To date, no reply has been received as to Departmental approval or otherwise and as the parents do not care to know whether their children will be admitted or not, it will be appreciated if early attention can be given to the matter.\n\nI shall also have to also meet the question of a child who (I believe) was at this school last year. This child, last year's child, is now five years old and is about to start school next fall. Whether she will attend this school or not depends entirely upon the wishes of her parents. She is now five years old and has never been away from home except for a short time when she was very young and has not been there ever since.\n\nAnother was recently taken into the band with the approval of the Dr. who said she is known as a member of the tribe but her parents have left, of course, no letter of address.\n\nConcerning the case of this child, I am willing to take her elsewhere at any other school if necessary. The child is now attending school here but the parents want her to go back to her own band. If she is allowed to go back she will be going for her. I have not been able to find out what she was doing while I was little more than at the present time. A woman named Jacob King has made some inquiries to Rev. Strapp to have the girl admitted and therefore considered that I should bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nSecretary,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Strapp, Principal of the school has reported as afflicted with venereal disease, I have to report that he has discussed this case with me several times. This pupil is about seven years old, is the daughter of Mr. Hill, of the First Nation, and her father is believed to be white.\n\nShe has been a ward of the Bishop's Missionary Order at St. Thomas, Ontario, for some time, and is known to have congenital Syphilis. Her mother has been under treatment at this office for the same disease, and Patricia has received some treatments from Dr. Fry, of St. Thomas, who examined her on admission to the school.\n\nThe suggestion that Patricia be isolated in the school for a short time, or kept in an Indian home while she is undergoing treatment is not practical, as expert opinion, with which I agree, is that at her age, she could be treated for years intravenously, and still yield a positive blood test.\n\nPrincipal Strapp is quite definite in his stand that he does not wish any girl to be in his school with venereal disease, congenital or otherwise. He says that the attitude of his pupils, as they are composed of other pupils, all of which have been treated, makes that this case may be handled rather than by nature. He stated that I thought this girl would be very improved after treatment. Said I would, and that I felt there would be no harm in allowing her to attend the school, provided she was treated in the manner described.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMedical Superintendent\n\nParadise Agency\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They claimed that they could not pay the transportation but later agreed to pay expenses out of interest money due them this fall.\n\nWhen making arrangements regarding the sending of these children to the Mt. Elgin School I found out that Leslie McCue and Nora Monague both have a serious skin disease and at the present time it would not be wise to send them as they would not be admitted to the School. It will be impossible to send them until this disease has been cured, they are both being given treatment for the disease at the present time and will, in all probability, be free of it in about two weeks. As soon as the disease clears up, I shall arrange to send them to the school and the parents will pay all expenses.

However, in a letter dated the 5th instant that has just reached the Department the Rev.

They hesitatingly agreed to do this as soon as they received their allotment money or whatever last but one payment was made.\n\nIn November, one of the parents objected to paying a reasonable fare and said that she would make other arrangements to get her children there but this was, as usual, only an excuse and nothing was done on her part.\n\nThere has been one delay after another in connection with sending these children to residential school. The parents have not been interested in the matter now. The children are attending day school on the reserve and are being fairly well looked after by the Agency.

Under present conditions, and on account of the many demands which we receive from deserving pupils for accommodation in residential schools, we feel that it would be a mistake to keep the pupils you mention for a further year in the Mount Elgin Residential School.

Miss Moodie intends to write to you in regard to this matter and in the event of your deciding that a few of them would profit by the additional domestic science training we will be prepared to favourably consider their re-admission to the school for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Mrs. Brown states that the boy is too ill to attend the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School and wishes him to be discharged. She gives his age as 13 years.

Strapp, Principal of the School, stated to me that this boy should be requested to remain at the School unless proof is furnished that his health would suffer if such action were taken. As far as can be ascertained this boy did not require any medical attention during his previous term at the School and he appeared to be in good health.\n\nIt appears as if the mother of this boy is unwilling for him to go back to the school for some reason, probably due to the fact that he can work now and would be earning money which he would no doubt turn over to his mother. The R.C.M. Police had to visit the Brown home last year to get the boy to return to Mount Elgin and at that time the mother caused considerable disturbance.\n\nI would suggest that this boy be re-examined by our Medical Superintendent and if Dr. Jamieson finds him in good health he should be forced to return to the School. This cannot be done until the boy returns to the Reserve as he is now working in some white municipality with his parents. When Wilbert was admitted to the School on September 17th, 1938, he was ten years of age and in my opinion he should return to the School, health permitting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W.

Let me know she has to go first in Murray and get her eyes tested too. From\nMrs. A. Cook\nC.W. Murray\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6209, file 468-10, part 3)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 7-0-10, dated September 13th, regarding Marion Kahgee, Elijah, John and Alvina Wahbegona being returned to the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nI beg to say, Marion Kahgee was returned to Muncey on September 10th, and should remain there as the mother is living with another Indian. Regarding the Wahbegona family, this family spent the summer at Negaunee Beach, which is north of Collingwood, last winter they were at Kintail, which is near Port Albert, during the past three years they have spent possibly six months on the reserve, where a family is moving around like that it is hard to know whether the children are attending or not to any school but when on the reserve we had trouble with their attendance.\n\nFor your information enclosed please find a letter received from Mrs. Cook, (Wahbegona) mother of these children, I did not return from leave until August 25th, and when I got in touch with Mrs. Cook she wished to have this application cancelled, so you can see how changeable they are. I would recommend these children be returned to Muncey.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDon Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to certain children for whom the Department received applications for discharge from the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nWe agree with you that it is in the best interests of all these children to return to the school and you may make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D. Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1941.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of the 11th instant with reference to certain children whose parents requested you to write to the Department in order to obtain their discharge from the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nThe following report has just been received from the Indian Agent:\n\n\"Marion Kahgee was returned to Muncey on September 10th and should remain there as the mother is living with another Indian. Regarding the Wahbegona family, this family spent the summer at Wasaga Beach, which is north of Collingwood. Last winter they were at Kintail, which is near Port Albers. During the past three years they have spent possibly six months on the reserve. When a family is moving around like that it is hard to know whether the children are attending or not to any school but when on the reserve we had trouble with their attendance.\"\n\nI may add that recently the Agent received a letter from Mrs. Wahbegona requesting that her children be returned to the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nTaking everything into consideration the Department believes that it is in the best interests of these children to return to the Mount Elgin Residential School and instructions are being issued accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMessrs.

On the 27th of September the Indian Agent of the Cape Croker Indian Reserve communicated with the writer when he advised that he had just received word from the Indian Affairs Board that the boy that Lee Martin was to be placed at the Mohawk Ind. Indian Residential School at Brantford, Ontario. Mr. Taffnell, the Indian Agent at Cape Croker requested that this matter be attended to by this Detachment.\n\nInvestigation revealed that since the above named was convicted at Marton, Ont. on the 25-8-41 he had left the Cape Croker Reserve and had gone to Honey Harbour, Ontario. When it was learned that there was any reasonable doubt that Lee Martin would be found at the home of one Eli Lambeau at Honey Harbour, in the p.m. of the 3rd. inst. a patrol was made from this detachment to Honey Harbour, Ont. where Martin was located and taken into custody. On that date he was escorted back to our own Owen Sound where he was lodged in the house of the Children's Aid Society for the night.\n\nBetween Sept. 27th. and Oct. 2nd. the Indian Agent of the Saguenay Reserve communicated with this detachment advising that there were three youngsters from that Reserve who were truants from the Mt. Elgin Residential School at Nunsay, Ont. In view of this, it was decided to save considerable mileage by taking all four back in the same manner as Lee Martin. After the departure the officers left this detachment, proceeded to the Saguenay Reserve where the three truants were taken into custody. From there the patrol was continued to Nunsay and from that point to Brantford, Ont. when the above named was handed over to the proper authorities at the Mohawk School at approximately 11p.m. on the 4-10-41.\n\nCASE CONCLUDED.\n\nEXCEPTED TO BE INCLUDED ON FORMS 95 FOR THE PERIOD.\n\nTHE COMMISSIONER:\n\nFORMA REDD, CASE CONCLUDED.\n\nTORONTO\n\n(V.A.M.Kemp) Supt.,\n\nOwen Sound Detachment.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 4200, file 40-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO 41 D C2-C-L-11\n\nYOUR FILE NO\n\nOTTAWA, October 14, 1916\n\nReferred by direction of The Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nTO:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nGAV/DK\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will advise you later regarding this point. In the meantime I would like you to state if you recommend that all girls graduating from this course should be given a loom or just those who have done especially well. Our experience has been that even though looms are supplied the recipient has to purchase necessary yarn and that when supervision is removed their work is inclined to deteriorate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This authorizes the expenditure of $80 for the purchase of lumber, and my understanding is that you are willing to arrange to have the boys in the manual training shop make the looms without cost to the Department. If you will let me have the necessary information as to the size and measurement of steel combs required, we will order them from the Montreal Steel Heddle Company and have them sent to you at Muncey. Miss Moodie has mentioned that the cost of these combs, when buying six of them, should not exceed $4.00 or $5.00 each. In submitting your account please state on the voucher that payment is to be made from \"Schools Vote\" and refer to this letter as authority for expenditure for the lumber.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience regarding the specifications which should be included in our order for the combs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n7-0-11\n\nOttawa, March 19, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI have your letter of March 13 with account for lumber to make looms for the members of the Weaving Class. We did understand that the cost of the lumber would be approximately $5.00 for each loom, but in view of the fact that you have been able to secure the lumber at a total cost of approximately $10.00, we will be glad to have you make eight looms instead of the six originally mentioned. We have ordered eight combs and I hope delivery can be made before the end of March. We have asked one of the officers of the Department who is at present in Montreal to see about this immediately and to take delivery in Montreal if the combs are finished only at the end of the month. They will then be forwarded to you, but payment can be made out of this year's funds. I presume you will submit a further small account for lumber to cover the two additional looms.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. O. B.

It appears that the type you request are electric machines and, while I would like to supply them, I regret that present regulations prevent our doing so. The argument used is that electric machines do not provide the training for the children that they require in view of the fact that few, if any, of them will have electric machines when they return to their homes. I can very easily secure either the regular type machine or, if you wish it, the so-called tailor machine which, as you know, is a heavier stronger machine than the ordinary one. I should appreciate your considering the matter again and advising me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. O.B.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 10th, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Mount Elgin Residential School\n\nSome time ago Mr. Strapp of Brandon wrote, asking what was to be done with certain equipment at Mount Elgin, which is the property of the Department. In my letter to him I pointed that out, and as a result Mr. Strapp has written to Mr. Phelan, who has replied to say that there is no objection on the part of the French to the transfer of the Manual Training equipment from the Mount Elgin School to Brandon; and Mr. Strapp has written to Mr. Soper, suggesting that he come down and crate the material.\n\nI have not much time today to go into the matter in any detail, but I feel that I must write immediately to ask whether consideration has been given to the fact that some of the equipment - how much I cannot tell - should be left at Mount Elgin, so that it could be used in the development of the courses which it is proposed to have initiated in connection with the new school. I have no list of what is at Mount Elgin, and it may be that none of the materials there will be useful in the new set-up; but it does seem to me as if, in view of the fact that the school is not to be closed until June 30th, there has been a little haste in assuring Mr. Strapp that he can get all this material.\n\nI have not a copy of the letter which Mr. Strapp has written to your Department, and consequently I do not know what he proposed to take away. We have, of course, no objection to the Brandon School getting some of the equipment, but we must, at the same time, protect the interests of the new set-up at Mount Elgin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-11, part 1)\nOttawa, May 14, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 2nd instant and my reply of the 6th instant, with reference to transferring some of the manual training equipment from the Mount Elgin Residential School to the Brandon Residential School.\n\nIt is our intention to erect a new day school on the Caradoc Reserve and vocational training will be taught. Consequently, there will be necessity for some of the equipment in the new school, and in that event there would not be any advantage in transferring it to Brandon, because we would have to purchase new equipment for the Caradoc School.\n\nI intend to visit Mount Elgin next week, at which time I will look over the equipment, and I will write to you on my return.

Soper\nThe Indian Residential School\n\nPhone 2938\n\nBrandon, Manitoba\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nSt. Vital,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have just received your letter of the 15th instant, and I am glad to hear that the school has been closed at your request. I have been in touch with Mr. Strapp regarding the transfer of the school furniture equipment at the school to this school. He informed me that he thought there would be no objection to the transfer of such equipment that was not the property of the United Church.\n\nA high speed drill press was purchased directly by Indian Affairs, and the metal working tools were transferred from the Christie Street Hospital, Toronto. The high speed saw and jointer combination unit was purchased through sale of beaten metal work done by the boys. The wood working benches and tools were supplied by Indian Affairs.\n\nI believe that it was a good idea to transfer these items. If they had not transferred we would not have had the freedom of time.\n\nLast year a proposal was made that Indians in the west be willing to pay a portion toward the salary of a manual arts teacher for this school, but the idea unfortunately has not taken root, and nothing happened. I am wondering whether something can be done for the opening of school in September of this year.\n\nIn correspondence with Mr. Candy who was the senior teacher here a couple of years ago and left to enlist in the forces. He is interested in Manual Arts and Physical Training, and on his release...\nfrom the forces would like to return to our staff.\n\nI shall be glad to have your decision on this proposal at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-11, part 1)\nOttawa, May 6, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to transferring manual training equipment to the Brandon Residential School from the Mount Elgin Residential School, when the latter closes. I cannot see why this equipment should not be transferred to your school and you could make the necessary arrangements with the Principal of the Mount Elgin School.\n\nProvided the services of the teacher engaged meet with the approval of this Branch, we are prepared to pay one-half the yearly salary of a manual training teacher, the maximum amount of our payment being $750.00. I attach a form which you should have completed and returned to me when you engage a manual training teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend O. B.

This may not be so, however, unless we have not quite satisfied these points.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

To keep these grounds under proper care I would suggest the purchase of a Garden Tractor with cutting-bar attached. As this implement could serve other various purposes it is a question as to what division would purchase it should it be approved. I am suggesting the matter to Mr. Pratt, under separate cover, and perhaps some action may be taken.\n\nThere are also a few items to be completed in connection with the school itself. These are things which could not be done owing to the winter weather and as soon as our labour is available we should like to request permission to have these things done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nFH/JA\n30th March, 1949.\n\nMr. F.

At that time he will review the situation carefully with yourself and Mr. Joblin, and examine the equipment already in the school. He will then decide what additional equipment should be supplied.\n\nUnder these circumstances it has been decided not to purchase additional equipment until we receive Mr. Doucet's recommendation.\n\nBernard P.

Phelan\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Kitchen Unit for Mt. Elgin Indian Day School\nDepartmental File 468-11 (E 1)\n\nAs requested in your letter of November 4th we enclose, herewith, a sketch showing the proposed unit.\n\nBefore a definite decision is made on this matter, however, I should like to bring to your attention a few facts and suggestions bearing on the case.\n\nIt has been pointed out that if the basement rooms of the Mt. Elgin Day School are used for Manual Training and Home Economics classes, then the school will be without a suitable playroom or gymnasium. Furthermore, it will be a comparatively easy task to put the Manual Training material and equipment out of harm's way when not in use. It will be a somewhat more difficult task to protect a considerable amount of classroom furniture, etc., in a room which is of necessity used as a thoroughfare between the classroom and the toilet. It has been suggested that to solve the problem we might build a Home Economics cottage wherein all the Home Economics equipment may be housed and wherein all the classes could be held in a setting more closely resembling the homes of the pupils. It would thus provide protection for the equipment, a better classroom and would release the basement room for use as an auditorium, playroom and gymnasium.\n\nI have taken the trouble to have estimated the cost of material for a cottage 24' square, set on a concrete base, insulated, gyproc lined, covered with Johns-Manville Asbestos shingles and wired for electricity \u2014 approximately $1150.00.\n\nTo construct such a cottage would ordinarily double the cost but by allowing the senior boys to do a large portion of the work under proper supervision, we could provide them with valuable experience, and we estimate that it would reduce the cost of construction to $500.00 which would place the total cost of the completed cottage at between $1600.00 and $1700.00.\n\nIt may be that the Department might consider the suggestion of such a cottage. If so, they wish to hold up the construction of the kitchen unit until we have it built in such a way that it could be fitted into the cottage.\n\nAll of which we respectfully submit for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the whole, the inferences drawn from outside sources looks fairly serious on paper, but generally speaking the medical department and health of the pupils is in good shape.\n\nRegarding the skin condition introduced into the picture I may say that on taking over this appointment Dr. Fardy informed me that there was an obstinate condition at this Agency which he could not name or cure. It is a cross between secondarily infected Impetigo and a Pemphigus, and is sporadic in its appearance. Several times it has been identified only to disappear after the children return from visits to their respective homes. It is present both on the reserves and at the school, and seems to run in families, Wassermann tests proving negative. At no time was there any great number of children affected, but it is a nasty looking disorder and leaves scars. Ammoniated Mercury Ointment proved useless in treating it and I obtained the best results from Bichloride Washes and internal use of Cod Liver Oil, and the latter suggests a lack of vitamin A partial etiology. At present it is cleaned up, and there is not a case at Mount Elgin Institute. I talked to Dr. Wall about it, and may have mentioned it to you previously. At any rate I was always aware of the situation and we have done our best to cope with the situation, now well in hand. While its degree of infectivity is low, we had separate towels for all patients, and I have been successful in obtaining separate towels for all pupils at Mount Elgin. This skin infection was usually absent on the face but seemed to have an affinity for hands and buttocks, and we had the toilets washed with a solution of Lysol after affected ones utilized them. I am pleased to report that everyone at the Institute co-operated to the fullest in cleaning up this disease which did not involve more than a dozen pupils over a period of 2 years and three of them were from one family.\n\n...........\nWith reference to food provided pupils at Mount Elgin Institute I have inspected the tables ready for serving several times and concluded that a well balanced ration was provided. I believe that you remarked upon the same thing during your visit to Muncy. Further I have on file a letter from Rev. S.R. McVitty Principal, dated May 15th 1932, in which he says in part; \"An abundance of excellent food such as whole milk (50% Jersey), butter, eggs, meat, bread, and a superabundance of fresh vegetables are served daily, and I am pleased to say that the wonderfully healthy appearance of our pupils calls forth the admiration of our many visitors. The usual comment is that white children have no such accommodation. This we know to be true.\" As for the egg ration I have taken the Reverend Gentleman's word for it, but agree that despite the absence of such food the children are in fine physical condition and have been prior to my appointment. I feel that any grievance regarding food is trivial and can be easily remedied.\n\nRegarding bath accommodation for pupils this is in need of improvement, but until financial conditions warranted same, like many other of our needs the end justifies the means. Toilet accommodation is in a similar category, and Mr. McVitty informed me that indoor flush toilets for pupils was an endless source of trouble due to foreign material being thrown in them by ignorant pupils. The outside toilets are kept in a clean sanitary condition and I have inspected them several times.\n\nAside from the incident reported to you on December 12th, 1932, wherein the Principal refused to supply orange juice to a Pneumonia patient at Mount Elgin Institute after I had requested same there has been no friction.\n\nI believe that a few recommendations are in order for the Institute worthy of consideration. They are as follows;\n\n1. That all pupils submit to a blood Wassermann test for Syphilis. All new pupils from this Agency examined by me are so tested, but those in the school should have this done as a protection to themselves and others.\n\n2. The system of ventilation in the sleeping dormitories be improved. At present this is notoriously poor particularly if there are many pupils ill. Mr. O.B. Strapp, assistant principal and myself have repeatedly discussed the situation and if limited funds were available an electric motor and large fan for each dormitory would make conditions satisfactory.\n\n3. Installation of modern bath equipment when and as finances will permit.\nProvision of modern flush toilets (to augment one in each dormitory now used at night), either indoors or out for the pupils with a campaign of education and supervision as to management by pupils.\n\n5. A tooth brush for every pupil. Older pupils use them but in my opinion all should for the moral effect if no other goal is attained.\n\nInsofar as the Medical end of the Department is concerned I believe that this covers the situation, and I'd being forwarded to you in the belief that this report will supplement that from the Indian Agent, the latter (from a layman's point of view), not covering the medical end of the problem as fully as might be desired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. Roy McLeod, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nDr. E.L. Stone,\nDirector of Medical Services,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJanuary 25th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McLeod,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant and it is regarded as a valuable contribution to the subjects discussed therein. I think only one or two parts require comments on my part.\n\nI agree with you that all pupils entering school should have an examination for syphilis regardless of where they come from. This is a matter which you are competent to arrange but I am pleased to support your opinion. You appear to have the skin condition in hand and there is nothing I can add to your discussion of this particular matter.\n\nI suppose there is no institution in the world with which fault cannot be found, and those in which young children are maintained are particularly open to attack. Knowing the very substantial improvement in our Residential schools in the last five or six years and the earnest endeavour the Department is making to keep up the standard under difficult financial conditions, I really regret to see them publically criticized. My impression from this particular controversy is that the author of it has some private spite against the church and the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Services of a dentist for six days at Mount Elgin Residential School, and four days for pupils of the day school. If any further service is needed by current pupils, Dr. Ackland of Delaware engaged last year did excellent work, and this service was greatly appreciated by the Indians.\n\n2. Permission for extraction of tonsils or other surgery on day school pupils as listed in Report attached hereto. If desired this work can be done during hospital periods during the next few weeks.\n\n3. A visit by Dr. Wall as time permits to check up on treatment and diagnosis of Trachoma cases at this Agency. His visits are a great help to your local superintendent in his Trachoma work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Medical Services,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Of the new cases I have to report that some of them are new pupils who have brought the disease in with them from their respective reserves. I note that most of our defective children are senior pupils on the school roll, just why, I am not prepared to state.\n\nRev. O.B. Strapp is quite anxious that the impaired vision found among his pupils, (and which he has mentioned several times before inspection), be attended to, and I suspect that several of the girls at least have feigned impairment in the test, under the impression that glasses will improve their appearance, which is not original on their part.\n\nIn connection with my report I would recommend:\n\n1. Services of a dentist for six days at Mount Elgin Residential School and for four days for the pupils of Day Schools or any portion thereof as funds permit. Dr. Askland of Mount Brydges has done excellent work in past years and is available this year.\n\n2. Permission for extraction of tonile of eight day school and fifteen residential school pupils. This can be carried out periodically during slack hospital months if preferred.\n\n3. Refraction and glasses if necessary for six day school pupils and fifteen residential school pupils at an estimate by Dr. Dobb if done in numbers at $6 per pupil including glasses.\n\n4. A visit by Dr. J.J.Wall to check my diagnosis and treatment of Trachoma.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. E.L. Stone,\nDirector of Medical Services.\n\nT.Ray McLeod, M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent,\nCreeago Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 621C, file 46H-13, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\nUOSSY, ONTARIO.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Foster,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of the location of a large tribal encampment consisting of two longhouses located near the mouth of the river. The encampment appears to be quite substantial, with several families living there. I have also included a list of the names of those who are residing in the camp.\n\nI hope this information will be useful to you in your work. If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 621C, file 468-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 22nd, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of March 19th, 21st recommendations regarding attention required by school pupils. You may arrange for a four-day dental clinic at the Mount Elgin Residential School at the earliest possible date. Accounts will be received up to April 10th, but must be dated March in order to be paid from funds available for the present fiscal year. The rate should be \u00a350 per day, and I presume you will be able to assign Miss Murdoch for duty at the school if this is desired.\n\nYou may also arrange immediately for any absolutely necessary tonsil operations for pupils of the Residential School. This also should be attended to during the month of March, if possible.\n\nI note that Doctor Babb gives an estimate of \u00a36 per pupil for examination and classes, and you may arrange to have the fifteen Residential School pupils examined and fitted with glasses if necessary.\n\nI realise that there is not a great deal of time left during the present fiscal year, but it will be appreciated if you will arrange to have as much work as possible done at this time for the Residential School pupils. It is necessary to leave work for the day school pupils until a later date.\n\nDoctor Will may possibly be at Winnipeg when you receive this. If not he will arrive there very soon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. Roy MacLeod, Esq., M.D.,\nWinnipeg,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The symptoms have been very mild being mainly cervical and occipital adenitis, sore throat, conjunctivitis, a slight fever, in no case exceeding 100 degrees, accompanied by rash of varying intensity. The first cases were put down to overeating of fruit on the part of the pupils, and it was only when the numbers increased that my attention was called to the afflicted, some of whom had not taken to bed or reported their illness to the staff.\n\nThe average duration of indisposition on the part of the children has been two days, and recovery has been exceptionally rapid. I detected one case on the Chippewa Reserve today, and the young daughter of the Mounted Police Constable here has just recovered from a similar attack. With the co-operation of the Institute staff I have instituted such quarantine measures as are feasible under the sudden onset of the outbreak. I feel that this epidemic will likely sweep through the school and reserves, but it is of such mild character that there is no cause for alarm.\n\nI am informed that this disease has been prevalent, and undiagnosed in the vicinity of Shuben, eight miles from here. Several of those pupils who suffered severe attacks of typical measles last summer at the Residential School, including two who had the hemorrhagic type have been down and subsequently recovered from this latest illness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.Hey McLeod, M.D.\nDr. E L.Stone\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Medical Superintendent,\nOttawa, Ontario.

This situation has been very nicely handled with no complications, and but one case reported on the reserves. To our chagrin, however, the pupils are being visited by a form of influenza (at least that is my diagnosis), and in most cases these children have escaped the measles. The onset of this illness is very abrupt with temperatures elevated as high as 105.2 and most of them in excess of 104 degrees. The initial symptom is headache, and pain in the chest. The latter is only caused being exceptionally severe, and in most cases in the right chest. In fact my first case showed pain in the right shoulder region with marked tenderness which presented a surgical problem, and several similar cases since have lead us to believe that this is due to irritation of the diaphragm in that area.\n\nPhysical signs at onset show no abnormality of the chest excepting harsh breath sounds, but in about 2-4 hours moist rales are present with a Bronch-Pneumonia. This is the picture in every one of six cases, and the routine of the disease is very interesting, and I may say new to me. All cases have done well under treatment although they have been very ill patients, and required much nursing care. Three patients are in the midst of the attack now, and the others are on the mend which seems to require about one week to get under way. One case, the first, was very severely ill, and as a result of isolation, and also for better treatment facilities I removed her to hospital 112.\nambulance. She is now recovering, and was a great interest to\nthe medical staff, there being three different clinics held\nduring her acute stage. Incidentally, the patient seems to\nhave a crisis, and for this reason, Lobar Pneumonia was\nconsidered, but the course is too short and snappy in\naddition to being wicked while it lasts.\n\nI have been very interested and have seen every patient\ndaily, and feel that you would appreciate the details of this\nrarity, which to date has not hit the reserves. The Measles\nquarantine was enforced for this illness also, and may account\nfor a portion of our success in limiting the outbreak.\n\nReverting to the nursing problem, Miss Carlson, the\npermanent nurse at the institution, in addition to her normal\nduties as a girls' supervisor. These duties included checking\nthe pupils in the dormitory at night, and rousing them in the\nmorning. She has done excellent service in nursing the sick, and\nI was under the impression that she would be relieved of her\nsupervisory duties, particularly in view of the fact that she\nhas been up to see the patients several times each night. This\nrelief was not forthcoming, and is really not a problem for me.\nHowever, Mr. Strapp, principal of the school, approached me\nMonday, and after outlining his nurse's duties requested an\nassistant temporarily, pointing out that he was a hard of his\nnurses \"cracking up\". I readily agreed with him that a relief\nwould be in order, as with nursing duties solely, Miss Carlson\nhas been hard pressed.\n\nSince the night letter the German Measles has allowed\nthe eight days quarantine to elapse with no new cases so that\nthese all have been released. At present there are eight down\nwith the Influenza crisis, five of whom are at the peak of\nthe illness. Three others have discharging ears, which is an\naftermath of their infection. Miss Carlson, the nurse, insists\nthat she can carry on more easily, and Mr. Strapp has not broached\nthe subject of extra help since. Mr. Moore and I have discussed\nthe situation, and I have decided that until the principal brings\nthe subject to my attention, I will take no further steps re\nnursing, of which you will be advised later.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that Mr. Strapp resents the fact\nthat no hospital room has been provided for his pupils, and in\nevery case of illness of any degree intimates that the Department\nand myself must take the responsibility for undue results, and\npractically insists that the patient be removed to hospital. The\nlatter injunction is governed by my judgement, but I do feel that\nan infirmary for infectious and minor cases at Mount Elgin could\nand should be equipped regardless of plans for a hospital at Muncey.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMunczy, Ontario.\nNovember 20th, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor Stone;\n\nWith further reference to the situation at Mount Elgin Residential School, I am pleased to report that the German Measles has been fairly well cleared up. That is to say we have gone beyond the regulation eight day quarantine period with no new cases. In all there were about 60 victims, with no complications, and two of the adult staff were involved.\n\nThe Influenza affair which disrupted our routine at Mount Elgin has also improved. One week ago I had three pupils in bed, and in all there were ten cases of Pneumonia. These are all recovering with the exception of one girl aged 16, whom I removed to Victoria Hospital at London on November 16th. This was done because of her grave condition in the school dormitory, and the fact that the heating system balked and for three days the school was real cold. It is a good thing that I removed her, which was done by ambulance, as her latest development is a tendency to pleural fluid which may call for surgery. One of the others in hospital underwent a rib resection for pus, and the third has recovered and returned to the school.\n\nIn each case of serious illness, in cooperation with Rev. O.B. Strapp, the parents were notified. We take not avail ourselves of an assistant nurse as the situation improved, and I feel that a portion of the hospitalization involved will be economically balanced thereby.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.Roy McLeod, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nDr. E.L.

It would appear that this man had visited the school and attended at the noon meal and found that his child had no butter on her bread and no meat in the meal and that her dinner consisted of milk, bread (dry), 4 small potatoes, diced carrots and butter scotch pudding and in his opinion this was not enough and not to the standard that he fed her at home, when she received meat and butter at least twice a day.\n\nOn hearing his complaint, I asked Dr. McLeod to accompany me to the school and did learn that the claim of the man was right as to the meal he attended, but that the girl had not made any complaint to the principal or any of the staff that she had not received enough to eat.\n\nIn the presence of the Doctor, the principal and the matron and the dietician, this girl made the statement that she had only received meat at one meal in three weeks which was denied by the dietician, who maintained they served meat twice a week, which she did consider sufficient and that according to calories, the pupils were getting a well balanced diet and I can vouch that none of the pupils look underfed.\n\nThe father could not be convinced that his child was receiving good enough meals and rather than have further trouble with this parent who was adamant in his demands and at the request...\nof the Principal I did instruct this girl to be discharged at once, contending that if the father was able to provide at home this was satisfactory and that the vacancy created would allow for another pupil to be placed in the school, as there are many applicants.\n\nThere has been a large number of truants from this school of late and in procuring the return of these pupils to the school and on enquiring as to why they ran away, Constable Bella of the R.C.M.P. has stated to me that some of these truants on being apprehended complain to him that they are not receiving enough to eat and being made to eat foods that they were not accustomed to and did not like and could not eat.\n\nThis complaint of the children can be understood to some extent, as no doubt the foods they receive at Mount Elgin are not of the same nature they had received at their homes, where they go in for a considerable amount of salt pork, and other heavy foods, which they, under the present system at Mount Elgin, do not receive.\n\nDr. McLeod is making a survey of the school as to the health conditions in general at the school and pending his report to you, I will speak to the Principal of the school to give attention to the feeding of his pupils, as I am informed that the children working in the kitchen are always well fed and it may be possible that these children take foods that should be given to the smaller pupils in the dining-room and that these small pupils go short and this would be the result of bad supervision by the officer of the school in charge and should be stopped by her. It is possible these children in the kitchen are playing favourite to their friends in the dining-room of other non-friends.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. D.

As soon as Dr. McLeod has finished his survey of health conditions at the Mount Elgin Residential School, you should report fully and state what action you consider necessary to ensure that the children attending the school receive proper food.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) J.

MOORE,\nINDIAN AGENT, MUNCEY, ONT., DATED OCTOBER 21, 1936.\n\nWith reference to the report requested on health conditions at this school, I would advise that Dr. McLeod, Med. Supt. of this Agency, did submit a full report to the Deputy Superintendent General on the 17th instant and no doubt this report gave full details as to conditions at Mount Elgin with regards health and food, and as I have been informed of this report by the Med. Supt. I would concur with this report and would recommend that additional meat and butter be given to the pupils at this school, who in my mind should at least receive the same allowances of meat that is given in the relief rations, namely 5 pounds of meat per month to all children over 10 years of age and half that amount for children under 10 years, which according to the principal's own statement to the Doctor and myself, they only receive 500 pounds a month for 150 pupils, which is supplemented by the pupils receiving an egg on odd occasions.\nJanuary 6th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of December 20th you state that though the undernourished children at the Mount Elgin Institute were not provided with a separate dining room they did receive for a time extra food and that on this additional diet their weight came up to practically normal. I presume that you are not concerned how the good result is arrived at if it is accomplished and that your only reason for complaint is that the extra diets were not continued, in some cases at least.\n\nThe proposal to set up a separate dining room was made by the Principal of the school on a visit to the Department, and the Department's recommendation was based on his proposal. The method by which the children's weight is maintained is perhaps not important but it is important that it should be maintained, and you are entitled to make adequate representations to the Principal to this effect. It is a duty I would say. The terms of your letter rather suggest that you would prefer to deal with the matter yourself for the moment but the Department is prepared to write to the Principal if you think it advisable. It does not wish to involve you in any possible difficulty and would be pleased to receive any suggestions you might have for a letter to the Principal of the school if you think one is in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAmosy, Ontario,\nJanuary 12th, 1837.\n\nWith further reference to pupils of the above school who were underweight, and your letter of the 5th instant, I have to report that I am quite pleased with the results obtained. My motive in writing December 28th, was not of complaint, but more to acquaint Dr. McGill with the fact that proposals made by the Principal to the Department, and passed along to me by Dr. McGill were not being carried out. I felt that the Department reasonably expected a separate dining room for underweight pupils had been inaugurated as promised, and should be made aware through me that nothing along this line had been done.\n\nI do not believe that it would be advisable to write the Principal in view of the improvement made by these children. If under the present system normal weight is not maintained, to be revealed by periodic check-up on my part, a letter could be drafted at a later date.\n\nThere have been no major difficulties experienced with the Principal and staff of Mount Elgin Residential School by me. Nor once include the determination manifested of attempts to safeguard the pupils' health in methods other than those of your Medical Superintendent, the usual objection to the latter and those laid down by the Department being that they prove to be too great an inconvenience. This difficulty mainly involves the treatment of Trachoma, and the opportunity presented by the separate dining room proposal enabled me to bring the situation to the attention of Ottawa.\nWith the gratifying results obtained with weight production, I would prefer to let the same rest for the present. This is in view of the fact that the Principal has been ill, and in hospital, although now completely recovered.\n\nIf the occasion should warrant same due to weight loss, proper representation can be made to him both from the Department and myself at the time. Careful observation of the weight of pupils will be made, and it is my opinion that there will not be any great difficulty encountered in view of the excellent recovery of the children involved.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. Ray McLeod,\nMedical Superintendent,\nCaraogo Agency.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have visited the school and have been able to make the following recommendations:\n\n1. That the children be sent back for a period of four weeks in order to improve their condition.\n\n2. That the services of a physician be engaged for four weeks at an estimated cost of $50.\n\n3. That a special doctor be engaged for removal of the tonsils of the children, since no such doctor has yet been obtained by the hospital at an estimated cost of $50.\n\nI am mindful of the fact that the financial situation of the Medical Department has not improved, but we cannot ignore the recommendations as directed. In the absence of authority for this work I would request permission to proceed with tonsillectomy in about four cases which show marked hypertrophy and disease. This work could be carried out when and as hospital facilities are available.

Stone.\n\nAt the request of the Principal of Mount Elgin Residential School, I have examined Truman Antone, aged 16, and Kathleen Simon, aged 18, pupils who will be writing the entrance examinations for high school on June 25th. Both pupils suffer from defective vision which may handicap them in their tests.\n\nIt is the intention of the Principal that both these pupils be discharged from the school this year, and it is recommended that authority be granted for refraction and eye glasses at a cost not exceeding ten dollars per pupil.\n\nIf these pupils leave the school without glasses it is unlikely that they will obtain sufficient funds to purchase them for some time, and their tests show that the glasses will be of great advantage to them in concluding their school work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

However, his services here will be appreciated on the reserve, and he can review the work at the school to advantage should he arrange to come as promised. Many of the institution children can be reached at their homes here.\n\nWe arrived home Sunday to find that Miss Shore had very creditably handled things during my absence, having recourse to outside medical service on two occasions only.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMedical Superintendent,\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nDr. E.L.

There are 151 fillings and 134 extractions indicated in the Agency Day Schools while at the Residential school there are 129 fillings and 113 extractions.\n\nI would recommend that the services of a dentist be engaged for this work, and estimate that he would be required for a total of 14 working days equally divided between the day and residential schools. Any portion of this period, as funds permit, could be utilized to great benefit, as it is three years since a dental clinic was held at this agency.\n\nAs previously reported the chest clinic conducted for 155 residential school pupils, and 127 day school pupils, revealed but one case of active Tuberculosis. The latter, a day school pupil is being admitted to sanatorium, and the boy from Cape Croker Reserve admitted without chest X-ray and later found to be infectious has been returned to his home, from Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Roy McLeod,\nMedical Superintendent\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nDr. S.L. Stone,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMarch 31st, 1938\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe require a supply of form #403 for the quarterly returns, also large manila envelopes for the same.\n\nUnfortunately we seem to be in for a real epidemic of measles with about twenty in bed up until last evening. I would appreciate authority to engage a special nurse for a few weeks if any more cases develop. It will be impossible for our school nurse to properly care for such a large number and at the same time give attention to her regular school duties. I believe that a grant not to exceed $60.00 per month would take care of the matter.\n\nI trust that it will be possible for you to arrange for this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doctor Moore intended to discuss this with you, but, unfortunately, you were away when he was at Munsey. The Department is endeavouring to arrange that a doctor be appointed full time to replace Doctor McLeod during his absence for military duty. In the interval we must ask the cooperation of all concerned, and in this regard must insist that you make your requests to have a doctor visit the school through regular Departmental channels, that is, through Miss Shore, Departmental Nurse, or Indian Agent Moore. It is regretted that if this procedure is not followed, the Department can not be responsible for payment for services rendered by a physician visiting your school. This is no reflection on either yourself or members of your staff, but it is a strict Departmental ruling that only recognized officers of the Department may commit it to expense.\n\nIn case of a real emergency, if difficulty were experienced in getting in touch with Departmental officers there, the Department would make an exception if the circumstances were fully explained.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Indian Agent Moore.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

There are two proven cases at the school at the present time as well as approximately twenty suspects. One of the proven cases is the nurse manager, and the principal of the school advised me that help to take care of these patients was urgently needed. We are endeavouring to secure the services of a trained nurse to assume immediate duty. The pupils who have contracted the fever have been isolated in one dormitory at the school and all possible precautions to prevent spread of the disease have been taken.\n\nIn the opinion of the Medical Superintendent Dr. T. J. Jamieson all members of the Staff as well as the pupils are contacts and should be inoculated at the earliest possible date. There are only twelve vials of antitoxin on hand at the Medical Superintendent's office to do this inoculating and I am enclosing a requisition for 100 additional vials which should be forwarded to this office immediately. Dr. Jamieson has tried to obtain a supply of this antitoxin at the Public Health Institute at London but was refused on the grounds that we should arrange to secure our supply direct from Connaught Laboratories, Toronto but before committing the Department to this expense I would wish to have same approved.\n\nDr. Jamieson also wishes to receive your definite instructions as to the correct procedure to follow in procuring insulin or specific treatment for venereal disease as he has experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient supply of these types of drugs.

This was authorized in your telegram sent from Ottawa to this office on October 12th, 1941. I would recommend payment of this voucher.\n\nI am glad to advise that Miss Hill became ill on October 24th and she was not able to continue her nursing at the school. We have secured the services of a graduate nurse from St. Thomas who is replacing Miss Hill but over fifty patients are in bed with this fever and additional help was necessary as the Doctor considered it was far too much work for one nurse. We therefore obtained an Indian woman from this Reserve to assist at the school and her services will not be as expensive as though we had engaged an extra nurse. At the present time there is, therefore, one nurse and an Indian woman on duty at the school whose services will have to be made a charge against the Department. I trust that this action will meet with approval and these services will be discontinued as soon as the scarlet fever shows signs of abating but at the present time new cases are continually being reported.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nM.

As advised in my letter to the Department of October 27th, we have engaged an Indian woman to act as assistant to the nurse. This Indian woman is now ill herself but will probably be able to continue her duties on Wednesday. In any event it is the Doctor's opinion that we may not be able to work with two Indian women and dispense with the services of a third person. The epidemic does not improve.

The Principal of the school should submit to you a requisition for whatever tooth brushes are needed and you can forward it to the Department.\n\nI agree that the children should be given dental instruction and it should be possible to arrange with the doctor, with the possible assistance of the school nurse, to give some such instruction to the children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

I believe that this is very valuable training for the children to receive and I feel certain that you will co-operate with the Medical Officer in putting it into effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

Mr. Strapp will expect you to follow this procedure. You should understand that it is unnecessary for you to examine the classroom work, as the Provincial Inspector visits this school and submits a report regarding the teaching services. As stated above, you should examine this school at least monthly and at a time that will not unduly interfere with the Principal's work. You should examine the buildings, barns, etc., and if there is any matter requiring Departmental attention you should so advise me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncie, Ont.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to request you to furnish on repayment and send by freight prepaid to destination the supplies mentioned in the attached list. The supplies are intended for the use of Indians of Mount Elgin Ind. Res. School in the Carleton Agency and should be addressed as follows:\n\nThe Principal,\nMt. Elgin Ind.Res.School,\nLinney, Ontario.\n\nPayment will be made by this Department on receipt of your account in quadruplicate.\n\nT. R. L. M.

Can such animals be sold at a public sale with other cattle? Can they be sold without advising prospective purchasers regarding their condition or is it necessary by law to give this information?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 14, 1935\n\nMr. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th Instant, addressed to the Deputy Minister, and transferred to this office for reply.\n\nIn connection with the enquiry in regard to cattle infected with Bang's disease, or infectious abortion, I would say that this Department has not passed regulations for the control of this disease. It has an optional policy, which is available to live stock owners who must agree to comply with certain procedures, and, in return, the Department conducts blood tests and assists the owner in eradicating the disease in the herd.\n\nIn so far as this policy is concerned, the owners are not permitted to dispose of infected cattle except for immediate slaughter, or to purchasers who know they are infected animals.\n\nThere are, however, not more than 737 herds throughout the Dominion under this policy at the present time.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information and for any comments you may care to send forward, copy of a letter received by this Branch from A.E. Berry, Director of the Sanitary Engineering Division of the Provincial Department of Public Health. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI should state that about four or five years ago the question of installing pasteurization plants at a number of our residential schools was very carefully considered. It appeared to us at that time, however, that the obstacles standing in the way of such installations were almost insurmountable. I have in mind, of course, installations that would be really effective. We did, however, do everything we possibly could at that time, and have done everything possible since, to encourage the establishment of T.B. tested herds at our schools. We felt that by doing this we were taking the most effective step that could be taken at that time.\n\nIn view of the difficulty we are now experiencing in securing certain supplies, there is not even a remote possibility that we could secure, during the war period, the supplies necessary to install pasteurization plants at our schools. It is just possible that in the immediate future we may be unable to secure essential supplies such as school desks, gasoline engines, etc. What I am anxious to learn from you, however, is the status of your herd at the present time. You might supply me with full and complete information in respect to your herd, whether it is an accredited herd and if the cows in the herd have been recently tested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. O.B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School,\nMunsey, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neey,\nSept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nAugust 24th, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Neey;\n\nIn reply to your letter with reference to the health status of the dairy herd at this school may I say that this herd is fully accredited and negative to the blood test for contagious abortion.\n\nWe hold \"Dominion of Canada, Department of Agriculture, Health of Animals Branch, Accredited Herd Certificate # 11524. This certificate was issued December 19th, 1936 and an annual inspection has been made by the Health of Animals Branch regularly since that date. The last test made was July 17th, 1942. All cattle, including young calves were passed as free from contagion.\n\nWith reference to the matter of the people of the surrounding areas being protected by pasteurization of the milk supply, Mr. Berry omitted to state that this applies only to milk sold for human consumption; it does not cover farmers and their families who keep their own cows and who constitute by far the largest group in the two counties adjoining this Agency.\n\nThe majority of the herds of cattle from which the farmers obtain their milk supplies are neither T.B. tested nor Blood tested. I certainly think that Mr. Berry would do better to spend his time persuading the farmers of Caradoc, Ekfrid and Southeld townships to clean up their dairy and beef herds and bring them to the standard of the herd at this school.\n\nI may say that in addition to the health status of the herd, the milk is cooled immediately by placing the cans in running water and is then placed in the large refrigerator before being used. This procedure prevents the development of bacteria in the milk.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-14, part 1)\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Berry:\n\nRe: Milk pasteurization\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 17th instant, in which you discuss the desirability of having pasteurization plants installed at our Indian residential schools.\n\nIn this connection I am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated August 21 sent forward by me to the Principal of the Mount Elgin Residential School at Muncey and the Principal's reply thereto dated August 25, 1943.\n\nI should state that, apart from the expression of opinion contained in Mr. Strapp's communication, there is not even a limited possibility of this Branch being able to secure the supplies necessary to undertake the installation of pasteurization plants at our residential schools at any time during the war period. I might add also that this matter was very thoroughly investigated when a request reached us about four years ago for the installation of a pasteurization plant at our residential school at Kamloops, B.C. The officials who made a very thorough investigation of the Kamloops School were of the opinion that with the employment of Indian labour, etc., effective pasteurization was almost impossible. It was at this time that we decided to do everything we possibly could to establish T.B. tested herds at all our institutions.\n\nIt has occurred to me that this is a matter that might be discussed with you personally by our Superintendent of Medical Services at the time of his next visit to Toronto.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.E. Berry,\nDirector, Sanitary Engineering Division,\nDepartment of Health,\nToronto, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nToronto, September 2, 1942.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Milk Pasteurization at Indian Schools\n\nI have your letter of the 29th concerning the pasteurization of milk at the Mount Elgin Residential School at Muncey.\n\nThe communications between yourself and the Principal of this school have also been reviewed. Exception must be taken to the statement by the Principal to the effect that this office would be better engaged in persuading the farmers in that territory to clean up their herds and bring them to the standard of the herd at that school. While that, no doubt, is a desirable standard, there can be little doubt that the Principal has the mistaken idea of so many people, that if they have a healthy herd there is no danger from the milk. That is so far from the true situation that one would not expect it to call for any support.\n\nI am also interested in your statement to the effect that you cannot obtain supplies for the installation of pasteurization plants during the war period. This is surprising in view of the fact that those dealers who are handling equipment for pasteurization plants inform us that they have no difficulty in making this material available to those who desire to purchase it. It would be unfortunate if any restriction of this nature were placed upon something which is so essential for public health. I must emphasize that while testing of the herds is a laudable procedure, it cannot be considered as by any means adequate. All the herds in the provincial institutions are likewise so examined but at the same time all the milk supplies from these herds are pasteurized. There is the additional situation which arises when your schools are in areas that are under compulsory pasteurization, such as the one at Muncey.\n\nI shall be glad, as you suggested, to discuss this matter at any time with your Superintendent of Medical Services when he is in this city.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nSanitary Engineering Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A police car was sent to the Chippewa Indian Residential School, and enquiries made to ascertain whether any chickens were missing from their flock; a count was taken, and it was determined that approximately 30 light Sussex chickens were missing.\n\nA patrol was accordingly made to the house of SIMEN, where he was questioned and readily admitted the theft, and further that one ROBERT GRIMSHAW (Indian) Juvenile and Lloyd HUGHES (Indian) Juvenile, had assisted him in the theft. SIMEN and GRIMSHAW were placed under arrest, and an attempt was made to locate HUGHES, without result.\n\nSIMEN informed the officer that the 30 chickens could be located in a potato patch under a tree of his house. They were subsequently found at the County Light Indian Residential School, where they were identified by a tattoo on the wings. Two of these chickens were dead, apparently having smothered to death in the cage that were used to carry them away from the school. The 30 chickens were handed over to Mr. G. S. STRAPP, Principal of the school.\n\nSIMEN and GRIMSHAW were escorted to London, SIMEN being remanded in custody until 7-12-43. GRIMSHAW was placed in the Juvenile Detention Home, 645 York St., London, Ontario, and will appear in Juvenile Court on 10-12-43. In the meantime every effort will be made to locate HUGHES.\n\nDuring the late P.M. of this date a further patrol was made of the Chippewa Indian Reserve, in an effort to locate HUGHES; however, he had not returned to his home, and nothing could be learned regarding his present whereabouts.\n\nOn this date SIMEN appeared in County Court at London, before Magistrate DUGGAN, and in answer to the charge entered a plea of GUILTY and was remanded in custody for sentence until 14-12-43.\n\nForm 2648 in the above case will be submitted to comply with the marginally noted Diary Date.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 6210, file 468-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 4th\n\nMr. G.W.

Sexton B.A., our Public School Inspector, with reference to establishing a high school entrance examination centre at our school. Experience has taught us that the abrupt change to strange surroundings under an examiner who is strange and, at times, apt to be somewhat unsympathetic is frequently responsible for the failure of an otherwise really good candidate. This is particularly noticeable in oral examinations such as reading.\n\nMr. Sexton is quite enthusiastic about the matter and has taken it up with the Ontario Department of Education with the result that he has recently received a communication, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nYou will note that the \"local agent\" of the Department is mentioned in the letter. I took the matter up with Mr. Moore and we both felt that it would be better to have the request come from the department at Ottawa rather than the local office. I believe that Mr. Moore will be writing to you in the near future.\n\nWith reference to the expenses mentioned; it would be understood of course that the expense connected with the presiding examiner etc. would be taken care of out of our regular school income and not be a burden upon your department.\n\nI feel that this is a move in the right direction, etc., not only will it benefit the local pupils, but it will give the educational work of The Department of Indian Affairs a much better standing in the local and county educational circles.\n\nI sincerely trust that you will give this request your careful consideration and heartiest support.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-22, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOntario Department of Education,\n\nToronto,\nFebruary 13th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 10th in which you ask if it would be possible to have a high school entrance examination centre at the Mount Elgin Institute. I consulted Major Cowles and he states that he will be glad to recommend to the Minister the approval of such a centre on request from the Department of Indian Affairs through its local agent. The understanding would be that the expenses of the examination centre would be met by the Department of Indian Affairs and that the examination papers would be marked by the Strathroy High School Entrance Board, the new centre being affiliated with Strathroy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.

In this connection he forwards copy of a communication from you to J. H. Sexton, B. A., Public School Inspector, Strathroy, Ont.\n\nThis Department would be pleased if your Department could arrange to have the examination centre conducted at the school, on the understanding that the expense connected with the presiding examiner, etc., would be provided by the school authorities. If your Department agrees to conduct the Entrance Examination for the pupils at the school, I would request that the necessary arrangements be made with the Principal, Rev. O. B.

It is the contention of Mr. Strapp that Indian pupils should be placed among the whites in a strange school and that they cannot do themselves justice and will often fail on this account. Mr. Strapp also contends that his school would bear any cost of the attending officer at these examinations and there would be no cost to the Department and under these circumstances I would recommend that a centre be established at Mount Elgin and being given a trial at least.\n\nSecretary,\ndept of Ind.

A history was obtained of having fallen from a second story window. Child was unconscious at the time, on a bent Bradford frame with neck extension. Temperature was 104 per Axilla. Arms flexed - some nystagmus. Pupils dilated - no reaction to light. Respiration were deep with slight irregularity and mainly thoracic.\n\nThere was a large swelling on the right side of the head posterior to the orbit with bleeding from the ears and much mucous in the throat. Patient opened eyelids slightly at times. There was also marked twitching of the arms and legs if disturbed. The abdomen was somewhat distended.\n\nIt was considered that the child probably had suffered a severe fracture of the skull, most likely basilar. Also had a fracture dislocation of the 7th cervical vertebra. The patient was practically moribund on admission and the prognosis was felt to be nil. Due to poor condition and the fact that the patient was considered to be dying at the time, a complete neurological examination was not carried out.\n\nThe X-ray report was as follows: \"No fracture of the skull was determined, but there was a fracture of the body and of the left articular process of the seventh cervical vertebra.\"\n\nOn discussing the case with the Radiologist, he gave the opinion that although no fracture of the skull was determined by X-ray, it was probable that the child had a fracture of the base, which, of course, would be diagnosed clinically.\n\nThe patient became worse - depth of unconsciousness became deeper and respirations became markedly embarrassed, especially during the twitching spells, which were more frequent. At 9:00 P.M., left leg showed to be spas tic and the right leg flaccid - bilateral ankle clonus was present - both pupils were dilated and fixed. Some external strabismus left eye. At 10:30 P.M., breathing was more shallow - pupils fixed - twitching much more frequent.\n\nThe treatment consisted of Bradford frame with halter extension, ice cap to the head, sponging for fever and restlessness, and stimulation, coramine etc.\n\nThe patient gradually became worse and died about 3:35 A.M., a few hours after admission.\n\nA copy of the X-ray report is attached.\n\nDiagnosis recorded is Fractured skull (base) and fracture of the 7th cervical vertebra.\n\nL.

On Sunday June 11th, the girls on hospital duty took his dinner up to him at about 12:10 P.M.. One of the girls, Lillian George, removed his pillow at about 12:25 P.M., and the other girl, Vella Seth, saw him in bed at about 12:35-40 P.M.\n\nIt is difficult to fix the exact time when the accident happened but three of the senior pupils, Lloyd Nicholas, Christine Henhawk, and Ruth Antone, were standing together at the corner of the girls' play-ground shortly before 1:00 P.M. when they saw him in mid air, falling. They rushed to where he was lying on the ground, picked him up carefully and carried him into the main building, where they met Mrs. Erratt our lady superintendent and Miss Stanley our nurse. A call was put in for Dr. McLeod. Meantime, our nurse took charge of Cody, and as he was unconscious, treated him for shock until the arrival of Dr. McLeod a few minutes later.\n\nDr. McLeod advised me that Cody's condition was serious and I telephoned Major Randle at Brantford asking him to notify Mr. Jesse Claus.\n\nCody was removed to the Victoria Hospital in London where X rays were taken. Little hope was held out for recovery as it was evident that there was brain injury and internal hemorrhage. Mr. Claus arrived about 9:00 P.M. and remained until Cody died.\n\nI arranged with our local undertaker, Mr. Harding, to provide a casket and look after the body.\n\nI called a Board of Inquiry with Mr. Agent Moore as Chairman at which Mr. Claus was present.

The application form stated that the boy was 5 years of age and a member of the Six Nations Band.\n\nOfficial letter of July 15, 1938, was forwarded to Major Randle requesting him to state the reason for recommending the admission of a boy under age.\n\nMajor Randle replied as follows in a letter dated July 23, 1938:\n\n\"I beg to acknowledge receipt of your 7-0-10 of the 15th of July in connection with the application for admission to the Mt. Elgin Residential School of Ivan, Courtland and Lucille Clause.\n\n\"The father of these children is a cripple and not able to support them and also the parents are separated, consequently it would be in the best interests of the children that they should receive institutional care.\n\n\"The reason for application for entrance to Mt.

In this particular case it would appear that if there had been a proper screen in the window the boy would not have fallen out.\n\nNo provision is made in the appropriation for Indian Education for the funeral expenses of pupils at Indian residential schools as such costs are usually provided by the school management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Mr. E.H. Berthe worked at the school in the afternoon and did most of the detail checking of invoices, cancelled cheques, bank a/c, additions, etc. In the afternoon and evening we went both present and prepared the attached statements.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. O.B. Strapp, gave us every assistance including access to all records, and volunteered much information.\n\nThe period under review was the last Fiscal Year ending March 31st, and the cash book was balanced with the Bank Pass Book to that date.\n\nRevenue - Cash Book - Cheques - Invoices & Bank A/c.\n\nThe cash book is the old synoptic type with only one column for revenue and receipts so it was necessary to analyse the revenue for the year and separate the grants from Farm and Garden proceeds, refunds, rebates, and miscellaneous. The Principal was advised of the new cash book and promised to send for one.\n\nThe total receipts were $36,417.15; the per capita grant is received about once a month indirectly from the Mission Board and not direct from the Department as at other schools. The total of these remittances was $19,004.15 which I do not think is the full amount due according to the per capita attendance.\n\nThe proceeds from Farm and Garden produce sold was $8,290.62, $1,444.52 being derived from the sale of eggs, and $6,846.10 from cattle sales, vegetables and miscellaneous products.\n\nThe item of $8,500.00 is in my opinion quite misleading being the estimated value of food consumed and produced.\n\nN.C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-24, part 1)\nfrom the Farm and Garden. It is doubtful if quantities of meat, vegetables, milk, cream and garden stuff, all at present market prices, would realize that sum.\n\nAt other schools I have visited it has been suggested to the Principals that an approximate record be kept of quantities of food produced and consumed from the farm and garden, with current market prices, in order to obtain reasonably accurate ideas of this food value. The Principal admitted that no record was kept, but the sum as above had been placed on the books by the previous Principal for years past and he had merely followed precedent. He realized how inaccurate this might be, and intends to have a record kept of what is received in the kitchen for consumption. The item is offset under \"Food\" item and is shown separately under \"Expenditures\".\n\nExpenditures\n\nThe item of Salaries $9,824.08 appears high; it is more than 51% of the per capita grant payments received. There are fifteen members of the staff for an average attendance of 153 pupils during the year, and extra labour for the year was $774.08.\n\nThe Fuel & Light item also appears high, although I was informed the old building requires much fuel to heat it in the winter season.\n\nFarm and Garden expenses $5,685.50 includes several items incorrectly classified. For instance, the cost of a new car is included, also repairs and operating costs of the farm and truck which should really be apportioned between the farm and travelling and transport expense. The attention of the Principal was drawn to this.\n\nOwing to losses occasioned by T.B. cattle, more cattle had to be purchased which also contributed to the Farm expense. New implements and farm equipment replacing old and worn out pieces were purchased, and considerable feed for cattle was an additional item due to insufficient quantities being produced last year.\n\nThe balance on hand at the close of the fiscal year was $289.91 with only current accounts payable.\n\nStaff occupations and Salaries\n\nThe list of salaries being paid as at June 12th totalled $9,804.00 which approximates the actual total paid last year $9,824.08 but not including extra labour of $774.00.\n\nAlthough conditions may warrant it here, the combined salaries of the mechanic, farm Instructor, herdsmen and utility man seem high, $2,260.00. Many of the residential schools in the west having more cattle and larger acreage under cultivation do not have men for each of these four occupations. The mechanic\nand utility man's duties are one, and the farm instructor's and herdman's duties are combined also.\n\nCost of Operation\n\nThis statement is self-explanatory, but it appears exceptionally high compared to other schools due to the fact of the large \"estimated\" item of food consumed ($8,500.00) being included in the total expenditures.\n\nThis is clearly indicated by the item \"cost of food per pupil for the year\" $76.43, but if the food actually purchased is considered only, the amount per pupil for the year is $22.87 which is about normal.\n\nThe number of pupils in attendance as at June 12th was 154, and the average for the year 153.6.\n\nLivestock & Crops\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 9 horses, 59 head of cattle, 61 hogs and 300 poultry. There are 20 hives of bees for the production of honey.\n\nThe crops produced in 1934 consisted of 932 bushels of oats and 1,905 bushels of potatoes. The root vegetables, hay, corn and greenfeed were not recorded, so there were no particulars available.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records were in excellent order having been recorded neatly and accurately with the exception of a few expenses incorrectly classified and the matter of the haphazard way in which food values were estimated. A few suggestions were offered the Principal in regard to bookkeeping details which he seemed to appreciate and appeared keen and anxious to co-operate in any way possible.\n\nThe following statements are attached hereto:\n\nBank Adjustment\nStaff Occupations & Salaries\nReceipts and Expenditures\nCost of Operation\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Rayner,\nAuditor\nMount Elgin Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\nLunney, Ontario\n\nJune 29th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr.:\n\nI beg to submit a report of an audit of the books at the above-noted school which I visited on June 4th, while at Caradoc Agency.\n\nThe period under review was the Fiscal Year ending March 31st, 1936 and the cash book was balanced with the Bank Pass Book as at that date as per statement No. 1 attached.\n\nCash Book, Cheques, Invoices, Bank Account\n\nThe new cash book was put into effect after our visit last year but was written as from April 1st, 1936. This book provides a better record for revenue and receipts and the Principal is well pleased with it.\n\nThe cancelled cheques and invoices were examined and checked to the book. The bank account and additions of the cash book were checked by me.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures - Statement No. 2.\n\nThe total receipts were $35,607.68 as compared with $36,137.15 last year. There was quite a reduction in the sale of the crops. The total produce from the previous year which is partly accounts for the difference. Last year the produce sold amounted to $2,729.67 and was sold at market prices. The reduction is due mostly to the sale of a large number of 300 cattle during the previous year. During the last year only two head of cattle had to be disposed of.\n\nIt will be noted that the estimated value of food produced and consumed was $4,270.73 as compared with $5,500.00 the previous year which was only a rough estimate as no records had been kept. During the last year a record has been kept and according to the principal the amount was $3,305.23, but after a close examination of the items it was observed that $3,934.50 covered hay, grain, corn, etc., etc., which had been fed to the stock, therefore only $4,370.73 represented the value of food produced and consumed.\n\nThe total of the monthly grants received by the school from the Mission Board amounted to $21,600.00 as compared with $19,004.15 during the previous year.\n\nSalaries paid during the year amounted to $9,998.86 or 46% of the total grants received. There are seventeen members of the staff at present. Miss Elford was recently added to the staff owing to the absence of Miss Lind, the dietitian, on sick leave with pay.

The number of pupils in attendance as at June 4th was 155.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 6 horses, 41 head of cattle, 17 calves, 16 hogs, and 400 poultry.

The vouchers covering disbursements were examined and compared to entries in cash book. These were found to be properly allocated under the various headings.\n\nDeposit slips were also verified with deposit slips and Bank Pass Book.\n\nReceipts and Expenditure - Statement No. 2.\n\nThe total receipts for the year under review amounted to $31,737.72 as compared with $33,607.68 for the previous year. The total of the monthly grants received by the School from the Mission Board amounted to $21,517.73 as compared with $21,600.00 last year.\n\nThere was a reduction over the previous year in the sale of Farm and Garden produce by $800.00, also in the estimated cost of food, feed and grain produced and consumed by $750.00. Sundry refunds and rebates were also less by $241.00.\n\nThe total expenditure for the year amounted to $32,298.99 compared with $33,040.14 the previous year. The difference is partly due to the value of the food produced and consumed being estimated less than the previous year by approximately $900.00.\n\nThe attached statement No. 3 shows the expenditure more in detail.\n\nThe balance on hand at the close of the fiscal year 1936-37 was $296.25 as compared with $857.45, at the end of the previous year.\n\nL.

The position of Farm Hand is presently vacant but such a position is to be filled in the near future. This will bring the total salary to $9,960.00, which is about normal.\n\nCost of Operation, Statement No. 5.\n\nThis statement shows a slight reduction over the previous year. This is due to the expenditure being lower than the previous year by $741.00 also owing to the average attendance being higher.\n\nLivestock and Crops.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 6 farm horses, 50 head of cattle, 12 calves, 1 herd sire, 48 hogs, 600 head of poultry and 20 skips of bees.\n\nThe crops produced in 1936 consisted of 1936 bushels of oats, 664 bushels of barley, 285 tons of silage, 150 tons of hay, 250 bushels of roots, 13,200 pounds of soya beans, 600 bags of potatoes, 100 bushels of turnips, 325 bushels of carrots, 150 pumpkins, 100 squashes, 43 bushels of sugar, 1,600 cabbages, 150 small flowers, 75 bushels of parsnips and 60 bags of onions.\n\nIn addition the following commodities were also produced with values placed opposite:\n\n| Commodity     | Value   |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Black currants| $10.00  |\n| Raspberries    | 25.00   |\n| Citrons       | 20.00   |\n| Rhubarb       | 40.00   |\n| Honey         | 199.20  |\n\n$ 294.20\n\nThe value of milk produced is estimated as $3,000.00, eggs as $123.00, fowl as $45.00.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe books and records were found to be neatly and accurately kept.\n\nThe manner in which the vouchers were numbered and filed made it most convenient for audit purposes.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy extended to me by the Principal and his assistance during the course of my visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

The vouchers covering disbursements were examined and compared with entries in credit cash book. These were found to be allocated properly under the various headings in the cash book.\n\nDeposits were verified with deposit slips and bank pass book.\n\nBank Reconciliation - May 10th, 1938 - Statement No. 1.\n\nThe bank account is kept with the Bank of Montreal, St. Thomas, some twenty miles distant. According to the Pass Book which was returned from the Bank on May 9th, the balance in the bank on that day was $936.05. The unpresented cheques totalled $775.51 leaving a net bank balance of $160.54. Cash on hand on May 10th amounted to $72.35. The actual balance, therefore, was $232.89, which agreed with cash book balance.\n\nMarch 31, 1938 - Statement No. 2.\n\nThis statement is a reconciliation of the balance at March 31st, 1938.\n\nReceipts and Expenditure - Statement No. 3.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the fiscal year 1937-38 amounted to \u00a330,601.92 as compared with \u00a331,737.78.\n\nW. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor the previous fiscal year. The total of the monthly grants received during the year by the School from the United Church Mission Board, Toronto, amounted to $21,275.00 as compared with $21,517.73 for the previous fiscal year.\n\nThere was an increase over the previous year in the sale of Farm and Garden produce by close to $500.00. The estimated value of food, feed and grain raised and consumed was less than the previous year by nearly $1,500.00. The miscellaneous receipts during the fiscal year 1937-38 were greater than the previous year by $175.00.\n\nExpenditure\n\nThe total expenditure for the year amounted to $30,601.92 compared with $32,298.92 for the previous year. The difference is due partly to a reduction in clothing costs by $550.00 and Farm and Garden by slightly over $1,000.00.\n\nI have shown the expenditure more in detail under Statement No. 4.\n\nThe balance on hand at the close of the fiscal year 1937-38 was $398.09 as compared with $296.25 at March 31st, 1937.\n\nStaff Occupation and Salaries - Statement No. 5.\n\nThe attached statement shows the salaries being paid at present rate, viz: $9,800.00. The expenditure on account of salaries during the fiscal year 1937-38 was $9,798.00. There are thirteen full time employees and a music teacher part time on the staff of this institute.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 6.\n\nThis statement shows comparative cost of operation between the last two fiscal years. The cost in 1937-38 was slightly higher than the previous year except in the case of food which was a little higher.\n\nLivestock and Crop.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 6 horses, 45 cows, 7 heifers, 4 calves, 2 bulls, 12 hogs, 16 weanling pigs, and 650 head of poultry. There are also 20 hives of bees.\n\nThe crop produced in 1937 consisted of 1185 bushels of oats, 733 bushels of barley, 125 tons of hay, 225 tons of ensilage, 25 tons of straw, 400 bags of potatoes, 130 bushels of turnips, 240 bushels of carrots, 70 bars of onions, 185 bushels of soya beans, 75 bushels of beets, 50 bushels of parsnips, 125 cauliflowers, 2400 cucumbers, 2400 quarts fruits, berries, etc., and 800 lbs. of honey.\n\nThe value of milk produced is estimated as 179629 lbs. at $1.35 per hundredweight - $2,425.00.\n\nThe farm...\nThe Farm and Garden revenue, including food, feed and seed raised and consumed, was $966.67 less than the previous year.\n\nThe farm comprises 233 acres owned by the school, and 345 acres rented.\n\nLast year there were 118 acres under crop, 50 acres in hay, clover and alfalfa, and 47 acres summer fallow.\n\nGeneral\n\nMr. Strapp had entered the hospital on May 9th for treatment, but Mrs. Strapp was present and she assisted me in every way during the course of my visit.\n\nThe books and records were found to be up to date and accurately kept.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and assistance extended me by Mrs. Strapp.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.H.

The vouchers covering disbursements were examined under test and compared with entries in credit cash book. These were found to be properly allocated under the various headings in the cash book, with few exceptions and the necessary adjustments were made.\n\nDeposits were verified with deposit slips and bank pass book.\n\nBank Reconciliation - April 30, 1939 - Statement No.1\n\nThe bank account is kept with the Bank of Montreal, St. Johns, a few two miles distant. According to the Pass Book which had been returned from the Bank at the close of April, the balance in the bank at April 30th, was $2,248.02. The Principal had been away to Toronto during the first days of May, and only returned on May 4th, consequently no deposits had been made during May. Two unrepresented cheques at April 30th, totalled $6,027.27 leaving a net bank balance of $220.75 which agreed with the cash book balance as there was no cash on hand.\n\nBank Reconciliation - March 31, 1939 - Statement No.2\n\nThis Statement was prepared to tie in with the balance shown on Statement No.3.\n\nReceipts and Expenditure - Statement No.3\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the fiscal year 1938-39 amounted to $33,948.45 as compared with $30,601.92 for the previous fiscal year. The total\n\nL. W. McGeoch, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-24, part 1)\nmonthly grants received during the year by the School from the United Church Mission Board, Toronto, amounted to $22,951.13 as compared with $21,275.00 for the previous fiscal year. In addition the School received Special T.B. Grants from the Department amounting to $299.00.\n\nThere was a decrease from the previous year in the sale of Farm and Garden produce of $1,142.44. The estimated value of food feed and grain raised and consumed was greater than the previous year by $2,702.69. The miscellaneous receipts were less than the previous year by close to $100.00.\n\nExpenditure:\n\nThe total expenditure for the year amounted to $34,175.01 as compared with $30,601.92 for the previous fiscal year, an increase of $3,573.09. The cost of food was greater by $2,034.25 and there were slight increases in salaries, fuel, buildings and repairs, Farm and Garden, and extra labour.\n\nI have shown the expenditure more in detail under Statement No.4, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe only expenditure which appeared out of the ordinary during the year was the purchase of a combine machine for the farm at a cost of $896.25, less trade in value of $75.00 on a binder. According to the Principal, this piece of machinery will do the cutting, threshing and bagging of the grain in one operation.\n\nThe balance in the bank at the close of the fiscal year 1938-39 was $171.53 as compared with $395.09 at March 31st, 1938.\n\nStaff Occupation and Salaries - Statement No.5.\n\nThis statement shows the list of staff, occupations, and salaries being paid at present, viz: $10,000.00. The expenditure on account of salaries during the fiscal year under review was $10,257.56. There are thirteen full time employees, a music teacher, part-time and a handicraft teacher also part time on the staff of this institution.\n\nTwo new courses of training are being introduced at this school, one in beaten metal work, and the other in handicrafts.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.6.\n\nThis statement shows comparative cost of operation between the last two fiscal years. It will be noticed that the cost for the last year was somewhat higher than the previous year with the exception of clothing and food purchased which show the cost as slightly less.\n\nLivestock...\nLivestock and Crop\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 5 horses, 30 milch cows, 37 young cattle, 2 bulls, 7 hogs, 8 store pigs, 25 young pigs, 236 hens, and 609 baby chicks. There are also 22 hives of bees.\n\nThe crop produced in 1938 consisted of 2705 bushels of oats, 591 bushels of wheat, 529 bushels of barley, 117 bushels of soya beans, 75 tons of hay, 1 silo of corn, 1000 cwt. of potatoes, 140 bushels of turnips, 600 bags of potatoes, 2000 cabbages, 50 cauliflowers, 100 bushels of parsnips, 500 bushels of beets, 100 bags of onions, 200 pumpkins, 150 squash, 300 bushels of carrots and 125 bushels of tomatoes.

The total monthly grants received during the year\nthrough the United Church Mission Board, Toronto, amounted to\n$24,564.00 as compared with $22,951.13 for the previous year.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Farm and Garden cash receipts were greater than the previous year by $630.42. The estimated value of food, feed and grain raised and consumed was also greater than the previous year by $350.25. There was also an increase in the miscellaneous receipts of $299.65.\n\nDisbursements\n\nThe total disbursements for the year amounted to $34,108.97 as compared with $34,175.01 for the previous fiscal year, an increase of $2,666.04. With the exception of \"Telephone, fuel, Light and Water\" and \"Food\", there is a steady increase under each heading.\n\nI have shown the expenditure more in detail under Statement No.4, but this can only be taken as approximate as it would be an endless task to make a complete analysis of all the expenditures.\n\nAt the close of the year the books showed a debit balance of $661.49, an unusual thing for this school. There was still a debit balance of $134.60 at the close of April. The Principal explained that when the accounts for March quarter was received the day book would show a balance on the correct side. There were no accounts payable on hand.\n\nStaff Occupation and Salaries - Statement No.5.\n\nThis statement gives a complete list of the staff employed, occupations, and salaries being paid at present, totalling $11,550.40. The list includes the account of salaries during the fiscal year 1938-39 amounting to $10,561.68, as compared with $10,509.60 for the previous year. There are now fifteen full-time employees on the staff of this institution, an increase of one over last year. A few of the salaries were increased slightly.\n\nSchool Operation - Statement No.6.\n\nThis statement shows a comparison of operation between the last two fiscal years.\n\nWith the exception of food cost there is a substantial increase over the previous year. The average attendance was two less than the previous year, but even so with 152.31 it was over the quota of 150 for this school. The per capita grant has been paid on the basis of 150 however, plus 10% adjustment for the March quarter 1939.\n\nLivestock and Crops\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 7 horses, 27 milch cows, 20 young cattle, 13 heifer calves, 2 veal calves, 1 bull, 5 sows, 48 store hogs, 22 young pigs, 1 boar, 100 hens, and 60 ducks. There are also 10 hives of bees.\n\nThe crop produced in 1939 consisted of 2,544 bushels of oats, 714 bushels of wheat, 415 bushels of barley, 140 tons of hay, 219 bushels of soya beans, 34 silos of cornage corn, 250 bushels of roots, 50 tons of straw, 1 bag of buckwheat, 100 bushels of turnips, 2,500 cabbages, 100 kilolitres, 50 bushels of parsnips, 50 bushels of carrots, 150 bushels of carrots, 175 bags of onions, 100 pumpkins, 150 squash, 100 bushels new potatoes, 100 bushels cooking potatoes, 250 jars of various fruits, 730 jars of rhubarb, 63 jars of various conserves, 124 jars of relish and pickles.

The paid vouchers were examined by test and compared with the entries in the cash book. The vouchers are filed in order of payment and they are also identified by the cheque numbers.\n\nThe cash book entries are neatly recorded and the allocations under the various headings are correctly made.\n\nAll casual receipts are covered by the issue of Standard receipts, the duplicates of which are available for checking purposes.\n\nThe deposits were verified with the duplicate deposit slips and the bank pass book.\n\nBank Reconciliation - April 30, 1941 - Statement No. 1\n\nThe bank account is kept with the Bank of Montreal, St. Thomas, some twenty miles from the school. According to the pass book, the bank balance at April 30th, was $127.65. The unrepresented cheques totalled $846.50, leaving a debit bank balance of $719.90. Cash on hand amounted to $15.18. Sheds for the new debit balance was $15.18, which agreed with the cash book. The bank account was overdrawn during a portion of each month during the year. The Principal made arrangements with the Bank to carry overdrafts and the interest charges for the period on overdrafts amounted to $11.65. The Principal feels the effect of the reduced grants and he will have to curtail his expenses to a minimum.\n\nBank ...\n\nA. J.

The per capita grants totalled $21,712.60 as compared with $21,584.00 for the previous year.\n\nIncluded as part of the receipts is the following estimated value of the farm produce raised on the farm and garden and used in connection with the school:\n\n| Comparative | 1940-41 | 1940-41 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n| Food        | $3,377.94 | $3,800.31 |\n| Feed, seed, etc., | $3,672.50 | $3,222.35 |\n| Total       | $7,050.44 | $7,022.66 |\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe total disbursements for the year amounted to $35,999.53 as compared with $36,605.97 for the previous year.\n\nI have shown the expenditure more in detail under statement No.4.\n\nThe only expenses which appear out of the ordinary were for the purchases of the following articles:\n\n- Teacher: $525.00\n- Stoker: $275.00\n- Total: $800.00\n\nStaff, Computation and Salaries - Statement No.5\n\nThis statement shows a complete list of the staff employed at present, occupations, and the present annual rate of pay which totals $10,660.00 or 95% of the per capita grants received during last year.\n\nThere are now fifteen full-time employees on the staff of this institution and the Principal feels that he will have to let one of the employees go this year as an economy measure.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.6\n\nThis statement shows a comparative cost of operation between the last two fiscal years. There is very little difference between the two years in the per capita cost. Although the annual cost was less this last year there was a corresponding reduction in the average attendance.\n\nLivestock...\nLivestock and Crop\n\nAccording to the Principal, the livestock includes 6 horses, 4 colts, (1-2 yr., end 3-1 yr.), 45 cows, 3 bulls, 12 young cattle, 12 heifer calves, 85 pigs, 741 hens and 584 chickens.

The paid vouchers were examined by test and compared to the charges in the cash book. The voucher records were complete and filed in an orderly manner.\n\nThe cash book entries were found to be neatly recorded with the exception of a few errors in the recording of the charges, the postings were correctly made.\n\nThe duplicate receipts covering the revenue received were verified with the cash book entries. The deposits were verified with the deposit slips and the bank pass book.\n\nBank Reconciliation - April 30, 1944 - Statement No.1.\n\nThe bank account is kept with the Bank of Montreal, Toronto, some twenty miles from the school.\n\nAccording to the bank pass book, which was written up to April 30th, there was a debit balance of $1,494.35 at that date. The unrecorded charges totalled $8,026.85; therefore, the bank debit balance was $9,521.20. Cash in hand amounted to $9.10, leaving an actual debit balance of $2,509.10 at April 30, 1944, which agreed with the cash book balance. The Principal made arrangements with the bank to carry overdrafts on account of which interest charges during the year amounted to $123.97.\n\nBank Reconciliation - March 31, 1944 - Statement No.2.\n\nThis statement, showing a debit balance of $2,672.87 at March 31st, 1944, was prepared to tie in with Statement No.3.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.3.\n\nThe total receipts during the fiscal year 1943-44 amounted to $36,784.09 compared with $37,535.27 for the preceding year.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6210, file 468-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\npreceding fiscal year.

See details on Statement No. 3.\n\nThe receipts from Other Sources include an advance of $500.00 from the Department for major repairs. The sum of $491.82 was expended and the balance of $9.18 was refunded to the Department together with credit vouchers accounting for the disbursements.\n\nThe Principal received $73.90 from the Farmers' Co-operative Society on account of dividends and cancelled shares which the school had subscribed to the society.\n\nThe other items are self-explanatory.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe disbursements during the year amounted to $38,593.90 compared with $37,920.96 for the preceding year.\n\nThe salaries are about normal.\n\nThe clothing charges show a reduction of $723.65 from the previous year.\n\nThe food cost at $10,602.94 shows a slight increase of $185.37.\n\nThe cost of Telephone, Fuel, Light & Water is normal.\n\nBuildings and repairs cost shows an increase of $342.74, but in the previous year no advance was received from the Department for major repairs.\n\nHouse expense cost shows a decrease of $310.86 from the preceding year.\n\nThe Farm and Garden cost at $10,602.61 shows an increase of $1,172.64 over the preceding year. The Principal explained that the crop in 1943 was very poor and that he had to buy a great quantity of feed for the stock. The sum of $4,991.99 was expended for feed and seed compared with $3,153.38 for the previous year.\n\nThe transport cost is about normal.\nThe cost of extra labour shows an increase of $37.37.\n\nThe miscellaneous charges amounted to $233.29. These are detailed on Statement No.4. The largest item was on account of advertisements for want help.\n\nI have detailed the most important items of expenditure on Statement No.4. These figures should be taken as approximate only; so it would be impossible to prepare a complete break-down of all the disbursements.\n\nStaff Compensation and Salaries - Statement No.5.\n\nThis statement shows the members of the staff employed and the rates of salaries at May 4, 1944. The salaries being paid at present would amount to $10,570.00 per annum. The Principal explained that he has had difficulty to obtain farm help and that he has to pay higher salaries.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No.6.\n\nThis statement shows a comparative cost of operation between the last two fiscal years.\n\nThe cost per pupil per year shows an increase of $4.94 over the preceding year. This is due almost entirely to the increase in the average attendance from 127.75 in 1943-44 to 107.34 in 1943-44.\n\nLivestock and Crop.\n\nAccording to the Principal the livestock includes 10 milking cows; 2 yearling colts; 30 milk cows; 10 heifers; 17 calves; 3 bullocks; 69 pigs, including 33 little ones; and 350 hens. There are also 8 hives of bees.\n\nThe crop produced in 1943 consisted of the following:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Value   |\n|---------------|----------|---------|\n| Wheat         | 130 bus. | $181.00 |\n| Oats          | 257      | $143.64 |\n| Hay           | 231 loads| $2,310.00 |\n| Straw         | 10       | $70.00  |\n| Haulage corn  | 2\u00bd miles | $187.50 |\n| Mangels       | 57 bus.  | $22.50  |\n\nValue of feed and seed $2,914.94\n\nLivestock and Livestock Products:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Value   |\n|---------------|----------|---------|\n| Potatoes      | 300 bags | $750.00 |\n| Peas          | 99\u00bd lbs. | $288.30 |\n| Butter        | 11\u00bd lbs. | $348.50 |\n| Milk          | 100 lbs. | $450.00 |\n| Pork          | 100 lbs. | $365.47 |\n| Poultry       | 100 lbs. | $278.10 |\n| Eggs          | 3000 doz.| $618.00 |\n| Honey         | 400 lbs. | $56.00  |\n| Milk - 297,096 lbs @ $1.90 per cwt. | $4,627.78 |\n| Cream sold    | 345.19   | $4,292.53 |\n\nValue of food raised and consumed $7,477.56\nThe farm and garden revenue for the year, including cash sales, food, feed and seed raised and used, was $16,182.36 compared with $14,593.21 for the preceding year. The sale of 119 hogs for $3,170.05 shows a substantial increase for this undertaking over the preceding year when $1,419.64 was realized.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe books and records were recorded up to date and in very good condition.\n\nThis school is in a poor financial condition. The deficit for the year was $11,909.81.

The cash book for April had not\nbeen recorded and according to the Principal he had been\nso busy attending to other duties he did not have time to\npost the cash book since March 31st.\n\nCash Book, Cheques, Vouchers, Etc.:\n\nThe paid cheques for the period under\nreview were examined and checked to the cash book entries.\n\nThe paid vouchers were examined by test and\ncompared to the charges in the synoptic cash book.\n\nThe manner in which the cash book was\nrecorded showed a vast improvement over the previous year.\nThe Principal had managed to balance the cash book each\nmonth during the year, something he was unable to do a\nyear ago.\n\nBank Reconciliation - Statement No.1.\n\nThe net debit bank balance at March 31, 1946,\nwas $6,746.24 compared with a debit balance of $6,402.32\nat March 31, 1945. In addition to the usual school receipts\nthe Church provided $3,000.00 special grants during the year.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements - Statement No.2.\n\nReceipts:\n\nThe total receipts during the fiscal year,\n1945-46 amounted to $34,704.65 as compared with $26,274.41\nfor the preceding fiscal year. The per capita grants received\nfrom the United Church Mission Board, Toronto, totalled\n$19,050.65 compared with $12,150.00 during the previous year.\n\nIncluded .....\nIncluded as \"contra\" under receipts is the estimated value of the produce on the farm and garden and used in connection with the operation of the school.\n\nComparative last two years:\n\n|                | 1944-45   | 1945-46   |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Food           | $4,377.60 | $5,560.75 |\n| Feed, seed, etc.| $1,251.43 | $1,401.50 |\n|                | $5,729.03 | $6,962.25 |\n\nThe farm and garden cash sales brought $6,093.18 compared with $3,691.83 during the preceding year. The cash sales are detailed on Statement No. 2.\n\nThe receipts under \"Other Sources\" are also shown on the statement and they are self-explanatory.\n\nDisbursements:\n\nThe disbursements during the year amounted to $38,648.58 compared with $31,978.86 for the preceding year.\n\nThe salaries are about normal with other years.\n\nThe cost of clothing shows an increase of almost $130.00.\n\nThe food purchases show an increase of $780.72 and the value of food produced shows an increase of $1,183.15.\n\nThe cost of telephone, fuel, light and water shows an increase of $701.32.\n\nHouse expenses show a reduction of $325.70.\n\nThe disbursements under Farm and Garden show an increase of $2,026.56.\n\nThe transport cost shows a reduction of $339.53.\n\nThe cost of extra labour is up $192.39.\n\nThe miscellaneous charges show an increase of $422.29. The bank charges on overdrafts show an increase of $268.06 over the previous year.\n\nI have detailed the most important items of expenditure on Statement No. 3. Although these figures are fairly accurate, they should be taken as approximate only, as it would be physically impossible to prepare a complete breakdown of all the disbursements.\n\nCost of Operation - Statement No. 4.\n\nThis statement shows a comparative cost of operation between the last two years.\n\nThe cost per pupil per year shows a reduction over the previous year. Although the net cost was almost $4,000.00 higher during the last year, the average attendance...\nattendance was also higher by 18.47 pupils.\n\nCrop:\n\nThe crop produced in 1945 consisted of the following:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Price | Value |\n|---------------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Wheat         | 750 bushels @ $1.05 | $787.50 |\n| Oats          | 400      | $.51  | $204.00 |\n| Barley        | 400      | $.70  | $280.00 |\n| Turnips (feed) | 400     | $.20  | $80.00 |\n| Hay           | 1/2 tons | $10.00 | $1,700.00 |\n| Straw         | 75       | $.60  | $300.00 |\n| Total feed and seed | - | - | $3,401.50 |\n| Milk          | 34275 qts. | $.08 | $2,742.00 |\n| Cream         | 530 lbs. | $.30  | $159.00 |\n| Eggs          | 1800 dos.| $.30  | $540.00 |\n| Beef          | 330 lbs. | $.25  | $82.50 |\n| Pork          | 2435 lbs.| $.25  | $608.75 |\n| Vegetables, etc., valued at | - | - | $653.50 |\n\nTotal food - $5,560.75\n\nTotal farm and garden - $8,962.25\n\nThe farm and garden revenue for the year, including cash sales, food, feed and seed raised and used, was $15,060.43 compared with $9,420.56 for the preceding year.\n\nGeneral:\n\nAccording to the Principal the School will not operate after June 30th. He has been instructed by the Secretary of the Church Mission Board to sell the farm implements and the livestock. The farm implements were sold by auction early in May and the sum of $4,375.96 was realized. This amount was deposited in the bank on May 3rd. It is anticipated the livestock will be sold in a similar manner on June 6th. The Principal expects to realize over $6,000.00 on the sale of livestock. According to the Principal the money realized from these sales will be used to liquidate the bank overdraft for which the Church is obligated.\n\nAs far as I could ascertain the accounts are paid promptly. The Principal proposes to notify all business houses with which he is doing business to render their accounts before the close of June in order to complete the payments by June 30th.\n\nI have no information from Ottawa that the school is closing on June 30th.\n\nThe foregoing report, to the best of my knowledge and belief and from the books and records which were placed at my disposal, is a true and complete statement of the condition of the accounts at the time of my audit.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the courtesy and the assistance extended to me by Mr. Soper during the course of my audit.\n\nE.H.

I am therefore wondering, although you did not state in your letter, whether it is required that I should voucher each month for his salary. In any case I have attached voucher as Mr. Burch is becoming anxious and would request that you give this matter urgency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

Under proper authority he commenced his duties on November 1, 1946. This is certainly very unsatisfactory and I am wondering if whoever is responsible for this delay visualizes how this man and his family is expected to live. He has been very patient and I have personally recognized and thanked him for his patience, but that does not supply him with the necessities of life, and I feel that the time is past when this matter should be treated as a slight error. I do not like the word immediate but Mr. Burch demands immediate payment for his services and I concur that he has the right to do so.\n\nPlease look into this matter at once; otherwise I cannot guarantee Mr. Burch's services.\nas the driver of the school bus.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGeo.

This new building is not yet completed but we are using rooms in the former residential school and at the present time there is an enrolment of approximately 40 pupils.

A suitable bus has been purchased and Mr. Earl Murch has been engaged as bus driver and utility man. Mr. Murch is an Indian. He is a veteran with overseas service in World War II and has had considerable experience in handling motor vehicles. Indian Agent Down states that Mr. Murch is a steady worker and that he is the most suitable Indian on the reserve for the type of work required. Mr. Murch would not accept the position with a less salary than $1200.00 a year.\n\nAs the new school began operations on Nov. 1, 1946, it was found necessary to engage Mr. Murch from that date and it would be appreciated if you would arrange the establishment of the necessary position which will be continuous.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum: Miss B.

Driving school bus from 7 to 9:30 a.m., and from 3 to 5:30 p.m. daily. It is necessary to make separate trips to cover all roads.\n\n2. When not engaged in taking pupils to and from school the driver to be employed as utility man in making repairs to the above mentioned motor equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the summer season, when the school is closed, farm work will be at its peak. The driver then will be employed full time driving the road lorry, farm truck and tractors.\n\nThe Department has referred the matter of this employment to the Department of Labour. A copy of the reply received is attached. You will note that the Department of Labour is suggesting a rate of 65 cents per hour, which, for full time employment exceeds the monthly rate of $100, which the Indian referred to above is receiving.\n\nI am therefore suggesting that a position of Bus Driver be established at a salary range $100 - $125,- and am enclosing herewith a recommendation which has been prepared for submission to the Treasury Board in this connection. I am also suggesting that the class or this particular position might be exempted from the operation of the Civil Service Act.\n\nWhile this is the only position of this nature required at the present time, it is anticipated that consolidated schools eventually will be in operation at other Indian Agencies and bus drivers then will be required for them.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

We must keep in mind that he has the care and safety of the little children in his daily routine of travel. I therefore asked him what he might expect in the way of an increase; he said at least $25.00 a month. I think his request is very reasonable and do not hesitate to recommend it. His present salary is $100.00 a month for a twelve month service. During the summer holidays and all other school holidays he is used as a utility man for their rentals to the various schools and I have found his service very helpful.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This Office will write you later re: Irvin's said position but in the meantime it is recommended that Mr. Hendrick be engaged to drive the new bus at a salary of $100.00 per month. The writer has taken the responsibility of starting Mr. Hendrick on his duties immediately as at the moment, with only one bus operating, the driver has to cover two routes which results in one batch of children arriving at school at about quarter to ten and also arriving here after dark at night. You will appreciate this is not a good arrangement either for the teacher or the children; also under road conditions at this time of the year it is best the buses should deliver the children to their destinations before darkness sets in.\n\nMr. Hendrick is a young married man, aged , with four children and served overseas with the Canadian Army. He appears to be a clean cut reliable man who should admirably fulfill his duties. He has had ten years driving experience, mostly motor cars, but has had some experience driving a bus. At end of the month this Office will submit a voucher to cover the salary of this driver which will show the date he actually commenced.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon as this voucher is received here, cheque will be issued.\n\nIf you will check back over your files, you will find that this procedure was followed while we were establishing a Civil Service position for Mr. Burch.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 22, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA temporary exempt position of Chauffeur was established by the Treasury Board on March 27, 1947, for the Indian Affairs Branch at a salary of $100 per month. The incumbent of this position was engaged to drive a school bus at the Caradoc Indian Agency, Muncey, Ontario. It was necessary for the Department to provide transportation for several children attending school from different sections of the Agency. The bus is the property of the Department. When not engaged in taking pupils to and from school the driver of the bus is employed as utility man in making repairs to the bus and other motor equipment at the Agency. In the summer season he is employed by the Indian Agent driving a truck and tractors in agricultural operations. The incumbent of this position has recently requested an increase in salary to $125 per month.\n\nAs two school buses are now required at the Caradoc Agency, the Department will be employing two chauffeurs. Will you please advise me as to the prevailing rate for this class of employment in the Muncey District. I think Chauffeur and Truck driver would be a better designation of the position. The village of Muncey is approximately 20 miles from London, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM. M.

Mr. Macdonald to establish a mission school at Garden River.\n\nThis was the commencement of a movement which has since developed into an organized scheme for the betterment of the Indians of the Garden River district.\n\nThe first step taken was to raise funds for the purpose. This amount was appreciated by some who subscribed generously, and in addition a little money was raised among the whites, and with this money, during the ensuing winter, the commencement, a commenced a mission school at Garden River, which soon attracted considerable attention.\n\nThe next step (1875), Chief Bukkinkama (leader of the Lake Superior band) appointed the missionary.\n\nA second school was opened in the fall of the same year, and a third was opened in the spring of 1876, and a fourth in the fall of 1877.\n\nThe Garden River Mission is now under the management of the Church Missionary Society, but it receives an annual grant from Canada and Ontario Government.\n\nThe school is situated on the banks of the Garden River, about one mile from the town of Toronto, and two miles from the nearest telegraph office.\n\nA farm consisting of about six acres is attached to the mission and is being cultivated by the Indians.\n\nAmong other industries the boys will be taught how to make canoes, and a school for the instruction of boys will be opened.\n\nThe proposed Industrial Home is as follows:\n\n1. A substantial building will be erected in connection with the present premises, containing Dining Hall, School Room, sleeping rooms, etc., and will accommodate about 25 children (boys and girls) as Boarders.\n\n2. A farm consisting of about 30 acres will be purchased for the mission purposes, and will be worked by the Indians.\n\n3. The present school will be enlarged to about 15 acres.\n\n4. A school teacher is already engaged who has been in the boarding trade, and will continue to do so.\n\n5. This industry will be carried on by a carpenter living on the spot who undertakes to teach the boys his trade in the evenings.\n\nIn conclusion of his having the free use of the building for carrying on his own business.\n\nThis enterprise is to be looked upon as a noble and commendable plan on our part. The good effect and results which such a plan would produce cannot be overestimated.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the foregoing plan be carried out, and we trust that the friends who have already subscribed will continue to do so, and that others will be induced to do so.\n\nWe believe that the Indians will be benefited by this plan, and that the cost will be less than the value of the land, buildings, and implements.\n\nWe hope that the members of the Church will be able to compete with their white neighbors, and that the Indians will be enabled to earn a livelihood from the land.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\nLake Superior Mission\n\nProposed Industrial Home for Indian Children at Garden River,\nALGOMA DISTRICT.\n\nIt will be remembered probably by some that during the summer of 1874, Chief \"Little Pine\" from Garden River visited Toronto, Hamilton, and St. Catharines, and in his mission addressed the Indians who knew the wants of his people, namely\u2014\u201cthat a big teaching-wagon might be built at Garden River, where the children of the Indians of the Great Ojibway Lake might be taught and clothed, and fed.\u201d\n\nThis was the commencement of a movement which has since developed into an organized scheme for the establishment of an Industrial Home for Indian children at Garden River.\n\nDuring Chief \u201cLittle Pine\u2019s\u201d tour, the sum of \u00a3213.10s. was raised; this amount was supplemented by several generous donors, who sent us sums of \u00a35 each, and others, and several sums from the Old Country; and with this money, during the ensuing winter, by way of encouragement, the Reverend Mr. Wilson built a house (20 feet), at a cost of \u00a364\u2014which is now attended by about 30 scholars.\n\nThe next summer (1875), Chief Bukwejenjewa, together with \u201cLittle Pine,\u201d again visited Toronto, Hamilton, and St. Catharines, and he also was so successful as to raise the sum of about \u00a3740 towards the carrying out, in full, of this scheme. As a result of this visit, Mr. Wilson was enabled to superintend the disposal of the funds and to receive and account for any annual contributions that might be received. The Secretary, the Reverend Mr. Wilson, writes: \u201cEsq., Ware, Hertford.\u201d\n\nThe Garden River Mission is not now specially connected with any Home Society, but it receives an annual grant of \u00a350 from the Alder Board of the Synod of Toronto, and \u00a310 from the Indian Department. For its future support it is dependent entirely upon the benevolence of friends.\n\nThe plan proposed for an Industrial Home is as follows\u2014a plain substantial building is to be erected in connection with the present parsonage, containing Dining-room, Kitchen, School-room, and Bedroom for two missionaries about 20 children (boys and girls) as Boarders.\n\nA farm consisting of about 40 acres has already been set aside for mining purposes, and will be worked by the Indian boys under the direction of a farm man; about 14 acres were cleared by the Indians last fall, a few acres are still under cultivation, and the remainder will be sown in the spring, and the cleared part planted. For their education the children will be marched down to the school-house at Garden River, where they will be joined by day-schoolers from the vicinity.\n\nAmong other Industries the boys will be taught boat-making, carpentry, &c., and a teacher will be engaged for these purposes. A good school teacher is already engaged who has been in the boat making trade, and so will be able to give instruction in both. A teacher and a carpenter living on the spot will undertake to teach the boys how to make merely in consideration of his having the free use of the building for carrying on his own business.\n\nThis everything is to be conducted upon as simple and economical a plan as possible. The parsonage will consist simply of a room, a school-room, and a kitchen (two rooms), merely of a form man, schoolmaster, and cook (who will be paid), and the present farm will be already engaged, having been purchased by Mr. Wilson from England. Their salaries are to be provided for through the kindness of friends, and the surplus provided for through the benevolence of those who have already been asked for in ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR THE CHILDREN.\u201d The estimated cost of the building is \u00a3100, and the estimated cost of the land is \u00a310 for four acres. Several friends in the town have already very kindly offered to undertake the expenses of board of a few children, and the Rev. Mr. Wilson, Rural Dean, undertakes one, Rev. Mr. Davison a second, Rev. Mr. Davidson a third, from their respective Sunday Schools.\n\nIt is our earnest hope that in reply to this appeal other friends may rise to assist us, so that the good old Chief\u2019s wish may be thoroughly carried out.\n\nPractical people will understand that to set well on foot such a plan as we propose would require economy, a non-expense of the utmost necessity being made; not only have the buildings to be erected, but the land (not yet cleared) and the farm to be purchased, and for the successful carrying on of farming operations there ought to be some little surplus fund in hand. We therefore respectfully submit our plan, and respectfully beg to be thought unreasonable if we suggest that the funds required may be obtained by the sale of such as may be thought useful for the purpose of the undertaking. We believe that the sale of cattle or furniture for the market, or live stock or implements of culture for the farm, or even anything really useful will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWe trust our friends will assist this our undertaking in one way or another, and their consideration and support, now so much needed, will be greatly appreciated. This district of Algoma is opening up rapidly to the white settler, and the poor Indians, if they do not avail themselves of the opportunity, will be left behind by the tide of emigration or else tempted to go among the whites, where they will be more likely to be able to earn a livelihood by working on farms and units with the reaping machines from the till which God has bestowed upon us all.\n\nSome people may say, and may say that it is the fate of aborigines to disappear before the advance of the \u201cpale face,\u201d and that our efforts for their good must prove futile\u2014aye! while the world endures there will be those who will be willing to do what they can for the advancement of the race. If it be a mistake may God judge us and not man. If it prove successful we shall be glad, and if not, we shall be grateful that we have made the attempt.\n\nAny further information will be given and contributions will be thankfully received by the Rev. Stephen Wilson, D.D., Colwood; or by the Missionary, the Rev. Edward F. Wilson, M.A.\n\nGARDEN RIVER, ALGOMA,\n\nMarch 11th, 1876.\nIndian Affairs.

Macdonald to recommend that the land be purchased by the Crown, and the school, which is situated on the Agent's lot, be transferred to the Department of Education. The school has been in use during eight months out of nine, and containing the same number of students as the previous year, which amounts to 232 students for a period of eight months.\n\nOctober 8th, 1874\n\nH. Campbell\nThe Hon. Dept. General of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI had the honor to address you in connection with the late administration in reference to the Industrial Home for Indians situated at Garden River in the district of Algoma. At the time of the erection of the building during the last summer, I applied the Department for the grant of an annual sum towards its support. The children to be educated therein. The application was forwarded and reported on before I retired by the Deputy Superintendent, but before any answer had been given a sad calamity happened by which the structure or the building connected with it were all burnt to the ground.\n\nIt is much to be feared that the present administration will look unfavorably upon my renewed application for assistance towards the rebuilding of the Industrial Home on a somewhat larger & more comprehensive scale than the former one, and will also demand an annual payment by the Department toward the support of certain institutions of the Native Children to be trained therein.\n\nI beg therefore to lay our plans before you for your kind consideration.\n\n(1) The locality. We propose to build the new Institution in the immediate neighborhood of Baillie St. Marie, which is a good central point heavy of access.\nby order of the Indians living on the North Shore of Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, Rainy Lake, etc., Prairie to the Indians of Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, &c., Georgian Bay.\n\n2. Size and cost of buildings. We propose to erect three plain buildings of stone, the central one to be the largest and to consist of an Industrial Home containing schoolrooms, dining hall, kitchens, dormitories, washroom &c., suitable apartments for the accommodation of from 80 to 100 children, girls above ten years of age onwards. The second building to be an asylum or infirmary for sick and aged Indians, capable of accommodating about 12 persons. The third will be a great boon to the Indians, many of whom when advanced in years suffer from hardship and are but little cared for by their relations. The third building will be a residence for myself (or superintendent) & family. In cost we judge will be about as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| Land (including farm)       | $500 |\n| Industrial school            | $300 |\n| Asylum                      | $100 |\n| Missionary's residence      | $150 |\n| Furniture for school & asylum| $100 |\n| Farm buildings, farm stock  | $150 |\n| Carpentry, roofing, etc.    | $100 |\n| Fencing, making paths, fences| $100 |\n\nTotal $10,500\n\nWe understand that the first building is easily portable this winter from its canal works on the American side & could be hauled across twice in sleighs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n3. Funds available for building purposes. We have a committee in England who have undertaken to raise funds for the purpose of rebuilding the Institution. Up to present date about \u00a3500 sterling has been received. A collection for the purpose was being made in Canada. And we hope that the Department will be kind enough to make us a liberal grant taking into account that our motive is to improve & civilize the Indians as a people, & afford them the means of gaining their livelihood in an honest respectable manner in common with their white neighbours.\n\n4. Plan of operations. We propose to employ a staff consisting of schoolmaster & mistress, matron, and farm bailiff\u2014 for the Industrial School, and matron for the asylum. We intend employing no servants but trust the children to engage actively in every branch of house work\u2014and to carry it on in the most economical manner possible with a view of eventually making it as far as possible self-supporting. We have also started the business of carpeting, boot-making, co-operative farming etc., & these Industries will we hope assist from the first day thereafter.\n\n5. Means of support. During the short time that the first Institution was in operation, we obtained means of support from the following sources:\n\n- The Local Catt Church in England: \u00a3500.00\n- Friends in England: \u00a3100.00\n- Misses in Board: \u00a3100.00\n- Indian Department: \u00a3200.00\n- Sunday schools towards board of \u00a318.\n- Children at \u00a350, clothing, etc., as well: \u00a3900.00\n\nTotal: \u00a33100.00\nThis sum covered the salaries of missionaries, schoolmasters, farm bailiffs, matrons, &c., the board of 18 children. The cost of a child in addition for food and clothing was $75.\n\nThe annual cost of the new Institution at present will probably be for salaries of staff $2,500, - children in the school & inmates of the asylum $75 each per annum. We hope that the Department will undertake the support of a limited number of children in the school & of the aged people in the asylum, - besides continuing the present grant of $200 per annum towards the school master's salary.\n\nFrom the short experience we have had of looking to the different Sunday schools for the support of individual children - we are inclined to continue the plan, as it seems in every way a satisfactory one, and a means of creating an interest among the children of Canada for their less fortunate brethren, the red children of the forest.\n\nAll which I beg to respectfully submit and have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCopy of a Report of a Committee of the Honourable\nthe Privy Council, approved by His\nExcellency the Governor General in Council\non the 3rd December 1873\n\nOn the received Application\nof the Rev.

Of these 21 are supported by Sunday Schools, 10 by individuals, and 19 by Government.\n\nNO DEBT.\n\nThrough the blessing of Almighty God, funds have been supplied us to meet all our expenses thus far, and our accounts last October, at the close of the first year showed a balance in hand of $200.61.\n\nANNUAL COST.\n\nA general fund is required to meet the expenses of the Principal, Matron, Schoolmaster, Medicine, Repairs, &c., which together amount to about $2,500.00 per annum. The children cost $75.00 each per annum for board and clothing; hence 75 by 50 equals $3,750 plus $2,500 gives $6,250.00 as the entire cost per annum of the Institution at the present time. Of this amount we receive $1,642.00 from friends in England, $1,140 for the support of 19 children (50% paid by the Indian Department), $584.00 from the Col. & Capt. Church Society, $600.00 from the Algoma Diocesan Fund, $800.00 for the support of individual children at $75.00 each per annum, $500.00 for little girls ($50.00 clothing being supplied) and $100 for one child educated as a Teacher. Total, $5,000. The balance of $754 has to be made up by general contributions and by gifts of clothing, &c.\nCLOTHING.\n\nThis past winter we have run very short of clothing, and during the past half year have exceeded our allowance by $64. Several Sunday Schools that contribute only the $10 board money for their proteges have failed to send the required supply of clothing, so that we have been obliged to purchase from the general fund. Very few of the children were supplied by their supporters with warm underclothing, which in this rigorous climate is an absolute necessity. Unless we are liberally supplied with good warm clothing we fear it will be impossible to keep the children at the present low rates charged to their supporters. At the same time we would heartily thank those Sunday Schools, individuals, and friends both in Canada and England who have made the things and filled the boxes and bales\u2014the opening of which is so great a pleasure to us. We feel sure that none of our helpers would wish to see their children in rags, or that their toes should be frozen for want of warm socks and mocassins.\n\nINDUSTRIES.\n\nWe are endeavoring to make the industries\u2014that is the farm, carpentering, bootmaking, laundry, and workroom pay themselves, and so far have every cause for encouragement\u2014but at the same time there is of course a certain amount of risk in carrying on these various branches, and it seems to be only right that we should as soon as possible form a reserve fund, from which to draw when it becomes necessary to increase the stock in either branch. So soon as the industries are well established and begin to yield a regular income to the Home, it is intended that additional children shall be supported from this source.\n\nPROPOSED SEPARATE GIRLS' HOME.\n\nIt is proposed to erect a new Home for girls and to confine the present building entirely to boys. Our friends in England are entirely in favor of the movement, and a paper is already in circulation there asking for contributions to the amount of $8,500, which sum it is thought will be sufficient both for building and furnishing a Home for the accommodation of about 20 girls. A Christian lady will be engaged to undertake the education and general care of the girls, and a laundress and seamstress will also be employed. When the two Homes are in operation the annual expenditure will be increased by about $1,000 independent of the support of children.\n\nFor the present it is proposed to rent a building for the girls, so that the new plan will (D. V.) come into operation.\n\nAFTER THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS.\n\nAs soon as funds will admit of it we hope to introduce several new industries for the boys, such as printing, tailoring, boat-building &c., and we hope\n\nMORE SUNDAY SCHOOLS\n\nwill come forward to undertake the support of fresh children. We would like if possible to begin with 40 boys and 20 girls after the holidays, and the boys may in time be very well increased to 60 or 70 if supporters can be found.\n\nWe feel that it is indeed no small undertaking that is before us, but God has greatly blessed us hitherto, and we believe that He will continue to bless us and to prosper His own work. We therefore simply lay before you our plans and explain to you our position in the hope that\n\nINCREASED EFFORTS\n\nmay be made to enable us to carry on and render more useful this work in which we are engaged.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS\n\nmay be sent either by cheque, or bills enclosed in a letter and registered to\n\nREV.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe boys employed them.\n\nOur boys have been engaged in various trades, including blacksmithing, shoemaking, carpentry, and stone masonry work.\n\nOne boy's capability is that after learning a trade for a few months, he would be employed by someone willing to give him a certain amount of money each week.\n\nWe believe it is best to have the boys employed in order to continuously increase their income. Our work is helping the boys to earn a living, providing a large number of jobs.\n\nAt the present time, we have accommodation for 56 boys. We have 53 boys in residence. We have the hospital furnished for only $17.\n\nWe find it very difficult to procure support for the boys. Several Sunday schools and individuals who had been contributing generously to our cause for the support of a boy have since been unable to do so. Some found themselves unable to make up the full amount required.\n\nIn conclusion, we urge throughout the country to help us as we don't have a good bank balance at this time due to our funds.\nProposed enlargement of the Shingwauk Home.\n\nWe might then & make the following additions to our present building:\n\n1. To erect a village wing, in which we shall make rooms for the accommodation of the boys and girls, who will be housed there, and also a common room in the main building, for the use of the school company.\n\n2. To erect a 2 story wing at the Western end of the building containing a schoolroom, a dormitory, a dining-room, and a reading-room for the students.\n\n3. To erect a chapel, and provide the same with a clock in the village wing, and a bell-tower. But with the exception of the chapel, nothing is more essential than to build the new building. This would certainly be a room for two or three hundred more persons.\n\nThe buildings will cost about $25,000. The rough estimate is about $25,000.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, File 469-1, part 1)\nHave them make two applications to the Department for assistance:\n1. Towards the Board buildings\n2. For an increased grant towards the annual support of the boys.\n\nIf I may venture to name a sum I would suggest a thousand dollars ($1000) toward the proposed buildings, of which amount $400 to be paid now on the completion of the college wing, $300 on the completion of the first floor of the church, and $300 on the completion of the church.\n\nI think the application should be drawn in the district but we have neither asked for nor received any additional of the original grant made six years ago. At the time that house was built grant was made, the six hundred dollars paid the Wm. and Anna, keepers, part of that original grant made 6 years ago.\n\nI would also suggest that whatever the amount work on has been called (accomplished or completed) the Government should make some favorable consideration with the Board of Education.\n\nI am grateful for the receipt of the copy, will not fail to look for a favorable response from the Government in supporting the proposal for my district.\nWhen the new building are completed we expect to be able to take 80 boys which is our present number.\n\nI will ask that the government will undertake charges to support at $16 each per annum half of the number of boys resident in the Institution. That is, that when we have 40 boys forthcoming we will have the government will provide for 20; then we have 50 boys, for 25; then we have 60 boys, for 30; then we have 70 boys, for 35; then we have 80 boys required for 40.\n\nI think not that this plan may come into operation from the 1st January next; when there will be about 23 boys may remain here without any government instead of 20 total present. This will enable us take two more boy making our total number 57 plus 25 suffices (or even 1 or 27 suffices) (as at present) from the sources.\n\nI trust that my application may be favorably received with reasonableness this will\n\nEdward S.

Now that my health is in some\nmeasure restored, it becomes well that I should\nconsider again the proposal by you that progress has\nbeen made & in renewing my application for\nan increase in the annual grant of the Department\ntowards our work.\n\n(i) Proposed enlargement of the building:\nIn my letter of Nov. 26th, I proposed adding two\nnew wings to the Institution. The College wing\non the right hand\nhas been\nbuilt\nand\nthe\nbuilding\nin the east part of next spring.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 30, Volume 6214, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand during the temporary closure of the Home, the account of my illness will undoubtedly be sufficient to cover the expenses incurred in the erection of this wing.\n\nThe new wing on the left-hand side\u2014what was to contain a junior school-room\u2014already forms a bedroom for a patient, and will be erected as soon as funds will admit of it\u2014but at present we have \u00a315 in hand solely for the use of the proposed Chapel.\n\nGeneral Maintenance of the Home.\n\nThe most serious matter at present engaging our attention is the source of much anxiety in the General Maintenance of the Institution. We find our funds altogether inadequate to meet our growing expenses.\n\nTowards the support of individual boys we receive a grant from the Department of \u00a31200 per annum\u2014that is\u2014for the support of 20 boys at \u00a360 each\u2014which sum pays for their food and in part for their clothing\u2014but leaves little or nothing to meet the salaries of teachers, and of such other annual expenses.\n\nBesides the 20 boys supported by the Department\u2014we receive support for about 25 more from Sunday Schools and other sources.\n\nBut it is felt General Maintenance of the Institution has been an enormous strain.\nof increased help. Up to the present time we have endeavored to manage with as small a staff as possible. For about three years we managed this without a matron, the school master himself experimenting all the domestic arrangements of the institution with merely one woman servant as cook. As the number of the boys increased this became impossible. We engaged a matron. Then up to last spring I undertook all the account keeping myself for the two homes\u2014separate accounts for each separate trade, Savings Bank accounts. This, with teaching a senior class every day under tints, the general management proved too much for me and I broke down.\n\nI have now engaged a man who will devote half his time to the printing office, or half his time to account keeping & general management of the boys when at work (apart from his school studies). This will be an additional expense to the Institution, but it seemed to be a necessity for the proper carrying on of the work.\n\nOur general expenses therefore at present are:\n\n| Item                                      | Amount |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Salary of Principal & Assistant           | $134    |\n| Matron's salary abroad                    | $350   |\n| Matron's salary                           | $250   |\n| Accountant & assistant manager's salary   | $200   |\n| Servant in kitchen\u2014wages abroad           | $150   |\n| Servant in kitchen                        | $350   |\n| Farm charges for teaming                  | $150   |\n| Final                                     | $250   |\n\nTotal: $1,089\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would prefer briefly asking for that which seems at present to be of the utmost necessity\u2014namely, a grant of \u00a3500 per annum towards the General Expenses of the Institution.\n\nShould however the Department refuse to contribute its funds only to the support of boys, then I would ask that an additional boy may be supported at \u00a360 each per annum, or I will endeavour to raise the \u00a3500 required for general expenses in some other way.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nS.

Wilson deeded in trust 100 acres of land, on which the Shingwauk Home is built, to the Bishop of Algoma, and to his successors in office, for the benefit of the said Shingwauk Home.\n\n2nd. \"That it is a private speculation of Mr. Wilson and some of his friends in England.\"\n\nIf no other proof were necessary, this charge would be sufficient to meet it; but we find, on referring to the records of the Department, that the Bishop has been appointed as Inspector of the Home, and has been directed to see that the Indians are educated there, and that the Home is managed for their benefit.\n\n3rd. \"That the boys are children of parents who do not desire their education if they attend the Home.\"\n\nThis charge is not supported by any evidence whatever. It is a well known fact that the Indians generally desire their children, whether able or not to pay for such\u2014so much need that they are pleased under the care of the school instructors, this we find to be the case with the Shingwauk Home, and that a preference is given to pagan and other destitute Indian lands.\n\n4th. \"That a Chapel is entirely unnecessary.\"\n\nThere being no accommodation for the Indian boys at the Parish Church, His Lordship the Bishop states that it is most desirable a Chapel should be at\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Van Abbott told me afterwards that he had made his written for the full number as usual, and our own school returns show the number of pupils that we have. I presume it has been the\nintention of the Department generously to continue the grant until such time as we can fill our ranks again and have sixty or seventy pupils as formerly.\n\nI wish to state plainly that I believe this is now little prospect of our number of pupils increasing to any extent at either of the Homes until after the Summer holidays. Our accounts (to end 31 December) show a balance (credit) of about $4000, and if the Department intends to continue its present grant of $600 during the two following quarters ending March 31st and June 30th notwithstanding the small number of pupils, I think it will be an excellent opportunity to make use of our remaining surplus in the purchase of a machine and fit a small stenographer's office.\n\nI trust therefore that when the question of the future of the Home comes up for consideration, the amount of the grant of $600\nIn practice, we may not be required at present to be maintaining your habit, the above object. The collection of the new building & machinery, not to exceed about $1500.\n\nWe have no machine yet at home in the hands of the Indians side, it is likely that the Divisional Superintendent would soon buy itself a source of profit to the Institution, and another person for our work, I estimate it to be the Bishop of Algoma who has been instrumental in securing the Indian Board's vision will be well contented at the new work place, and a man more able would have charge of our machine, who would not be anxious in the least when needed.\n\nSigned by Edward Wilson.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RC 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\nFORM OF BEQUEST\n\nTO\n\nLAKE SUPERIOR MISSION, AND ITS HOMES FOR INDIAN CHILDREN.\n\nI give and bequeath unto the Reverend Edward Francis Wilson, or the Treasurer for the time being, of the Lake Superior Mission, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the sum of $10,000; to be paid with all convenient speed after my decease, exclusively out of such part of my personal estate, not hereby specially disposed of, as I may by law bequeath to charitable purposes; and I hereby lawfully charge such part of my estate with the said sum upon trust, to be applied towards the general purposes of the said mission and its various Homes for the Christian training and civilization of Indian children; and the receipt of the Rev. Edward Francis Wilson, or the Treasurer for the time being of the said mission, shall be a sufficient discharge for the said legacy. (And I direct that the duty upon the said legacy be paid by my executors out of the said fund).\n\nThe will or codicil giving the bequest must be signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses, who must subscribe their names in his presence, and in the presence of each other.\n\nNOTE.\u2014This testament must have been executed one year previous to death of Testator, to give it effect over Mortmain Acts.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOUR INDIAN HOMES.\n\nWith our finances at a low ebb, it is necessary that every expense should be kept down as much as possible, and consequently the closing of the Indian Homes for the present season (we close our books now the 31st December instead of the 30th September) will be condensed into as few pages as possible.\n\nThe obvious cause of the low state of our funds is that our income has not increased in proportion to the increase of our work. It is no small matter to keep two Institutions in active operation\u2014a Girl's Home with some 20 or 25 girls to clothe and feed, and three persons employed to teach and keep them; and a Boy's Home with from 60 to 80 boys, and eight persons employed in caring for and teaching them, and instructing them in various trades. Even with the greatest economy, and the kind assistance we receive in gifts of clothes for the children, the entire expenses amount up every year to about $160 a week; (i.e.\u2014about \u00a3290.) We have never yet been able to receive so large a number of children as that mentioned above, the greatest number ever received being 18, and of boys 32.\n\nThe whole of this work of caring for these poor Indian children, and training them in the ways of christianity and civilization, has grown up within the short period of six years. The Shingwauk Home, for boys, was opened on the 1st of August 1875, and the Wawonish Home, for girls, (they are about 24 miles apart,) was opened on the 19th of August 1879.\n\nWe desire in this Report to tell, in as few words as possible, what the Homes are doing, and have done since they came into existence, and then leave it with the Christian public to say whether they are an object worthy of increased support. God has blessed and helped us wonderfully so far. It has been perhaps on the whole a struggling uphill work, but it is really worth while in looking back to see how difficulties once often seemingly have either vanished or been overcome; how when our path seemed mapped up, the way has been opened before us. We have never had to beg for money, our people have been simply to make known our wants once more, as they have arisen, and then do their best to put it into the hearts of His people to supply them. Just at the present time our want is an income sufficient to meet the annual expenditure of the two Institutions. We have already a considerable surplus of funds for the Shingwauk Home, the old set and the original Institution, and it seems most desirable that a second set should be established for the collection of funds for the Wawonish Home. We believe that some help would undoubtedly be collected in England, very about \u00a3100 per annum specially for the Girl's Home\u2014Then as to Canada, what we seem mostly to want is some organized plan for the collection of annual subscriptions for the General Fund of the two Institutions. A large number of the individual Indians are already supported separately by Canadian Sunday Schools. This seems an excellent plan, if only the children will not tire in their good work, and will send in their quarterly remittances as promptly as possible. We should be glad if 20 more Sunday Schools would at once each commence the support of an individual child, \u00a375 (\u00a313) per annum is the cost, or if nothing is sent \u00a350. But in addition...\nIn this individual support of Indian children, we want to see a generous subscription list set up in Canada, for the support of the two Homes. We have already a few names of annual subscribers, but the list needs to be very largely increased in order to come near our aim. Indians who are able to do so would perhaps try to send us $10 per annum; others might try to send that amount, and country Sunday Schoolers, whose Sunday collections would not admit of their supporting an Indian child, might perhaps send us $10 or $20 per annum to our General Fund.\n\nNow for a few words about the Shingwauk Home. There are at present about 50 boys on our roll list, but owing to the death of the Principal in the spring and the consequent partial closing of the Institution, there are only 17 boys at present in residence, and the money which would otherwise have been used in the support of the full number has been employed in the erection of the new wing, which adds greatly to the comfort and usefulness of the building. It was possible to build another wing at the other end of the Institution containing a junior schoolroom and dormitory, and reading room for the apprentices, all of which are now finished, and also a chapel, but there remains little prospect of carrying out any of these plans just as planned. Of the boys who left us in the spring, several had completed their full term with us as apprentices at various trades, and are expected to get employment among non-Indian people, while a tailor, two were fishermen, two prospectors, one a bootmaker, one a blacksmith, and one a carpenter. Two boys also had become fitted as teachers; of these one is now the catechist and school master at the new Mission among the Indians of the Red River District, the other has charge of an Indian school near Parry Sound. We hope that the Missionaries in charge of the Mission stations to which our boys belong, will after they have completed their course with us, look after them and assist them both in getting and retaining situations at work for which they have become fitted. Our boys make capital workmen, and give great satisfaction to their employers, but it is only to be expected that they will need some encouragement and assistance from those friendly to their race when they first come out into the world to make their own way. The spirit of industry, thrift, and determination to work, may be gathered from an extract from a letter written by one of the boys who is now making farming his vocation, but expects to come back to us next spring.\n\nThe Wawanoosh Home, for girls, has been placed under the fostering care of a local ladies' committee, the members of which all take very great interest in the working of the Institution. Mrs. Macdonald, the Superintendent's wife, though a great invalid and seldom able to leave her sofa, has quite made it her work in life to care for the poor Indian girls, and kindly occupies the position of first Lady Manager. A full report of the work from her pen will appear in the Annual Missionary News, but from the reasons given above only a very little can be said in this condensed report, which for economy's sake we wish to confine to 24 pages, and of which about 500 copies only will be printed. Mrs. Macdonald says\u2014\n\n\"Our Wawanoosh Home which has now been fully opened a year and a half (though the wing of the building had been occupied by a few girls the two previous years) has prospered. The girls are hardworking and receiving in all domestic duties in proportion to their ability. We have now 16 girls, whereas this time last year we had but 14. The exterior of the Home is becoming as attractive as the well ordered interior, the lot consisting of five acres.\"\nwhen which the house stands, has been trust, is the dawning wish to do some\nfound and drained, a good sweeping good for others, even as it is being\nfaded up again, and that the small drain for them.\"\nstanding clean, and the house itself red.\nAnd now, in conclusion, we would\nthe front most little, our doors and windows, and the many kind\ntear up and repair, and the best friends of our work for the general\npurpose, present our acknowledgements to the support of the institutions,\nthis spring; whereas, having heard from Our Honorary Secretary, in England,\nthat we have been doing well, and he writing a gain quite hopefully about\nthe state of affairs. A few weeks ago, the increase in funds, the contributions\nof the Shingwauk Home, which had\nbeen received, was \u00a320 a year, having been\nreceived up again to the original sum,\nand we feel sure that we may hope a little\nmore. This sum over and above the\nregular annual amount of \u00a340 to the missionary\nwork, has been given to our secretary by our\nhonorary \"Lady Receivers,\" if each\nhouse in the district would make a like effort,\nour income might soon be raised to the\ndesired amount. We trust that every\nyear our appeals by our Honorary\nHome may be represented in England by\na Secretary-Treasurer and a staff of\nactive, earnest \"Lady Receivers,\" as is\nalready the case with the Shingwauk\nHome. We also most heartily thank\nour friends, both in England and\nCanada, for their most kind contribu-\ntions of clothing for both the House.\nA large amount has been received al-\ntogether during the year, and owing to\nthe partial closing of the Boy's Home\nwe have been able to accumulate a lit-\ntle reserve stock, ready for use when all\nthe boys come back to us next summer.\nWe are very grateful for the results of\ntheir efforts, for the boys, especially, use\nup immense quantities of underclothing,\nand any money that comes into our\ntreasury for clothing purposes is more\nthan absorbed in the purchase of cloth\nclothes and boots for them. For the\nboys, Mrs. Faquier asks especially for\nuniforms of some sort to be made up by the\nchildren for their own use. The new\nuniform dress is of navy blue, trimmed\nwith red, of serge for the winter and\ncotton for summer, made with blouse\nwaist, and cuffs, collars, and belts piped\nwith red. All gifts of clothing are ac-\nknowledged at the time of receipt in\nthe Algoma Missionary News.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The best of the pupils were Martha Esquimaux who took 330 out of 478 marks, and Florence Wawanoan who took 293 out of 440.\n\nThe average number of marks taken by the pupils was higher than at any previous examination. At the midsummer examination 1879 the pupils averaged 574 per cent of the total number possible; at Christmas 1880 564 13-18 per cent; at midsummer 1881 613 per cent; and at the examination just held 632-26 per cent.\n\nThe subjects taken up were as follows:\n\n3 senior boys were examined in geography, grammar, arithmetic, English history, English, algebra, Latin, and a little Greek.\n\n12 boys and seven girls in reading, spelling, dictation, arithmetic, geography, grammar and English history, the girls omitting the last two subjects and taking sewing, knitting &c., instead.\n\n14 more boys and 7 girls brought up the 2nd reading book, spelling, dictation, arithmetic, and a little elementary geography. The rest of the school were only commencing to read, and writing on slates.\n\nThe following are a few specimens of the questions given to the senior boys and the answers they gave.\n\n(a) Describe the Tabernacle. Ans. (Esquimaux.) The Tabernacle was a church made something like a tent. This is the church which the Jews had while journeying through the wilderness. It was 30 cubits long, 10 cubits wide and 10 cubits high. It was divided into two parts, the larger part was called Holy Place, and the smaller part Holy of Holies. In Holy Place form the services, but inside the Holy of Holies only the High Priest was allowed to go once a year. In Holy Place the altar of incense, the table of shew bread and the golden candlesticks were kept. In Holy of Holies the Ark of the Covenant was kept.\n\n(b) Tell what you know about Melchizedek. Where is he mentioned in the New Testament? Ans. (Perkins.) He blessed Abraham when he came from the battle after he had got Lot, for he was made prisoner. He was king of Salem and also a High Priest, and no one knew who he was. He is mentioned in Hebrews vii.\n\n(c) Where are Aden, Puducherry, and Singapore? Ans. (Kahngwa.) Aden is at the mouth of the Red Sea. Puducherry is in India, on the Coromandel coast. Singapore is on the Straits of Malacca.\n\n(d) What is told of Edward VI? Ans. (Williams.) He became King when he was 10 years old. Quick and intelligent. Somerset managed the kingdom when he was a boy. He built schools at Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Macclesfield. Also hospitals of St. Bartholomew and St. Thomas.\n\nThe marks gained by the pupils included those given for good conduct, punctuality &c., as well as for progress in their trades, so that the apprentice boys (who only study at night) had an equal chance with the rest.\n\nThe following is a letter written during the examination by one of the apprentices\u2014\n\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste Marie,\nDec. 15th '81.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I thought I would write to you this evening and tell you what I am doing. We are very busy the whole day and return to the Home about 6 o'clock in the evening. There are at present 2 boys learning tailoring, 3 learning carpentry, 6 printing, 3 blacksmithing, 3 timbersmithing, 4 bootmaking, and 1 harnessmaking.\n\nThe following are specimen letters from their employers\u2014\n\n(From the Blacksmith.)\nSault, Dec. 15th '81.\n\nRev. E. F. Wilson,\n\nDear Sir.\u2014I am pleased to be able to say that the whole of the boys in my employ are making very fair progress, and that they are always anxious to oblige in every possible manner, and give entire satisfaction to myself.\n\nI remain,\nVery respectfully,\nWilliam Brown.\n\n(From the Tailor.)\nSault, Dec. 15th '81.\n\nRev. E. F. Wilson,\n\nDear Sir.\u2014In reply to your note starting from the Shingwauk Home I have to say that I've been Maxwell...\nI am yours truly,\n\nW. Vaughan.\n\n(From a Carpenter in the Village)\n\nRev. E. F. Wilson\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It gives me great pleasure to say that the boy William since he came to work for me has been punctual, obedient, and hardworking, and deserves the best character that could be given to anyone in his situation. He has given perfect satisfaction in every particular.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. Storey.\n\nOther tradesmen speak equally well of the capabilities and behaviour of the boy, and it may be taken as an established fact that Indian boys are fully capable of becoming good mechanics if a fair chance is given them to do so. It surely then would be far better that increased facilities should be afforded to the rising generation of Indians to engage in occupations for which they are as well fitted, than that they should be left to idle away their time in a semi-civilized, half-gipsy sort of existence on the Indian Reserve. His Excellency the Marquis of Lorne, who visited the Institution last summer, was exceedingly pleased with all that he saw, and expressed his belief that our plan of dealing with the boy and encouraging him to throw off their Indian habits and amalgamate with the white population was the right course to pursue. His Excellency the Earl of Dufferin, who laid the foundation stone of the present Shingwauk Home in 1874, received a more satisfactory account of the work done there than we have ever heard of from any other institution.\n\nWe are not at present gaining their hearts by giving them food, and care for them as though they were our own family, and through the medium of their local agents make known to them the importance of working and earning their own living.\n\nTO OUR SUPPORTERS\n\nWe most heartily thank our many friends and benefactors for the kind help they have afforded us during the past year, and trust that they will continue to do so.\n\nFor the sake of the Indians making progress and gaining self-support, we appeal to all who can afford to do so to contribute to this responsible undertaking.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFORM OF BEQUEST\n\nLake Superior Mission and its Homes for Indian Children.\n\nI, [Name], of [Address], do hereby make this my last will and testament, in which I declare that all my estate, both real and personal, shall be disposed of as follows:\n\n1. I give and bequeath unto the Lake Superior Mission and its Homes for Indian Children, the sum of $[Amount] to be paid at my death.\n\n2.

In the year 1877, A. R. Wilson visited the Garden, but on account of the sickness there being near, and ten girls taken as pupils by all Christmas and in a comparatively civilized state, had the funds been so low that it resolved to give it up, and other thought inexpedient to keep Mr. Wilson another mission.

We admit that the whole work is one requiring much patience and faith.\n\nThe result of the six examinations added to this out of 36 boys\u201410 were found to be \"excellent,\" 15 always appearant, 10 generally a pass, 29 generally below mark or less.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that a letter from Mr. Smith, dated June 25th, 1883, was received today. The subject of our discussion here at the Indian Affairs Office is the need for improvements in the management of the Department. It is essential to ensure a more regular attendance of Indians and to reduce those who have been taught to continue at their trades after they leave us.\n\nIn order to strengthen the arguments which I have had the privilege to lay before the Department and to show how very necessary it is that something should be done, I have now to lay before you a complete statement of the number of Indians who have attended our institutions since we opened eight years ago, showing the number of years in which they have been enrolled, the number of years they actually attended, and the number of years they have been enrolled but did not attend.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAnd this will be recorded since leaving the home where we can be ascertained.\n\nYou will note that of 135 boys who have been under our care, as many as 61 have been removed by their parents (or failed to return after holidays) before their time with us was completed; that only 13 boys completed the full term of 5 years, and that 52 remained only 1 year.\n\nIt appears to me that it is next to impossible to carry on the work of our institution in a satisfactory manner and with good results without having an active interest in the future of those who have been committed to our care for a period of at least 4 or 5 years, and to remain practically after the summer holidays.\n\nI think it has been found that it is best to provide for a better education, attention to athletics or some course which may prove beneficial not only for Indian boys here but also for similar institutions throughout the country.\n\nEdward B. Wilson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEnglish Composition\n\nI have the privilege of telling you my experience in this place. The manner in which it is conducted. We are boarded and our clothes are given to us for nothing. We don't have a hard time to be kept in this position and equal to any other school. Perhaps better off in some respects. I suppose many of the white children would be very glad to help the place and be cared for like adopted children, and be cared for when they are sick when they have been there. What they want most now is for the Indians to be more educated. More time is devoted to the study. In this case we ought to be very particular. I have been with the chief several times in this place, and some of them use the best of medicine for them. Some have been here several times but have not been able to get well. I know some boys who have come out from here and have been treated very well and they say it was the stepping stones they have been used upon and never came back because they did not have the opportunity to go back when they came out. They will be sent back to their homes. Please send me the money for the Indians here. I think they need it badly, and perhaps I could be of some help in this matter. I believe you can put on your hands and some of the boys can put on some of their feet. You know I don't care how much or little they give. I'm sure they'll be able to help to them, but I'm sure...\na little amount that is given them by Mr. Wilson for their wants having the people come out now. They will prefer paying money to have teachers coming in. I would think it better to continue the way I am doing. We have a school book for some time which I cannot keep up with the children to read and write. I have promised to have nothing but a pen, paper and something that fits at all.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo the Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nOur Institution for\nIndian boys has now been for several years\nin active operation, and as doubt have\nsometimes been expressed as to whether the Native\nrace is capable of improvement and education,\nI have set out in tabular form the result of\nthe successive half yearly examinations.

Every boy that enters the\nInstitution has obtained 100 marks for every year he has been in residence in order break as \"Victor\"; so marks for each year makes him an \"Aspirant\"; less than 80 marks for each year and above 60 puts him \"below mark\", and any who get less than 60 marks for each year are counted \"lag\".\n\nWe have followed this system for three years, and find that it answers very well, as it shows us how the boys besides rewarding their exertions, and marks in their progress in trades, good conduct, writing English etc., are making in lessons.\n\nIn regard to the six examinations which included in that out of 85 boys, 17 were \"Victris\", 23 were \"Aspirants\", 13 were \"Aspirants\", 10 generally aspirant, 29 generally below mark or lags.\n\nBelieve that this statement will compare favorably with the progress made in schools among other children\u2014remembering that \"Victors\" have got upwards of 75 instead of total marks for months, and taking into account that our boys are taught in a language of which they know little or nothing before they come here.\nI am offering the Department the above Statistics in regard to our work, because I am most earnestly desirous that this matter of educating & improving the Indians should be taken up more warmly & systematically than has yet been done, and I believe that the Department can do much to aid us in making our Institution more acceptable to the Indians and more successful in its work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nShould be much obliged if Indian Office Reports could be sent me for last year & the year before.

But it would be desirable that in future issues of the same agreement, that the amendment should be made at the first call.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nI have had the honor of addressing several letters to the Department in reference to the difficulties we have had in securing a regular attendance of pupils at our institutions, and have also recently paid a visit to Ottawa in order to press the matter upon the attention of the Department.\n\nFrom what I know personally of the condition of Indian schools throughout the Province of Ontario, I feel that there has been employed little energy in the education and training of Indian children; it seems to me that there is most urgent need for some increased pressure...\nbeing brought closer upon the Indian parents \u2014\nwhether by Compulsion or by milder means \u2014 so\nas to secure a regular attendance at the schools,\nand a better return for the great expenditure\nincurred both by the Department and by\nMissionary Societies.\n\nIt surely is not a satisfactory state of things\nthat in a district where there are 50 or 60 children\nof a schoolable age, the average attendance at\nschool should be but from 10 to 15, \u2014 that\nat an Institution such as ours, with accommodation\nfor 60 boys & upwards, we should have only\nbetween 20 and 30. But these should be such\ndifficulties in inducing the Indians to allow their\nchildren remain a period of five years;\u2014\nand that agreement when signed should be\ncontinually broken. But I have said\nSufficient already on these points in my former communication - and I feel satisfied that the heads of the Institution will readily cooperate all that I have said.\n\nIt seems time that the only way to bring about an improvement is for the Department of State to take up the matter, and that that course may be brought promising if there are any further suggestions in addition to those which I have already ventured to put forward.\n\nI would propose first (as I have already said)\n\n1) A thorough government inspection of both day schools and institutions - such inspection being but a new to assuring that the school are properly attended - the teachers efficient scholars taught good lessons - and advance in their knowledge of the English language.\n(2) That a system of fines be introduced for non-attendance at School\u2014\n\nThese fines I would suggest might be imposed as follows:\n\nThe inspection of the schools should take place just before the half yearly payment of annuities.\n\nThe annuity money would be forfeited by pupils\n\n(a) Between the ages of 11 and 13 who were unable to read & spell intelligently from the 2nd reader, write a fair hand 75\u00a2\u2014\n\n(b) Between 13 and 15 who were unable to read & spell from the 3rd book, do arithmetic up to a certain point, answer questions in geography, write a letter and speak intelligible English.\n\n(c) By young men between 15 and 18 who failed to pass an examination in the\nforegoing subjects - and who had not learned or become apprenticed to a trade.\n\nThe annuity money to be forfeited to be either:\n(a) divided among the members of the Band (those who forfeited it being excluded)\n(b) or be used for the improvement of the School building and the purchase of School supplies\n(c) or be expended in prizes, medals etc. to be awarded to the most efficient pupils.\n\n(Cases of sickness could, of course, be excused by a doctor's certificate)\n\nI venture to think that the effect of introducing some such system as this would be to produce a far more regular and satisfactory attendance at the Day School & the Institution. It would make the Indians on the Small Reserves more anxious than they are now to have schools erected - when they have been kept in constant operation - it would\nalso I believe be a means of infusing fresh life and spirit into the teachers.\n\nI would also renew my former proposals that in addition to this\u2014a system of rewards should be instituted in the form of medals or government certificates\u2014which would lead to enfranchisement.\n\nThe idea (as I have suggested in former letters) would be for the Indian children to attend the day schools till 10 or 11 years of age, and then under the direction of the Inspector, to be drafted for the Institutions. Should the institutions now in existence\u2014viz Muncy, Mohawk, Wikwemikong, Shingwauk, and Wanabek be found insufficient to accommodate, it could I suppose easily be enlarged\u2014or new erected.\n\nAnother matter that I think requires to be remedied.\nIn that the children do come to our Institution, seldom know their own names and rarely if ever their ages. A child whose name is David and whose father's name is John Keshik - will call himself David John instead of David Keshik - not understanding the difference between Christian and surname. We have occasionally had children who are known by as many as three different names in different localities. This is both confusing & tiresome. I should think the Indian agents might keep a correct list of the names of all children born on the Reserve and register the dates of births. Then the school teachers could procure the correct names and give of their pupils from the agent. If the Indian surname is not conspicuous, the Christian name of the father might be omitted.\nwit a diviname, as John & Johnson, or trans-\ncated - as liezhiik to Sky.

My experience with Indian boys is that they make very good mechanics. And a certain proportion of the boys we have taught have stuck to their trade.\nand are making their living & their trades \u2014 and\nis sufficient encouragement true to persevere.\n\nCol. W. Durocher also letters excepting by\nspecial No. 6 \u2014 or to found that the Indians can\nbuild by hand, fishing would take his mind\noff him. Col. W. Durocher is anticipated\nby the State of Ohio to have had interest in\nindian work in the past, and now they\nhave been doing all they could do in any\nplace where they have worked in a way of\ntaking care of a good friend and in making him\nmore useful member of society.\n\nTo my own part I have faith in the\nmechanical & intellectual power of the Indians,\nbelieving that with proper guidance & a due\nconcern of nature & man in some cases the\nnatural training amongst native & a few\nbecome educated & become useful &\nproductive citizens & gain their living in a\nsustainable way as farmers & mechanics in a\nBoil Stick gave birth to their predictions. But for this, the door we must join the Confederacy. Our children, & the principal problem of our new nation, is the future. We must prevent the Indians from breaking the agreement, promising to keep their children from these institutions in education. This cannot be done by force, but must be done by reason. You will soon see that our policy is working. The Indians cannot be forced to agree, but if at the time of signing the agreement they were informed that it would result in the removal of their children, if they were to agree to the agreement on those conditions - that the children will be removed, I do not think the Indians would agree.\n\nI urge that the Department have received the views of the Indians in question from the heads of the various institutions involved, and now take the matter up to make such changes and provisions as may be desirable, so as to make the institutions, rather than day schools on the Indian Reserve, a more solid foundation for Indians and their advancement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Carlisle Institute, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with 600 Indian pupils, under control of Capt. Pratt, U.S.A.; (2) The Hampton Institute, in Virginia, with 500 colored pupils, + 135 Indians\n... - full dormitories; and (3) The Lenape Institute, Philadelphia, with 200 Indian pupils, under Dr. Bellamy.\n\n(1) The Carlisle Institute was, indeed, a barracks; it\nconsists of 15 separate buildings (exclusive of stable), located on a large piece of ground, with band stand and\nplayground in center, and has accommodations for about\n600 Indian children - boys & girls. At present there are\n450 pupils in residence, and over 100 more placed out with\nfarmers. A staff of about 10 teachers is employed. The\ngovernment allows the Institution $167 per annum per capita,\nand they also raise about $10,000 in annual contributions.\nThe buildings are all stonework, well furnished, heated by\nsteam, there are facilities for trade & a 10 different\ntrades. The total expenditure per annum is between\n$80,000 and $90,000. The School has been in operation\nsince 1879, and is very successful. General Atwood,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, whom I had the privilege\nof meeting in Washington assured me that it was doing\na good work, not only in educating the Indians, but in proving\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the White people. That the Indians can do if Mr. Pratt had not been so cruel in taking the children away entirely from their parents, - to further they can be removed by force, to better, - and after they are educated be encouraged to leave the Reservation or settling among White people.\n\n(2) The Hampton Institute (Virginia) is for both Colored Students and Indians, and is under charge of Prof. Armstrong. Originally it was for Colored persons only. Indians were first taken in 1897. There are at present 500 Colored pupils and 135 Indians - boys and girls. Two separate buildings are set apart for the Indians to live and sleep in - 2 m 3 of each bedroom, - and for music and lesson they mingle with the Colored Students. The average age of the pupils is about 17. The buildings are nearly all of red brick - large, roomy, substantial, heated by steam - and most complete in every way. There is a staff of six teachers employed. The Colored Students pay in part for their education, but the Indians are admitted free - and the Government allows the Institution $6,167 per Capita in annual. Both the Instruction and training at Carlisle are conducted on the Military system, the boys being all in uniform, - and formed into battalions under regular officers. Every day they march to the Dining Hall led by their Band, - numbers of visitors are generally present to see them. I was much struck by the manner...\nThe foreign interest in teaching seemed to take it upon itself and its personal good feeling which seemed to prevail. The school teachers receive from $9600 to $1400 each salary, out of which they pay $3 a week each for board.\n\n(3) The Lincoln Institute (Lincolnville) consists of two large buildings in the immediate neighborhood of Philadelphia and several miles apart from each other. They were both established by a benevolent lady named Mrs. Cox, and are under the auspices of the Episcopal Church. The government aids these institutions by a similar grant of land made to Carlisle and Hampton, named $167 per capita maximum. There are 98 boys at present in the Boys' Home and 101 girls in the Girls' Home; they are chiefly Sioux and Ojibway, & come from Minnesota, Nebraska, and the distant states. The idea seems to be at all times to remove the children as far as possible from their old haunts, & they are not allowed to go home for holidays. 25 or 30 of them are sent back yearly, trained in the Institution and attend the public day school in the city.\n\nI have endeavored to make any account of these institutions which I have visited as brief and concise as possible. The Chief Point emphasized in my mind was:\n\n(1) That the U.S. government is dealing with great thoroughness and considerate liberality with the question of Indian education,\u2014and has evidently been led on to do so partly.\nPretty poor the idea of economizing public funds, and\ndiscarding of Indians in a less expensive manner than\nby old way of shooting them. Hardly & it just that\npublic sentiment demands it. There are 260,000\nIndians at present in the States, and the U.S. government\nis extending a million dollars per annum solely in the\neducation of its children.\n\nI notice that in the States, it seems to be quite accepted\nthat the day school or the Indian Reserve is a little award\nexcept as a stepping stone to the Educational School or Institution,\nand, as Capt. Pratt well remarks, even the Institution could\nnot be a stepping stone to the Common School & High schools\nof the country, where the Indian children would mingle\nwith the White children and emulate them in their studies and\nfuture aspirations.\n\nI notice that it is common for the U.S. government\nto allow $187 and in some cases even nine hundred\ndollars per pupil in their various institutions. Whereas at our\nhome at Sault Ste Marie we are only allowed $400 a head for\n30 boys which is hard for us, plus out of a total of 15 pupils.\n\nI notice that in the United States there is a distinction\nin every practical way between the status of Indian Reserve\nand other card Indians, so long as he is sufficiently civilized\nand educated to have his own homestead unhampered by any\nspecial Indian laws. I would urgently press this on the\nadvice from Canadian government. No doubt, I imagine,\ncan cure those who are always kept in a state\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA certain proportion of the Indian population in Ontario might go to the wall if made independent, but I believe the great bulk of them would prosper in a way they cannot expect to do at present. It seems quite hopeless teaching our boys trade so long as they have any to Indian Reserve to go back to when they leave us. If any of them wanted to buy stock or set up a trade, no wholesale dealer would trust them under existing laws. There is only a division of opinion in the State in regard to the plan of separating civilized Indians from their Reserve, but the balance of opinion seems to be in favor of division, and it is a notable feature that those institutions seem to prosper most which are the farthest away from the Indian Reservations.\n\nAnd now in regard to my particular work at Lault-St. Marie, I am engaged in remodeling our present building, and erecting a Branch Home in the North West district.\n\nSince visiting these institutions in the States, I am inclined to give up my plan for Branch Homes, and to concentrate all my efforts towards the establishment of a large central Institution at Lault-St. Marie. I believe Lault-St. Marie to be about a good a central position as could be found. It is already the crossing point of 8 or 10 different steamboat lines, and I doubt not within ten years' time it will be the centre of some railway.\nRailway lines,\u2014two connecting us with the States and two with Canada. Our position on the banks of the St. Mary River is a very prominent one,\u2014and a large institution established there could not but be noticed by the travelling public. There are already eight or ten large institutions established in the States with large aided or wholly supported governments,\u2014and it seems time of reasonable that we should have at least one such institution established in Canada. I would propose to make our present Shingwauk House the School House; (2) to buy the farm adjoining us on the East which is already partly under cultivation and I believe can be bought at a moderate price, and build there a new Boys' Home; (3) to erect a separate building with suitable Classrooms above and Dining Hall & Kitchen in basement; (4) also workshops where boys may learn a useful trade, might be taught, the Indian Dept. employing us (as is done in the States) to make farming implements, harnesses, tinware &c. to supply the Agencies in the North West.\n\nI therefore hold the government should undertake the main cost of all this, & do it in a liberal substantial manner; and when the buildings are ready, allow us at least $500 per Capita\u2014say for 300 pupils,\u2014so that we may be able to employ an efficient staff of teachers and conduct...\nNatalia on a similar plan to that which is so successfully followed in the States. I think it would be an honor to the Country to do such a work as this. Several Attorneys assured me that in his opinion the expenditure on education Indians went further than those expended in fighting them.\n\nIf the government will carry out the plan I wish, say that I am willing to yield all the independence that I have hitherto enjoyed and am ready to become a servant to the Department and act faithfully under their direction. I am willing that the Institution should become independent in so far that funds not belonging to the Church of England be allowed to attend their own place of worship in town and be visited by their own ministers, provided only that the Institution continue to be distinctly Protestant and that the Bible always be a text book in the school.\n\nThe Wannock Home, at present occupied by sick, might if the change were made, be utilized either as a junior school or a hospital.\n\nI very earnestly hope that the government will undertake this work. I have been struggling amid many difficulties for the past fifteen years to build up such a work as this. If the U.S. government, after due and thoughtful consideration...\nconsideration, has been found to authorize the expenditure of one million dollars per annum in the education of children of more than 260,000 Indians, would it be any out of the way for the Canadian government to expend a million a year on the children of our 130,000 Indians? But I ask only for $45,000 per annum for the St. Marie Institution when established, and I say a like amount would require the burnt in the form of additional land or the erection of new buildings.\n\nI think it is not only a mistake, but unjust and wrong to treat our Indians as paupers. If we are to have schools, let them have good schools; let us make our institutions to them in a generous manner, worthy of a great nation. I see why the Indians should not be so respectfully treated as cared for as are the inmates of our Blind and Deaf and Dumb, and other Government Institutions.\n\nThe Blind and the Deaf and Dumb, their condition is their own and not their fault. It is not right (in my opinion) that Indian children should be treated as paupers ought at least to get as good food and clothing best of them would get in their own homes. No, few of our children's parents are respectable for...\nAnd houses, and yet we have often been obliged to cast off clothing to cover them, and yet it is a 4 cents a meal each.\n\nI may just add in conclusion that the people of St. Marie are fully in accord with me in extending my work, and are also employing our pupils so attentively that they are greatly prejudiced against us, but I have treated us closely for the last 10 years, and see no reason why the results of our system, if not now, will be seen from our work.\n\nI have to honor this day,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdward Wilson\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOur Forest Children.\n\nVol. 1, No. 1. SHINGWAUK HOME. February, 1867.\n\nWhat is to be Done With the Indians?\n\nSent Gratis\n\nto those who will interest themselves in the welfare of the 25,000 Indian Children.\n\nOur Object:\n\nOur object in issuing this little paper, which will be printed from time to time as funds admit, is to draw attention to the following facts:\n\n1st. That there are in this country, scattered throughout the Dominion of Canada 139,000 Indians.\n\nThat as time goes on and our West expands, these Indians necessarily come more and more into contact with us.\n\nWe must now that the wisest, most just and humane course for us in Canada to pursue would be at once to establish Institutions on a large scale where Indian children would be received and educated and brought up in the habits of the white man, so that when they grow up they may be enabled to stand up among their neighbors, to resent and to remove the question again comes to the fore. What are we to do with these wild men of the forest, the original owners of all soil which they have discarded their all their rights and drive them into the wilderness or else we must provide for their existence in our midst and admit them into our civilization. There seems to be little doubt but that this Indian question will become more and more difficult and serious as time goes on.\n\nThe advance of the iron road through the North West has produced a demand to do with the Indian question as little as possible. The insidious influence of the Red and his half breed friends is felt even in the heart of the Indian country. The advance of the iron road through the North West has produced a demand to do with the Indian question as little as possible. The insidious influence of the Red and his half breed friends is felt even in the heart of the Indian country.\n\nEvery year will bring our white population, more and more into contact with the wild Indians of the North West; every year will subdue the feelings of jealousy which already exist between the two races.\nThe troubles that have been experienced in the United States are probably in store for us. In the United States there are 60 millions of white population and 260,000 Indians. Here in Canada we have a million only of white population and 130,000 Indians. We in Canada have just half the number of Indians that they have in the United States; the Indians therefore are in far greater proportionate numbers with us than they are across the border. As our population increases we must necessarily come more and more into collision with them. The United States Government has spent an enormous amount of money in trying to reduce the Indians to subjection by compelling them by force not to interfere with the advance of white immigration. But time has made the Americans wiser; they have found that killing the Indians and driving them westward does not pay, the process has been too expensive. Within the last eight or ten years they have completely changed their policy. They have realized that it is cheaper to expend large amounts of money and sacrificing the lives of many of its best soldiers in reducing the Indians to subjection by force of arms, is now subsidizing in a liberal generous manner a number of large Institutions which for the most part have been originally started by philanthropic people or charitable societies. There are now in the United States eight or ten LARGE INSTITUTIONS for Indian children, accommodating from 200 to 600 pupils each, all under efficient teachers, and with facilities for teaching trades. The American Government is now spending a million dollars a year, solely in the education of young Indians. We want to see something of the same kind done in Canada: Surely it is a question, which it would be well for the country, just at this juncture, to consider,\u2014whether money expended in the education and training in Industrial pursuits of the rising generation of Indians, would not be well spent. The Indians are among us. The Indians have to be dealt with in some way. And just now it is a question, which is the wisest course to pursue? That they are, as a people, capable of elevation and education, seems to be a point beyond dispute. The success that has attended the Institutions, which already exist, both in this country and the States, goes far to show it. If the Indians are to become our fellow citizens, and to unite with us in building up this great country, it surely seems the wisest and most generous course on our part, to afford their children the advantages of a liberal education, and to put them in the way of gaining their own livelihood, as we do ourselves. A little money spent now, both by government and by our wealthy fellow citizens, may be the means of saving much expense, and perhaps many lives, in the future.\n\nA Large Protestant Institution At Sault Ste Marie\n\nSAULT STE. MARIE is a splendid centre for Indian work, and that is where the two Indian Institutions, called the Shingwauk Home and the Wawatam Home are situated, established. There is no better central position could be found. It is already the crossing point of eight or ten different steamboat lines, and we expect within two years time it will be the centre of four railway lines, two connecting us with the States and two with Eastern Canada. Our position on the banks of the St. Mary River is a very prominent one, and a large Institution established there could not but be noticed by the travelling public. There are already\nOUR FOREST CHILDREN\n\neight or ten large Institutions established in the States, the Carisle Institute in Pennsylvania\u2014all Indian\u2014with 600 pupils; the Lincoln Institute in Philadelphia, all Indian, with 200 pupils; the Institute in Virginia, owned folk and Indians, 600 pupils; the Salem Institute, Oregon, 150 pupils; the Haskell Institute, Kansas, 350 pupils; these and many others, and they are all of them either largely aided or wholly supported by Government. $167.00 per capita per annum is the usual allowance. Now it seems to us only reasonable that we should have at least some such institution established in Canada, and we propose to remodel and enlarge our present Institution, so as to take 300 pupils, and we shall ask the Government to give us at least $150 per capita towards the support. We believe it will be an honor to the country to do such a work as this. The Indians ought not to be treated as paupers; they ought wisely to be assisted except for their blood and sweat and labor. Their condition is their misfortune and not their fault. We appeal to the Christian public to aid us in setting this great work on foot. We rely on the sympathy and goodwill of all Protestant denominations in carrying out this work. The Jesuits are to the fore in Indian work as in everything else; they are doing their best to bring about a wholesale conversion of population from Paganism to Jesuitism. If successful the consequences to the country may be most disastrous. Protestants, if they cannot unite about other matters, may surely take hands and work together in this great Indian question. Hitherto our Homes at Sault Ste. Marie have been distinctively Church of England; if the opportunity takes up our work as we propose and undertake the main cost of support we are willing that they should become undenominational in so far that pupils not belonging to the Church of England, shall be allowed to attend their own places of worship in town, and be visited by their own ministers.\n\nShingwauk Boys to the Carlisle Boys.\n\nThe following is the message which Mr. Wilson sent to the boys at the American Institution in Pennsylvania, which Mr. Wilson visited. \"We hope that you all love Jesus Christ. Pray without ceasing. We wish you all to be patient at your studies; and in everything that you do, do it unto the Lord.\"\n\nDavid Minonine, John A. Mingash.\n\nMr. Wilson brought back 25 replies from the pupils at the three Institutions which he visited. These are some of them\u2014Dear Friends: I am very glad to receive the message, that you sent to us. So I thought I would like to send my message back to you. Well, I have this to say: We are glad you love Jesus Christ, but I also believe and try to keep His Commandments. Now I must tell you, that we have prayer meeting, and we pray for you people. We want you to pray for us, also. I am truly, your friend, Lorenzo S. Bonito, an Apache boy, from Arizona.\n\nTo the girls at the Home, up in Canada\u2014Dear Friends: We were very glad indeed to receive that kind and welcome message, you sent by Mr. Wilson. I was very much interested in visiting a boarding school. Our school here is very large, we have great many buildings here, and we have about 600 students. The Indians here come from different parts of the United States, some from Dakota, Indian Territory, Nebraska, and a few from Arizona. I myself come from Nebraska, and I belong to the tribe of Omaha. I am 13 years old. I study geography, arithmetic, history of the bible, grammar.\nThe troubles that have been experienced in the United States are probably in advance of ours. In the United States there are 60 millions of white population and 260,000 Indians. Here in Canada we have 5 million only of white population and 130,000 Indians. We in Canada have just half the number of Indians that they have in the United States; the Indians therefore are in far greater proportionate numbers within than they are across the border. As our population increases we must necessarily come more and more into collision with them. The United States Government has spent millions of money in trying to reduce the Indians to subjection and compelling them by force not to interfere with the advance of white immigration. But time has made the Americans who thus have found the Indians the Indians and driving them westward does not pay, the process has been too expensive. Within the last eight or ten years they have completely changed their policy. The American Government, instead of expending large amounts of money and sacrificing the lives of many of its best soldiers in reducing the Indians to subjection by force of arms, has started in a very generous manner a number of large Institutions which for the most part have been originally started by philanthropic people or charitable societies. There are now in the United States eight or ten LARGE INSTITUTIONS for Indian children, accommodating from 200 to 600 pupils each, all under efficient teachers, and with facilities for teaching trades.

The success that has attended the Institutions, which already exist, both in this country and in the States, goes to prove this. If the Indians are to become our fellow citizens, and to unite with us in building up this great country, it surely seems the wisest and most generous thing to give them, as a reward for their children the advantages of a liberal education, and to put them in the way of gaining their own livelihood, as we do ourselves. A little money spent now, both by government and by our wealthy philanthropists, may be the means of saving much expense, and perhaps, many lives, in the future.\n\nA LARGE PROTESTANT INSTITUTION AT SAULT STE MARIE\n\nSAULT STE MARIE is a splendid centre for Indian work, and that is where the two Indian Institutions, called the Shingwauk Home and the Wawanoosh Home are already established. Probably no better central position could be found. It is already the crossing point of eight or ten different steamboat lines, and within five or six years hence it will be the centre of four railway lines, two connecting us with the States and two with Eastern Canada.

We have no control over them, nor do we pay any part of the expenses. We have no voice in their management, nor do we have any say in their education. They are all under the control of the government, and we have no say in their affairs.\n\nShingwauk Boys to the Carlisle Boys.\n\nFollowing is the message which the boys at the Shingwauk Home sent to the boys at the American Institution in Pennsylvania, where Mr. Wilson visited.

These\nfigures represented our position just before I\nstarted on my trip to the North West 5 weeks ago.\n\nI have this morning examined our accounts, and\nfind that instead of $1900 we are at present\n$1400 in debt.\n\nUnder these circumstances I feel it not in\nquestion to endeavour to keep our Institutes\non its present stand.

Not asked for a new corps, but have said so before towards the enlargement of the Central Battalion or built the main, and (look my postscript letter.)

It is of its consideration on 22nd December of that year.\nWould involve too great expenditure.

We also desire to call special attention to the Christmas number of Our Forest Children, which we propose to issue about Christmas time. It will be very prettily got up, extensively illustrated with original sketches engraved for the purpose, 16 pages in length, and the price 15 cents. For 25 cents we will send Our Forest Children to any address from the present time until December next, and the Christmas number now to be issued. We hope to get as many orders as possible for the Christmas number. In no other way can the friends of our Indian Homes help us just now than by sending $1 with the names and addresses of 4 new subscribers, to each of whom we will send the Christmas number of Our Forest Children and its contents.\n\nShingwauk Pupils to Montreal.\n\nWe are just back from a most interesting and successful trip to Montreal and Ottawa. What a business it was getting those 30 children ready! First, there was the selecting of which of them should go; then came the packing; the nicest-behaved must go; do not think that members of our church should be able to pack; of course we must not omit the two blackest draw from the school, and the two prettiest pack on that box. At length the 10 were decided on\u201420 boxes and another. We believe that our beloved mother church will gain infinitely more influence in this young country by owning her arms widely and acknowledging the need of work done by others than by attempting to do all herself. We must carry all that would be required for themselves during the 5 days' absence, and all the things required for the tableaux, and the large pictures to hang on the walls; and then when the packs were completed, all were weighed, and the weights regulated according to the size of each child. Then there were the provisions to see\u2014to baskets for canned meats, biscuit, cheese, sugar, etc., tin cans for tea, water, milk, &c.; boxes packed tightly; large bags for bread and bags for apples for all the boys must have new hats, and these had to be trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons; and lastly there was the drilling and rehearsals for the tableaux and singing. Well, the day came at length, and they all looked very nicely as they started off at 6:30 in the morning\u2014the boys all with their shiny black packs on their backs, the girls with satchels slung to their sides and all carrying flags in their hands. It was a loggy...\nIt was dreary and rain when we reached Montreal station at 8 o'clock Saturday morning. The Division fell in on the platform; was the first under cover, followed by the same order in the Second Division, and proceeded to the Victoria Rink. We marched in order up the centre aisle to seats set apart for them. In the afternoon we divided into three parties: David and nine pupils were to visit St. Luke's and Trinity Sunday Schools; Johnny and nine more were to visit the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Macdonald and Mrs. Macdonald were to visit the Protestant Church. Mr. Macdonald was to take charge of the boys and Mrs. Macdonald of the girls. We were to meet again at the rink where the great Sunday School demonstration was to take place in the afternoon, and spend an hour getting things ready for the entertainment.\n\nOwing to the wet weather the parade of 10,000 children belonging to the Protestant Sunday Schools through the streets of Montreal, had to be omitted\u2014but the gathering in the Victoria Rink was a great success.\nThe Happy Little Indians.\n\nThe boys of the town had a glorious time of it last week, consorting with the children of the forest. Indeed all the families who threw open their houses to receive them were delighted subsequently at having done so. At the first they consented to the proposal with reluctance, saying, \"It's with the woods,\" and they began to think whether a bed in the woods would not be more agreeable than the spirit of the roving rascals. But when the electric wires of human nature were strung, and the whites and reds looked into each other's eyes, the fog of misconception dissipated, and there came a feeling of warmth and fraternity. The \"square\" bed and the Benjamin's portion were freely bestowed. The children were exceedingly clean and neat. They ate with refinement of manner, were kind and good-natured, and with rather elaborate ceremonies, they commenced to perform kind and kind deeds made them laborious, and they made bows and arrows for the children in the houses they stayed, arrows and such things of mechanical cunning and that could shoot as straight as a line. One of the boys who stopped at Mr. Godden's asked one of the town group: \"Shall I shoot down that bird in the tree?\" Eagerly they fired off a volley of \"Yeses.\" The bird was killed off-hand, picked up a stone, and in a flash the bird was tumbling on the ground. The two blackest youths stayed with Mrs. McKay. One of them had never been clothed except with a blanket until three months ago. There were some boxing matches in the house and Capt. McKay and one of his sons gave them exhibition, at which their faces lighted up merrily, and they looked on to the end with interest. Everywhere in the houses the children succeeded in imprinting indelible impressions; and when they walked out on the streets with polished boots and well brushed uniform, these impressions circulated into a wider area and were discussed with enthusiasm.\n\nCentral Canadian, Toronto.\n\nMr. Wilson has given thought of taking a number of his Indian children to England next spring.\n\nThere are also Indians at the Wawanoosh, and will soon be returning.\n\nA little Mohawk, named Sebastian Brant, a descendant of the renowned Chief Joseph Brant, has been received at the Shingwauk.\n\nClothing for the Indian Homes.\n\nFrom Morrisburg, per Mrs. Killaly, a box containing a large supply of coats, trousers, warm caps, mittens, shoes, books, and various other things.\n\nFrom the Missionary's Office, Quebec, a barrel containing a nice supply of boys' and girls' clothing, shirts, socks, underclothing, petticoats, aprons, a frock, factory cotton, books, toys, etc.\n\nParcel by mail, containing two knitted vests.\n\nFrom Mrs. Bartlett, 12 pairs socks, cloth, mittens.\n\nFrom the St. Paul's branch of W.

The land was bought last spring from Mr. Atalton & Mrs. Church and Mr. Dunn, Michigan. We are now planning to purchase the land at a cost of $6,000.

The next year (1872), Chief Shingwauk went with Mr. Wilson to England, where he collected, and the first Shingwauk Home was built; this Home was destroyed by fire in 1873, six days after it was opened. The foundation stone of the New Shingwauk Home was laid by the Earl of Dufferin in 1874, and it was opened for use in 1875, by their Lordship the Bishop of Huron and the Bishop of Algoma.\n\nThis cut shows the present Shingwauk Home and its surroundings as completed December, 1886; also the sites of proposed new buildings. The explanation is as follows:\n\nA.\u2014The Shingwauk Home (stone), with accommodation for the fifteen boys (built 1874); B.\u2014the stable (frame); C.\u2014the chapel-built 1883 (stone); D.\u2014the boys' hall (stone); E.\u2014the boys' cottage (frame); F.\u2014the form cottages (stone); G.\u2014the boys' bath and wash-room (stone); H.\u2014the furniture factory (frame).\n\nThe plan shows the proposed new buildings: I.\u2014the central building; J.\u2014the school rooms; K.\u2014the dormitories; L.\u2014the superintendent's quarters; M.\u2014the proposed new Central Building; N.\u2014the proposed new Laundry.\n\nIf these plans are carried out there will be accommodation for one hundred boys and fifty girls, and all will attend the one building for school and meals.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Right Rev. the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, says of the proposed Home at Medicine Hat:\n\n\"I welcome most heartily and thankfully the independent Indians who are now preparing to commence. Medicine Hat is a place excellently suited for the work, being within reach of several large Indian reserves, having abundant water and coal supply. I trust you may have every success in raising the money.\"\n\nAt the present time, December, 1884, we have $1500 on hand, towards the Medicine Hat Home; and the people of Medicine Hat have promised subscriptions to the amount of $2500.\n\nIn order to secure a Government grant we ought to make a good start ourselves, and we trust that many of our friends will come liberally to our aid.\n\n**MORE HELP NEEDED**\n\nWe earnestly pray that Almighty God will put it into the hearts of His people to aid us abundantly in carrying all these plans, for the benefit of the Indian Race, into effect. Our motto from the first has been\u2014\"A Work that is of God cannot be overthrown.\" Sunday Schools can very materially aid us by adopting an Indian child in one or other of our Institutions, and paying $3 (or if clothing is sent, $5) annually, towards its support.

We have judged it prudent to reduce the number of our pupils or staff at the Shingwauk and Wawanosh Homes during the winter months.\n\nI am in the meantime representing to our Board of Domestic & Foreign Missions the necessity of these homes for Indian children which have been established at Sault Ste. Marie - at Elkhorn - at Medicine Hat - and placed on a more satisfactory basis, and require their support.\n\nThe result is that steps are now being taken to form an \"Indian Auxiliary\" in connection with the Board of Domestic & Foreign Missions, having its local committees at various points in Ontario, Manitoba & North West. These will be such as I am convinced will be more adequately supported & better supervised.\n\nThe Department will I think be pleased to cooperate.\n\nIndian Affairs.

And I think the Department may see its way to provide for 100 pupils at New Wawanoak from the 1st July next at $60 each per annum instead of for $77 as at present.\n\nMy next step in the Build line will be to erect a new Wawanoak Home and laundry near to the Shipwreck & division of the present girls' building. This is not an inconvenient distance of three miles. (See plan part 2) \"The Hall\" (see fig.)\n\nAnd we have erected this summer will serve as well as a school room for 65 boys & girls.\n\nThe New Wawanoak Home should I think have accommodation for 50 girls and I hope the Department may make up a Building Fund.

(RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTWENTY-FOUR years ago there was erected on the Canadian banks of the St. Clair River, on the Indian Reserve three miles below Sarnia, an unpainteted little frame school house; it was painted red, and the whole cost was only about $400. That was the beginning of our work among the Indians. Since then, by God's blessing, we have been enabled to erect as many as forty buildings at an aggregate cost of about $40,000. Four hundred and seventeen Indian children have entered or passed through our schools. Those who came first are now out in the world, mostly of their own race and settled with families of their own. Two of our pupils now at the Shingwauk are studying for the medical degree.\n\nMany have heard of late who doubt the wisdom and necessity of expanding so much on the training of Indian children. They ask us, To what good is all? What becomes of our pupils after they leave here? Are they following the trades which we taught them? Are they doing well for themselves, among their own people? In reply we would say Yes; some of our pupils have become teachers\u2014others are now making their living by the trades which they have learned here, as is already known by our Superintendent, Mr. John Indian Department, who is now studying at St. John's College, Winnipeg, preparing for the ministry. We do not pretend that any large proportion of our pupils have made an independent start for themselves. By far the largest number we know are still living on the farms, or in small way, working in the fields, or on the land, or as deck hands on steamboats.\n\nThis will probably not seem satisfactory to our friends, who believe it their duty to encourage, but we must see reason why there are so few of our converts. The difficulties are not entirely on our side, and we must content ourselves with saying that while we are doing our best, there is a great deal of prejudice against Indians, and the Indians are themselves often unwilling to work. We must also consider that when we started out, when offered these difficulties, we knew to a great extent what was in store for us. In the State of Pennsylvania, numbers of children who have been educated at the Carlisle Indian School are now out living on farms, working for the white farmers, and the Indians are hoping before long a similar state of things may exist here. Several of our Wawanosh girls are already out in service, and others are expecting to get places early in the new year.\n\nOur work has been very active during the past year, and much increased during the year which has just closed. Our new Homes at Elkhorn have been opened. Improvements to property and additions to buildings have been made at the Shingwauk Home, and a site has been purchased in the far West for the establishment of a new Home in the Province of Alberta.\n\nWe cannot make too strong recommendations in connection with the work of the O.I.H., as it is being done by such hardworking people, who are willing to sacrifice everything for the cause of the Indians. We urge every one to read Our Indian Home, as it contains much that will interest and instruct.\n\nTHE SHINGWAUK HOME\n\nThe Government made us a grant of $2,500 last spring, and this, with other contributions, has been expended as follows:\n\nWe began by putting up a new comfortable little stone cottage for the accommodation of our newly engaged Missionary of factory and ox-packer, with his family. It was necessary to clear a number of men and teams were busy grading and levelling the wide stretch of land between the Institution and the new building. This was satisfactorily completed, sown with grass, and a handsome little band-stand erected. Here the base-ball matches are played, and musical visitors come to sit under the trees in summer and listen to our brass band. Then we...\nmaking, and perhaps helped by harness-making. We also erected telegraph poles near the Shingwauk Hospital, Industrial and Factory are now all connected by telegraph. Besides being a convenience, it is also teaching the boys an employment which may some day be of use to them. The accompanying bird's-eye view of the Shingwauk shows at a glance what our improvements have been, and the sites also are marked for other important buildings, viz., the Building, where both boys and girls will go to school and have their meals in the \"Industrial Home,\" and a new Laundry. It may take three or four years to complete all these buildings. When all are in operation we hope to have accommodation for about one hundred and fifty students.\n\nOur Wawenak Home is at present sadly overcrowded. We have only beds for twenty-five girls, but have had to accommodate seven or eight more during the winter months. After Christmas two or three girls are going to be sent away, and thus the number will be reduced to suit the accommodations. Our happy thoughts about the Wawenak, especially interested in the fact that the girls' fingers are, with few exceptions, always busy employed. Each girl has learned to knit, and quite a lot of pairs of socks and mittens are very neatly knitted every week by the girls during their periods of leisure, each pair costing ten cents a pair. One girl does a great deal of knitting, and her work is excellent. She is also learning to sew, and is doing very well.\n\nThe Elk Horn Homes\n\nThe Homes at Elk Horn, near the Kawartha, for boys and the Wawenak Girls for girls, are now entirely completed and in full use. One hundred and forty acres of farm land also have been purchased some four miles from the Institution, and when the Spring opens, we hope, with Government assistance, to put up necessary buildings and commence farming operations. Mr. McKeever has proved himself a very efficient and painstaking Superintendent, and Mrs. and Miss Vala are doing all they\ncan to make the Elkhorn Homes a success; they have, however, difficulties to contend with from which we are comparatively free at the Shingwauk and Wawanoosh Homes, namely, the parents of the Indians who allow their children to run away, and many a time has there been a long and hard chase after runaways. The Indian children in the neighborhood of Elkhorn are many shades wilder than those which have been usually received at the Small St. Mary's Homes, and it seems almost impossible to impress upon\n\nit has cost us $378 during the year going after and getting in our pupils, and no mention of any, and he has been unable to procure sufficient teachers. Lord Stanley, and his staff did not have to pay our Elkhorn schools a visit on the occasion of his late tour in the West.\n\nOF R. FINANCE.\n\nOur finances at this present time are sufficiently low to cause us a little uneasiness. We had hoped to begin the year with a small balance; but no, taking into account the balance deficit last year and the unprofitable Government grant to put against it, and the balance deficit this year and the deficit this year, we find ourselves in a very bad position. Our expenses have increased greatly, and the general wants of the school have not increased proportionately. We must hope, however, for the best, and believe that He, who has helped us so far, will continue to work with us and send us the means and the proper friends to help us. No fear from giving in or closing down any part of our work, we are looking forward to still further extension this next summer. Already has the band of friends been enlarged by the addition of Mr. James Hat, government has been applied for a grant, and the answer so far is favorable.\n\nMedicine Hat is an excellent location\u2014supported by the Department, favored by the Bishop\u2014and is in every contingency to meet the large Indian Reserve, on which it is located, the people of the town and the Indians.\n\nWe trust that our friends will now come to our aid and help us in the erection of this new institution at Medicine Hat\u2014also that many new Sunday schools may be induced to take up our work and aid us by adopting and providing for an Indian child in one or other of our schools.\n\nList of Pupils at the Shingwauk, Wawanoosh and Washakie Homes during the year 1889.\n\n1. David Oakes was working at the Shingwauk till towards end of January, when he went to Ottawa to enter on his duties as clerk in the Indian Department.\n\n2. Anna Johnson was sick during the latter part of the winter, and in May (1889) was sent to his home, where after lingering for some time he died.\n\nHe was an earnest Christian boy.\n\n3. Edward Williams went to his home in October, and is yet coming back.\n\n4. Peter Oakes was away all winter on account of sickness. He came back to us for a few months during the summer, but returned to his home in the fall.\n\n5. Anna Scoltchin was very sickly last winter and spring, so we sent him home in the summer, and advised him to remain at home for a year.\n\n6. Isaac Simpson did not return to us after the summer holidays. His father was very sick, and had to give up farming.\n\n7. Peter Stone: Poor little Peter was very ill with a relapsing complaint all the winter, and was well nursed in the hospital by our good friend, Miss Pegler, who visited the Reformatory several times.\n\n8. Peter Nezna: This is the naughty boy who tried to set the Shingwauk Home on fire Sept. 12th. He has been sent to the Reformatory.\n\n9. Francis Baker was ill at his home with typhoid fever when school opened in 1889. August, so could not come back. We have not heard whether he recovered.\n\n10. Charlie Baker did not come back after the holidays because his brother Francis was sick, and has not yet returned to school.\n\n11. James Smith was sick a great part of the winter with pulmonary complaint, and when spring came we sent him to his home. We hear that he is somewhat better, and wants to come back to the Shingwauk.\n### OUR INDIAN HOMES MAINTENANCE FUND\n\n#### General Statement of Receipts and Expenditures, as last set in December 19\u2014\n\n| Item Description | Amount |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Contributions - England | $250.00 |\n| Indian Department grant | $100.00 |\n| Clothing and material | $10.00 |\n| Wood and posts sold | $10.00 |\n| Vegetables sold | $10.00 |\n| Pupil at St. John's Church | $10.00 |\n| Total Income | $380.00 |\n\n#### Payments\n\n| Item Description | Amount |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Local Superintendent salary & board | $100.00 |\n| Matron's salary and board | $100.00 |\n| Clothing and material | $10.00 |\n| Vegetables sold | $10.00 |\n| Laundry Shinguard | $10.00 |\n| Total Expenses | $220.00 |\n\n**Note:** There are balances due from the Indian Department on this account which will reduce the deficit to about $60.\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined and audited the books of the Indian Homes, and find the same to be correct to the statement above.\n\nI.

The patient was kept from his companions in the middle of the ward. The patient is also kept away in the hospital room. We have been twice successful in finding fires among our patients.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6211, file 469-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe river is 300 yards distant from the building site, and 500 yards distant from deep water at low tide, set back on rock. Down to it. We have tried wells, various ways in the building, but they have been unsatisfactory. The water being bad color and odor, so all our water supply is brought from the river by truck in summer, sleigh in winter.\n\nI have for sometime been contemplating a windmill at the water's edge to conduct water up to our building. It is a big job to get much done. To install the steam engine at our factory might be attended for this, but it would require no doubt considerable work.\n\nI think both ship yard & Newcastle are well provided for in the way of exit from the upper flat, as will be seen by looking at plan.\n\nHave strict rules about smoke being put in until past 6 carried quite away from the building.\n\nSmoking is forbidden inside, but not downstairs. At present we have no fireplaces at the Newcastle.\n\nDo special precautions against fire are taken, windows thrown out. Water barrels kept in the workshops & hospital. Nearly all the buildings are insured. I am to honor the fire insurance.\n\nEdward F. Wilson\n19th December 1870.\n\nMemorandum\n\nTo the Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Wilson's letter of the 15th instant shows that, so far as he is aware, there is no threat from the Shingwauk or Nawaweshik homes at present. The precautions taken by guard against loss of life by fire are sufficient, but it is considered that means additional to those employed should be adopted to preserve the children should an outbreak occur.\n\nFirstly, which seems to have fallen into disuse, is the curfew. There are two other dwellings in town, and that of summoning the boys by alarm to their beds at night and rising early they are taught to be neat and steady. Such a proper discipline can be relied on. The younger boys at Shingwauk and the girls at the Nawaweshik home should be taught to...\nThe corridors and stairs out of the building when an alarm of fire is given; this latter is a kind of drill to which much attention is paid in public schools in the United States, and proficiency in which has saved many lives.\n\nThe water supply seems to be very inadequate and measures should be taken by hydraulic ram or otherwise to force a constant supply of water into the building.\n\nSmoking in the workrooms, barns and stables should be prohibited; lights should not be used in those buildings more than is absolutely necessary, and the lights should never be uncovered lights.\n\nAdditional barrels and fire pails as indicated on the plans should be placed in the corridors and fire stations, and fire extinguishers should be added to the other means of preservation from fire.\nP.S.\n\nRev.

That the medical expenses of the school be defrayed by the Department, or a grant of $150 per annum be allowed the Shingwauk Home to cover cost of same, this sum having been the average yearly expenditure for medical expenses during the past five years.\n\n2. That the Department furnish the Shingwauk Home with school supplies.\n\n3. That a grant of $2500 be made to the Shingwauk Home for the building and equipment of an addition to the north wing of the main building.\n\nTo provide:\n\n1. Proper bathing and increased lavatory accommodation and clothing room.\n\n2. Two Staff bedrooms.\n\n3. Add Dormitory accommodation for ten more beds, which are all urgently needed.\n\nDeputy Supt.

Marie as at points in Manitoba where contract schools are in receipt of nearly double the amount of our per capita grant allowance, and the fact that the Department has never paid off any deficit for the Shingwauk Home as it has done for other schools, that our present accommodation is taxed to its utmost capacity and that we are unable to admit pupils constantly applying for admission were matters laid before you, and discussed with you on the 16th inst., and I need not further comment thereon, except to point out that the concessions asked for would materially tend to reduce our present large and increasing deficit of nearly $800, and would provide better facilities for the carrying out of the work.\n\nThinking you on behalf of His Lordship, the Bishop of Algoma and the Homes' Committee for the courteous interview granted the Committee on the 16th inst., and gratefully appreciating your promise to give these urgent and important matters your favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nWith reference to the letter hereunder from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, I beg to say:\n\n1. No medical expenses are paid by the Department at any of the four industrial schools in Ontario, though such expenses are borne by the Department in Quebec and the North-west Territories.\n\n2. The only industrial school in Ontario receiving school supplies is that at Wikwemikong, and this matter arose through the fact that supplies were first given for the day pupils at this school in the same manner as they are given to day schools, before supplies are permitted to the industrial schools in Wikwemikong and the N.W.T.\n\n3. A similar grant of $2500 for improvements in the Shingwauk Home was made under authority of Order-in-Council of the 13th July 1895.\nAccountant,\n\nWill you have read paragraph 2 of the memo.
