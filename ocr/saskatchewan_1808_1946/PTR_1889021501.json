Mr. Macdonald.\n\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1889.\n\nOUR NORTHERN INDIANS.\n\nMr. Dewdney gives constant evidence of the wisdom of Sir John Macdonald in appointing him to the important position he now occupies. Both as Minister of the Interior and as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, he has appeared to be guided by the wishes and requirements of the people of the Northwest. He has acted very promptly with regard to the Northern Indians of this District and we have reason to believe that they will be treated justly and fairly by the Government; but we would point out to the latter that most of those Indians have belonged inside of what is known as the ceded territory ever since 1876, and are consequently entitled to all the privileges there since that date, and the money should be paid to them whether they demand it or not. If they do not ask for it, it is only because they are ignorant of what they are entitled to. Another matter to which we would direct the attention of the Minister is the limits of the treaty which is now being made. We are informed that it is not intended to extinguish the Indians or Half-breed title to the lands covered by the provincial district of Saskatchewan. This is a mistake. There are in this district and elsewhere in the Territories and Manitoba large numbers of half-breeds who are entitled to scrip, but cannot get it, because the tribe to whom they were residents of that Territory extending north of Saskatchewan as far as Isola Cross. In most cases that was only temporarily their residence. These claims should be dealt with at once. There will still be a great number until a settlement of all such claims is effected, and we see no reason why it should not be made.\n\nIt would not be necessary to take in a very great extent of territory in order to settle all the claims and the expense in doing so would not be great, as there are very few Indians within that district.\n\nThe following is taken from the Winnipeg Sun\u2014\n\nOTTAWA, Feb. 2.\u2014Mardoull, member of Saskatchewan, informs me that the Indians are anxious to make arrangements with the Papage company as would secure the building of the Red River Line of the Canadian Pacific during the summer. The road is to be built and the Saskatchewan bridge before the end of June. The line is ninety miles to build the following year to Prince Albert. Mr. Mardoull is much anxious about the construction of the road. He is urging the Government to establish a post at Prince Albert.\n\nRED DEER HILL.\n\nA meeting to consider the advisability of forming this vicinity into a statutory labor district was held at the school house and was well attended.
