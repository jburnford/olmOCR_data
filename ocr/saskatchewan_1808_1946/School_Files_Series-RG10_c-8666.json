These two children\nare now at Sandy Bay School and allotted numbers 355 & 0398.\nThe application is now being submitted for their\nadmission to Sandy Bay School.\n\nI would suggest these two principals be contacted\nfrom a higher level in the Department than myself, and informed the\npractice of admitting or transferring pupils without authority from\nOttawa should cease immediately.\n\nYou might also note that the Physical Examination\nhas been conducted by the Registered Nurse at the School, not a\ndoctor.\n\nJ.H.

J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res. School,\nMarius, Man.,\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that arrangements had been made to transfer the two Houle children from the Sandy Bay to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School without authority from the local Indian Superintendent.\n\nIn order to maintain friendly relations with the local Indian Superintendent, it is only fair to arrange these matters through his office. This procedure will not hamper the arrangement in any way but will lead to mutual good will.\n\nWhen recruiting children for the first time you should also consult the local Indian Superintendent in each case in order that he may approach the Department for authority to admit the children as grant-earning pupils.\n\nWe have had complaints from local Superintendents that children are brought to the school first and later the Superintendent is asked to recommend the approval of the admission. This is hardly fair to the Superintendent concerned as he is responsible for all the children in his Superintendency.\nand there may be cases that he knows about where children need institutional care more than the children picked out by the Missionary.\n\nPlease bear this in mind for future transfers and admissions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 1, 1951\n\nMr. J.H. Staunton,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Man.,\n\nWith reference to a letter dated October 29 from Regional Supervisor R.S. Davis, the Department approves the transfer of pupils O280 Bernice Houle and O281 Irene Houle from the Sandy Bay to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are also writing Father Lambert instructing him that no transfer of pupils should be carried out without approval from your office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School\nMarion P.O. - Man. November 10 1951\n\nMister Philip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Mister Phelan:\n\nYour letter of November I last (your file 584-10) seems to indicate that you have been misinformed concerning the transfer of the two Houle children from this school.\n\nIt has always been my policy to follow the proper channels in such matters and I want to state that concerning the transfer of the children in question I have duly put an application with Mister Staunton in Dauphin who, to the best of my knowledge has forwarded it to Mister Davis who, in turn, has or should have transferred it to you in Ottawa.\n\nFurthermore, the application I sent in was to the effect that the said children be transferred to the Roman Catholic school at Kenora, Ontario, and not to the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, as you have been informed. Whoever has stated that to you certainly was misinformed himself because I cannot see how he could confuse those two institutions.\n\nThe application for the transfer of those two children was made in due time, before the school term and it should have been in your office before the opening of the classes. By all means, I can assure you that I did to the best of my knowledge and that I still feel that I have followed the proper channels.\n\nTrusting that this will clarify the question, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

We have checked our records and find that he was admitted to the Brandon school in September 1943 as the application for admission at that time read the religious denomination to be Protestant.\n\nPlease advise under what circumstances you recommended the admission of this boy to the Sandy Bay school which is Roman Catholic and what evidence you have to show that this boy is a Roman Catholic as indicated on the application for admission.\n\nWith reference to Roy Francis, the application form you signed indicates the religious denomination to be Roman Catholic and that this boy has previously attended the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School. We have reviewed our records but fail to find his name on the Portage la Prairie Return for the past six years.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise when he attended the Portage la Prairie school and if he actually\nattended this school which is United Church, when the parents changed their religious denomination as the application received indicates the religious denomination to be Roman Catholic.\n\nAs the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of the two children mentioned above, please advise the Principal of the school that these children should not be admitted to this school until a decision is reached on their applications and if they are at school they should be discharged immediately and returned to their parents.\n\nAttached I am forwarding a copy of a letter sent to Father Lambert in connection with Gilbert Meeches.\n\nWith reference to the applications for Selma and Viola Hazel Francis, it is presumed that these girls are sisters of Roy Francis mentioned above, consequently their admissions are denied until such time as the religious denomination of this family is clarified.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure\n\nMFT/HM\nApril 5, 1952.\n\nMr. J.H.

I received a copy of a Certificate of Baptism from Father Lambert who has signed as Pastor of the Notre Dame des Suffrages Church, which shows Gilbert to have been baptised as a Roman Catholic on August 3rd, 1943 at the Long Plain Indian Reserve by Rev. Jean Lambert, O.M.I.\n\nRoy, Selma and Viola Hamel Francis:\nThe following are the pertinent facts. When the application was received in this office on March 20th and originally dated January 3rd, I contacted the father, Donald Francis who lives in MacGregor. He advised me to the effect that his wife, Eva, No. 159 of the Long Plain Band, was Roman Catholic and upon further inquiries through the Principal of the Sandy Bay School, I received copies of the Certificates of Baptism as follows:\n\nViola Hazel Francis: Baptised at the Notre Dame des Suffrages Church on January 3rd, 1952 at Sandy Bay, signed by Rev. J. Lambert, O.M.I.\n\nRoy Francis: Certificate of Baptism from the same church as noted above showing the child as being baptised on January 3rd, 1952 at Sandy Bay by Rev. J. Lambert, O.M.I. I have checked with the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Indian Residential School and find that Roy attended this school from January 9th, 1949 to September, 1950 and was discharged from the school because of the fact that his father, Donald Francis was living at MacGregor and had secured permanent employment and tuition fees was paid to the MacGregor day school for Roy's attendance.\nFrom conversations I have had with this boy's father, it would not appear that Donald had ever changed his religion, but he advises me that his wife has always been a Roman Catholic as outlined in my para 3.\n\nViola Selma Francis: A copy of the Certificate of Baptism for the same church showing this girl as being baptised on January 3rd, 1952 at Sandy Bay by Rev. Jean Lambert, O.M.I. has been submitted to this office.\n\nMy reason for recommending the admission of the three Francis children was that there is no doubt that their home conditions are not of the best, however, I did advise the principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School to the effect that any admissions must be made after approval of the Department. In these particular instances, the children have been in the Sandy Bay School since January 3rd without the knowledge of this office. The mother, Eva Francis, has received Family Allowances for the children which, of course, has resulted in an overpayment and this amount will have to be recovered.\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in your letter, I have contacted Father Lambert by telephone and he has advised that as they are now at home following the Easter recess, they would remain at home until the matter has been completely clarified.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJR/eb\n\nSuperintendent.\nMay 8, 1952.\n\nMr. J.

Staunton,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Man.\n\nThe Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School in preparing the June Quarterly Return has neglected to forward Form I.A. 411 which should accompany the Quarterly Return when forwarding it to this office.\n\nFor pupils 363 and 364 the Principal has claimed 56 days grant while he has shown that they were admitted to the school on May 15, 1952. It will be noted that the school is entitled to 46 days grant for each of the two pupils. We have amended this on the Return.\n\nFor pupil 0290 the Principal has claimed 66 days grant and has indicated that she left for Selkirk San on May 31. From this information it is impossible to know how the Principal arrived at the figure 66 as if the pupil was in residence continuously from April 1 to May 31 this would add up to 61 days. It is evident, therefore, that the pupil left for the sanatorium later than May 31st; however, as school is entitled to thirty days hospital grant in such cases, we have allowed 91 days grant for this pupil. Please ascertain from the Principal the exact date when this girl left for the sanatorium.\n\nThe Principal has also claimed 66 days for pupil 0309. The information is identical to pupil 0290. We have allowed 91 days for this pupil also. It will be necessary for you to secure same information as for pupil 0290.\nThe Principal has dropped O382 with no apparent reason. Please advise him that this practice is not correct as each pupil discharged and dropped from the Return must be shown on Form I.A. 411 and authority for discharge secured.\n\nThe Principal has claimed 26 days grant for pupils O409 and O410 and has indicated that they were admitted to school on May 15th. It is presumed that these pupils were either truant or were admitted to the school later than indicated by the Principal. As we are anxious to have the Return paid as soon as possible, we are disallowing any Per Capita Grant for the two pupils. It will be in order for the Principal to include them on the September Return indicating the dates they were admitted to the school and the period of their truancy if they were truant.\n\nPlease impress on the Principal the necessity of taking great care in preparing the Quarterly Returns. These Returns are checked by the Treasury Branch and the Auditor-General's office and the information must be definitely shown on all absences, giving the number of days the pupils were in residence.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6279)\n\nFile 584-10, part 3\nPortage la Prairie Agency - Sandy Bay Residential School - Roman Catholic - Admissions & Discharges, 1943 - 1948\n\nFile 584-10, part 4\nDauphin Agency - Sandy Bay Residential School - Roman Catholic - Admissions & Discharges, 1948 - 1952\n\nFile 584-11, part 1\nPortage la Prairie Agency - Sandy Bay Residential School - Roman Catholic - General Administration - Vocational Training, 1939 - 1949\n\nFile 584-23, part 1\nPortage la Prairie Agency - Sandy Bay Residential School - Roman Catholic - Deaths of Pupils, 1937 - 1944\n\nFile 600-1, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Ahtahkakoop Day School - Church of England - General Administration (Photos), 1894 - 1935\n\nFile 600-1, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Ahtahkakoop Day School - Church of England - General Administration (Photos) - Salaries, 1937 - 1949\n\nFile 600-3, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Ahtahkakoop Day School - Church of England - Teachers' Salaries, 1913 - 1944\n\nFile 600-5, part 1\nCarlton Agency - Ahtahkakoop Day School - Church of England - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts, 1930 - 1938\n\nFile 600-5, part 2\nCarlton Agency - Ahtahkakoop Day School - Church of England - Building Maintenance, 1938 - 1949\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School\n\nMarius, Man., May 29th, 1939.\n\nJ.

An instructor could be obtained, which we cannot do actually as we are financially handicapped. The work of this instructor will consist in teaching the women to sew, knit, weave and all other handicrafts.\n\nA lot of relief is given actually to the Indians and they dispose of it to their detriment. Under one supervision this could be done away with and would entail quite an economy to the Department, so would appreciate in knowing if the Department could see its way clear in granting a special grant towards this purpose.\n\nThe writer would indeed be very pleased to take this matter further personally upon interview and explain in detail the full details of this movement which is already creating a lot of good on the reserve.\n\nRespectfully submitted by,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Comeau, Principal of the Sandy Bay residential school, enclosed therewith.\n\nThe request contained in the Principal's letter was brought to the attention of the Department a few weeks ago by Father Plourde. At that time the officials were sympathetically disposed to the appointment of a social worker at Sandy Bay. In view of the new conditions now confronting us, however, it is not at all likely that such an appointment would be even seriously considered. In this period of national crisis it will be the duty of Indian Agents and Principals of Indian day and residential schools to co-operate with the Department in keeping all expenditures down to the lowest possible figure. A rapid advance in the price of certain basic commodities and the limited appropriations at our disposal have created a very embarrassing condition for those charged with the responsibility of administering schools and Indian relief. I feel confident, however, that the members of our field force will do all they possibly can to assist us during this critical period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSandy Bay R. #11/26-9-11\n\nSandy Bay, Man.\nDec. 1st, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have had during the last month the visit of the Public School Inspector, Mr. McKenzie. He suggested that the boys should be trained in more extensive manual labor especially trades, in which our Indian Boys might later on make their way in life. He suggested woodwork and woodcraft, shoemaking, for a beginning.\n\nHe directed us to Mr. P.J. Johnstone, Director of Technical Education, Dept. of Education in Winnipeg. The answer from the Technical Bureau was that the Dept. of Education does not provide funds for\nequipment for this undertaking.\n\nI wonder if the Indian Department at Ottawa could not be of help in this matter.\n\nFor a small workshop, hammers, saws, coping saw, planes, bench vise, chisel, bit brace etc. are needed.\n\nFor woodcraft, the Hobbs fretwork outfit and a pedal jigsaw for fretwork would be required.\n\nFor the Shoemaker's shop, a sewing machine for shoes, iron foot stands and stool would be of immediate necessity.\n\nThe Indian Boys here like to do these small works. From past experience, with just one small saw and a hammer, they managed to make pretty bird houses, but they lack material and experience. We come with the other.\n\nI am inclined to believe that\nsuch equipment might prove of great help to the School Program and to the boys themselves.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon, I am yours very truly,\n\nLeon Savine,\nBoys' Supervisor\nSandy Bay Indian Res. School\nMarina P.O., Man.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Leon Savoie in connection with the vocational work at the Sandy Bay Indian residential school. He mentions two activities which the Department is inclined to assist at the present time:\n\n1. For a small workshop -- hammer, saws, coping saw, planes, bench vise, chisels, bit brace etc. are needed.\n\n2. For woodcraft -- the Hobbies Fretwork outfit and a pedal jigsaw for fretwork would be required.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the articles you require for the workshop and the woodcraft.\n\nMr. Savoie also suggests equipment for a shoemaker's shop. This machinery is expensive and the Department is not prepared to consider supplying it at the present time. As a matter of fact it is doubtful if it is worth while encouraging pupils to learn shoe repairing as it is unlikely that they would have an opportunity of earning their living by doing such work after they leave school. A more practical trade to encourage would be automechanics. It might be possible for you to obtain an old automobile engine without heavy expense and some preliminary training could be given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. O.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast October, when visiting the School here, you have asked me to write to you about our Social Welfare Club established in this School for the Indians of the Reserve. I have written to you on Dec. 11, 1939, mentioning the material needed for the good operation of this club. My letter has yet remained unanswered, and the club has remained on a standstill on account of lack of material.\n\nI had mentioned at the time that the things most needed were:\n\n1. 60 inches wide loom with accessories.\n2. Material to make blankets for old Indians.\n3. 100 lbs of knitted wool.\n4. Raw wool for spinning.\n\nIf you would add to that, material for sewing and knitting, our Social Welfare Teacher will give her services free for this year.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon, I remain Yours Truly,\n\nRev. C. E. Comeau O.M.I.,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, P.O., Man.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your recent letter regarding the Social Welfare Club established at the Sandy Bay School for the benefit of the Indians of the Sandy Bay Reserve.\n\nI realize that what you have in mind is a very desirable activity but unfortunately many worth-while projects have to be abandoned at the present time due to the fact that it is impossible to secure funds for their successful prosecution.\n\nI feel it is unnecessary for me to point out to you that until the war is concluded there is no likelihood of our securing increased appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C. E. Comeau, O.M.I.,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nMr. H.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa Canada,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast October, when visiting our School, you asked me to write to you about our Social & Welfare Club established at the Sandy-Bay School for the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nYou told me then to mention the material needed for the good operation of this Club.\n\nThe most needed apparatus for the moment, is a 60 inches wide loom with accessories. We need also material for the making of blankets for the old Indians; about a hundred pounds of knitted wool, also raw wool for spinning; few hundred pounds.\n\nIf you would add to that material for sewing and knitting our social & welfare teacher will give her services free for this year, and we may also organize work for the Red-Cross.\n\nHoping you will consider this request favorably, I remain yours very truly: Rev. C.E. Comeau O.M.I.\n\nRev. C.E. Comeau O.M.I.\nIndian Missionary\nalso Pastor.\nMiss Ferguson,\n\nRequest a 60\" brown woolen blanket from without frame, would you suggest purchase?\n\nP.P.\n\n5/4/40\nThere are only two firms I know of from whom foot-power looms such as we have at Caughnawaga can be purchased: Romeo Savoie, Joliette, Quebec; and Omer Leclerc, L'Islet, Quebec. The size mentioned in the attached letter, 60\", is unusual, as 30\", 45\" and 90\" looms are the sizes usually made. The price runs about $1.00 per inch and it is necessary to specify that heddles are to be included and the size of reed desired. We have found a reed \"15 to the inch\" can be used for all general purposes. In setting up a weaving room a large spool rack, a warping beam, a croisse, and at least one bobbin winder will be needed. I should think everything except the bobbin winder could be made in a manual training room if the school has a good manual training teacher. Otherwise the cost will be considerable as a large spool rack costs about $5.00 and the other two articles from $8.00 to $15.00 each. A bobbin winder can be bought from the Canadian Handicraft Guild, 2025 Peel Street, Montreal for approximately $2.00.\n\nSome time ago we had to pay about 90\u00a2 a pound for home spun yarn for blankets and one blanket weighing four pounds therefore cost $3.60 without taking into consideration the value of labour. The price of yarn of course increased since that date. It might be advisable for a new group to start with cotton warp for dish towelling etc. We use unbleached cotton warp size 2/8, which costs about 60\u00a2 a pound in ten-pound lots.\n\nHandicraft Section.\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Leon Savoie in connection with the vocational work at the Sandy Bay Indian residential school. He mentions two activities which the Department is inclined to assist at the present time:\n\n1. For a small workshop -- hammer, saws, coping saw, planes, bench vise, chisels, bit brace etc. are needed.\n\n2. For woodcraft -- the Hobbies Fretwork outfit and a pedal jigsaw for fretwork would be required.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the articles you require for the workshop and the woodcraft.\n\nMr. Savoie also suggests equipment for a shoemaker's shop. This machinery is expensive and the Department is not prepared to consider supplying it at the present time. As a matter of fact it is doubtful if it is worth while encouraging pupils to learn shoe repairing as it is unlikely that they would have an opportunity of earning their living by doing such work after they leave school. A more practical trade to encourage would be automechanics. It might be possible for you to obtain an old automobile engine without heavy expense and some preliminary training could be given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. O.

Sirs:\n\nWe have your request for manual training equipment. From your list it is rather difficult to know the quantity of paint required. You may, however, expend an amount not to exceed $15.00 for the above required material.\n\nIn looking over the list of tools which you have on hand we believe that you have a sufficient number to permit you to give more advanced manual training to your students. Fret work gives a certain amount of training, and is an excellent activity for junior pupils, but it will not give the older pupils any training in the use of hand tools, which is so important for their future welfare.\n\nThe Department would like to see our Indian students given a training that will help them after they have left school. If you should require a course of study in this line, as well as suggestions in carrying it out, the Department is ready to furnish these on request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res. School,\nMarius, Man.\nI wish also to remind you that you have given us a sum of $15.00 to buy lumber, paints tools etc. for Fretwork and carpentry.

Sir:\n\nOn reading over the Special Report which you sent in, I notice that this school has a shop 60 feet long by 28 feet wide. As the Department is very anxious to give the boys training in manual work, I wondered for what kind of work these shops were equipped.\n\nOn reading over your tool list for woodworking, I notice that the tools you have on hand would not be sufficient to give the boys adequate training.\n\nWould you have, on your staff, anybody who could give instruction in a simple course in woodwork? If so, the Department is ready to assist you as much as possible under the present strained conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G.

PHILIP PHELAN.\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur 60 by 28 work shop is used for general repairs. It is equipped with some tools used by tinsmiths, carpenters, pipe fitters, plumbers, electricians, and blacksmiths.\n\nI have asked Father Provincial for somebody who could give instructions in woodwork. For the present he has nobody, but as soon as he finds one I will let you know.\n\nIt is true I have a carpenter, but he is a very quick tempered man, and will not get along very well with boys.\n\nOn your letter Sep. 9th 1941, you have authorized me to buy for $15.00 worth of Fretwork material. I have sent an order to Hobbies Limited, 54 Wellington Street West Toronto. So far I have received nothing. May I send the order again?\n\nFollowing is a list of material ordered:\n\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| The Log Cabin No 1787                     |          | $3.05 |\n| 2 Plant Table Design.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant and note the list of materials which you have ordered. I imagine that it will be rather difficult for Hobbies Limited to supply your order. I think that the pupils would get much more useful training if they were to design their own cut-outs in this fret saw activity. You may, however, check up on this order if you wish.\n\nWe are prepared to furnish you with a course to be followed in woodwork, along with reference books, plans, and the procedure to be followed in doing this work, the moment you have a man able to give instruction along these lines. I noticed in the second paragraph of your letter that you will let us know as soon as you have one. At that time, we will be prepared to proceed and give you the help above mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. O.

This is a valuable training for the girls. The three weaving looms are in use and already they have finished some very excellent pieces of material.

He reports very favourably on the work that is being done in the sewing room and the weaving room.\n\nHe further states that manual training is being taught by one of the Sisters, but that the supply of tools is limited. I should appreciate it if you would let me know what special qualifications the Sister who is in charge of the manual training room has for this particular work. You might also let me know what additional tools she considers she could use to advantage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

Hoey,\n\nReally I am pleased to see that you are greatly satisfied with what we are doing and trying to achieve with our Indian children specially mentioned in the sewing-room and in the weaving room. It is surely a great encouragement for me. I am trying also to have the older girls, even women from the Reserve to come and learn and work at weaving looms. It will be without any doubt a slow organization but hope to bring it to success. Later I will let you know if there are any results.\n\nIf it ever happens when coming into the West, you have a few days at your disposal, to come and visit our Sandy Bay School. I would be greatly pleased, and also it would stimulate our enthusiasm towards the educational welfare of our Indians.\n\nYou are inquiring about the qualifications of our Sister Supervisor of the boys. Well, the Sister has really no special qualification for manual training, but only a natural gift well developed in her. And, I believe, having tools, she could train the boys to a certain extent, but now at present, it is practically impossible having not even the most necessary ones.\n\nAccording to your request you will find attached to this letter a list of tools that I have made with the Sister in Charge of the boys.\n\nWhat I find also very important for the future of this Reserve is the compulsory education. It might be somehow difficult and hard to break in the parents towards it, but it has to come if we wish to build up any future hopes for this Reservation. I believe, forty children or more, of school-age, on the Reserve, to whom the parents are refusing education... and also what else... It is too bad! There is lot of room in School for them all, and more yet.\n\nMy little Scout Troop is still progressing, and my Indian boys are yet enthusiastic about it. It does them good! I am planning for the Girl Guides, but cannot get any answer from the headquater in Winnipeg...\n\nOnce more, many thanks for your kind letter and cooperation in the educational welfare of our dear Indians, and hope that I will give you always satisfaction in my educational work amongst Indians.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nFather J.

He is good in electrical work. He is at the school now.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have just received Inspector MacKenzie's report regarding his visit to the Sandy Bay School on the 18th instant. He mentions that Brother Bruyere is now a member of the staff and under these circumstances it is hoped that the vocational programme for the boys, about which you have already been supplied with complete information, will be put into effect. If any further suggestions are required, please let me know.\n\nIf you need materials for the vocational training class, a requisition should be forwarded. Our file shows that we have already supplied you with sufficient tools to have this work started.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nReceived your letter regarding Inspector MacKenzie's report.\n\nWish to thank you for your kind consideration towards our start of vocational programme.\n\nIn fact, we endeavor, right now, to give the preliminary hints to our boys concerning blacksmithing, carpentry and farming.\n\nLater, we shall be in need of materials for the vocational training class. We shall then forward the requisition. For the meantime, we have in hand the necessary equipment.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nFather Jean Lambert\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSandy Bay Indian School,\nMarius P.O., Man.\nFeb. 9, 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur boys, due the wise and expert guidance of Brother Bruyere, are progressing more than expectation concerning the vocational programme for carpentry & blacksmith.\n\nHere is a list of materials needed:\n\nI set wood bits\n\nI brace\n\n4 - 2\" x 10\" x 12' No 1 Western fir 60 bd ft\n\n6 - 2\" x 10\" x 12' Com. pine No I 170\n\n4 - 2\" x 10\" x 12' Com. spruce No I 80\n\n200 ft. 1\" x 4\" x 12' spruce flooring No I\n\n200 ft. 1\" x 12\" x 12' No I spruce\n\n100 ft. 3/4\" x 3/4\" x 12' 1/4 round fir\n\n100 ft. 3/4\" x 3/4\" x 12' cove\n\n200 ft. 1\" x 4\" x 12' fir ceiling\n\nHinges 2 doz. narrow tight pin butts 1/8 x 1 7/16\n\n1 doz. safety Hasps 3 inch. long\n\n1 doz. padlocks\n\nMasonite 3/16 2-4\" x 6\"\nI think, there is no doubt, we can count at least, a relative success.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nFr. Jean Lambertoni\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 13, 1945.\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to materials which you state are needed for the vocational program.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter of December 20, 1944, it was stated that if materials for the vocational training class were required we would be prepared to favourably consider supplying them. However, from the materials requested in your letter of the 9th instant it is evident that you intend to erect a building. On reviewing our last quarterly return, it is noted that there are only 24 boys in the school who are over 12 years of age. I was wondering if in the erection of a building they would receive any actual benefit, in view of the fact that all of them are comparatively young. I would appreciate hearing further from you regarding your plans. With regard to the spruce and fir ceiling, you should let me know if the quantity requested is board feet or lineal feet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Manitoba.\nSandy Bay Indian School,\nMarius P.O., Man.\nFebruary 19, 1945\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe requisition made for our vocational training class may appear extravagant. In fact, I should have given more details and explanations on my last letter.\n\nThe said material is to build the following articles:\n\nwashing stands,\ndrawers,\ncupboards,\nbenches,\ndesks,\ntables and many other useful articles for Indian homes.\n\nThe fir and spruce ceiling are square feet.

You should receive it in a short time.\n\nIn our estimates for next year, money has been put aside for the purchase of projectors. We have started with a certain number with the intention of increasing that number as circumstances permit. It has not yet been decided which schools will receive them. This will be done at a later date.\n\nA special letter was sent some time ago to the Reverend Provincial re Manual Training instructors. You will very probably hear from him if you have not already done so.\n\nShould there be any other information you desire, please let me know.\n\nA.J.

May you and your happy family feel as much happiness as you render others happy through your kind deeds.\n\nAs the department is eager to have the Indians interested in little industries, we also want to answer to their wish.\n\nLast June two of our scholars: ESTHER HOULE & MARTHA BEAU LIEU were discharged and both know weaving very well. Now Kind Mr Doucet you have promised to help us in this matter. Those girls have a home fair and large enough to put a loom etc. You could probably send us two looms 36\" and material to give them a start. As for the material it will stay at school. The teacher will control it as well as their different projects.\n\nMay I enclose a requisition for both.\n\nStill trusting in your generosity. I remain.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nFather J.

If you have not yet received these, it is probable that they are unable to deliver them. I am, however, writing to the company to see whether or not they have been shipped.

D'abord nous n'avons pas encore re\u00e7u les deux m\u00e9tiers\npour nos deux gradu\u00e9es de 1946: Martha Beaulieu et Esther Houle.\n\nVous le savez pour avoir visit\u00e9 nos \u00e9coles, que le\ntravail de pelure les patates prend un temps et un groupe d'enfants\nassez consid\u00e9rables. Ce genre de travail offre \u00e0 l'enfant tr\u00e8s peu\nde chance de formation et peut-m\u00eame avoir le r\u00e9sultat funeste de le\nd\u00e9go\u00fbter. Nous demandons donc par votre entremise une pelouse de\npatates, au D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes.\n\nNous signalerons \u00e9galement encore que nous aimerions\navoir quelque chose de d\u00e9finitif au sujet de la construction d'une\nboutique pour \"Vocational Training\".\n\nUn ma\u00eetre en menuiserie accepterait $1.25 de l'heure\net trois de nos post-gradu\u00e9s de la R\u00e9serve, travailleraient sous ses\nordres \u00e0 .40 sous de l'heure.

I understand that Mr. Doucet has already settled the case of Christopher Beaulieu.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May 22nd, we ordered the looms several months ago but they are not yet available. As soon as the company can supply them, they will be forwarded to you.\n\nI regret that the Department does not supply potato peelers.\n\nWe have no funds specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of manual training buildings at residential schools.

No. 1391 - $156.50\n\nThe above encumbrance was raised to cover goods ordered from Jules Clement, Saint Justin, Comte de Maskinonge, P.Q., as per Purchase Order No. 14857, dated November 18th, 1946.\n\nThe delivery of the goods was made twelve months later as per firm's invoice No. 315, dated November 17, 1947, at $205.94. The question of the increase of $11.26 on the cost of the goods has been explained by Mr. Clement as something like 10% over a period of one year which is not out of line with the increase on other commodities. The amount shown as Federal Tax computed at 5% is nominally the Government Sales Tax at $13.48 which the firm advise should be charged. This charge was discussed with officials of the Department of National Revenue who claim the charge is justified. The two cushions at 35\u00a2 each or a total of 70\u00a2, although not on our order is justified. The additional amount of $24.00 for express charges supported by C.N. Railway voucher should be honoured.\n\nTherefore, it is requested that an additional amount of $49.44 be provided in order that Jules Clement invoice mentioned above may be passed for payment.\n\nW.Ms Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo allowance towards salary of vocational P.T.\nat Sandy Bay Res.

No. 1391 - $156.50\n\nThe above encumbrance was raised to cover goods ordered from Jules Clement, Saint Justin, Comte de Maskinong\u00e9, P.Q., as per Purchase Order No. 24837, dated November 16th, 1946.\n\nThe delivery of the goods was made twelve months later as per firm's invoice No. 313, dated November 17, 1947, at $205.94. The question of the increase of $11.26 on the cost of the goods has been explained by Mr. Clement as something like 10% over a period of one year which is not out of line with the increase on other commodities. The amount shown as Federal Tax computed at 3% is nominally the Government Sales Tax at $13.48 which the firm advise should be charged. This charge was discussed with officials of the Department of National Revenue who claim the charge is justified. The two cushions at 3% each or a total of 70\u00a2, although not on our order is justified. The additional amount of $24.00 for express charges supported by C.N. Railway voucher should be honoured.\n\nTherefore, it is requested that an additional amount of $49.44 be provided in order that Jules Clement invoice mentioned above may be passed for payment.\n\nW.M.

We would prefer a loom from Nilus Leclerc Manufacture Quebec, since the girls here operate those which are perfect looms in my opinion. Mr. Jules Clement's looms are not so easy to operate, thus requiring more skill to work quickly.\n\nYou understand, Kind Mr. Doucet, that this plan of making bed spreads for 150 pupils is not a little job, and operating a perfect loom will lessen the task.\n\nCounting on your constant and sincere devotedness, I remain very gratefully yours,\n\nSister St. John Mary Vianney\nNovember 29, 1948.\n\nRev. J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Res., School,\nMarius, Manitoba.\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 12th instant, the Department is not prepared to place a 90\" loom in the school at present.\n\nThese looms require a great deal of space and more of a commercial type loom than the 45\" loom which may be used for instructional purposes. The handling of the 45\" loom is similar to the 90\" loom and requires the same manipulation. The Department, consequently, feels that all the educational value of the 90\" loom is contained in the 45\" one.\n\nA.J.

However, since I have been able to obtain a 90\" loom which I wish to dispose of, I am therefore sending you by freight the 90\" loom in the shape that it is transferred to us. It may be that some parts are missing. In that case you let me know what is missing and we will endeavour to furnish these parts. The loom will be sent from Muncey, Ontario to the Principal of the Sandy Bay School, Marius, Manitoba.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

The other part will have to be crated and the entire loom sent to the following address:\n\nThe Principal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\n\nPlease prepay the freight and submit vouchers for the freight and crating to this office for payment.\n\nThe above should be done as soon as possible as we are told that the Department of Health and Welfare is taking over Mrs. Lockwood's home.\n\nA.J.

The Department has not yet received the memorandum or enquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of this pupil.\n\nYou were instructed some time ago to inform the Principal that, when a pupil of a residential school dies, he should notify you at once.

In future, when a pupil dies at a residential school in your agency, you should see that the instructions, as stated on the form, are immediately complied with.\n\nPlease have the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School complete the form in the case of pupil No. 0148 and forward same to the Department, giving all the information requested.

Some months ago particular attention was paid to the schools in the southern part of the North Saskatchewan Inspectorate, and, with a view to extending the work, the situation as existing on the more northern reserves has been looked into and reported upon, and the Department now wishes to try to effect an improvement at the Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake Schools.\n\nYour Lordship will readily recognize as one of the first essentials to success the procuring of efficient and interested teachers, and to obtain and retain such the co-operation of the authorities of the church directly interested is much to be desired. This matter is, therefore, being brought direct to Your Lordship's attention with the hope that it will receive early consideration.\n\nThe Ahtahkakoop school is in charge of Mr. Louis Ahenakew, an Indian who attended Emmanuel College. The very poor enrolment and attendance at this school are evidences that there is something wrong in the management and the conclusion has been reached that the fault lies largely with the teacher. Mr. Ahenakew is reported to be\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nlacking in scholarship and energy and to take no interest in his work. During the six years he has been in charge of this school he has evidenced no desire to improve himself intellectually and thus better fit himself for his duties. The first step, therefore, is to procure the services of a qualified teacher who will devote all his or her energies to the work. It is considered that a married teacher, male or female, would be most suitable and to a competent person the Department would pay a salary of $500.00 per annum. If a male teacher could be secured, whose wife would be able and willing to take up nursing and field matron work on the reserve, a larger salary would be allowed.\n\nThe above remarks apply in a large measure to conditions at the Sturgeon Lake school and Mr. Crain should be replaced by an efficient teacher, to whom the same salary as that at the Ahtahkakoop school will be paid.\n\nThese changes may be made after the summer holidays and Mr. Ahenakew and Mr. Crain should be notified at once that their services will not be required after June 30th, next, and in the mean time the names of successors may be submitted to the Department for consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nBishopsthorpe\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 26, 1910\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to the above I am glad to hear that there is a chance of improved schools at Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake schools. I have seen Mr. Borthwick (Indian Agent) also on the subject. I quite realise the necessity of procuring efficient teachers. This will take time. I am looking out for them and no doubt shall have them by the time you are ready for them. It will take some time to put up proper buildings so I hope the Department will instruct their Agent to lose no time. I will notify Messrs. Ahenakew and C. Crane that they will not be needed after June 30th.\n\nWhat do you think of Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey for Ahtahkakoop Reserve, if I can induce them to accept? Mrs. Godfrey, as you know, has done splendid work; she could teach in the school, and Mr. Godfrey could assist her in the management and in gardening.\n\nfaithfully yours\n\nJ.M. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, April 4th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo asking whether in the event of your being able to induce Mrs. Godfrey to accept the position of teacher of the Ahtahkakoop day school the Department would agree to her appointment.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in case Mrs. Godfrey will not remain at the south Fort a la Corne school the Department will be pleased to engage her at Ahtahkakoop on the same terms as she was offered to remain at Fort a la Corne, viz.- $500.00 per annum.\n\nThe Department is making as to whether there is suitable accommodation for a teacher at Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake schools and, as soon as this information is received, Your Lordship will be further advised.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to official letters of March 3rd, last, in which you were asked to advise the teachers of the Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake schools that their services would not be required after June 30th, next.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department has under consideration the transfer of Mr. MacLeod, the farming instructor on the Big River Reserve, to either of the reserves above mentioned. In the event of this change being finally decided upon the services of Mrs. MacLeod would be available as teacher of the school. Excellent reports on her work at the Big River school have been received and presumably Your Lordship would have no objection to her appointment at Sturgeon Lake or Ahtahkakoop.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Farmers Labister and Campbell are each becoming settled in their positions, and will prove more useful this coming season than heretofore, especially Mr. Campbell, who is new to the work. Regarding the Sandy Lake school, the attendance under the new arrangements will be larger than I think Mrs. Macleod could do justice to; as I understand that she has not had the experience of a trained teacher. She possesses the teaching faculty, is well suited to her present school, and is calculated to succeed there. I am in hopes that the difficulty between Mr. Macleod and the Indians may be allayed, and, if so, I would prefer him to remain where he is rather than that either of the suggested changes should be made.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the suggestion of the Department that an exchange might be made between Mr. McLeod, farm instructor on the Big River reserve, and either Mr. Campbell at Ahtahkakoop or Mr. Isbister at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the explanations contained in your letter, this matter may be allowed to drop for the present.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the relations between Mr. McLeod and the Indians on the Reserve will permit of his being retained in his present position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos.

The Letter has been long in the work, & does fairly well. I only proposed Mr Reddie when I thought Letter was going to College. Letter has abandoned this idea, I don't think Mr Reddie better qualified to teach Indians, though probably better educated. I think Letter had better stay on at present. Should he wish to leave, I should be glad to nominate Mr Reddie.\n\nII/117332/1\n\nMrs. Geoffrey & Ahtahkakoop School.\n\nI understand that Mrs. Geoffrey has decided to stay, & where she is now, South Fort & to come, which I am glad. You have always approved her work, & I hope will give her generous treatment. So she will not be free for Ahtahkakoop's, which school I have omitted in my next paragraph.\n\nExtract on II/117332/1\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am truly astonished at your letter. I can not pretend to understand the J.D. You propose great anxiety to have improved day-schools, with artificial teachers, gardening, nursing, etc. You bid me dismiss a faithful & earnest teacher because incompetent, I ask me to secure a competent one. Then you write I ask me to accept a woman who has no such pretensions & skill, but who has (I believe) a desire for the welfare of the Indians, but certainly not more so than has Louis Sherriner. Moreover she, however excellent herself, I admire her for what little I have heard of her, is the wife of a farm-instructor whom you have dismissed because he treats the Indians like dogs, or slaves. You say you have \"excellent reports of her work\" - if so, it only shows how little you can rely on the testimony of your local officials! I have nothing against her. I dare say her work would be excellent if she had a chance. But I understand that the school has been but little open, & hardly any scholars, because the Indians are so much away, so she has had no ground upon which to build up a good report.\nWith regard to this matter then, in answer to your question as to whether I will appoint Mr. M. Lord, they say:\n\n1. Do you, or do you not, know of Mr. Lord's conduct? He is in many ways an active, diligent man, & has tried to make the Indians more diligent, etc. But he is rather crazy at times, or has a terrible temper. I have heard it very strongly prophesied that if you did not move him he would be attacked or assaulted by the Indians. He knocked me down with his gun not long ago, but the matter was hushed up. The Indians are terrified of him.\n\n2. He might possibly succeed at Striped Lake; he will never do so at Sandy Lake, but might be marred or murdered!\n\n3. The accuracy of the report from Mr. M. Lord's letters is more than doubtful\u2014I don't care whether it was Christian or Brotherick who sent it\u2014there has been no chance for him to prove his excellency.\n\n4. The whole recommendation savours of an easy way for the I.D. to remove an official who has rendered his position impossible, & let him down easy by securing a position for himself. It in no way agrees with the desire of the I.D. for \"improved day-schools.\"\n\nNow, my dear Sir, I write plainly & confidentially. I write\nin no hostility to the I.D., with all due respect for you, sir. But I do feel, as many of us feel, there is contention, that you do not hear the truth at all, that your local officials return partial reports, spare wrong-doers, give an unfair help to their friends, etc. I can only account for your action as to the Lord's wife by thinking that you have been misinformed.\n\nIt was just the same at the Pas when I reported against Mr. Fischer. The I.D. sent a investigator! The man was whitewashed & I was told I was mistaken. I am as sure of the truth of what I alleged as I am of my own name. And now Fischer is telling the Indians at the Pas, that we (the Church People) are blocking the way & preventing our building the promised Boarding School there! You know where the delay & hindrance comes. Mr. Fischer also told my missionary there that he had nothing against Mr. Lundie, & wished me to appoint him to Shoal Lake! I thought that Mr. Lundie question had been settled for good & all. If Fischer has nothing against him, I am sorry for Fischer's judgment.\n\nI am very much taken up so much of your time, but I do not regret me and the above\u2014\n\nJ.A. Saskatoon\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 11, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the Ahtahkakoop school I beg to say that, in view of the fact that the Department cannot see its way clear to undertake the erection of a teacher's dwelling on the reserve this year, Mr. Ahnakow may be allowed to retain his position as teacher for another year, if he so desires.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that, in view of the fact that the Department cannot see its way clear to undertake the erection of a teacher's dwelling on the Ahtahkakoop reserve this year, Mr. Ahenskew may be allowed to retain his position as teacher of that school for another year, if he so desires, and the Bishop of Saskatchewan has been so advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to Indian school matters in your Diocese.\n\nIn connection with the Sturgeon Lake school I beg to say that instructions have been given to have the school-house thoroughly repaired. These repairs call for an expenditure of close to $300.00 and, when completed, it is hoped that the building will be quite comfortable and much improved in appearance. As this expenditure is somewhat higher than was anticipated the matter of enlarging the teacher's residence will have to stand over till next year and in the meantime it is hoped that the present accommodation will suffice.\n\nThe contract for the erection of a teacher's residence and pupils' dining room on the John Smith's reserve was let sometime ago and the work is now under way. Any delay that occurred in proceeding with this work was unavoidable. The Department wished to erect a creditable building and had careful plans and specifications prepared. Following this tenders were called for, but all the details were attended to as promptly as was possible and the building should be ready for occupation by the Rev. Mr. McCausland and his family early in the autumn.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newman, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\nA change of teacher at the Ahtahkakoop school at an early date is no doubt most desirable, but, as in the case of the Sturgeon Lake school, repairs to the building in order to make it comfortable called for an outlay of $235.00 and funds are not available this year for the erection of a teacher's residence, owing to this fact it is deemed advisable to allow Mr. Ahonakew to remain in charge for at least another year.\n\nIt is noted that Your Lordship has in view a married man to take charge of the Sturgeon Lake school and the Department would like to know whether the present dwelling, which was erected by your Church, will provide temporary accommodation. As Your Lordship has already been advised a salary of $500.00 will be paid a teacher and, if his wife is competent and willing to take up field matron work among the Indians on the reserve, an additional grant will be made for her services. In the absence of fuller information, however, a definite amount cannot at present be decided upon.\n\nIn reference to accommodation for teachers on these two reserves I may say that the Superintendent of Indian Education contemplates visiting the Carlton Agency in the near future and while there he will make special inquiry with a view to having the necessary work undertaken early next year.\n\nMr. Northwick, the Indian Agent, has been written to in regard to Mr. Qeno's complaint that he has not been furnished with necessary supplies during the last year and it is hoped that there will be no further difficulty in this respect.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to assure Your Lordship that the improvement of day school conditions in your Diocese is\nearnestly desired, but as it is quite a large undertaking and as similar improvements in many other districts have at the same time to be considered progress must necessarily be comparatively slow. However, it is thought that a decided advance has been made during the past year and it is hoped that results next year will be even more satisfactory. In the meantime a communication from Your Lordship in reference to the qualifications of the teacher and his wife referred to above will be awaited.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to recommend by your advice & consideration Mr. H. Hutchinson, who will write to you. I think we shall be fortunate if we secure him as teacher for the improved day-school, Ahtahka kopt's Reserve next spring. He will tell you his qualifications & experience, a gentleman highly educated for many years a \"coach\", i.e., preparing young men for the University, &c., in legal, having taken a medical course, but not his M.D., taught Public School for some years in Man., under a Certificate, took charge of Church services & parish, was allowed by doctors to do a good deal of medical work in outlying parts, his wife is a nurse, little like the idea of teaching & helping the Indians.\n\nI think he can have a fair salary for both, to commence. I wish you could get the house built, & school enlarged, &c., as early as possible, according to our proposal in last fall, a house such as that for Mr. Waggott, or Mrs. Smith, &c., as well.\n\nI remain, yr faithfully,\n\nJ.H.

As to the salary, the Department will pay Mr. Hutchinson $600.00 per annum and his wife $300.00. As Your Lordship is aware these are the salaries paid on the John Smith's reserve.\n\nThe plans are being prepared for a teacher's residence and the work will commence as early in the spring as weather conditions will permit. I may say for Your Lordship's information that it is the intention to follow in a general way the plan of the residence on the John Smith's reserve in so far as the residence itself is concerned, but provision will be made for dormitories and recreation rooms in the annex.\n\nAs to the immediate engagement of Mr. Hutchinson the Department wishes to offer the suggestion, if practicable, that he take charge of the Sturgeon Lake School for a few months when the spring season opens until such time as proper accommodation can be provided at Ahtahkakoops.\n\nBuilding operations will also be undertaken at Sturgeon Lake, but the Department will give the erection of the Ahtahkakoops\n\nRight Rev.

The Church of England has a Mission House at Sturgeon Lake and the suggestion was made to His Lordship that you might take up work on the Sturgeon Lake reserve until such time as proper accommodation would be ready for you at Ahtahkakoops. No doubt the Bishop will communicate with you at an early date. In the meantime I may conclude by saying that the\n\nH. Hutchinson, Esq.,\nc/o C.P.R.

I may say that the Department is not aware of any appointment to the Sturgeon Lake School. His Lordship the Bishop had someone in view, but in the last communication received from him it was stated that no further word had been received from the prospective teacher. Any arrangements that will be mutually satisfactory to yourself and His Lordship for the summer months will be approved by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

In the 2nd you referred to this again, & also said you wished Mr. & Mrs. Gregory to take Sturgeon Lake later on. I would like to say that I fear it will be difficult & very inconvenient to Mr. Hutchison to follow this plan. First he has furniture to move, & it will be great cost & trouble (risk?) to move 1st to Sandy Lake, then to Sandy Lake (Makahkakopis). 2nd he will not be ready till May 1st. 3rd I fear he would find accommodation poor at Sturgeon Lake till the house is reconstructed, & more so if the new structure was in course. Could you not press on the Sandy Lake house so that he might go there early in May or June? I could keep him in work till then.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nYours faithfully,\nJ.M.

I may say that the Department is quite anxious to rush this work, but I would remind Your Lordship that plans and specifications in detail have to be obtained and then tenders have to be called for. Some considerable time must, therefore, elapse before any contract for this work can be awarded. For this reason it is utterly impossible to have the building ready for occupation early in May or even in June. The Department has several other buildings that it is proposed to erect in this northern country and in order that the best prices may be obtained it is desired to call for tenders for all about the same time.\n\nWith regard to the South Fort a la Corne school I may say that the Department has granted Mrs. Godfrey three month's leave of absence from May 10th, next, and it is proposed to leave the school closed until her return.\n\nIn regard to Your Lordship's query I may say that the Department has no proposal to make in regard to the Sturgeon Lake school. If Your Lordship is not in a position\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime it is not known that there is any vacancy, unless the temporary one at Sturgeon Lake. Should Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey eventually go to the place last mentioned there will, of course, at that time be a vacancy at Fort a la Corne.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI fear that there is a little confusion as to Sturgeon Lake & Sandy Lake appointments, owing to letters going to different persons, perhaps by my density. I would ask you to be kind enough to state as clearly as you can your wishes, & the plans at present proposed. I am only anxious to comply with them if we can. The confusion has partly to do with the Godfrey & Gentleman's appointment, & partly with Mr. Hutchison's. I would therefore ask you to be kind enough to tell me how the whole matter stands at present, & I will print tell you how I understand it from your previous letters. I gather that:\n\n1. The Godfrey will be absent till August, so that you wish him in their return to take Sturgeon Lake School.\n\n2. You intended to erect Big Head's school for a time when they leave, unless you have appointed Mr. & Mrs. Gentleman to it.\n\n3. You desire Mr. & Mrs. Hutchison to take Sturgeon Lake School for the summer, while you build at Atahkakaposi; but you are prepared to consent to their going to the latter, May 1st, if they can find a house to live in.\nI would suggest, if Mr. Hutchinson will agree to it,\n1. That he takes Sturgeon Lake School till Mr. Godfrey returns, as I feel sure he can rent said a house & live in at\nAtahkakkoops. 2. That if you accept Mr. Gentleman he goes\nto Big Heads at once, rather than to move to Sturgeon Lake for\na few months, & then to move again to Big Heads. 3. That if\npossible you should give Mr. Hutchinson some financial aid\nin the expenses of his moving family & furniture.\n\nI send this to Mr. Hutchinson, that he may see the proposal,\n& add his opinion or desire regarding it, & forward all\nway, & I would ask you to answer direct to him, both to\nsave time, & avoid further confusion through a middle cor-\nrespondent. I am sorry for the imposition, & for causing you\nadditional letters, but it was almost inevitable under the\ncircumstances. I do not yet know whether you have accep-\nted Mr. Gentleman, if he does not come I must look out\nfor another for you.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A.

A building is also to be erected at Ahtahkakoops and when finished Mr. Hutchinson and his wife will be engaged there. The Sturgeon Lake school is at present vacant and it occurred to the Department that Mr. Hutchinson might go there in the meantime and dwell in the Mission House, which, if is understood, is available. This would give him employment on the Sturgeon Lake reserve until such time as the residence at Ahtahkakoops is ready for occupation. As to Mr. Gentlemen he was informed by the Department that should there be a vacancy at the South Fort a la Corne School in the autumn or in the meantime at any other Indian school at which there is accommodation for a married man the Department would be very pleased to consider his application. It is not proposed, however, to ask Mrs. Godfrey to resign as teacher of the Fort a la Corne South School until the residence at Sturgeon Lake is completed. A communication has just been received from Mr.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, October 19, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of September 8th, last, and to state that the Department is advised that the teacher's residence on the Ahtahkakoops Reserve is well under way and will be rushed to completion at the earliest possible date. I have asked Mr. Borthwick, the Agent, to advise you in good time so that you may make the necessary preparations to transfer to Ahtahkakoops, as Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey from Fort a la Corne South will take up their residence at Sturgeon Lake. I trust that this will be satisfactory and that you will find the new accommodation quite up to your expectations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nH.

No. 22409\n\nSir,\n\nI commence now to report as follows regarding conditions as I found them.\n\nAfter an examination of the pupils, I found a want of thoroughness most marked, due, I believe, to lack of method or system - partly induced by the absence of discipline -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\nThey are weakest in their knowledge of English. No English Grammar has been taught, no meaning of words, no explanation of reading matter.

The\nSignificance of the results arrived at.\n\nI am making very little use of text books; using chiefly the black board, & verbal explanations.\n\nIn my opinion book work forms only part of the instruction which should be given in an Indian school\u2014what is needed further, I consider, is to teach the pupils to take a lesson.\na better view of life than they have hitherto done, & to realize their position in the world as sentient & responsible beings. A little knowledge gleaned from books, & ill conveyed, can hurt & affect them.\n\nThey must certainly be given to be well instructed in the ordinary curriculum of school work, but an effort should be made to get some time to spare.\nNew moral tone... lift\nnew character to a higher\nstandard.

I have therefore requested that authority be extended to me to purchase these goods according to the following list.\n\nSandy Lake School --- beans 100 lbs. peas 60 lbs.\nMistawasis School --- \" 100 lbs. \" 60 lbs.\nSturgeon Lake School- \" 100 lbs. \" 60 lbs.\nBig River School --- \" 50 lbs. \" 30 lbs.\nTotal --- \" 350 lbs. \" 210 lbs.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant stating that it is the intention of the teachers of the schools mentioned therein to provide a mid-day meal for the pupils during the winter months.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to purchase the quantity of beans and peas required for these schools, as given in your list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

During my monthly visits to each reserve I cannot approach the schools without a request from the teachers for something which they desire to be done; invariably if takes the following, \"I should like you arrange to send a man to put up our storm windows\", \"To saw our wood\"; in fact to do many little things which I contend might easily be done by themselves.\n\nAs I have no authority to be continually hiring men for their benefit, and as the ration house is now closed to workers, I would ask you to inform me if it is the desire of the Department that these numerous requests should be complied with. If so you would oblige by granting me an open authority to hire a man whenever the teachers see fit to require the services of such.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At all these schools there are men in charge and they should surely be able to put on their own storm windows and cut their own fire wood. Of course the fire wood for the school should be arranged for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTHOS. BORTHWICK, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter this day received from Mr. Hutchinson, teacher of the Sandy Lake school, asking for your assistance in securing extra help for his wife.\n\nHaving only recently visited the school, I find that the conditions are exactly as stated in Mr. Hutchinson's letter. Further, I am given to understand that Mrs. Hutchinson is doing splendid work amongst the Indians, not only in attending to the sick and preparing the mid-day meal for the pupils, but helping in many ways to further their interests, whenever possible.\n\nHowever, the work of handling the whole situation is getting beyond her; and I would earnestly suggest that the application for extra help be added to.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAt Tahkakoots Indian Day School\nSaints Lake Reserve\n\nStationed V.O.\nSalt - Feb 1st\n\nDear Mr. Fosterwood:\n\nThe duties here incumbent on the field mission are so numerous, that I should be much obliged if I could be so kind as to communicate with Mr. Bishop with a view to his securing her some assistance. The preparation of meals for 6 children; the looking after women's & children's classes; the distribution of medicines, a daily matter, together with visits to the sick at their homes, demands more time than she has at her disposal, besides pressing strongly upon her strength \u2014 she expects a sick child from England, a niece of Mrs. Matheson's, &c. If Bishop could grant her a sum of $10 or $15 per month, she would be able to remain...\nMaterial kept in the different heads of work.\n\nPoveshell has the right to be formally considered as such.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nJno. Thomas\n\nH.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Northwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to advise you that during the last two or three months, I have experienced great difficulty in securing adequate service for the transportation of the school children on both the Sandy Lake No.104 and the Sturgeon Lake No.101 reserves. The Indians inform me that the present allowance per day, viz: $1.50 hardly suffices to keep the team they have to work and further that the work necessitates the breaking up of practically the whole of the day. In many respects this is perfectly true, as it is often 11.50 am, before the transporters can return home to commence any other work they may contemplate doing. However, I have now come to a satisfactory arrangement with an Indian on each of the above mentioned reserves, whereby the trouble will be minimized to a great extent, if the Department can see their way to carry out the following suggestion. That is to furnish each of the following applicants with a team costing in the Neighbourhood of $400.00 each.\n\nViz: John Iman of the Sandy Lake reserve and Thos. Peter of the Sturgeon Lake reserve. Repayable in each case by half of the proceeds of their labor per month being returned to the Department on account of the purchase price, until such time as the debt is written off. This system, which has been in operation on the Mistawasis reserve has been very successful; and I really believe it is the only satisfactory way of solving the problem.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 5, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to the transport of children to the schools on the Ahtahkakoops and Sturgeon Lake Reserves, in which you recommend the purchase of a team of horses each for John Iman and Thomas Peter of the above mentioned reserves respectively to be used in conveying the pupils to school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the success which has attended a similar scheme at Mistawasis, you are hereby authorized to purchase a suitable team for each of these Indians at a cost not exceeding $400.00 each, upon condition that these horses are to be used solely for the purpose of transport and that re-payment is made at the rate of 50 per cent of each month's earnings as they fall due and are paid by the Department. It is also to be understood that these horses are to remain the property of the Department, and in the event of failure to take proper care of them provision should be made for their reversion to the Department. In the case of necessity arising for the Department's taking possession on account of failure to live up to the contract all payments made would be forfeited. The above conditions should be carefully embodied in an agreement to be signed by the Indians in the presence of witnesses and a copy of each forwarded to the Department to be\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nbe placed on record.\n\nThese horses should be examined by a veterinary surgeon and a copy of his certificate should be attached to the voucher.\n\nThe Department desires to make payment out of the appropriation for the current fiscal year, so that the purchase should be made, if at all possible, before the 31st of this month and the vouchers dated accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the teacher of the Sandy Lake school, Mr. Hutchinson.\n\nI complied with the request and granted the necessary leave of absence.

Original on 117332-7\n\n================== 488331\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Hutchison devotes too much time and attention to the 5th or higher grades. The lower grades are very backward compared with the same grades in either the Mistawasis or Big River Schools.\n\nSgd. S. A. Milligan\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 13, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that you devote too much time and attention to the fifth or higher grades in your school and that the lower grades are very backward.\n\nThe Department would like you in future to devote a little more of your time to the lower grades.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Hutchison, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nAhtahkakoops Day School,\nStarblanket, Sask.\nTo,\n\nIn reply to your communication of March 13th, No. 17382/1, I beg to allow me to make the following statement:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter, I thought it best to call a meeting of the Chiefs and Councilors, and Mr. Miller was to be present before them. After some discussion, they were present. The Chief, William Carroll, and Jack Morin were there. However, Louis Steinhauer was away at his place, and Mr. Alexander was unable to receive a report of the meeting. The meeting appeared to be quite satisfactory, and Mr. Miller was quite pleased with the account given. Mr. Miller had been nothing but friendly to the children who attended school. The chief, however, was not pleased because he had been away from the Reserve.\n\nLouis, said his dog named Wolfie, had been away from another Reserve. He has been staying there on a visit with his family, and said during his period of his return to the school, Wolfie was friendly to Jack. He has been sick since then, like this before, I did not know anything, but in my school, all that I have heard anything, and after he has attended to school for about a month, he was very much worse, much behind in his studies, but of late, Jack seems very steady.\nI have always seen my effort to keep 15 pupils engaged in school activities without interruption from beginning to finish. I have consequently given as much attention to the lower grades as to the higher, and pupils are treated alike. All work requires attention, and some cannot be permitted in all matters relating to persons.\n\nI have never normal conditions between 30 or 40 children present. When 15 school has unexpected lack fell by late inspection children have been 35 or less occasion, he said, \"for me too classes.\"\n\nSome times our own can teach them, indeed, as they have to do so many classes doing. Many are struggling who have much less time.\n\nIt is a difficult matter. I will leave, & I often have to do two things at once time. I have kept busy without being forced into the hours of the school. To avoid wasting time, & keep all our plans require very careful arrangement of their studies.\n\nHere is a part of Class V during the morning.\n\nThe class commences at 9 o'clock, for half an hour, instruction. Next follows explanation of matter, & meaning & parsing of words. The rest of the morning they work from then until twelve, & I have nothing further to do with them & to close of 16 school. They prepare written lessons are given for 10 day. Geography, History, Grammar, English, Arithmetic, & all their work is examined & questions asked on the various subjects, at a stated time during the afternoon. Then it will be seen I am free during the greater part of the morning.\nfor the other clauses; in fact, the lower clause has to refer back to my time.\n\nI have to honor & remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Of all others\nno valid scheme whatever can be made.\nOttawa, August 17, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. H. Hutchinson, teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, in which he states that Edward Abenakew, an ordained Indian, has recently visited the reserve and made arrangements for the removal of four of the pupils of his school to the Onion Lake Church of England Boarding School, also, that he may possibly have other children in view.\n\nMr. Hutchinson states that the parents of these four children are well able to support them, namely, James Starblanket and Peter Knife.\n\nAs there is a good day school at this reserve the Department cannot approve of these children being sent to a residential school. There is ample accommodation for all the children at the day school, and, if a number are sent to residential schools it would lower the attendance to such a point that it would be useless to continue the day school.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the parents or other interested parties that it is not the intention of the Department to permit the recruiting of children attending the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School to residential schools, and you should see that these children remain on the reserve and attend the day school.\n\nWhere day schools are in operation and the parents are able to provide for their children, it is not the intention to place any such children in residential schools.\n\nAll applications for admission to residential schools from reserves in your agency, should receive your approval and no child should be taken until you have approved their application for admission.\n\nThe four children referred by Mr. Hutchinson should remain on the reserve and attend the day school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

One factor has been responsible to some extent for this extraordinary condition viz., the absence of many of the Indians at Wawa Lake helping with the harvest, taking their families with them. But there are also cases of the smallness of attendance. There are, of school age, 18 children living so remote from the school that they cannot possibly attend, at least 15 anyway of these - I am sure if the roads were better be more.\n\nWe can accommodate in the classroom portion of this house for 16 pupils; if any we had to acquire lots, building etc., we should be very glad of the Department's aid in this way & in making up an arrangement whereby we could secure heat here from Monday & Tuesday when the house is able to attend to school without heat. It seems a pity when heated a school room that not more children should not be able to take advantage of it.\n\nThis house certainly will require the additional labour on our part. It is here with Shanty number 10 back, & we object to this if we do nothing under the existing instructions. We believe we may assume that such an arrangement should be made.\n\nI have the honour to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. H. Stevenson\n\nIndian Affairs.

This plan commends itself somewhat to the Department, and we are writing Mr. Agent Weir for his recommendation. You would do well to address any communications to the Department to our local agent, who will forward them with his recommendation attached.

In the interim, I would be pleased to have your opinion as to the desirability of allowing Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson the privilege of providing residential facilities.

If we commence taking in day school pupils, parents will take it for granted that when they go away hunting and trapping, their children should be looked after as well.\n\nCommissioner Graham has shipped supplies for Sandy Lake residence, in order that some of the rooms be fitted up as a hospital, in order that Mrs. Hutchinson will be in a better position to attend to the sick, in further conjunction with the tent supplied by the Department this summer. At present I cannot say how many rooms will be left free, if under the circumstances you are still inclined to outfit some of the rooms for residential purposes, on hearing to this effect, I will go into the cost of equipment, and monthly bill for supplies.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, October 26th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, concerning the advisability of allowing the teacher of the Ahtahkakoop Indian Day School to provide residential facilities for the more remote children in attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that your recommendation has been noted, and the Department is not prepared to allow any of the pupils residential facilities at this time.\n\nOn your next visit to the Sandy Lake Reserve, you might look into the available space in the school building and be in a position to attach your recommendation to any future request in this connection the teacher may make through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Heir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nThe majority of the Indians have been away during the month, many of them at Sandy Lake doing harvest work. Before leaving, some of them came and asked me if I could receive their children in order that they might attend school. This I should have been very glad to have done. We have spare room for about ten children if an arrangement could be made for that purpose. It would, without doubt, be a great boon to the Reserve if the accommodation provided when this house was erected (by the Laurier Government) were to be utilized. It would help two classes of children, viz., those who live so far away from the school that they cannot attend it, and secondly those who have to be taken with their parents when away working or hunting. It seems to me a pity that so many of the children should only be able to attend school at intervals, while others cannot be present at all. There are some now living across the river who are growing up destitute of all school knowledge and acquiring at the same time knowledge of an undesirable character. This inability to attend school of course affects my classes, and keeps the children from an influence which should benefit them. My classes are not simply meetings for instruction in needlework, singing, cooking, etc., but I endeavour as far as possible to help in character building, and if there is one thing needed on the Reserve it is that.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(Sd) A.M.

Possibly some other accommodation can be secured for school children.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the AHTAHKAKOOPS SCHOOL, September 28, 1922.\n\nIt is quite evident that the school is not being managed as well as it might be or the pupils would be in better shape. Mr. Hutchinson does not appear to have been following any particular course of study as he was teaching Greek, Latin and Algebra to some of his pupils. This will doubtless be remedied now that the provincial programme is to be followed.\n\nW. J. Drimmie,\nInsp.\nOttawa, November 17, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Drimmie's report on the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nAs the inspector no doubt informed you, the Department desires you to follow the course of study prescribed for the white schools in Saskatchewan. A copy of the course of study and a list of the prescribed textbooks can be secured upon application to the Department of Education, Regina.\n\nWhen forwarding requisitions you should request the books prescribed by the Provincial Education Department.\n\nWe are ordering for your school one year's subscription to the \"Canadian Teacher.\" It is hoped that this publication will prove of considerable benefit to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Hutchinson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nAhtahkakoops Indian Day School,\nStarblanket, SASK.\nI have & must apologize for a recent communication, in which you expressed your regret regarding the Indian School Teachers' Association's letter to the Indian Commissioner. I also want to thank you for your letter of November 17th, in which you allude to the difficulties faced by the school, as well as for your supply of Canadian medical magazine. I am sorry to hear such a poor attendance on occasions of the harvest season. We have at no time had empty hands, but often do find it difficult to effect much through lack of material to work upon. Which, we may say, is the reason of his health deterioration, a loss which he deserves. To put the matter in a nutshell, James replies, some form of compensation, attendance at school or otherwise. Some years ago, let me know, he would have as many as 35 pupils present, but to reach this number is very difficult now. It seems a great pity, but the attempt was made to develop a school here. After a considerable time, I asked to work at another to maintain his work, but he has resumed. He tells me he does not want to do this, but it seems he is very glad to do it. In conclusion, I am very grateful to you for your kindness and understanding.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere is more than one cause of a varied attitude at Indian School, and all Indians should be more lenient in their conduct.\n\nReasons for Poor Attendance\n\nIn the first place, there are many reasons for school age, who live so far from the school, that it is still much impossible for them to attend. A tendency is also in the case of girls.\n\nSecondly, there is the influence of some parents regarding the education of their children. In this case, more often than not, they try to prevent their children from attending school because they require very little learning. They are less likely to work or earn any money, and have been known to become unemployed. The encouragement of women is not in the best interest.\n\nThirdly, children of both sexes are not to work too long to life, which they can get work, attend to cattle and horses. If this happens, and they are forced to work, it will be difficult for them to maintain their health.\n\nThey are not such a boy or girl as I said to assure me that he is working, and he must maintain his parents' hopes and dreams.\n\nThen comes a case where a boy is content. Usually a pupil reaches 15 years of puberty, and goes back to school. At 12 or 13 years of age, she is called into work equivalent to a \"young man\" in England, and is in constant need for further attendance at school. I have recently heard some of my best pupils change his course, but it is uncertain. His age was lost by boys and girls who began to work at 15 years of age. It seems that the school has not been successful in maintaining its standards, and the school has lost its purpose.\n\nIt is time they knew something about the importance of education, and the value of their future school at USD period. It is time they knew...\nThe following is an extract from a Report dated in the year 1879 which indicates my views with regard to the importance of Indian schools.\n\n\"The school is, in fact, the first organization on the Reserve, the basis on which religion itself must build all refinements of thought or action; for its church can do but little if those whom she instructs cannot understand her teachings, while it is true enough that education is not, by any means, always a moral factor, yet it is none the less an established fact that ignorance, immorality & superstition go hand in hand. Cultivate the intellect & you open the door to which religion introduces a higher standard of morality & give it death blow to superstition. The Indian has capabilities & possibilities before him; but uneducated he finds much needs lie dormant, while his second are not realized. Would they may learn, whom the Lord of Science would have charged; but untaught they fail to execute the work they might otherwise have accomplished. The welfare of the Indian race depends upon its cultivation. Educate it & the old man of old will ultimately disappear & a new creation will take its place in the world's annals.\"\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. H. MacKenzie\n\nDeputy,\nAttawapiskat Indian Day School\nOttawa, Feb. 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your communication, relative to school matters generally, and with particular reference to the poor attendance at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I wish to assure you that the matter of school attendance on Indian reserves has given this Department cause for much thought and discussion from time to time, and a few years ago a clause with reference to compulsory education was introduced into the Indian Act. All children living within a reasonable distance of a day school can be forced to attend; but considerable tact has to be exercised by our agents, teachers and other representatives in this connection. If you find children who live close to the school are not attending regularly, and if your efforts with the parents are unavailing, the matter should be reported to the Indian agent.\n\nThe Department has discontinued the use of vans to haul children to school, and I regret to inform you that this method of securing a better attendance will not be resorted to at your school. The hot meal at noon, prizes for good attendance and interesting classroom and playground activities have all militated for larger classes.\n\nWith particular reference to the Ahtahkakoops School, may I suggest that you bend every energy toward awakening an interest in the younger pupils. There is, I know, an inclination to give instruction in more advanced work to the brighter pupils, but a teacher should not succumb to the temptation to offer Greek, Latin, Algebra, etc., to a boy or two, when a half dozen younger pupils are either learning to idle away their hours or are losing their interest.\n\nIf you wish to have some inexpensive primary materials, in addition to your present supply, or some athletic equipment for group games, I would be pleased if you will make a definite request. Our efforts to educate the Indian youth are abortive unless we can secure a good attendance. The problem is partly solved by making the school ground and the classroom more attractive to the child mind than the home and the bush.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

There are several Reserves in British Columbia where the services of both a teacher and field matron are engaged, the latter position being established by the Civil Service Commission. Mr. Cairns would, no doubt, be able to inform you whether there will be any vacancies where the services of yourself and wife could be utilized, beginning with the next school year.

Sept. 12, 1925.\n\nThe report on the whole is fairly satisfactory. The Department is aware that Mr. Hutchinson has been teaching this school for quite a number of years and that he is now reaching an age when I think steps will have to be taken to replace him. We cannot expect much from a man seventy years of age, especially in an Indian school. However, he is still doing as well as many of our younger teachers.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nAbout a week ago, Mr. Ellis, principal of the Okotoks Industrial School, came here for the purpose of recruiting pupils for his school. He called upon me and assured me that he did not wish to remove any children who were attending my school, only those who living too far away could not attend. I found out, however, that such prior to his call, upon me he had asked one of my parents for his two children who were attending my school regularly, in two of my best pupils. The latter had refused, although Mr. Ellis would then confine his attention to those children remote from the school. Too late, however, I discovered that he had removed 8 of my pupils, regular attendants at my school. I had run a large school owing to previous deportations, and school has thus been reduced by half. I am certain Mr. Ellis has acted in a very unbecoming manner. Instead of coming to me with a request to be permitted to deport the children, he visited me again.\n\nMy pupils were working hard, were well behaved, and making excellent progress, but through Mr. Ellis' arbitrary conduct they school has been materially injured. He is considered hard, after between 14th-15th years work in the school here, to have its invaded by a stranger who assumed to himself the power to disintegrate it at will.\n\nIf Mr. Ellis had been able, I do not think he would have left me a single pupil. I have...\nin my possession a communication from the\nDepartment that it is said that the Deputy\nMinister approved recruiting from an Improved\nResidential School. I regret now that I did not\nask Mr. Wilson if he had special permission to\nrecruit here at a reserve school attending the school.\nI may say here that Mr. Wilson was assisted in his\nwork upon the Reserve by the missionary and his wife\nand his wife's family who are most wonderful\npeople who from time to time have attended\nto matters of school matters - others which are\nnot concerned with them. I have written to Bishop\nLloyd on this point.\nThe Deputy Minister asked me for any views on the subject,\nbut I cannot help saying, from what I have seen\nof him, that the Residential Schools are not altogether\na success. The poorest Indians on this Reserve are\nthose who have come from such schools. Those\nwho have been taught and trained during our tenure\nof office here are vastly superior in every way.\nI am convinced that the best way to improve\nthe condition of the Indians is to give them\nan education (use the word education) so that they\nare educated (use the word educated) in all\nways of an ordinary making up for lost time now.\nThey seem to lack some common sense. This was the\nopinion of the Rev Canon Bannerman whom I met\nabout 20 years ago, and who had had a long\nexperience in residential and residential schools. But\nit is a problem to sustain the best of the hopes in the U.S.\nit is hard not to believe. I trust I may be pardoned\nfor thus expressing my view.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I said the reason he gave for removing some of the children attending the school to have been that they asked him to take them. This was given me as a valid reason for deporting them. Seeing to the excitement created by the removal of the non-attending, some may have expressed a desire to be taken, looking forward, no doubt, to the journey as a kind of picnic - very natural for young children.\n\nIf it were not too presuming too much, we should be very glad if those attending the school could be released & the Reserve, with the exception of the few named & Edward Little.\n\nThe following is a list of fifteen reported as attending the school regularly, living close at hand:\n\nJohn James Senechal 10\nEmma Bird 9\nAlfred Snake 9\nEdward Little 12\nHannah Little 9\nWilliam Macdonald 12\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH.

It is stated that the chief recruiting efforts on behalf of the Onion Lake Indian Residential School were in connection with the regular attendants at the day school. The Department does not purpose taking any action in this connection, other than to suggest that successful day schools should not be injured by recruiting officers, who would be well advised to make their efforts among those children whose education is being neglected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He told me distinctly that he did not wish to take any of those who were attending the school but in spite of this he went away with seven who were in regular attendance, six of whom were living close to the school.\n\nIt was done in a very underhand manner and we did not know until too late what he was about. It is a great pity for some of them were too young for a residential school and were doing well here, besides this there was no reason for their removal and our school has been greatly injured by his action.\n\nA.

The six children to whom the Matron refers as residing near the school, belonged to widow women and old people who were not in a position to look after them properly, and it was an act of charity to have them sent to the Boarding School.\n\nI have written to the Agent, informing him that under the circumstances Mr. Ellis' action was in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Murison on the Ahtakhaslops Indian Day School.\n\nI visited this school on February 24th and found five boys and four girls present out of an enrollment of eleven. There were eighteen enrolled during the month of January, but seven of these children were sent by their parents to the Onion Lake Boarding School. The teacher at Sandy Lake, Mr. Hutchinson, expressed great displeasure regarding the recruiting of these children and said that he did not think the Principal at Onion Lake should take the children who are residing close to the day School. I looked into this matter and found that the Principal did not make any effort to recruit children so far as I can learn, but simply took the children that were brought to him by the parents themselves.\n\nMr. Hutchinson is becoming well advanced in years, being now over seventy. He is quite hard of hearing and I do not think will be able to continue long at this work. His wife acts as Field Matron and prepares the mid-day meal for the children. She has done excellent work in caring for the sick and in teaching the women on the reserve to keep house properly, but I regret to say that at the present time she is not enjoying good health.\n\nCommissioner Graham forwarded the above under cover of his letter of February 19, 1926, and states:\n\n\"With reference to the Inspector's remarks about children being taken from the Sandy Lake Day School to the Boarding School at Onion Lake, I have dealt with this in a separate letter.\"\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\nIndian & Eskimo Commission\n\nONION LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nONION LAKE, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\n26th February '26.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.107-2-1, dated the 16th instant with reference to my recruiting for the new Onion Lake Residential School being done on the Sandy Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to advise you that only the children who were destitute or lived too far from the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, or children who were not attending regularly were taken from this reserve, and not even then, until I had taken the matter up with Mr. Hutchinson, the teacher and the Indian Agent.\n\nOur policy is to take the neglected or orphan children, or where they are living too far from the Day School to attend regularly into the Residential school, except in cases where the parents were anxious to give their children a chance of going through for their entrance examination.

(RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\nI have received an insolent letter from Mr. Hutchinson, teacher of the school, regarding this matter, in which he informs me that he is astounded at the nature of the communication which he received from the Agent, and he assures me that the matter will not rest where it is, stating that perhaps I would be good enough to inform him whether Weir is acting on his own initiative or on instructions either from me or from the Department. I have made a number of complaints about Mr. Hutchinson to the Department. The Agent's life is made miserable by having a man of this type on his staff. He is a man of 80 years of age who does not get along with his own church people. He is opposed to anything in the way of recruiting. Why should the Department stand for this? Why should not this man be retired, and someone be put in his place who will work in harmony with the Agent? If he were a good teacher it would be a different thing but I do not think he is in the right place at all. We must consider our own people a little in matters of this kind, and I do not see that Mr. Weir should be subjected to this sort of thing.\n\nIn Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the Sandy Lake School in April, 1923, he makes the following remark about Mr. Hutchinson, - \"I do not like his gruff and abrupt way of shouting at the children, and the progress as shown by the pupils present on the day of my visit was very unsatisfactory.\" In his report dated Feb. 15th, 1926, he says, - \"Mr. Hutchinson is becoming well advanced in years, being now over seventy. He is quite hard of hearing and I do not think will be able to continue long at this work.\"\nSir,\n\nA child, by name Emma Reid, daughter of Betty Reid, a grandchild of Thomas Knife, was removed from this school at Sandy Lake Residential School, about twelve months ago. This summer the child returned to the Reserve to have her baby born.\n\nNow it seems when this child was an infant she was handed over to her grandparents who took her and brought her up.\n\nNow it is known a little more than three months ago that the mother Betty, very unselfishly quarreled with her mother Mrs. Thomas Knife.\n\nThereupon in order to settle her matter she signed the papers for the transference of her child to Omin Lake, whereas she had no right to do this having a long time previously, as stated above, handed over the child to her parents who worked the child as her own.\n\nNow Mr. Thomas Knife, grandfather, decided not to send his child back to Omin Lake, but to keep him on this Reserve and earn him $15 school tax, or 150 dollars of the two schools.\n\nThen the Agent here arrives on the Reserve with a police officer and demands the child. Thomas Knife absolutely refuses, and threatened in a very threatening manner with imprisonment if he persisted in his refusal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo Mr. Cathcart, London.\n\nMr. Thomas Kneifl's complaint was received in the house at the time he was made prisoner, at the thought of his father being sent to prison, and his condition was extremely grave. Thomas Kneifl said yes, and the child has recovered.\n\nBut the episode has not been forgotten.\n\nNow it seems as though I should be glad to receive information in, who am in the right? In addition, there had been some up (not sure what word) but mostly to which belongs to the Indians. Mr. Thomas Kneifl in signing away his rights, he wrote down, had written down (not sure).\n\nNow in connection with this matter, Samuel Cathcart, remarking that at late time has been too much worrying of police officers to Mr. Kneifl, threatening the Indians with imprisonment. Now possibly Mr. Kneifl was securing his powers. Has Agent been to authorize legal powers to arrest Thomas Kneifl or close a road him to prison simply because he refuses to allow the deposition of his squatters to Mississauga Lake.\n\nI consider this threatening to Indians with imprisonment very serious. I must say more but I have it at that.\n\nIn their attitude towards the Indians is too militant, and he has absolutely no sympathy with them at all.\n\nMy opinion has not been asked for, but it is that he should not be doing Indian work. Indians may need kindness, but they also need kinder treatment.\n\nSometimes ago I wrote to Mr. Ferrier with regard to compulsory education, he told me.\nWith this in mind, let me add (as far as I can remember), but add, \"we have to be very careful\" quite so... I think I am repeating myself.\n\nI have already made it very obvious to them to bring us into this kind of imprisonment. (Some other line)\n\nIn the matter arose me of the Indians in the Reserve was expected. Before making a decision, \"Home Room\" to a police officer an instance, by whom I know not, but Mr. Brown's missionary here at the Office were persistently to Reserve at night & try to capture the delinquents - one man was stopped, but nothing was accomplished in pursuit. A few days later he was tried with no result, a verdict, and Mr. Brown's missionary did effect something. He gave a very serious blow to his own usefulness in the Reserve, and he is spoken of as a \"Spy\" in the Potawatomi.\n\nMy father was a Clergyman. (An Oxford man in classical honors) but I could not visualize him walking around this Park at night with a police Officer trying to find one of his Potawatomi parishioners. What else can one do? Can't think of anything can be done to see justice. He has no right.\n\nDuring 15 1871 we have been working on the Reserve, we have tried to deal kindly & sympathetically with the Indians, especially Mr. Matheson, who was so much of blame - and a kind of constant worry.\n\nI care to know to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.M.

Smith\nJan. 7, 1927\n\nTo our great satisfaction, Mr. Hutchison very recently received a letter from Agent Weir, informing him that no further supply of flour for the school children would be allowed, with the allowance of each month to end soon. A note promptly came in for 10 sacks, which will be demanded.\n\nMoreover, but the assistant matron was to send a salary of $5 per month for two months in the year, thus depriving her husband of his assistance for two months.\n\nAnd then after fifteen years had a conversation and arranged to borrow on the Reserve.\n\nThat such an arrangement as this alone connected from the Department might be difficult to conceive.\n\nFurther, it assists in to take her meals (dinners) with the children, but must have the privilege of such board.\n\nWhen the Assistant was first appointed about six weeks ago, there was no hospital here, she visited some time until she was told to go according to Agent Weir's letter, but not have any supplies. Therefore the midday meal for the children, but that is only a fraction of what she has to provide all the meals for 15 patients.\n\nShe has to purchase all the meals for 15 patients herself, and sometimes a week or so. She has to see an enormous amount of labour in connection with the washing & blanket, bath, furnishing & care of 15 patients.\n\nHer rooms have only the basics, a little compulsory clean, (in certain cases such as pneumonia or sleeping sickness) allow.\n\nThen again this house is a large one, where the help is needed, so I think it may be seen that the position of...\nIt's assistant in by no means a sinecure.\n\nThe Mediator has to rely on the Reserve often a great deal of 15 day visits, many duties fall to the lot of 15 assistants while she is away.\n\nAlso when 15 assistants are employed we have to be able to be met in need, had to be supplied with 15 children supplies, all arrangements have been made, there is much to undertake not a good luck & her food for her personal & so on. The trust receive his instructions from the Mediator. Now 15 assistants must settle her business with the children & minor, & feed 15 2nd & 3rd.\n\nThen Reserve is very different place from that of her home in fact came here & have no trouble in doing what she does in advance of some other Reserve. Why then is this new arrangement slower & not what has to be successfully been carried on by assisted. & to satisfy of a fair rate of flow to cut off?\n\nWho experienced the difference from previous existing conditions I know not, nor can I see the reason thereof.\n\nIn order to keep the reserve & 15 Departments N.T. has Mediator as a good helper here or a doctor, a nurse here saved to get a large sum of money.\n\nSome years ago during the outbreak & flu then we had here 165 cases, & did not lose one case, here Mediator handled these cases alone. Again during a small pay epidemic, here 17 losses were prevented.\nShe again has arrived. I was more in a single case her last.\n\nDuring the war, Mr. Macleod has to visit scores of cases in a day from early morning until late at night. The Indians have been here. She comes through to work. During the period she lived in the Big River Reserve, she has had to pay all they received.\n\nI think I may be permitted to say that, while there seems to me not much of cutting down necessary supplies, an increase in its value under the new economy.\n\nAgain, here is a letter received from him a short time ago, which I know how much work he allowed to be distributed in the morning, from morning to night. It would be hard to keep track of his amount. In addition to work which has been supplied by the B.C.A., a large quantity of dry goods has been made from the surplus fish from the beef, a kind of own resource.\n\nEvery patient coming into the hospital is put into a clean bed, a blanket, sheets, etc., are looked after. Each patient's bed is washed and sometimes had to buy a suit to help to assistant in the work.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Macleod\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would mean an average of 1.65 lbs per person including 10 children & hospital patients.\n\nToday there were 11 school children, 2 patients & assistant & husband of the same.\n\nThe 1.65 lbs includes bread, fat, & flour. This in the second half of January, 15 amounts of meat available here will certainly last.\nOttawa, January 17, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to supplies allowed for the children at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, the salary of the assistant field matron, rations for her and other related subjects. The Department this year is making an effort to standardize the amounts granted to the Indian day schools for the noonday lunch. No flour was allowed at Ahtahkakoops, as a full ration of biscuits (4 oz. per day per pupil) has been granted and the allowance for beef was reduced as 300 lbs. was considered sufficient for the occasional making of beef soup. I may say that the food supplied for the noonday lunch is not sufficient for a full meal but is for the purpose of augmenting what the children themselves bring. This noonday lunch generally takes the form of a hot soup, or cooca, and biscuits when required. I may state that the items allowed for the noonday lunch are as follows:\n\n- 400 lbs. of biscuits,\n- 200 lbs. of rolled oats,\n- 150 \" rice,\n- 12 boxes yeast sake,\n- 50 \" beans,\n- 25 lbs. of tea,\n- 500 \" beef,\n- 100 \" salt.\n\nThe print and flannelette was not approved in connection with the Estimates, as any of this type of material that is required should be the subject for a special communication.\n\nI note you are complaining that the assistant matron is being paid $10 per month for 10 months only. I may say that the assistant matron is paid at the rate of $6.25 per month for 12 months in the year. This has been the practice for some time and I know of no proposed change. The Department does not supply rations for field matrons or their assistants. However, I understand from your letter that Miss Hill devotes most of her time to the field matron and hospital duties. The Department understood that her sole duties were the assisting with the preparation of the children's noonday lunch.\n\nI note that some of the school rations have been used for hospital patients. This practice should stop and whatever is required for those that are ill in the hospital should be the subject for special requests.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

G. MOYER\nPrivate Secretary.\nAt the Halcoops Indian Day School & Hospital,\nSandy Lake Reserve, Sask.\n\nMont Nebo P.O. Sask. Jan. 18, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nAfter over fifteen years strenuous service on this Reserve, myself as Principal of the School, and Miss MacKenzie acting in the twofold capacity of Nurse, Matron & Doctor, we find ourselves now forced to threatened as follows, a few circumstances:\n\nWishing to do the best we can with regard to the education of the young generation (girls), we send them to the Boarding School (Catholic) at Prince Albert. This move was upon us the result of the departure of Mr. Lloyd, who was nominated to our present position by Bishop Humber, appointed by the Canadian government. Following upon this, the missionary here & his wife, taking up south, left our care from Mr. Nebo, entering together with the principal of the Sandy Lake (Anglican) Residential School, brought about a total of 16 of our best scholars transferred to the Catholic School, & our own school badly considerably injured. Whereupon I wrote strongly to the said missionary, complaining of the measures taken to join the action of the tribe. My letter was forwarded to Bishop Lloyd, who in consequence threatened to communicate me. This letter was about twelve months ago.\n\nLately, matters have assumed threateningly in the same direction, in this wise\u2014\n\nRecently, he received a letter from the Agent for this\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReserve. The local institutions that contain supplies for our school children must be discontinued. The children have provided for them a mid-day meal; a flour was to be withdrawn. A new regulation arrangement will be maintained. This will be taken up by many other areas for our use.\n\nThe object of the mid-day meal is to ensure that we maintain our position in respectability. It is our responsibility under the laws to follow.\n\nThe main concern in this matter are, I believe, William Graham, Dominion Commissioner, Regina, and other local Indian Agents. We have Reserve living at the Reserve Agency, Millarville, South Dakota. It is quite possible that the new regulations may have been issued from the Dominion Office, Ottawa, concerning the mid-day meal, but I cannot say if this is the case or not.\n\nBut there is another factor to be considered. I am a liberal, and there are strong conservatives. I have always felt that the best solution is to work together. This has been done in the past. I am sure he will find means here for our cause.\n\nWork shown in connection with this form of recreation should be continued, and it is a course of action excellent for all communities, a community affair.\n\nI wrote very lately to the Dominion Department with regard to their recent attitude toward us Indians. There is no question, a little is much more than none among them in consequence. I wrote the Deputy, but I consider their activities in some respects curious, and I am very much amused. He is convinced, too, that it brings police officers on the Reserve. Therefore, the Indians will understand what they are to certain school matters. But it comes later today, I feel in detail.\nWith utmost regard,\n\nTo enter fully into our affairs connected with the Reserve, under let me say to write, as I have, let terms to read. We do share outline with, I trust, be sufficient to make me in uncertain of adverse conditions under which we are now living.\n\nFrom the outset, in my opinion, I have stated that to the Department, whom never have been appointed Dominion Agent. He has no sympathy with the Indians, his action is too officious.\n\nPraying that I may receive from you such sympathy a support as is need.\n\nI beg to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. H. Thomson\n\nPrincipal\n\nAnd he must be kept in mind that, even though there is no question of welfare be eliminated, the previous letters goes be re-established.\nOttawa, February 3, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 18th instant, addressed to the Right Honourable the Prime Minister. I beg to say that your observations have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Hutchinson, Esq.,\nMont Hope,\nSask.\nRegina, Sask.,\nFeb. 14, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding Mr. Hutchinson, teacher at the Sandy Lake School, the Department are well aware of the situation at that point, and know all about Mr. Hutchinson. He has been reported on quite frequently. He is a hard man to get along with but his wife is doing good work as Field Matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSANDY LAKE DAY SCHOOL:\n\nI visited this school on January 26th, and found six boys and three girls in attendance out of an enrolment of fourteen. The average attendance for the December quarter was 7.84, a little over half of the enrolment. The Teacher Mr. H. Hutchinson is a man well advanced in years. He is hard of hearing, gruff and sharp in addressing the pupils; does not visit the homes, and I would say that his personality would not be conducive to making attendance at the school attractive for the Indian children. I feel it my duty to report that this man appears to have an unfortunate tendency towards antagonizing the people with whom he comes in contact, and his presence on the reserve is not conducive to promoting harmony on the reserve.\n\nThe present resident missionary the Rev. C. Morris I am informed has forwarded his resignation to be dealt with by the Bishop on his return from England. The attitude of Mr. Hutchinson has made life on the reserve unbearable for his wife and himself. His predecessor Rev. D.D. MacDonald resigned his charge for the same reason. They appear to have taken a high hand attitude with the Farm Instructors and have shown antagonism towards the Agent who will not visit them unless the exigencies of his business demands it.\n\nThe situation is wrong and intolerable, and I feel that the work on the reserve would not suffer by their removal.\n\nThe foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe have your letter No.107-2-1 Jan 17.\n\nAs this refers to the Matron's Assistant, I beg to be allowed to make a few remarks concerning her duties, as well as my own.\n\nInspector Macdonald called here with Mr. Weir the Agent on Wednesday last. When I brought up the subject of the matters having been cut down etc., we shall not at the time receive the above mentioned communication No.107-2-1 so he read the copy which had been forwarded to him.\n\nI was under the impression that the Dept. was acquainted with the duties of the Assistant. When the Hospital was established, I pointed out to Mr. Weir the greatly enlarged work any assistant would have to take up, and asked him in view of this to lay the matter of her pay before the Dept. Considering the extension of her duties, it was evident that the small sum of $8.53 per month, though it might meet her case when her duties were principally concerned with the preparation of the Midday Meal, would be insufficient now that she would be engaged throughout the day in a variety of capacities. Mr. Weir afterwards assured me verbally that he had done this, but that the Dept.'s response to the request for increased pay was a decided negative. Absolutely no\nAnd in a further communication from Dr. Weir, the Dept. was quoted as saying I had a paid assistant who should be pleased to work for the patients.\n\nThe work of the Assistant is really very heavy. It includes besides the preparation of the meals, which vary in character according to the nature of the disease so washing the floors in the wards, dishwashing and articles used by the Patients, and the laundering of the clothing and bedding, some of which has to be changed daily.\n\nThen it must not be overlooked that I have to be out very frequently on the Reserve visiting many of their homes... and in my absence the whole supervision rests upon my assistant who will find very little time for rest.\n\nWhen I have Patients in the Hospital they have the same attention they would receive in a large Hospital. That is, they get their sponge bath in some cases daily or other cases twice a week. In Typhoid cases it means change of undergarments and very often sheets daily. We have had some very serious Typhoid cases since the Hospital was established, and I have not lost one patient so far.\n\nWhen we have serious cases in it means my being on duty practically twenty-four\nhours. In I never ask my assistant to lose her sleep.\n\nThis week for instance I have three children, one with pneumonia and pleurisy, the other two \"flu,\" running high temperatures. Then I have a woman, Mrs. Big John, who was very seriously ill with hemorrhage and would have had to be sent to Prince Albert for treatment\u2014had I not been able to take her here. Dr. McIver saw all these patients.\n\nI have been on duty at least twenty hours out of the twenty-four for five days. So I wait this I am waiting up with a sick child, and it is twelve o'clock midnight.\n\nI am telling you this so that you will see I am not wasting much time.\n\nNow what I wish to say is this, that when the matter was brought up to Mr. Murison and Mr. Weir about the assistant's salary, Mr. Murison said the Dept. was not furnishing a maid for the patient. This I consider was a very wicked and uncalled for and unnecessary remark, and I am quite sure Mr. Murison would not have said it had he not been influenced by others. Otherwise Mr. Murison has spoken very differently of my work, and has referred to it as \"your good work.\" Why this change?\n\nMr. Murison said there was \"a lack of cooperation\" quite so, Mr. Weir refuses to\ncooperate and has consistently refused.\n\nI will give you just one or two instances of his cooperation.\n\nA few winters ago, our pump broke down, and I mentioned the matter to Mr. Weir. We had patients in the hospital and the lake water was unfit for drinking especially in winter. I asked that we might have ice brought to which he replied he couldn't. You must requisition for it. This would have taken a month at the least. What were we to do in the meantime? I said I should have to write to the Dept. When he sent some ice. There is a sample of his cooperation.\n\nThey had a boy brought back from the Onion Lake Residential School in a dying condition. His mother was also very seriously ill at the time, and could not move (this was a few years ago). I visited them both two and three times a day and took them whatever nourishment they got from our own supply. I met Mr. Weir when I was returning home one day, and I laid the matter before him, and asked that the boy at least might have something provided. (The boy's father was dead, he had a stepfather.) He made excuses again and said there was nothing provided. I said is the boy to starve? I told him I should have to take it up with the Dept. On his way home he brought me some tobacco and a few packages of cornflakes. I do not believe in pampering.\nthe Indians, but surely when they are sick they should be shown a little sympathy. The boy died and then in my report I mentioned how nice it would be if there was a room or building where patients could be placed and given proper care and nourishment. The Dept. kindly came forward and sent cots, bedding and a large tent where I could have the patients in sunshine and afterwards the children dormitories were converted into wards and the hospital has been the means undoubtedly of saving many lives.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nDr. Hutchison\nMatron.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 1)\nI do not wish to add a religious dissertation to the above letter, but whenever I think of Mr. Weir, I cannot help calling to mind the words of one \"who went about doing good,\" who said, \"Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me.\" I have never known anyone who has less sympathy for others than Mr. Weir.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMrs. A. M. Hutchinson, Field Matron at Ahtahkakoops, writes on January 27th (File 107-2-1) concerning the duties of the field matron and her assistant. It appears that the establishment of the cottage hospital has resulted in a great deal of work for these officers. I believe, if any increases in salary are considered at any time, they should be paid by the Medical Vote. Mrs. Hutchinson's letter reads in part as follows: \"The work of the assistant is really very heavy. It includes, besides the preparation of the meals - which vary in character according to the nature of the disease - washing of floors in the wards, dish washing and washing other articles used by patients and the laundering of the clothing and bedding, some of which has to be changed daily.\"\n\nMrs. Hutchinson goes on to speak of her own work as follows: \"When I have patients in the hospital, they have the same attention that they would receive in a large hospital. That is, they get their sponge bath, in some cases, daily, in other cases, twice a week. In typhoid cases it means change of under garments and very often sheets daily. We have had some very serious typhoid cases since the hospital was established and I have not lost one patient so far. When we have serious cases in, it means my being on duty practically 24 hours, for I never ask my assistant to lose her sleep.\"\n\nThe field matron goes on to explain the seriousness of some of the cases she has treated in the cottage hospital and to show that she has been on duty 24 hours a day for five days at a time. Her letter ends with the following: \"The Department kindly came forward and sent oats, bedding and a large tent, where I could have the patients in summer, and afterwards the children's dormitories were converted into wards. The hospital has been the means, undoubtedly, of saving many lives.\"\n\nThere is a likelihood of Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson being moved from Ahtahkakoops this coming summer. I have prepared this memo so that those dealing with the field matron and hospital activity at this point will know something of the nature of the work that is to be done. At present, Mrs. Hutchinson receives $480 per annum and her assistant, Miss A. Ahenakey, $100.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note that the duties in the hospital are quite onerous at times. Your representations are receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. A. M. Hutchinson,\nMont Nebo, Sask.\nIt is a question for the Department schools in this province both city & rural schools & common schools each day at 9:30 until 4:00 from 1st November to 1st April 25th Morning March. This has been our practice here. Now, however, it has been set aside about 1st February of April. I do not know if this District will have instructions. I have delayed the opening at 9:30 until in a week or more until it looks like becoming more fit to handling. This has been done not to these people but to children, as I have only one busman and it became between his house & school. Whereas from 9:30 children have from 2 to 3 miles to travel, & the bus was very late. On this point I had some discussion with April 25th Morning. The answer was to school 11:30 in the morning at 8:00 in the afternoon. Consideration certainly, but I think an 8:00 start time for the teacher should be allowed a certain latitude. For me can say that I have been kept busy with work & for instruction & other things. If anything, I could be said that I have kept them too close to their studies for their benefit anyway, but that's all.\n\nI am the town's name.\n\nJim Robert Thomas\n\nH. MacKenzie\n\nTeacher\nSir:\n\nI understood from you some time ago that you had requested the travelling nurse Miss Colvin, when visiting this Reserve, to call upon Mrs. Hutchinson. Today Mr. Weir brought Miss Colvin here together with the Farm Instructor Montgomery, who, during the interview remained both of them in the room. This fact rendered Miss Colvin's visit a fiasco. How could it be otherwise, since the presence of the men prevented Mrs. Hutchinson from discussing cases to which she wished to refer? Anyway the visit of the nurse was but brief & for the reason given rendered abortive.\n\nIt seems to me that a nurse when visiting a Reserve should discuss with the Matron any cases of more or less importance - but of course this would require some little time - far more than Miss Colvin vouchsafed to stay & the male element should certainly be dispensed with.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd) H. Hutchinson\nAhbahkakoops Indian Day School  \nApril 8th, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nYou will allow me to say that I consider your conduct on Wednesday in bringing the Farm Instructor Montgomery into my house to be present at the interview between the travelling nurse and Mrs. Hutchinson as a piece of great impertinence. Mr. Graham wrote me some time ago to say that he had instructed the nurse to visit Mrs. Hutchinson and I presume, consult with her with regard to the sick cases on this reserve, but I hardly think he suggested that two men should be present on the occasion.\n\nPray, what has Montgomery to do with the medical matters on the reserve? As regards yourself I should have thought that you would have retired and left the two nurses to consult together privately. If you do not know the proper procedure in such cases I should advise you to consult someone who could aid you in this matter. No doubt Mr. Clifford Bell would do this for you were you to ask him.\n\nYours,\n\n(Sgd) H. Hutchinson\nLeask, Sask.\nApril 9th, 1927\n\nNo. 893-31-D\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSir:\n\nOn April 6th, Nurse Colvin, Mr. Montgomery and myself visited Sandy Lake Day School, arriving there according to my watch at 9.18 a.m., en route on a general inspection of the different homes on the reserve.\n\nMr. Hutchinson had not yet arrived. I mentioned to Nurse Colvin that we visit Mrs. Hutchinson first. On our way over we met Mr. Hutchinson at the residence gate according to his watch at 9.15 a.m. on his way over to the school. He did not speak to Nurse Colvin and passed the remark to me that we were early. I said, \"No, you are late.\" Mr. Hutchinson shouted again that we were early, I said 'No' and informed him that 9 a.m. was the correct time for school to open, and in future school was to open at 9 a.m., Mr. Hutchinson shouted at the top of his voice, which could be heard at least a half mile away, and with the school children present playing on ice in front of the school, that 9.30 a.m. was the correct time for school to open, and for me to go and not interfere where I had no business to do so, that I was no gentleman and a snob. Mr. Hutchinson within hearing of the school children also stated that Mr. Murison, and that man (meaning Mr. Montgomery) and myself were rude to Mrs. Hutchinson when we visited her during January last, and that we were not fit to be in a gentleman's house, and that we should have been kicked out. I informed Mr. Hutchinson that such was not the case, and that our conduct was all that could be desired. He then stated that he would fix me for it this time.\n\nWe then interviewed Mrs. Hutchinson, who was very nice to all, and made no mention of remarks made by Mr. Hutchinson. After Nurse Colvin consulted with Mrs. Hutchinson she went over to the school to examine the children. Mr. Hutchinson told the children to move down nearer the back of the school-room, young Tate was standing in the aisle waiting for Mr. Hutchinson to pass, as the boy was apparently in his way he grabbed and flung him into a seat. I consider that such conduct was unwarranted on the part of the teacher, and should not be tolerated. The frame of mind Mr. Hutchinson was in it was useless to talk to him, he taking the stand of the great \"I am\" having no respect for the rulings of the Department regarding school management, that he is always right, and that the Agent and others should not in any manner have anything to do with the school or him.\n\nAt the time I felt that a bit of man handling was what Mr. Hutchinson needed. However, as he is an old man, a person's hands are tied. I might mention that I have had a great number of men to handle in my time, including all classes, and I have never had such impudence and disrespect to put up with than I have had to from Mr. Hutchinson.\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter which I received from Mr. Hutchinson regarding my visit, which will give you an idea of the type of man we have to deal with. I feel that something will have to be done very soon, and for the general welfare of Sandy Lake reserve that Mr. Hutchinson should be removed, as his influence is undoing all the good other officials are endeavouring to do. Sandy Lake is the only reserve where there is any discord in the agency.\n\nIt was on the suggestion of Nurse Colvin that I accompanied her when she visited Mrs. Hutchinson, as the weather was very disagreeable. I saw no reason why Mr. Montgomery should stay outside in the cold. Mrs. Hutchinson had ample opportunity to take up with Nurse Colvin any question she wished when they were alone together in the hospital if she had so desired.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJohn Weir,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter is to inform Your Lordship that the Department presumed you had written to Mr. Hutchinson to the effect that his services were no longer required. This worker was secured by your predecessor. However, by concurrent mail he is being informed that his services will not be required for the coming academic year and that Mrs. Hutchinson, who holds the position of field matron, will be relieved as from August 31st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. B. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\nJuly 26, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nWith further reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, I have to approve of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Goodman to the positions of teacher and field matron at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, Sandy Lake Reserve. Salary will be allowed Mr. Goodman at the rate of $90 per teaching month. Mrs. Goodman will be paid $800 per annum. I trust that they will meet with much success in their new work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. G. E.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nWe have lately been informed that the Indians (who are employed as teachers and nurses on this Reserve) are leaving us. We haven't the least idea why the Department has acted so unfairly to such people who really have done their very best for the Indians.\n\nThe wish of the Indians is that the said employees be kept on with their work if it is any way possible, if it should only till spring.\n\nWe are writing this letter to give these people justice for their services amongst us, which were very highly appreciated by everyone of us.\n\nWe have the honor to be your obedient servants,\n\nChief - Allan Ahenakew\n\nCouncillor Adam Ahenakew\n\nCouncillor\nOttawa, August 12th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the change in teacher and field matron on the Ahtahkakoops Reserve. I regret to inform you that the Department cannot change its decision in this connection. Mr. and Mrs. C.E.

After reviewing our files, I am satisfied that this Band is becoming progressive and that the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School is not entirely meeting the need. The building is very old anyway and not large enough for all the pupils that would attend if vans were used. The more recent requests include a van system (2 outfits).\n\nThere are no funds for special purposes this year and the Department wishes you to have an Inspector make a careful study of the situation, so that improvements can be effected next year. If one day school will meet the requirements, then a site should be selected and you should state whether you recommend transporting some of the children daily. I am enclosing copy of letter to Agent.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed today with Reverend Mr. Ahenakew the school situation on the Ahtahkakoops Reserve. He informs me that these Indians are very progressive now and that better school services should be provided as soon as possible. He believes that the solution is a new school building with accommodation for 40 pupils. Of course, it should be built on the reserve, near the teacher's residence, which is in good condition. Unfortunately, the new school could not be placed midway between the present buildings, as there is a gully there, and it should not be placed near the old classroom because it is on a mission lot.\n\nOf course, two vans would be necessary to draw the children to school, as the Indians do not reside in one group.\n\nRussell Y. Kerr\nAHTAHTAKOOPS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, SANDY LAKE RES.\n\nThis school is in charge of Mr. E. B. Goodman, and I was delighted with the work that is being done.\n\nThe roll calls for 21 pupils, and 18 were present. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 10\n\" II - 4\n\" III - 3\n\" V - 3\n\" VII - 1\n\nThe children\nThe children were all neatly dressed, clean, and, without exception, all had their hair nicely combed.\n\nThe children appeared fairly well along in their work, and were not afraid to speak out. They appeared to understand their lessons, and were keen on making a good showing. The singing was excellent, and was enjoyed by the children, as well as those who listened.\n\nThe school is a log building, which, I understand, was erected in the year 1900. It is in good repair, and accommodates nicely the children now on the roll.\n\nA noon-day meal is prepared by Mrs. Goodman, the Field Matron, and is served in the children's dining room, which is a part of the teacher's residence. The meal consists of vegetable soup, biscuits and tea.\n\nIn addition to the children on the roll, there are about 20 more of school age who live too far away to attend. I am attaching a map which will show fairly accurately the distance the pupils now live away.\n\nIt would appear that hauling the children is out of the question, and that the only solution to this difficult problem would be to recruit from the outlying homes for the Church of England Boarding School. I understand most of these Indians belong to that denomination.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 14th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Carlton Agency, which was made by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nI quite agree with the Inspector that it would be out of the question to provide vans to haul the children to the Ahtahtakoops Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nNov. 7th 1932.\n\nJ. Weir Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHead, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to ask you if you would take up my application for an adjustment of salary with the Dept. at Ottawa.\n\nAt the beginning of the fiscal year, when salaries were reduced 10% or Field Matrons were dismissed; my wife & I received what was equivalent to a 50% cut & in proportion to our income received a heavier cut than any other employee in the Indian Affairs.\nwork. We have worked consistently to the best of our ability for over ten years and cannot understand why we should be singled out for an especially heavy cut in wage reduction! You know my work. I have worked up my school from almost nothing to its present condition of 27 regular attendants to eight grades. I ask that I be paid at least as much as other teachers. I am a married man with children to educate and start out in life. Some single women teachers of Indian Day Schools are receiving as much as $400.00 per annum more than I am and our work is the same. When my wife and I started in this work it was with the understanding that our\nunited salaries made the income.\n\nAll I ask is a fair deal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nErnest B. Goodman.\n\nP.S. My wife is continuing her work just the same without any salary.\n\nE.B.G.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose letter received from Mr. E.B. Goodman, Teacher, Sandy Lake Reserve No. 104, for your consideration.\n\nI may mention that Mr. Goodman is one of the best teachers on this agency. He is a hard worker and takes a great interest in his work and welfare of school children. Last year one of his pupils passed out of Grade 8, and he has several pupils at present in this grade.\n\nHis wife who used to act as Field Matron, is also very efficient, and since her salary was dispensed with has continued with her duties in the usual way. She is a very practical nurse and time is no object when her services are needed.\n\nI fully realize that we are passing through very difficult times and that expenditures are to be kept at the minimum. Though if Mr. Goodman's salary could be increased I certainly would recommend such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. E. B. Goodman, teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, in which he applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, under the terms of the Salary Deduction Act, 1932, no increase in salary can be made to any employee in the Government service during the present fiscal year. I regret, therefore, that the Department will be unable to comply with Mr. Goodman's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Heir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nMr. Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to make application that Mr. E.B. Goodman, teacher of the \"Ahtahkakoops\" Day School, Sandy Lake Reserve, Sask., be allowed the usual salary for a Teacher holding a first-class certificate.\n\nI do this on the following grounds:\n\n(1) He put through a Grade VIII pupil last June who is now attending High School at Brandon and is doing well there.\n\n(2) He has worked up his school until it has reached an enrolment of 33, and an average attendance of 26, and he is teaching pupils in Grades Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, and VIII.\n\n(3) He is a returned soldier, of good education, who was given a teacher's Certificate under the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment scheme after the war, and has been giving satisfaction to the Department's Officers and Inspectors for over ten years.\n\nHis present salary, since the reduction last April, is $810.00. As you know before that date Mrs. Goodman received a salary of $600, which is now discontinued,\nbut she is still continuing her work.\n\nIf he could be allowed the same salary as a first-class teacher this would help him with the education of his children.\n\nHoping that this request may receive favourable consideration,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Saskatchewan\n\nBp/P\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 24th ultimo, requesting, on behalf of Mr. E. B. Goodman, teacher of the Ahtahkskoopa Indian Day School, that he be granted an increase in salary commensurate with that allowed a teacher having first class professional qualifications.\n\nIn reply I have to inform Your Lordship that, under the terms of the Salary Deduction Act of 1932 and on authority of rulings of the Treasury Board, no increases in salary can be granted to any employees in the Government Service during the present fiscal year. I regret, therefore, that we will be unable to consider any increase in salary to Mr. Goodman at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Hallam, D.D.,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.\nJune 24th, 1956\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please advise me if it is in order for four non-treaty children to attend Sandy Lake Reserve No. 104 Indian Day School. Adam Ahanekew their uncle a member of this Band has been receiving in part certain funds for their board as their father who is non-treaty is Manager of a Trading Post about three hundred miles north of here and at which point there is no school. I am given to understand it is the intention of the provincial Government to erect a school at this point when funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, July 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, requesting to be advised if it would be in order for four non-treaty children to attend the Ahtahakoops (Sandy Lake) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, provided the teacher would be prepared to accept them; that they would not be in excess of the number of pupils for which seating accommodation is available and that they would not interfere with the regular classroom instruction of the Indian pupils, the Department would have no objection to permitting them to attend. When the school re-opens after the holidays, you should discuss this matter with the teacher, and, if you both consider it advisable, the Department will have no objection to the four non-treaty children referred to being permitted to attend. However, their names should not appear on the quarterly returns of attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nL e a s k, Sask.\nAug. 24, 1935\n\nI. Phrahkakooops\nM. Nebo P.O.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn 1932 I wrote to the Indian Department at Ottawa asking for a readjustment of my salary; my request was refused. I herein repeat my request for an increase of salary & state my case as follows:\n\nI started teaching in the Fort \u00e0 la Corne Days School in 1922 & my wife was appointed Field Matron that same year. In 1927 we were transferred to Sandy Lake Reserve, Carlton Agency. In 1928 the Dept. abolished the position of Field Matron & received a 10% cut. So that at the end of ten years work our income was reduced from $1500.00 per annum to $810.00 per annum.\n\nMy wife has continued to carry on her work regardless of salary & has saved the Dept. several hundreds of dollars. I have worked conscientiously & consistently & I have brought my school up to a standard of proficiency equal to any Sask. Provincial School, with an attendance of 38 pupils & a\naverage of $30 for the year. I like my work & am willing to stay at it indefinitely but at the same time I feel that I am entitled to consideration & fair treatment at Ottawa. I have a bigger school & more work than most other teachers & am receiving a smaller salary.\n\nNewly appointed teachers are being paid more while I am allowed no credit for my length of service.\n\nSister teachers with smaller schools are being paid more. I am a married man & have children to keep & educate & start in life.\n\nI was I believe the first Day School teacher in Saskatchewan to pull pupils through grade VIII into High School. This year I have all the grades except grade VIII. I have continued the mid-day meal without any assistance from the Deptt. for 3 years.\n\nFor information regarding myself, my work & my school I would refer you to\nGentlemen:\n\nMr. P.S. Davis, The Bishop of Saskatchewan, The Minister of Education, Mr. J.W. Estey, Regina, & my School Inspector Mr. Ferris of Shell Lake.\n\nI mentioned this matter to Mr. Morrison some years ago & he told me to carry on my work to the best of my ability & the Dept. would see me fairly.\n\nThis letter is in no way a complaint neither is it an expression of dissatisfaction with my occupation but rather an appeal for consideration & fair treatment.\n\nI like my work & am happy in it.\n\nI trust that you will consider my case with sympathy & if possible grant my request.\n\nI remain faithfully yours,\n\nErnest B. Goodman.\nLeask, Sask.\nAugust 3rd, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am forwarding to you at the request of Mr. E.B. Goodman, Teacher, Sandy Lake Reserve No. 104, Indian Day School, re question of salary adjustment.\n\nIf at all possible I would very strongly recommend his salary be increased, as there is no doubt he is a very efficient teacher and has brought school up to a very high standard.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill, M.D.\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, August 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. E. B. Goodman, teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, I beg to say that present regulations do not permit our increasing salaries of teachers in Indian day schools. Under these circumstances, the Department is not in a position to consider Mr. Goodman's request at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. S.

Hoey Esq.\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was, this afternoon, talking to Mr. Christiansen about my work here & my troubles & he advised me to write you what I had been telling him. He assured me that my letter would not just make kindling at Ottawa.\n\nI have been teaching in Indian Day Schools for 15\u00bd years. I taught for 5\u00bd years at Fort \u00e0 la Corne & ten years in my present school, Ahishkakop\u00e9 Day School.\n\nWhen I came there the school was in a wretched condition with an average attendance of 6 & I had a lot of hostility to contend with. I worked hard & put my best into it & within two years I had brought the attendance up to 32 Treaty Indians & 6 Non-Treaty. The average for the quarter ending Dec. 31st 1928 (of Treaty Indian Pupils) was 24.0%. From that time until the present I have maintained a full school; having had the quarterly average attendance go above the 30 mark & I have had as many as 42 pupils attending.\nI was, I believe, the first Day School teacher in Saskatchewan to put a pupil through Grade VIII into High School. That pupil, Lancelot Henderson, will attend the next session at Normal School in Saskatoon. Another ex-pupil of mine, Ida Vandal, was among the group of students chosen to go to the Coronation. Other ex-pupils of mine are also doing well.\n\nI receive a salary of $900.00 per annum. During the past 15\u00bd years I have never received an increase in salary. In fact, for a time my salary was cut 10%. I have on two occasions asked for an increase and have each time received a polite refusal.\n\nI am a married man of 41 years of age with a family to educate & provide for. There are single women teachers with smaller schools, less achievement & not nearly the number of years service to their credit that I have, receiving larger salaries. It does not seem at all fair. Farm Instructors, Clerks & Agents all receive regular increases & are allowed to subscribe toward a pension for their old age.\n\nI have to send my children to Prince Albert to school & with our own living expenses I cannot save anything.\n\nApart from my own activities, my wife has worked without stint for the Indians & thereby her nursing, saved the Indian Dept. many hundreds of dollars. When we first started in the work she was appointed Field Matron & received a salary of $600.00 per annum. On April 1st, 1932, her position\nsalary were abolished. Ever since then she has carried on her work without pay; I have never refused a call for help, or has often been away all night on a maternity case. Every time the doctor visits a case he receives $1.00 per visit, but whenever I drive my wife to nurse a case I have to dig into my own pocket to pay the expense of gas & oil.\n\nSince Jan. 1st, 1936 the Dept. have paid my wife $10.00 per month for dispensing drugs.\n\nEvery day school is free my wife cooks a hot meal for the school children. She receives nothing for this work. For about 2 years the Indian Dept. refused to grant any material or money (except biscuits) for the midday meal. During that period we provided the midday meal out of our own pockets. With the exception of one month, when my wife was too ill to attend to it, the children never went without their hot midday meal. We have never received any compensation or even thanks from the Indian Dept.\n\nBeing an Indian Day School teacher seems to carry a stigma with it. I can obtain no promotion. I feel that I am a parish of the Indian Dept.; I am sorry if I sound bitter, but I sometimes find it difficult not to be.\n\nBefore I spoke with Mr. Christianson I had already written a request for an increase in salary to the local Indian Agent Mr. R.S. Davis; asking him to put my request before the Official of the Dept. at Ottawa; so if you hear my request\nI am a returned soldier. I served as a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force.\n\nIf you can help me to improve my condition, I will be very grateful.\n\nYours truly,\n\nErnest B. Goodman.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nIn a letter dated August 27th, Mr. E.B.

The whole building\ncould be put into good shape with convenience at less cost\nthan a new school. So far as I can see, this would be an\neconomical arrangement, both for capital expenditure and\nmaintenance.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - Your letter of Sept. 18th, file 107-2-4\n\nAccording to your letter Mr. E.

I am writing this letter in case you thought there was unnecessary delay at this end.

I will let you know as soon as possible.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Superintendent,\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nNovember 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 18 and also a report on the Ahtshkakoops Indian Day School, submitted to you by Inspector Ferris.\n\nI note with interest the Inspector's suggestion, that it might be left to the discretion of the teacher as to when the long holiday should take place.\n\nIt is highly desirable that no misunderstanding should exist with respect to the conditions that prompted the Government to operate the schools on a 9 month rather than a 10 month basis. The records here indicate that attendance at Indian day schools throughout the Dominion has never been wholly satisfactory during the month of September. This unsatisfactory condition appeared most acute on a number of the larger reserves, such as the Tyendinaga and Six Nations Reserves in Ontario and was due, no doubt, in part, to the desire on the part of the Indians to have the older boys and girls engage in farm work - berry-picking, potato picking, etc. When the matter came up for discussion, the officials felt that the Government could scarcely afford to keep schools open and in operation with the attendance out of all proportion to the actual enrolment. For this reason and in an attempt to conserve public funds, therefore, it was decided to operate our schools for 9 months during the academic year. I note, however, from inspectors' reports, that almost every month in the school year has been suggested as the month during which certain schools should be kept closed. June has been suggested because certain Indian bands are anxious to get away from the reserve on hunting or fishing excursions -\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\nexcursions at this time. January has been suggested because of the severe weather usually prevalent in that month. December has been suggested from the standpoint of the convenience of the teachers, many of whom are anxious to get home early for the Christmas holidays. You can readily understand, therefore, the utter confusion that will result if we attempt to comply with these suggestions.\n\nIt should be pointed out also that an attempt is made to have our school supplies reach the schools on or about the actual opening date. This year we have failed in this respect because of the difficulty the Stationery Office has experienced in securing certain supplies. However, if certain schools open in September, having been closed in June, and others open in October, we shall require a special official here to keep the Treasury officials and the Stationery Office constantly notified of these changes. I am of the opinion, therefore, that unless local conditions are very exceptional, our schools should open on October first of each year and close on June 30.\n\nThe days in which we are living are, as you know, extremely critical, and it is our hope that we shall be able to secure the closest possible cooperation of our teachers and agents in carrying out regulations, the necessity for which may not always appear self-evident to the officials in the field.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nBig River Reserve,\nShell River P.O.,\nSask.\n\nNov 27th, 1940\n\nTo Mr. Hoey,\nSupt. of Indian Welfare,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nKnowing that a change was likely to be made at Sandy Lake, (not rumor this time) I took the opportunity to apply to the Rt. Rev. Bishop Martin asking that I be transferred there.\n\nToday I have received his reply, and though he was not able to say anything definite as yet, the one obstacle seems to be the fact that the Indian Dept. have made it plain that the appointment of women teachers is not looked upon with favor, and I believe has written to you to know your mind on the matter.\n\nWhilst realising that Mr. Goodman's appointment has been held up temporarily, and that until it develops further he will keep the school, I should like the transfer very much in the event of a vacancy. I do not feel that a transfer would count the same as a new appointment, and as there are both resident farm-instructor, and missionary, the necessity for a man must be considerably less. In addition, there are sufficient men speaking English on the reserve to be able to fight their own battles, which would save me the necessity of trying to fight for them.\n\nSo far as the size of the school is concerned I should welcome the extra scope, and though I should not perhaps be able to attain Mr. Goodman's standard of manual instruction, I feel I should be able to continue some of the work, and in fact have applied repeatedly for tools for such work here, and should I find myself seriously handicapped, I believe there are carpenters on the reserve to whom I could apply for advice. May I call your attention to the fact that I began a manual instruction class whilst on the prairie, and I believe you have particulars of my services in Canada on file at Ottawa, so that you will have the Inspector's reference to this class. So far as the girls are concerned we have received both needle-work and knitting awards during the exhibitions of the last two years, in competition with schools far larger, and in addition to awards for exercise books etc.\n\nI have an efficient companion who is able to do...\nsupervise the cooking of the midday meal, and to assist in school when necessary, though she is not a teacher. But then neither would a man's wife be a teacher.\n\nI am sending a copy of this to the Bishop, and feel sure that such a transfer would be to the advantage of all concerned.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Present regulations do not provide for assuring them of a position at the end of the war. However, there is no doubt that if a position is available when you return from overseas and you are in physical condition to fill it the Department will give you the preference.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Davis has just been to see me, informing me that Mr. Goodman has been called up for duty with the R.C.A.F. This will leave the Ahtahkakoops school vacant.\n\nAs you know, Miss Merrett has written you about being appointed to the school. Indian Agent Davis, in talking to me, said he would strongly object to her appointment. The main ground for his objection is that they desire a trained nurse on that reserve. It is a big reserve, and from that reserve they also serve reserves to the north.\n\nI, therefore, wish to nominate Mr. W.L. Bigg who is at present living in Alberni, British Columbia. Mr. Bigg holds a first-class certificate for Saskatchewan and before going to the coast was principal of the school in Spiritwood. His wife is a trained nurse. He was recommended to me by Inspector Ferris of the Saskatchewan Department of Education. Mr. Ferris speaks very highly of this man's ability. From all I have heard Mr. Bigg seems to be a splendidly equipped man for this important school.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Bigg by this mail telling him that I am nominating him to you. Will you please let me know as soon as you can as to whether you approve the nomination.\n\nWith the Season's Greetings,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nMr. R.A.

The basement contained sufficient vegetables to supply the school till the end of June. The garden was kept ready for the spring seeding.\n\nI notice in your letter that the Indian Dept. will not assure me of reemployment.

I have had no chance of seeing my inspector's reports, but so far as I know, they are satisfactory, and ever since I have been on the Reserve I have administered the Indian medicines, and helped where possible. So far as the carpentry is concerned, I have asked repeatedly for tools here, but cannot get them, housewifery and needlework, should be shown in the Inspector's report, so I still cannot understand why I was turned down.\n\nAs all the children, and parents have a mild attack of the 'flu', nothing I cannot handle without a doctor, it was decided on consultation with the chief councillor not to open school until Jan. 13th, one week from today. I could not consult Mr. Davis as he is away, but have written to Mr. Christianson, and trust it is in order.\n\nI shall be glad to have the letters returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir;\n\nSome eighteen years ago I went to the Orpheum Theatre in Prince Albert, Sask., to hear you address a public meeting. I was about sixteen at the time; the impression you left on my young mind has persisted through the years enabling me to feel confident that my letter will at least fall on responsive and sympathetic ears.\n\nIt is 5 months since I took charge of this school. My impressions on the evening of my first day here were typical of the general attitude towards the Indian problem. Wherever I have discussed the Indian and his education, and I have discussed it with everything from an Indian Agent, to three or four members of the Saskatchewan Legislature, I have run into the same feeling of resignation, the same feeling of hopelessness, and helplessness in the face of Indian lethargy, laziness and indifference. That is apparently a true picture of the average adult Indian. That is not true of the average 6 year old. They are as quick as keen, as energetic, and as intelligent as any children I have ever taught, and I have had eight years of teaching outside of Indian schools. I have been through the mill of rural schools with the usual Grade 1 to 11 business, and I have taught in town schools as well.\n\nFrom what I have seen and experienced in the short time I have been here has convinced me that sympathetic, but adequately trained teachers, could and would raise a very high percentage of the Indian children to a spiritual, cultural and economic level, comparing favorably to the society of the outside world.\n\nThere is however a fly in the ointment. First and last, these children should be fed. They quite definitely are not getting enough to eat, either at home, or through the facilities of the school lunch.\n\nI do not believe that the standard of teaching is high enough either. I do not believe that my own technical ability is sufficient to get the best out of these children. I intend to remedy the latter situation as quickly as possible. The results I have obtained since coming here give me the confidence and the courage to fight for these children, and fight hard. I am not particularly religious in the usual sense of the term, but after coming here and learning to know a little bit about some of these children, and after learning to love a few of the little rascals, I'll never know spiritual peace again until I have done all that is in my power to see that they get a square deal from the powers that be.\n\nAs I see my work here; it is simply this, I am working for these children, and no-one else. My duty is towards the children rather than towards the writers of my cheque. I have a strong feeling that you will help me, so long as I help these children. These children need food, and given food and well trained and sympathetic teachers, they can\nand will become independent of further help.\n\nOf course, speaking for the children of this particular school. I do not presume to prescribe a blanket remedy for the whole problem of Indian education.\n\nI notice that I have used the word \"sympathetic\" with regards to teachers, twice. Possibly I had better define it as I meant it.\n\nI mean a teacher who likes children, any children, and who really wants to help them. To put it another way. If this school was built to enable me, or someone else, to make a comfortable living here, then it were better that it burn down, or that it had never been built. Far too many of these Indians have nothing but distrust and hatred for their white masters. Masters we are, dictators if we like to be honest with ourselves. They do not trust us, they do not like us, they hate some of us; and they believe none of us, when we try to tell them that we have their interests at heart. I do not believe that it is the Indians fault that such is the case. I don't believe that it is the Norwegians fault that they don't like or trust Hitler, who, in his own words, is there only to protect them from aggression. We seem to be here to protect the Indian from the impact of the white man's way of life. We certainly were not invited to do so. I feel that the responsibility is entirely ours. That if we fail it is our fault. Either we have used the wrong methods or we have used the wrong people to put the methods into operation.\n\nThese people are worth all my efforts. I have promised them and I have promised myself, that I will always be ready to help them, even though it may at times get me in wrong all around.\n\nMy real purpose in writing this letter is to try and contact someone in authority who will at least consider my ideas. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Davis the Indian Agent at Leask, and to the Bishop of Saskatchewan. I do not want anyone to get the idea that I am trying anything so stupid as, to pull a fast one.\n\nTrusting that you are as greatly concerned as I am,\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours obediently\n\nWalter L. Bigg (teacher)\n\nAhtahkakoops Day School.\nMont Nebo, Sask.\nOttawa, June 18, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Bigg:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 6th instant, in which you discuss in a very interesting and arresting way the existing conditions at the Ahtahkakoops School and on the Ahtahkakoops Indian Reserve.\n\nIt was to me somewhat flattering to note that you remembered an address I had delivered at Prince Albert about 15 years ago. If I remember correctly, I was accompanied on that occasion by Mr. Andrew Knox, and I have still very pleasant memories of the large and attentive audience.\n\nI am particularly pleased that you brought to my personal attention certain conditions that are confronting you, and I am glad also that you are sending a copy of this letter to Indian Agent Davis and to His Lordship the Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nI cannot of course agree with all the conclusions you have reached in respect to the Indians, the progress they have made and are likely to make and the attitude of the Government to our native people. In view of your earnestness and transparent sincerity, I am anxious that you should not fall into the fallacy of reasoning from the particular to the general. We should not, for example when we meet a bad man, arrive at the conclusion that all men are bad; nor should we conclude, when we come in contact with a backward, dissatisfied group of Indians, that all Indians are backward and dissatisfied.\n\nIt was admitted at a Seminar Conference, organized by the Universities of Toronto and Yale and held at Toronto three years ago, that the Indians of Canada had perhaps made greater progress than any other primitive people of whom the delegates in attendance had knowledge. We had at that conference representatives from the continent of North America and Professor Loram, who was for a great many years adviser on native peoples to the government of South Africa.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that I was engaged in conversation with the member of Parliament for Brant when your letter reached my desk. Just as I opened it this member was informing me that the more he\n\nMr. Walter L. Bigg,\nTeacher,\nAhtahkakoops Indian Day School,\nMont Nebo, Sask.\ncame in contact with the Indians of the Six Nations Reserve at Brantford the more he became impressed by their loyalty to the Crown and their devotion to democratic institutions. This group of Indians have already contributed this year $1,000 from their own funds to the work of the Red Cross. May I be permitted to submit another illustration extracted from the thousands that reach us almost monthly. The Indians in the Kenora Agency were this year particularly anxious to secure flags (Union Jacks) that these might be placed on their tents and tepees at treaty payment time as an indication of their loyalty to the Crown, and I might go on, but I feel this is not necessary.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, a copy of my report for the month of November, prepared by me for the Director of this Branch. I should add that the excerpts contained in this report were not selected but taken at random from the reports that had reached the Department about that time. These reports, of course, refer particularly to British Columbia. In this province, I am inclined to think that our Indian schools are perhaps as good as, or indeed one might say a little better than, any other schools operated anywhere in Canada.\n\nI cannot persuade myself that we can do much to help Indians by \"doing something for them\". Our success will be determined largely by our ability to encourage them to do something for themselves. If I have any criticism to offer of the Government's Indian policy in Canada, I would say that when times were good and money was plentiful they appeared to have done too much for the Indians and failed to encourage these people to do something for themselves.\n\nYou, of course, are confronted with certain practical problems from day to day, and you are interested only - and rightly so - in ways and means whereby you can assist the pupils committed to your care. If I were in charge of an Indian day school I would attempt to teach the Indians how to look after their bodies and use their hands. This means a program balanced between academic and vocational instruction. Where a program of this character has been adopted the progress, as you will note from the reports, has been truly phenomenal.\n\nI note with interest your reference to the fact that Indians should be fed. This is a task that should be undertaken by the Indians themselves, under the direction and guidance of the Indian agent. If the resources on the reserve lands, wood supply, water, etc., are at all adequate, it should be comparatively easy for even a group of Indians to become self-sustaining. In certain sections of northern Canada I have been encouraging the Indians to destroy all dogs other than those necessary\nfor transportation and to keep goats. Five goats, I have learned, consume less feed than one cow. The milk supply of these animals is nutritious and beneficial. The goat, by the way, is one of the few animals not subject to tuberculosis.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult, of course, to send forward advice from this distance. Only a man reasonably familiar with local conditions can work out a satisfactory program. It is my hope, however, that you will have an opportunity to discuss your program very fully with the Indian agent and that your joint efforts will contribute substantially to the progress of the Indians on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nLeask, Sask.\nAugust 25th/41.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Day School Teacher at Sandy Lake Reserve is more or less of a trouble maker and where possible is unable to mind his own business; As this Band is going ahead fairly well, I consider it in the best interests of the Indians that he be moved to some other reserve.\n\nI understand there are a few vacancies at the present time.\n\nThe Teacher's wife at this point was recommended to us as a qualified nurse, but has no experience whatsoever along these lines, and as the reserve is miles away from a doctor, we should have someone with at least average nursing experience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nR.S. Davis.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1941.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of December 13, 1940, nominating Mr. and Mrs. W.L. Bigg for duties at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School. In that letter you stated that Mrs. Bigg was a trained nurse. I am now in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Davis which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The teacher's wife at this point was recommended to us as a qualified nurse but has no experience whatsoever along these lines and as the reserve is miles away from a doctor we should have someone with at least average nursing experience.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if arrangements could be made to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Bigg to some other Indian day school for which you nominate teachers in order that successors might be secured who would be qualified to handle the work that is required on the Ahtahkakoops Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. H.D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWill you please excuse me for my apparent neglect in not answering your letter dated September 9 regarding Mr. Bigg and his appointment to Ahtahkakoops School. My reason for delaying is that I have been away from Prince Albert for the last five weeks, spending the time in Eastern Canada doing deputation work on behalf of the missionary work in Western Canada.\n\nI am quite surprised regarding your suggestion that we transfer Mr. and Mrs. Rigg to some other Indian School. I fully appreciate the fact regarding the wife being recommended as a qualified nurse. At the time of my appointment that was my definite understanding and I cannot understand where the mistake was made. Anyway, even if she were a trained nurse, I doubt if she could spend much time on the Reserve simply because she has young children who would demand practically all her spare time.\n\nI wonder, Mr. Hoey, if you could give me some time to look around regarding this matter. It is my understanding from a previous letter of yours that teachers should not be asked to be transferred during holidays. Moreover, the difficulties of transferring a man at this time of year from one Indian School to another, as you can well understand, are considerable.\n\nFrom what I have heard from the Inspector, Mr. Bigg\nis a first class teacher. From what I know of my personal contact with him he is most keen about his work and very devoted in his work for the Indians. As far as I have found him he is one of the most interested and zealous workers for the ultimate welfare of the Indians that we have here.\n\nWe have always had a good teacher in this School and where I can find a man teacher to carry on the traditions set by the former teachers, I do not know. So many men teachers from this Province have enlisted and the situation just now is a grave one. Moreover, a man must be devoted to Indian work to be only paid nine months in the year and to have to provide for himself and his family for three months in the year independent of his school salary.\n\nI am sure you appreciate my difficulties in this matter, and I do ask that you will give me some time to look around that I may be able, first of all, to find a suitable teacher to succeed Mr. Bigg and also find a suitable school for him to be transferred to.\n\nThanking you for your kindness, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nMr. R.A.

I am communicating with the Indian Agent in respect to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. H.D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rt. Rev. H.D. Martin, in which he nominates Miss E.M. Ratz of Wimer, Sask., as teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Ratz will be allowed salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus cost-of-living bonus, and her appointment will date from October 1, 1942. I enclose the necessary forms which she should complete and return to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, September 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nThis is to advise you that the services of Mr. W.J. Riggs, teacher, Akatahakospe Indian Day School, ceased effective July 1, 1942. Would you kindly let me have a cheque in his favour for the amount at his credit in the Retirement Fund?\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.W. JACKSON\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOTTAWA.\nP.A. Hoy Esq.,\nSept. Wilkie & Sons,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter dated July 30, 1942,\n\nThe Treasury Branch has not issued the cheque due to me from the retirement fund; nor has it issued the cheque for Mrs. W.T. Bigg's nursing service for July. It is possible that by the time this reaches you the matter may have been attended to, but since the need is urgent I feel obliged to write about it.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours truly,\nWalter T. Bigg\nOttawa,\nSeptember 26, 1948.\n\nEX D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, I am informed by the Treasury Branch that a cheque for the amount to your credit in the retirement fund is being issued and should reach you within the next few weeks.\n\nA cheque for $10.00, covering her salary as field matron for the month of July, was forwarded to Mrs. Bigg on September 5 and no doubt has reached her by this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.L. Bigg,\nBox 64,\nCarrot River, Sask.\nMont Rebo, Sask.,\nOct. 8, 1942.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBeing accepted to teach the Indian Day school here, I arrived Sept. 29th. The trip from Winnipeg, Sask., entailed considerable expense, having to bring furniture.\n\nAlthough I have kept school going, I find I shall be unable to carry on. The whole proposition is too much. Up to now I have not seen the Agent, although I have written him. I came here to teach, not to be a janitor and charwoman as well. Found the place quite dirty. There are two furnaces, one that requires four feet logs and which I found choked with ashes. The water does not come up in the taps and there are no utensils for giving the children their noon day meal.\nAll this is much too much to expect of anyone, let alone a woman of 54 years.\n\nI herewith beg of you to pay my expenses and transportation back to Winnipeg and let someone stronger have the position.\n\nOtherwise there may be the added expense of keeping me in a mental hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) E. M. Ratz.\nOttawa, October 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received by the Department from Miss E. M. Ratz, teacher at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could make arrangements to visit this school and while there to see that the school building and the teacher's residence are both properly cleaned. You should also make arrangements for the purchase of the supplies necessary to provide a noonday lunch.\n\nThis school has been in charge of a married man and his wife until now, and I am not at all sure that the decision to send a single girl there was a wise one. However, this teacher was nominated by the Bishop and there is little that we can do about it at this date. It is just possible that you may have to make arrangements whereby someone will look after the furnaces. An allowance of $6.00 a month is usually made for this work.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T. B. Prince,\nIn charge\nCarlton Indian Agency Office,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, October 16, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Ratz:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you discuss the conditions confronting you when you arrived at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nIt is just possible that these conditions, in part at least, may be due to the transfer of Indian Agent Davis from the Carlton agency to the Touchwood agency. This transfer took place a few weeks ago. This will explain why you have not received a reply to the letters written by you to the agent. There is, however, a clerk in charge of the agency at the present time and it is my intention to communicate with him today. I am asking him, if it is at all convenient, to visit this school and do everything humanly possible to make conditions as comfortable for you as they can possibly be made.\n\nYou are aware, no doubt, that this school has been for years in charge of a married teacher and his wife, and I am not at all sure that it was wise to send a single teacher to take charge of the school. However, this is a matter over which the Department has very little control, and I feel confident that the Bishop did all he possibly could to secure a suitable teacher.\n\nIf there are senior pupils at the school, these pupils should be taught, as part of their regular educational program, to keep the classroom clean and in good order. If there are heavy tasks, such as the scrubbing of the floor and attending firesides, these should be undertaken by the caretaker. If there is a shortage of utensils necessary to supply a noonday lunch, these should be immediately purchased. I am asking the clerk to deal with these matters immediately.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that these are critical days in which we are living and days that demand a large measure of self-sacrifice and devotion on the part of all of us. It is my hope that you will be able to see your way clear to remain at Ahtahkakoops for the present academic year at least. If, however, you feel that you cannot do this, you should communicate with the Bishop at once, asking him for a transfer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMiss E. M. Ratz,\nTeacher,\nAhtahkakoops Indian Day School,\nMont Nebo, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter file 107-2-1 dated the 16th, instant, to Mr. Prince regarding Ahtahka-koops Day School.\n\nAs I was visiting the agency at the request of Mr. Christianson, I have visited Sandy Lake School and had a talk with Miss Ratz the teacher. Miss Ratz informed me that she was leaving the school at the end of the month, as she has been teaching in a Provincial school for the past 25 years and she had five years to go before receiving her pension, if she continued teaching in the Indian Day school she would lose her pension.\n\nThis morning I was advised that she had left the school and returned to Wimmer, Sask., with her brother who had come to take her home.\n\nShe seemed to have been upset over the water system and keeping up the pressure in the taps, this was caused by the pumping of straight water and not allowing air to be pumped with it.\n\nI visited the school shortly before leaving for Punnichy and the school was fairly clean, the only thing was that the ashes had not been cleaned out of the furnace which was only a few minutes job.\n\nMiss Ratz as you are aware was quite an elderly lady and naturally a little fussy.\n\nI would recommend that the next teacher when appointed be a married man, as it is very unsatisfactory to have a single person in a school of this size. I have made arrangements to see Archdeacon Paul tomorrow morning and he will no doubt be getting in touch with you. The question of getting a married teacher will be taken up.\n\nI am enclosing herewith forms in connection with Miss Ratz appointment as they may be needed for Departmental files. Miss Ratz taught from Oct. 1st, to Oct. 21st, inclusive. I would ask you to forward a cheque to her at Wimmer, Sask., as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nClerk in Charge,\nT. B. Prince.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School\nNo. 600\n\nIn Mr. Hoey's memorandum of September 5 you were advised of the appointment of Miss Ratz as teacher. A communication just received from the Indian Agent states that she gave up duties on October 31. Consequently payment should only be made to her for the period October 1 to October 31 inclusive. Her cheque should be sent to her at Wimer, Sask. I will advise you later regarding the name of the teacher who will succeed her.\n\nI attach the usual forms which were completed by Miss Ratz.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 27, 1948.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding Miss Ratz, teacher of the Ahtahakoops Day School. It is noted that she gave up duties on October 21. Payment of the amount due her will be made.\n\nI note from your letter that you have arranged to interview Archdeacon Paul regarding a teacher for this school. We will await the results of that interview.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. T.B. Prince,\nIn Charge Indian Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\nOctober 26, 1942.\n\nThe Hon. H. Staines,\nMinister of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools and Superannuation Fund.\n\nOwing to the present scarcity of teachers, I am experiencing great difficulty in finding teachers for the Indian Day Schools.\n\nWe had six vacancies to fill in this Diocese after the summer vacation; and five new teachers started to work in these schools on October 1st. One was Miss E.M. Ratz who went to Sandy Lake Reserve School. She had been paying into the Saskatchewan Superannuation Fund for 25 years; and when she found that teaching an Indian Day School would not enable her to continue the benefits of that Fund, she left on short notice. The school is consequently now vacant.\n\nMr. P. Farebrother is teaching at Big River Reserve, and he is in a similar difficulty. He has been paying into the Fund for 20 years, and if he cannot continue on this Fund by teaching this school, he wants to leave at Christmas.\n\nI have always tried to nominate to the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa qualified and experienced teachers; and it is disappointing to have to lose them because they cannot continue on the Superannuation Fund when teaching in Indian Schools.\n\nThe teachers are qualified Saskatchewan teachers, and the schools are inspected by the Superintendents of your Department; and I should like to ask if arrangements could not be made between your Department and the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa, whereby teachers be allowed to continue on the Saskatchewan Superannuation Fund when teaching Indian Day Schools.\nThis matter is very important at the present time, when most of the younger male teachers have enlisted in H.M. Forces; and we have of necessity to employ older teachers, and it seems most unfair that they should have to relinquish their superannuation benefits after contributing to the Fund for many years.\n\nHoping that something can be done to remove this difficulty,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOR YOUR INFORMATION\nOttawa, November 3, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are enclosing herewith Dominion of Canada cheque No.19756, for $77.85, in your favour, being refund of Retirement Fund account.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nL.W.

It is most difficult, as you well know, to secure teachers in these times, especially in Saskatchewan. My nominee is Mr. J.N. Ross of Macom, Saskatchewan.\n\nMr. Ross taught for three months at Big Whitefish Lake Indian Day School but was compelled to leave on account of the isolation and its effect upon his wife. Sandy Lake is of course much less isolated and there is a missionary and his wife and also a farm instructor and his wife living adjacent to the school. Mr. Ross has had considerable experience in teaching in rural schools and I feel he is well equipped to handle the situation at Sandy Lake. During his short stay with us at Big Whitefish he gave every satisfaction.\n\nWill you please let me have a reply at your early convenience because I would like to have the school opened as soon as possible.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nThe Secretary,\nWelfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School\nNo. 660\n\nIn my memorandum of October 27, I advised you of the resignation of the teacher, Miss E.M. Katz. To succeed her the Department has appointed Mr. J.H. Ross at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month. I am not certain when Mr. Ross will begin duties, but I will advise you definitely as soon as this information is received. I attach copy of letter of appointment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1948.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. J.N. Ross as teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month. You do not state when he will be ready to begin duties, but he should get in touch with Mr. T.B. Prince, Leask, Sask., who is in charge of the Carlton Agency at the present time, and they can mutually agree on what date the school should be re-opened.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nEXTRACT from Inspector's Report on the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, dated 6 December, 1945.\n\nThe effect of the family allowance on school attendance has been very marked. The present accommodations are taxed to capacity and yet there are twenty or more children on the reserve who cannot attend because of lack of room. As it is the teacher's time is very largely taken up with the very large Grade I class and the higher grades receive less attention possibly than they should. A second classroom would seem to be needed urgently.\n\nI was pleased with the cleanliness and general well being of the children. They were well behaved, happy and certainly industrious as the children of the average white school. This speaks well for the teacher.\n\nEXD.\nGrade 3\n2100\nCredit 8\n2 yrs back and\n2 yrs prior\nmention in\nattendance Summer\nSession\nPrince Albert,\nNovember 6, 1948\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nEnclosed find two nominal rolls of schools completed this week. First Ahtahkakoops School, Sandy Lake. There are 42 pupils on the roll of this school, 39 were examined, 3 were not attending school, 3 were free of dental defects, I was not treated, being absent from school. 17 adults received treatment.\n\n| Summary       | School | Outside |\n|---------------|--------|---------|\n| Examinations  | 39     | --      |\n| Extractions   | 22     | 35      |\n| Fillings      | 109    | 4       |\n| Prophylaxis   | 19     |         |\n| Treatments    | 1      |         |\n|               | 190    | 39      |\n\nAverage Dental Defects - Pupils - 43\n\nThe pupils of this school are clean and with a few exceptions appear to be quite healthy. No noon day lunch is served. The children bring their own lunch and must remain at school for lunch. I was informed that hot cocoa and vitamin biscuits are served during the cold weather. This is the most efficiently run school that I have been in so far. I completed this school on Tuesday, November 2nd. Mr. Dowsdell, the Farm Instructor, moved me to Mistawasis School, Wednesday morning. I set up equipment in the Agency Office and stayed with Mr. Bell, Farm Instructor. There are only 16 pupils on the roll of this school. 13 were examined, 3 were free of Dental defects - 2 were not attending school, 1 (Matilda Whitefish) was not at school. I examined this girl at the Big River Anglican School but did not do any treatment for her as she was absent from school.\n\n| Summary       | School | Outside |\n|---------------|--------|---------|\n| Examinations  | 13     | -       |\n| Extractions   | 9      | 9       |\n| Fillings      | 37     | -       |\n| Prophylaxis   | 7      | 9       |\n|               | 66     | 9       |\nAverage Dental Defects per pupil 5.3\n\nThis was the least efficiently run school that I have been at - the pupils come and go as they wish and I was informed that the only reason the pupils attended at all was that Rev. Moore provided a good lunch at his own expense.\n\nOral hygiene and tooth brushes are unknown at any of the schools. I discussed this with the teachers and they are willing to have a tooth brush labelled for each pupil and left at the school, where they will supervise cleaning of teeth once a day. I believe that this would be the only practical method to adopt. It would be useless to give out tooth brushes for the pupils to take home.\n\nSorry that I did not include these observations in my monthly report. Will do so in future.\n\nNo arrangements have been made where I am to go next week. The equipment is here. I intend calling you today. It snowed one day this week and while the weather is fine again, we cannot expect much more of it. I am getting a bit fed up with doing these day schools under present conditions of transport and making arrangements with the schools. The latter I have to do myself after arrival at the school.\n\nSincerely,\n\nO. G. Shepherd.\nCol.

The 1949 salary revision has been approved and we are now able to offer these teachers a higher rate than previously advised.\n\nFor example, Mr. Cuthand, who would have received $1,500.00 on the former scale, will now receive a starting salary of $2,160.00.\n\nI am writing today to Miss Kraft concerning the Sandy Lake School. Her salary will be at the rate of $2,280.00 an academic year (she has more experience than Mr. Cuthand).\n\nI have written at some length to Mr. R. J. Neches of 45 Bloor Avenue, Toronto, concerning the Minnitikum School. He is a young university graduate, whose wife-to-be is a Registered Nurse. I expect to hear from him early this week, when I will write you again at once.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nBernard F. Neary,\n\nCopy sent to Mr. OSTERHERR\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sandy Lake Indian Day School\n\nExpenditure - $25,000.00\n\nThe above estimate covers anticipated costs of erecting a new two room day school and converting present combined class room and teacher's residence into suitable living quarters to accommodate two teachers.\n\nThe following shows the number of children on Sandy Lake Indian Reserve:\n\nSchool Age - 72 Under School Age - 98\n\nOur problem here is to provide class room accommodations to accommodate children of school age and also with a view towards future years.\n\nAt present a class room is contained in combined teacher's residence and class room, suitable to accommodate 30 pupils. In addition we have opened a class room in old Parish Hall, property of Anglican Mission, this particular building is old and not in a very good state of repair and lacks accommodation for the additional teacher.\n\nI recommend that consideration be given to the erection of a two class room school building and convert the present combined class room and teacher's residence into two suites to accommodate and provide living quarters for the two teachers and their families.\n\nAlternate proposal would be to move the present day school in use on Mistawasis Indian Reserve (When class room on Mistawasis Indian Reserve is installed in former Carlton Indian Agency Office) to Sandy Lake Indian Reserve a distance of approximately 20 miles, retain the present combined teachers' residence and class room on Sandy Lake as is, and erect a new teacher's residence.\n\nThe class room building now in use on Mistawasis Indian Reserve would require a substantial sum to move, i.e., new basement, rebuilding chimney and moving and re-installing furnace or possibly installation of a new furnace and possibly after going to the expense of moving we would find in a few years time that two day schools might be required on Mistawasis Indian Reserve. I therefore do not recommend moving the school class room from Mistawasis Indian Reserve to Sandy Lake Indian Reserve.\nIn the event of approval being given for the erection of a two room school building on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve a substantial saving in costs of materials could be made by authorizing this office to have saw logs cut during the winter of 1949-50 by the members of Sandy Lake Band. Logs to be sawn into lumber to be used in erection of the two room class room building. All materials for the erection of the building could be secured from this source at a cost not to exceed $50.00 per M (Doors, windows, cement, flooring, shingles, wall board, nails, paint, etc., excepted). Materials from saw logs secured from timber available on the Reserve would cover dimensions boards, shiplap and siding, only.\n\nI recommend that the expenditure be approved as it is necessary to provide the facilities for education of the children of Sandy Lake Band.\n\nH.

Signature (Note additional classroom opened in old Parish Hall) |\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Survey of Potential School Population of Ahtahkakoops Band #104 occupying the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nAt the present we are operating two class rooms on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve. One contained in a building designed for class room and teachers residence, the other class room is contained in a very old building formerly used for many years as a Parish Hall.\n\nThe Indian settlement on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve is now centered in the area adjacent to our present school building site which borders on the south shore of a large lake contained within this particular Indian Reserve. I, therefore recommend that a new two room class room be erected on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve and our present large combined teachers residence be repaired and converted into suitable living quarters to accommodate two teachers and their families.\n\nYou will note that the potential school population of Ahtahkakoops Band is fairly large and no doubt in a few more years we will find that a two room school building will not prove sufficient therefore we will be confronted with the problem of erecting additional class room facilities. When we find that additional class room space is required consideration will be given to placing a new building at a separate location and located in such a manner on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve to accommodate any future Indian settlement that may take place away from our present school location.\n\nI recommend that approval be given for the erection of a two room school building on the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nN. J. McLeod\nSUPERINTENDENT, INDIAN AGENCY\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-1, part 2)\n5 December, 1949.\n\nMr. H. J. MacLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nANNAKAKOGE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nWe have included in our Estimates the following sums for the provision of adequate school facilities on this reserve:\n\nTwo-room School ............. $30,000.00\nAddition to Teachorage ...... 5,000.00\n\nI believe that this should provide adequate facilities for both teachers and pupils.\n\nIn following your recommendations, it is our plan to provide a two-room school, without teachorage. The conversion of the present school into two teachers' suites should provide adequate space for the teaching staff.\n\nOur experience in moving old school buildings has not been very satisfactory and we agree that it would be unwise to move the classroom building now in use on the Mistassini Reserve.\n\nNew standard plans are in the course of preparation for a two-room school and there should be no difficulty in advertising for tenders, etc., for its erection. However, there will be no plans available for the alterations required to the teachorage. I presume that you can make a sketch plan of what you need and that possibly the contractor handling the erection of the school can put in a tender for the renovations and conversions needed.\n\nBernard F.

He informs me that these Indians are very progressive now and that better school services should be provided as soon as possible. He believes that the solution is a new school building with accommodation for 40 pupils. Of course, it should be built on the reserve, near the teacher's residence, which is in good condition. Unfortunately, the new school could not be placed midway between the present buildings, as there is a gully there, and it should not be placed near the old classroom because it is on a mission lot.\n\nOf course, two vans would be necessary to draw the children to school, as the Indians do not reside in one group.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier Esq.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEver since I came here over 3 years ago, we, that is the Indians & I, have been pleading & petitioning for new & better educational facilities on this reservation but we seem to get nowhere. I am writing to ask you for your assistance in our behalf.\n\nThe Indians are very sincere in their request & if it were granted, I know would do all in their power to make it a\nlosing success. Do you know they have asked for two vans to convey their children to a new school building. The present building is 30 years old. The band has progressed tremendously since the school was built - farming is being carried on in a large scale, so that those on outlying farms are unable to send their children to school. They do not wish to send them away to boarding school. It is a fact that our best & most progressive farmers are all ex day-school pupils. They possess that spirit I have never met with before in my experience among Indians i.e., \"Esprit de Corps\", & it would be a shame to let it die for want of\nsympathy & material support.\n\nI take it that the chief function of the Department is to assist & educate the Indians to a better way of life. These people are making tremendous efforts in that direction on their own & are most worthy of encouragement. They are just as enthusiastic & anxious over the farm school project as they were when they started 3 years ago in spite of all the negotiations & disappointments with which they have met.\n\nYou have, I believe, all the details & figures regarding this matter to hand, so there is no need for me to go into that\nI trust that our request may meet with your sympathy & approval.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nErnest B. Goodman\nOttawa, December 6th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the providing of new and better educational facilities on the Ahtahkakoops Reserve.

It is noted that the yarn, towelling and biscuits requested can be issued from the warehouse.\n\nThe teacher requests 40 cords of wood and, also, an allowance for sawing same. Such an item should not be included on a requisition form. It should be the subject of a separate communication from you.\n\nIn connection with the supplies requested for midday meal purposes, I would refer you to official letter of April 21st, last, in which you were requested to write the Department a special letter regarding the serving of midday meals at the schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nAs you are aware, our appropriation this year has been considerably reduced and the Department is not prepared to authorize all the supplies requested by the teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Day School. I understand that biscuits have already been supplied for all schools in your agency and, in addition to these, it is considered that a hot drink consisting of cocoa and milk (condensed or Drimilk) should be sufficient. Please let me know what it would cost to serve this drink at all the schools in the Carlton Agency. In estimating this cost, you should keep in mind that the Department considers that it should be sufficient to serve midday meals from November 1st, 1933, to April 1st, 1934.

Though the teachers supplemented meals by growing vegetables, for the academic year 1933-34 I have received 5100 lbs of biscuits per day schools; and have informed teachers this is all that can be expected this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nManville Hardware Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSandy Lake Reserve (Ahtahtakoops Day School)\n\nI visited this school on February 20th and found 28 pupils present, 13 girls and 15 boys, out of an enrolment of 33. The pupils are graded from 1 to 6. I spent considerable time in this classroom, as I found the pupils very bright and very interesting. In their reading lessons they spoke up quite audibly and I had no difficulty in hearing them. I consider they are making good progress in the different branches of their studies. The children sang several songs remarkably well.\n\nThe health has been good during the past winter and the pupils had a healthy and well nourished appearance. It was found that they were warmly clad. The conduct of the pupils when questioned was open and natural.\n\nThe school building is of logs, sided with lumber. It was built 35 years ago and is situated on Church property. I noticed the floor joists beginning to rot and no doubt in a short time will have to be renewed. The interior of the building, while found in a clean and tidy condition, requires redecorating. The teacher, Mr. Ernest Goodman, is doing excellent work and is one of the best Indian day school teachers we have in the service. He is interested in his work and not only is progress being shown in the classroom, but he takes an active interest in the children when at play. They are given regular physical drill in the winter, also skating and hockey, and in the summer swimming, soft-ball, and foot-ball, all of which the teacher supervises and enters into. It is very readily seen when entering the school that good feeling exists between the teacher and the pupils.\nThe Indians on the Reserve have supplied material for a mid-day meal. Some have supplied beef, others eggs and chickens. The teacher has supplied the vegetables from his own garden up to date. He also supplies milk, cocoa, and tea. Produce from the gardens unfortunately during the past season was reduced in yield by drought and early frost. While the teacher has been able to supply potatoes, onions, and carrots for the mid-day meal to date, his supply has become exhausted. I would recommend that the teacher be allowed to purchase vegetables for this purpose to carry them until the coming season's produce is available at a cost of $20.00. This, it is estimated, would meet the need.\n\nThere is no question as to the value of this mid-day bowl of soup, not only is its benefit reflected in the health of the children but in the attendance at the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It consists of seven rooms and a large pantry downstairs and seven rooms and three large cupboards upstairs. It has three staircases, full sized basement with one furnace which is not large enough to keep the building warm. The building is forty four feet long and the main building is twenty two feet wide with the back part of the building being thirty six feet wide. It has nine foot ceilings.\n\nIf the partitions were taken out of the inside of the front of this building and the upstairs floor properly braced by a couple of stringers or iron rods, and the windows changed to the east side of the building, it would leave a class room twenty eight feet by twenty two while the back part of the house would remain untouched. This back portion contains three rooms of size large enough to accommodate a dining-room, kitchen and wash room.\n\nThe upstairs could be changed around as per the plans enclosed with adding on a balcony and staircases and would make a wonderful suite of rooms for the Teacher's Residence. It would be necessary to put in running water and sewerage as it would be unhandy living upstairs without these conveniences.\n\nThis building needs re-shingling and painting in any event and the upkeep of this building would be a saving and I consider the total cost would not exceed $2500.00. We would then have a first class school, ample play-grounds for the children, and a much better school than we could build for this money. In addition the Teacher would have comfortable quarters which he does not enjoy at present as it is impossible to keep the building warm.\n\nI have talked this matter over with the Teacher and he considers that this would be a more feasible plan than building a new school and would be more satisfactory to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Indian and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is in answer to your letter of Oct. 25th file 107-2-5, regarding the Estimates for 1938-39 for a school at the Sandy Lake Reserve (Ahtahkakoops). Also enclosed is a counter proposal.\n\n1. Provision should be made for approximately 35 children\n\n2. There is no site available and it will be necessary to purchase a site from the Church of England, who own the land on which the school is now located. One acre of land should be sufficient. The land is on top of a small valley and fairly level land. On this Reserve the Church of England own 160 acres of land. The land we now have lies between this Church property and the Lake and all the available land is connected with the Teacher's Residence. The building should face south.\n\n3. We have a building used for the Teacher's Residence at this point.\n\n4. Good drinking can easily be obtained on the site recommended at about a thirty foot depth.\n\n5. I would recommend construction by day labour.\n\n6. I consider a full basement necessary.\n\nThe school building should have a full size basement with a furnace and a dining room and wash rooms downstairs. I would recommend that the building be stuccoed on the outside as this would be more economical and reduce the upkeep of the building in years to come.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nIndian Affairs.

Davis. In view of the impossibility of determining in the Engineers' office the extent of the structural changes, repairs and alterations required, and the amount of work necessary to increase the heating system to the required capacity, an accurate estimate of the cost of the alterations cannot be prepared by our architects. A careful survey and investigation of the building would be necessary before a close estimate of the cost could be made.\n\nThe Indian Agent has stated that he considers the building can be modeled at a cost not exceeding $2500.00.\n\nIf the alterations indicated on the accompanying plan are satisfactory to your Branch, the necessary working drawings and specifications could be prepared, and tenders obtained for carrying out the work by contract.\nIt might be called to the attention of the Superintendent of Indian Welfare and Training that, owing to the low ceiling in the existing Teachers' Residence there would only be about 70% of the usual allowance of air space for each pupil and that the net glass area of the class room windows also will necessarily be about 30% less than would be arranged in a new building.\n\nThe correct orientation of the existing building should be ascertained. The original plans show the present entrance front facing south, while the Indian Agent indicates it variously as east and north.\n\nThese plans are submitted for your comments. Any suggestions for variations in the proposed alterations or errors in the plan of the existing building could be noted on the plans, and if the scheme is approved, one set of plans should be returned to this office duly initialled.\n\nDirector.\nPlan for Proposed Day School\nAttawapiskat Indian Reserve\nSaulteau\n\nO.H.M.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis Esq.,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have in my school two bright youngsters Mary & Matilda Bird. Their Mother Mrs. George Bird is in very poor health. (Dr. Duncan is familiar with her case & I would refer you to him for particulars.) She is unable to maintain her home & care for her children properly. Both Mr. & Mrs. George Bird have told me that much against their wishes they will have to send their children away to a Residential School. I suggest that the Dept. pay a capable woman to look after this household so that the children may continue at this school. This would be cheaper than sending the children away to a Residential school. I have talked the matter over with the parents & they are quite agreeable.\n\nI would further suggest that the amount paid to the woman be sufficiently worth while so that there could be no objection to boarding the\nMassachusetts children during the week when the weather is too inclement for them to make the trip from the far end of the lake & back.\n\nBrids have a good house with plenty of accommodation.\n\nI have had a request from Andrew Blanchard for a door & 3 windows & hardware to enable him to build a house near the school so that he may start his children to school this fall.\n\nI would be glad if you could take these matters up with the Dept. & let me know what they decide.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nEdward B. Goodman.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJuly 22nd 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from Mr. E. B. Goodman, the Teacher at the Sandy Lake Indian Day School. The letter is self explanatory.\n\nI would recommend that we pay a woman the amount of $15.00 a month to look after the Bird Children and also to care for the Masaskapuo Children when the weather is too severe for them to make the trip from home and return. The Masaskapuo children live over five miles from the school where the father has resided for a number of years.\n\nI would also recommend that a small amount be allowed for provisions for the Masaskapuo children while they are staying at Geo. Bird's. This amount should not exceed fifty dollars for the school year.\n\nThe total cost of this plan would only be $200.00 while the cost, if these children were sent to a Boarding School would be over $300.00 for the Bird Children alone.\n\nI would like to have an answer as soon as possible in order to make arrangements before the school term commences on Sept. lst.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Davis Esq.,\nLeask,\nSask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for 24 pairs of skating boots for this school. I have over 30 children on the roll & my average so far this year is 24.\n\nAs you know this school is situated beside a lake & for years I have maintained a skating rink. I have only been able to obtain old skates from my friends & have never had nearly enough to go round. It would be a tremendous help if the Dept. would supply those I have requisitioned. It would give infinite pleasure & health giving benefit to the children. You may have heard the old Hungarian Proverb, \"The Devil tempts every man except the silly man who tempts the Devil.\"\n\nI would be grateful if you would help me obtain this sport equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nErnest B. Goodman\nLeask, Sask.,\nSept. 19th 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for carpenter tools as received from Mr. E. B. Goodman of the Sandy Lake Indian Day School. His letter is attached thereto.\n\nMr. Goodman is a good man at this work and I feel that he will make good use of any equipment that may be provided.\n\nAlso enclosed is a requisition for skates and boots for the school children. As you know, Mr. Goodman's school is located near the lake and in the past he has always had a rink. He has had some old skates that he has secured in different places but these are now worn out. Most of these children can skate and while I realize that the parents should provide the skates, they are not in a position to do so at the present time. This is a good healthy sport and if the Department could not see their way clear to furnish all of these if they could make an allowance for a few pair it would be a wonderful help.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach a Requisition from Ahtehkakoops Day School, Sandy Lake Reserve, Carlton Agency, for 24 pairs of skates and boots, 3 dozen spoons, and 12 large cups.\n\nThis is the first request I have received for supplying skates and boots, and no doubt it will be followed by other schools if granted in this case. At the same time it is my opinion that it would be of tremendous advantage not only for the health of the children, but also in their advancement.\n\nOn Mistawasis Reserve, where a few years ago the Indians were practically out of control and constantly consulting a lawyer, today they are working in close co-operation with the Department and making great headway. While in no way belittling the work of our Agent, Mr. Davis, who has done a great deal to bring about this condition, I feel that a great part of it is due to the fact that we have a good Community Hall located beside the lake. During the summer this Hall is used for social gatherings. In the winter, while it is used for the same purposes, they also have skating, hockey, and other ice sports, using the Hall for dressing and refreshments. This has brought the Band together, particularly the young people, and fostered a spirit of co-operation.\n\nI feel the same effect would be obtained on all our Reserves if we could get our teachers or Farming Instructors to organize the young people into skating and other clubs, taking an active part in the direction of these clubs. The young people would in that way grow up in close touch with their officials, and we would obtain their co-operation, which is so badly needed.\n\nPersonally I would like to see these efforts supported by the Department. At the same time I realize the granting of these would be followed by others, and therefore I do not feel like making a recommendation, but would rather leave it to your judgment.\n\nI am attaching Mr. Davis' and Mr. Goodman's letters covering this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

The cost of the work required to remodel this building for use as a school was estimated at $2,500.00 by the Indian Agent, but you will note from your memorandum of January 22nd that our architects pointed out that it would not be possible to accurately estimate the cost of this work.\n\nWith regard to the tender submitted, while no officer of this Service has inspected the present building, it is considered that an expenditure of the $4,674.40 would not be in proportion to the value or purpose of the building. Under the circumstances, it is suggested that advice be obtained from the Indian Affairs Branch whether they desire such an expenditure in order to obtain the school as planned. Would you kindly advise in this connection.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-5, part 1)\n8th October, 1938.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to the above, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from our Chief Engineer. The facts leading up to this point are as follows:\n\nWhen plans and specifications were ready, five firms were asked to tender. Only one of these, however, submitted a tender, namely Graham and Clunie, the amount of their tender being $4,674.40.\n\nYou will remember that the Indian Agent estimated that the remodelling of this building would cost $2,500. Our engineers, in considering what would probably have to be done, did not consider that the work could be carried out at less than $3,000. As this tender is considerably above that figure, our engineers are of the opinion that the amount is not in proportion to the value or purpose of the building.\n\nI should be glad to have your comments before any steps are taken to accept or reject the tender received.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of the 8th instant in connection with the above and notice that the only tender you received was for the amount of $4,674.40.\n\nAs you state in the third paragraph of your memorandum the Indian Agent estimated the cost of remodelling this building at $2,500.00. He visited the Department last week and at that time I advised him that the quotation we had received was considerably higher. The Indian Agent, Mr. Davis, when in Ottawa stated definitely that he could remodel the building in a proper manner for the amount of his estimate; namely, $2,500.00 provided a carpenter-foreman was engaged. Indians would be employed. I recommend that you allow Indian Agent Davis to proceed with the construction of this building on the understanding that the cost must not exceed $2,500.00. In this event you should advise him whom he should employ as carpenter-foreman.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to requisition received from the teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nYou may authorise the purchase of 24 spoons and 12 large cups.\n\nWhile I am very desirous of encouraging the worth while activities mentioned in your letter at the same time I regret that it is not possible to favourably consider the teacher's request for 24 pairs of skates and boots.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n28th October, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 24th instant in which you advise that your Indian Agent, Mr. Davis, has stated that he could remodel the building in a proper manner for the amount of his estimate, namely $2,500, provided a Carpenter Foreman was engaged, I may say that this Branch is quite willing that Mr. Davis should proceed with the construction of the building. It should be pointed out, however, that when tenders were invited for the remodelling of this school certain specifications and plans were submitted and also that our Engineers' estimate of $3,000 was based on these specifications.\n\nI should be glad if you would advise if the construction proposed by Mr. Davis will be in accordance with these specifications or if some other scheme of remodelling is proposed.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of October 26 regarding the above school.\n\nAs I advised you in my memorandum of October 24 the Indian Agent visited the Department during the latter part of October and at that time he stated that he could remodel the building in a satisfactory manner for the amount of his original estimate; namely, $2,500.00. He intimated to us that he would follow in a general way the specifications and plans that had been prepared but he might find it necessary to make two or three minor changes. Mr. Davis' address is Leask, Sask.\n\nDirector.\nNovember 5th, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Day School Ahtahkakoops Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 3rd instant, advising that Agent Davis will carry out the remodelling of the above school in a satisfactory manner, for the amount of his original estimate, namely $2500.00, and that in general, specifications and plans prepared by this Branch would be followed. I understand from the telephone conversation with Mr. Phelan, that it will be quite satisfactory to your Branch to have the accounts rendered to our office for approval, when they come in. This will obviate the necessity of having the money re-transferred.\n\nAs regards a Carpenter Foreman for Mr. Davis, this will advise you that Mr. Rod Grant of 119 Fourteenth Street West, Prince Albert, may be employed in this capacity.\n| QUANTITY | TERMS: net | REG.

I understood you to say that you considered that you could remodel this building according to the plans prepared by the Surveys & Engineering Branch but that you considered some minor changes would be necessary in order to keep the total expenditure within the amount provided in the current year's appropriation; namely, $2,500.00.\n\nI have received the approval of the Surveys & Engineering Branch for you to proceed with this work. Mr. Rod Grant, 119 Fourteenth Street West, Prince Albert, should be employed as carpenter foreman. When you were in my office I further understood that you considered that you could engage Indians to assist Mr. Grant.\n\nImmediate arrangements may, therefore, be made to remodel the Ahtahkakoops School and any further correspondence with reference to the matter may be directed to Mr. J.M. Wardle, Director, Surveys & Engineering Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose the plan which was originally forwarded to you in my letter of January 29 and you commented on this plan in your letter of February 18.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6279, file 600-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLeask, Sask.,\nJan 13th 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn December 14th we received an advance cheque No. B 49309 for the amount of $650.00 to cover the cost of labour on the remodelling of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School under authority No. 107-3-5. I now find that this amount will not be sufficient to pay for all the labour; I will need another $200.00 for this purpose. If you will forward an accountable cheque for this amount we will submit a credit voucher to cover the full amount of $850.00.\n\nThe total expenditures to date, including the $200.00 asked for, is about $2100.00. The work is all completed on the inside and it will be a while before I will be able to have the outside work done, until the weather moderates.\n\nThis school and residence is one of the finest now in the Province and I think that Dr. Robertson will agree with me when he sees it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa\nMarch 1, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School,\nProvince of Saskatchewan.\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of November 5, 1938, I enclose voucher No. 912 amounting to $601.59 in favour of the Fletcher Plumbing and Heating Co. Ltd., Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, covering the cost of installing plumbing and heating in the above-mentioned school.\n\nDirector.\nMarch 15, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe - Indian Day School,\nAhtahkakoops Reserve, Sask.\n\nWith reference to the above work, which is being carried out by the Indian Agent, R.S. Davis, Esq., it is noted from the copy of Mr. Davis' letter of January 13th last, forwarded with your memorandum of January 13th last, that the total expenditure to January 13th was about $2,100.00, and that all interior work has been completed, and further, that the outside work would not be carried out until the weather moderated.\n\nI may say that various accounts amounting to $2,802.06 have been received in this office chargeable to Vote 76-64, and an advance of $200.00 has been made to meet labour costs. In addition to the above an advance of $650.00 was made by the Indian Affairs Branch (vide your memorandum of January 4th last). This would make the total expenditure to date, about $2,052.06. The Indian Agent has been authorized to spend $2,500.00 on this work, and, as he has received all instructions from the Indian Affairs Branch, it would be appreciated if the Indian Affairs Branch would advise Mr. Davis that the accounts for all expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred before March 31st, must be submitted as soon as possible, in order that payment may be made with funds available under the 1938-39 estimates.\n\nIt is also felt that Mr. Davis should be advised that no expenditures are to be incurred on this work after March 31st unless the Indian Affairs Branch authorize such expenditures under their 1939-40 estimates.\n\nWith regard to the advances for labour, I may say that paylists accounting for the funds advanced have not been received in this office to date. Paylists duly receipted, should be forwarded by March 31st, in order that these accounts may be closed. Any balance remaining on hand should be deposited to the credit of the Receiver General and duplicate copies of the deposit slip forwarded with the balance sheets.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised by the Indian Affairs Branch as soon as possible as to whether any further accounts in connection with this work, will be forwarded for payment this fiscal year.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

You will note that the expenditure to date is approximately $2,050.00. As you know your agent Mr. Davis was authorized to spend $2,500.00 on this work. He should, therefore, be advised at once to submit the balance of his accounts in order that they may be paid before the 31st March. Accounts of course should include pay-lists.\n\nIt would be appreciated if your Branch would get in touch with Mr. Davis at once and advise him to submit his accounts with the least possible delay.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the remodelling of the Ahtahkakoops Indian day school the Surveys & Engineering Branch advise me that the following expenditure has been made to date:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Advance for labour           | $650.00  |\n| \" \"                           | $200.00  |\n| Various accounts              | $1,202.06|\n| **Total**                    | **$2,052.06** |\n\nVoucher 932 just received and not yet paid - $3.18\n\n**Total** - **$2,055.18**\n\nOfficial letter of November 14, 1938, authorized you to expend an amount not exceeding $2,500.00.\n\nIf you have any further accounts you should forward them immediately as the amount provided for this school lapses with the present fiscal year which closes on the 31st instant.\n\nWith regard to the advances for labour receipted pay lists accounting for the funds advanced should be forwarded at once. Any balance remaining on hand should be refunded.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nNo expenditures are to be incurred on this work after March 31 unless you receive specific authority from this Branch.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your letter of Sept. 11th, file 107-2-5.\n\nI am instructing the Teachers of the Indian Day Schools of this Agency to only serve a light lunch to the pupils at mid-day instead of a hot meal as we have been doing in the past. Knowing conditions as I do on Indian Reserves, I feel that the children should have a good meal at noon as many of these children have to come four and five miles to attend school, in very cold weather. In many cases they are not any too well clothed and a good meal would certainly be appreciated by them, and would also be a wonderful help towards improving the health of these growing children.\n\nI notice your remarks about increasing our relief allowance. I am proud of the fact that the Indians of this Agency have never been on relief, except the old people who receive rations under their treaty agreement. In most cases the most useless Indians have the most children and therefore, while the children are not actually undernourished they are not any too well fed. This condition exists, not only in this Agency, but in any Agency in western Canada. In my opinion it would not be a good policy to put these useless Indians on relief. However, if you wish to take this action I will make an application for some supplies for these families.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTBP/AE\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1944.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you submit an itemized list of the amounts necessary to provide noonday lunches at eight Indian day schools in your agency.\n\nIn this connection it is my understanding that vitamin biscuits have already been sent forward to these schools. You will be interested to learn that this year the Department purchased 25 tons of specially prepared vitamin biscuits at a cost of 22\u00a2 per pound. These biscuits were manufactured, purchased by this Branch and distributed on the understanding that the vitamin content was such that the consumption of a biscuit or so per day was sufficient to provide the average pupil with the vitamins necessary for his growth and development, with perhaps the single exception of Vitamin D which is, as you know, secured from cod liver oil or substitutes of cod liver oil. In view of this fact is it necessary to provide elaborate noonday lunches at these schools? I have in mind at the moment not only the cost but the amount of time required in the preparation and serving of the meal and in washing up, with due regard for sanitation etc. I remember a few years ago when we decided to serve noonday lunches in the drought-stricken areas of Manitoba the time consumed in the preparation and serving of the lunches was such that the public school inspectors recommended their discontinuance. This letter is not written by way of criticism and is written by a man wholly unfamiliar with conditions on your reserves. I just want to be sure that our schools are\nrecognized not as restaurants but as educational institutions and to point out that the time during which the average Indian pupil attends school is decidedly limited. It is not my intention, however, to reduce, this year, the amounts you are requesting. I am asking, however, that you discuss this matter very fully with your teachers and perhaps with your medical health officers and with them work out a programme based on the nutritional and educational needs of the children in attendance at these schools.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLeask, Sask.\nNov. 20th/44.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter 107-2-5 of Sept. 8th/44, regarding supplies for noonday lunches at eight Indian Day Schools in this agency.\n\nI have gone into this matter with eight day school Teachers and Dr. J.M. Morrow, Medical Superintendent of Prince Albert, seven of the teachers and Dr. Morrow maintain that the extra nourishment supplied for the noonday meal is necessary for the health of the pupils.\n\nTherefore if the Department approves of this expenditure, I would appreciate authority to make the purchases requested in my previous letter.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1944.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves the following expenditures for purchasing supplies for midday meals during the current academic year:\n\nSturgeon Lake Day School ........... $50\nMistawasis \" \" .................. 60\nSandy Lake \" \" .................. 60\nMontreal Lake \" \" ................. 90\nBig River R.C. \" \" ............... 70\nBig River C.E. \" \" ............... 50\nLittle Red River Day \" ............ 50\nChitek Lake Day School ............. 50\n\nThe above amounts are the same as allowed last year.

Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nI attach requisition received from the teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School.\n\nEvidently the teacher is of the opinion that considerable work is required to repair both the school and the teacher's living quarters. It is not usual to place such a request on a Requisition for School Material form. Please let me have a report regarding the work that you consider is necessary and you should estimate the cost of material and labour. If the material will cost over $50.00, it will be necessary for you to supply detailed information so that the order may be placed through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nDear Sirs,\n\nThe board fence requisitioned for us much needed for the following reasons.\n\nAs can be seen from the diagram on the reverse side of this page we have no private yard for our children to play in. We have two children aged three and four.\n\nThe fence that is around the school now will not keep the children in and as there is thick bush on three sides of the school we are constantly worried for fear the children may get lost. The fact that the living quarters are on the second floor makes the watching of the children that much harder.\n\nThe proximity of the lake (Coye) is also much cause for worry on our part.\n\nHoping this requisition will receive a favourable reply, I remain,\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs. S. W. Hancock.\n\nP.S.

Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Bldg.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have recently sent in a requisition for school material that is urgently needed. Unless this is received very soon I will be unable to carry on my work in a satisfactory manner. For example, I have on hand eleven pencils.\n\nI have also sent in two requisitions during the past year. The first one on April 1st for school material of which I received about one quarter and the second in June for material to repair the living quarters and schools; have received none of the latter.\n\nSome of the materials asked for in the April 1st requisition are urgently needed such as soap, towels, text books, etc. In fact, I have not asked for anything that is not needed badly.\n\nHoping you will be able to supply some of these materials soon, I remain\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs. S.W. Hansbeker\nTeacher, Ahtahkakoop School\nSandy Lake Reserve\nOttawa, 28th January, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Bryce, Acting Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nI have a letter from the teacher of the Ahtahkakoops School with reference to certain supplies that he states have not been received. We are checking these items at the Stationery Office and we will try to fill his request as far as possible. Many articles are still in short supply and that accounts for the delay in forwarding them. I have no doubt that the teacher only requested what is needed but under present conditions we cannot always secure the items.\n\nOn reviewing our file, I note that in writing to you on September 25th I advised you the Purchasing Branch would secure the materials required in re-decorating the school and residence. Due to an oversight the requisition was not forwarded to the Purchasing Branch. I enclose the requisition which you forwarded with your letter of September 16th and authority is granted for local purchase of the materials required. You may have the work done whenever you consider it timely. Possibly you can arrange to have it done during the Easter Holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT   |\n|----------|----------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Jan./46  | To lumber for fence at Sandy Lake School     | $49.56   |\n|          | As per statement attached                    |          |\n\nAuthority No.107-2-5 Aug. 28th/45.\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Correct lighting is most essential and the placing of the windows in Plan 686 should assist you in changing over the agency building.\n\nI understand that this change is a matter for further deliberation on your part, but I felt the attached plan would be of assistance.\n\nBernard F.

These repairs call for an expenditure of close to $300.00 and, when completed, it is hoped that the building will be quite comfortable and much improved in appearance. As this expenditure is somewhat higher than was anticipated the matter of enlarging the teacher's residence will have to stand over till next year and in the meantime it is hoped that the present accommodation will suffice.\n\nThe contract for the erection of a teacher's residence and pupils' dining room on the John Smith's reserve was let sometime ago and the work is now under way. Any delay that occurred in proceeding with this work was unavoidable. The Department wished to erect a creditable building and had careful plans and specifications prepared. Following this tenders were called for, but all the details were attended to as promptly as was possible and the building should be ready for occupation by the Rev. Mr. Macdonald and his family early in the autumn.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newman, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 600-8, part 1)\nA change of teacher at the Ahtahkakoop school at an early date is no doubt most desirable, but, as in the case of the Sturgeon Lake school, repairs to the building in order to make it comfortable called for an outlay of $325.00 and funds are not available this year for the erection of a teacher's residence, owing to this fact it is deemed advisable to allow Mr. Ahonkew to remain in charge for at least another year.\n\nIt is noted that Your Lordship has in view a married man to take charge of the Sturgeon Lake school and the Department would like to know whether the present dwelling, which was erected by your church, will provide temporary accommodation. As Your Lordship has already been advised a salary of $600.00 will be paid a teacher and, if his wife is competent and willing to take up field mission work among the Indians on the reserve, an additional grant will be made for her services. In the absence of fuller information, however, a definite amount cannot at present be decided upon.\n\nIn reference to accommodation for teachers on these two reserves I may say that the Superintendent of Indian Education contemplates visiting the Carlton Agency in the near future and while there he will make special inquiry with a view to having the necessary work undertaken early next year.\n\nMr. Northwick, the Indian Agent, has been written to in regard to Mr. Oreno's complaint that he has not been furnished with necessary supplies during the last year and it is hoped that there will be no further difficulty in this respect.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to assure Your Lordship that the improvement of day school conditions in your Diocese is\ncorrectly carried, but as it is quite a large undertaking and as similar improvements in any other districts have at the same time been considered progress must necessarily be comparatively slow. However, it is thought that a decided advance has been made during the past year and it is hoped that results next year will be even more satisfactory. In the meantime a communication from Your Lordship in reference to the qualifications of the teacher and his wife referred to above will be omitted.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI note with pleasure your desire to provide suitable accommodation for a married teacher on Satehakakop's Reserve. I have long desired a similar arrangement for some sort of accommodation for lodgers pupils when parents are away. In answer to your questions I would say:\n\n1. A building on the plan of the Mrs. Smith's new school residence, with a small dormitory over the principal room might serve well for Satehakakop's.\n\n2. I am inclined to advise an inside staircase only but for the pupils, a central aisle from this, separating the two dormitories; another door opening into this passage from a room in the house, which room might be occupied by the matron or nurse. This would still leave 3 bed-rooms for the teacher's family.\n\n3. The dormitories should be well ventilated, almost open at each end.\n\n4. As you ask me, I would say that Satehakakop's school accommodation requires almost (or quite) nothing, mean for the class rooms besides the building of teachers' house, pupils dining-room, etc. If this new scheme is successful there should be at least twice as many pupils as the present room will hold. It may be found necessary also to fetch the first-class pupils. There should be a married teacher swift, & also an extra teacher for the little ones.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to state how far the second choice of location made by you, which is near the southwest corner of the Church property, is from the Mission buildings and the present school-house.\n\nThe Church authorities have intimated that it will be necessary to provide a new building for class room purposes as the present one is too small. If a new building is put up the Department would then locate it beside the teacher's residence. The dimensions of the present school-room are given as 20' by 30' on the last teacher's annual report and this would provide floor space for some 36 pupils, but, as the ceiling is low, the air space is not sufficient for more than 30 pupils; however, it is thought that this is all that would be likely to attend for sometime. The question then arises whether if the residence with the dining-room attached be erected on the Reserve it will be too far from the present school building to have the mid-day meal served with convenience. Be good enough to let the Department have your views in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Northwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Borthwick has suggested that this work be done by day labour and the Department is disposed to carry out this suggestion. He has also prepared a sketch of a building that he thinks suitable modelled on the plan for the doctor's residence erected this summer at Mistawas. I would ask you to submit this sketch to Mr. Knox and have him prepare working drawings and specifications such as he thinks necessary for the guidance of the foreman who will be in charge of this work. Any improvements that Mr. Knox may be able to suggest in the sketch as prepared by Mr. Borthwick will be gladly received and they should be embodied in his plan. You will be kind enough to give Mr. Knox any assistance in your power and the Department wishes to have these plans as soon as possible in order that the work may be undertaken as soon as conditions will permit in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of December 3rd, last, in regard to the erection of a teacher's residence on the Ahtahkakoopa and Sturgeon Lakes reserves I beg to say that the Department has submitted your sketch to Mr. Knox, Prince Albert, and asked him to prepare working drawings and specifications.\n\nThe Department is prepared to carry out your suggestion that the work be done by day labour, provided you are quite satisfied that the necessary workmen and a competent working foreman will be available.\n\nPlans will be ready to commence operations early in the spring. The Department will await a further communication from you as to the site and if you have any further immediate suggestions to offer in regard to the building you might communicate with Mr. Chisholm in whose hands the matter of having plans prepared has been placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, February 1, 1911.\n\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Oliver.\n\nThe Department has in view the erection during the coming summer of residences for the teachers with dining-rooms and small dormitories attached on the Ahtahkakoops and Sturgeon Lake reserves, Carlton Agency. It is proposed to combine the best features of the plans followed last year in the residences erected on the John Smith's and Mistawasis reserves.\n\nIn view of the remoteness of these locations and the difficulty of getting tenders from contractors who reside in Prince Albert and the other towns at long distances from the reserves I am of opinion that it would be preferable to employ day labour in this work. Mr. Borthwick quotes an approximate price for the buildings, if erected by day labour, which is reasonable. Both the Indian Agent and the Architect who prepare the working plans will\nwill be held responsible for the character of the work.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that advantage be taken of Clause C, Section 36, Chapter 39 of the Act respecting the Public Works of Canada (R.S.'06), which provides that where the estimated cost of work is less than $5000.00 and it appears to the Minister that, in view of the nature of the work, it is not advisable to invite tenders, public tenders need not be called for.\n\nThe estimated cost of these buildings is $3,500.00 each.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 600-8, part 1)\nOttawa, February 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 2nd instant in which instructions were given you respecting the completion of plans for the proposed teacher's residences on the Ahtshkakoops and Sturgeon Lake reserves I beg to say that, upon further consideration, the Department has decided to have this work done by contract. It will, therefore, be necessary for Mr. Knox to make his drawings and specifications in detail so that tenders may be called for. As the advertising for these tenders will take considerable time the matter is now urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, February 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 2nd instant I beg to say that the Department, upon further consideration, has decided that it would be preferable to call for tenders for the erection of the residences on the Sturgeon Lake and Ahtahkakoops reserves.

Northwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nReferring to your letter quoted above and to previous correspondence regarding the preparation of plans and specifications for teachers' dwellings which it is proposed to erect on the Sandy Lake and Sturgeon Lake reserves, I have the honour to report that these have been completed by Mr. Knox in accordance with your instructions, and I now transmit them for the consideration of the Department. Such was the pressure of work on Mr. Knox's hands when I first placed this work with him that he was unable to undertake it at once, and he had made but little progress with the plans when I arrived here on the 27th ultimo; but since that date he has done the best possible in view of numerous interruptions.\n\nMr. Knox will be prepared to act as inspector of the work on these buildings during the course of their erection if required to do so; and it is safe to say that there is no more reliable man available to whom this important duty could be entrusted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant and also of plans and specifications prepared by Mr. Knox.\n\nIn this connection I would ask you to have Mr. Knox state his estimate of the cost of the erection of a building according to this plan at Sturgeon Lake and Athabasca.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

L. Maclean\n\nAgent Dominion Lands.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nI beg to recommend that the residences for the school teachers on the Ahtahkakoops and Sturgeon Lake Reserves be erected by day labour under the superintendence of Mr. Knox of Prince Albert.\n\nWe called for tenders by public advertisement and received only one for the buildings in this district which consisted of the two above-mentioned residences; a farmer's dwelling and bull stable at Mistawasis Reserve; a farmer's dwelling on James Smith's Reserve; a farmer's dwelling at Nut Lake Reserve and a farmer's dwelling at Ahtahkakoops Reserve. The tender for these buildings was $31,334.00 made by Goodfellow and Grant of Prince Albert. This amount was far in excess of the estimated cost of the buildings, which was in the vicinity of $20,000.00.\n\nWe can postpone erecting the other buildings, but the two teacher's residences should be built this year, as we have made arrangements with the Church of England to send married teachers to these reserves in pursuance of our day school.\nschool policy; in fact Mr. Hutchinson and his wife are already at work on the Sturgeon Lake Reserve pending the erection of the building at Ahtahkakoops, when they will be transferred.\n\nMr. Knox states that he is of opinion that the buildings can be erected by day labour for $5500.00 each, the estimated cost, and Mr. Inspector Chisholm is of opinion that an equally good job would be secured if the work was done under the supervision of Mr. Knox. Competent foremen for the work are said to be available.\n\nI would ask for authority under Section 36 of the Public Works Act to erect these buildings as above suggested.\n\nI would add that on February 1st, last, you were asked to sanction a similar course, but stated in reply that you thought the work should be done by contract after due advertising and, of course, if the results of the advertising had been satisfactory, it would not now be necessary for me to suggest having the work done by day labour.\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMay 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your telegram of the 19th and to my reply of today, regarding the tender of Contractor Goodfellow for the construction of the proposed buildings in the Carlton Agency, I have the honour to state that Mr Goodfellow and his partner, in view of the fact that there is no scarcity of work within the city and only a limited number of contractors and workmen available, have evidently calculated from the first that they will not incur the risks and inconvenience attending work in the country except at a very safe figure. They consequently decline to further alter or modify their tender in any particular.\n\nI went into the matter carefully with Mr Knox, who is of opinion that while building operations are somewhat more expensive this year than last yet the difference in the actual cost of material and labour is not greater than 10 to 15 per cent. There is no doubt, however, that over and above this actual increase in cost contractors are generally figuring on larger profits to themselves.\n\nMr Knox estimated when he prepared the plans for the teachers' dwellings that they could be built for $8500 each, and he is of this opinion still. He believes that it might be possible to secure competent foremen, one for each building, at about $6 per day. There are around Shellbrook and Marcelin a few skilled workmen, carpenters and plasterers, who are unable to tender on these buildings but who would take employment under a foreman on such work. Mr Borthwick\nhas mentioned some such men who are available and who, he thought, would be competent to act as foremen themselves. One whom he mentioned lives at Shellbrook and one at Marcelin, but I do not know them myself and cannot just now say anything further as to their qualifications.\n\nI have also approached Mr Knox as to whether, in case it is decided by the Department to have the buildings constructed by day labour, he would undertake to superintend the work on any or all of them. Although already engaged for a considerable amount of work in the city yet he would undertake this work. He would prepare lists of material, showing the quantities and description of the same, for the guidance of the Agent in the ordering; or he would order the material himself if required to do so, and from such dealers as might be designated. I might say here that Mr Knox could be trusted to see that the Department got good value for all sums expended in this way.\n\nMr Knox has telephoned me to the effect that he thinks he will be able to suggest the names of some competent men to be employed as foreman, as he has had in his employ at one time or another many of the best workmen in this place. These men will not be getting more than $4.50 or at most $5 per day at present; but to leave their present employment and take work in the country, I am convinced from enquiries I have made that good men will require not less than $6 per day, and possibly as high as $6. Men living at Shellbrook or Marcelin could be had for lower pay.\n\nFor his work, as above stated and including the general direction and inspection of the work, Mr Knox would ask 5 per cent of the cost of the buildings, this covering also the preparations of the plans. He would also\nexpect actual travelling and incidental expenses.\n\nBy the method here outlined the buildings could probably be built at a considerably lower cost than on the tender already submitted; and under Mr Knox's direction an equally good job would be secured. By entrusting him also with the purchasing of material, arranging for the transportation of material, and engaging of workmen, he would have full responsibility for the completeness of the work, and the agent would be freed from the burden of these duties, which would be the heavier because of his want of intimate acquaintance with building operations.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Egd.)

The fact is the Indians for various reasons unwilling to send children away from home until they are 12 years old, and even then they want a promise made to the Catholic Church Committee that the children will be sent to the church, and create a disagreeable situation.

As there are industrial schools conducted under the auspices of these religious bodies at no great distance from the reserve, the Department would like you to use your influence with the Indians with a view to persuading them to send their children to these schools, in order that they may get the benefit of the advantages afforded by a training in such institutions.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.S.

The following reasons are cited:\n\n(1). Very young children should not be allowed to go to very large schools at some distance off and leave their family connections.\n\n(2). Delicate children should remain at home until they are physically able to go.\n\n(3). Some are exceedingly shy and will not let any person know their troubles except their parents and thereby handicapped.\n\n(4). Some of the Indians claim they do not receive sufficient and timely notice of children taken ill in the larger schools. A case in point James Medicine Rope.\n\nChildren from the age of six to ten or twelve could attend the school on the Reserve and then be transferred to an Industrial School. I think this system could be very well tried here.\n\nThere is a building near the Presbyterian Mission that has been used more or less as a private school and could be used as a day school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.

Sir,-\n\nThe Department contemplates the establishment of a Day School on the Assiniboine Reserve, as the Indians are anxious to have one, and there are enough young children whose parents object to their being sent to boarding or industrial schools to justify the experiment.\n\nAn application has been received from Miss Anna A. Hawley, who is a qualified teacher and a trained nurse, and is now engaged at the Calt Hospital, Lethbridge, Alta. She has intimated her desire to engage in Indian work and devote all her energies thereto. It is, as you are aware, a difficult matter to obtain the services of one so well qualified as Miss Hawley, and the Department would like, if you see no objection, to place her in charge of this new school, so that the work may be commenced on a proper basis.\n\nShe is an Anglican, but as the Department does not know of a vacancy in one of the Church of England schools, it is thought that her services could be utilized at present on the Assiniboine Reserve. In view of the fact that many of the Indians of this Agency belong to the Presbyterian denomination, the Department would like to know whether you would have any objection to Miss Hawley being placed in charge of the new school.\n\nBe good enough to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nYours of July 21st., No.334701/1 received, regarding the establishment of a Day School on the Assiniboine Reserve. They have been asking a school there for some years, and I suppose should have it. Yet that has been the principal \"hunting ground\" for the Regina School. I assume the Assiniboine Reserve is what we know as the Hurricane Hills Reserve.\n\nAm I right in also assuming that this, like other Day Schools, would receive the usual Day School Grant, and that the Presbyterian Church would be expected to supplement up to the usual teacher's salary? The School would thus be related to our Mission and missionaries, and I suppose would be, as elsewhere, in a measure subject to suggestion etc. by the missionaries. That is where I am a little alarmed. The fact that Miss Hawley is an Anglican should make no difference, and would not, I think, at almost any other point, but Mr. & Mrs. McKenzie, the missionaries at Hurricane Hills, are Highland with all the ardour of the old Covenanters. I would be afraid of complications. This all the more as I understand Mrs. MacKenzie has been expecting that when the Day School came she would be the teacher. In fact she did for a time conduct a Day school in her own house. I do not think she has a teacher's certificate, and whether or not she would satisfy the Department I am not prepared to say. I am writing frankly. I appreciate the proposal but think it due to you to make known my fears.\n\nI shall not send your communication to the Western Committee until I hear from you further. If you still think it well to experiment I shall be glad to co-operate.\n\nMay I add that what I said as to Regina I do not regard as a reason why this school should not be opened, but it is another reason why the Pasquah Reserves should be provided for as formerly suggested and Regina School closed.\n\nI am,\n\nRPM/\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 26th., 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the Day School on the Assiniboine Reserve, I have to say that under the circumstances it would appear undesirable to engage Miss Hawley in this special work. The Department will endeavor to employ her elsewhere.\n\nIn establishing a Day School at this point the Department desires to make an advance on the old fashioned institutions and to engage someone specially qualified to carry on the work. The Department will be prepared to bear the whole of the expense in connection with the School, and it is thought that some person with similar attainments to Miss Hawley, who is both a qualified teacher and a nurse, should be engaged. The salary paid will be sufficiently liberal to attract a qualified person and the buildings for day school purposes will be gradually added to and improved. On these conditions may I ask whether it would be possible for you to suggest for this position a teacher who could carry out the educational work which it is desired to pursue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 26th, 1900\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received, in reference to the missionary reserve, your letter dated July 26th, No. 347027, regarding the prospect of giving a fair trial to the new type of day-school proposed by the Department. As the Department proposes to undertake the entire expense of the school, it seems best to me to make an appointment as to the employment of Miss Harley, whom you regard as qualified both as teacher and nurse. That is a combination difficult to secure, and I have not, at the present time, any one in mind whom I could recommend. I do not think it would be well to fill the bill in that respect.\n\nShould you feel Miss Harley's name remain before you a little longer that I may confer with some others as to that appointment. Whilst it would be very unfortunate to have any misunderstanding arise over the mission, yet possibly, under such conditions, it might be a safe experiment. The Mission house and the school of course should be intimately related, and indeed I should think it desirable that the lady teacher should board in the Mission house, because there is not in the neighborhood another suitable place. It would therefore depend largely upon Miss Harley's temperament as to whether or not she could adjust herself to the conditions. I shall communicate about after conference, and perhaps be able to make a suggestion.\n\nThanking you very cordially for your communication and proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are at present about 16 children living within a radius of one-and-a-half miles of where the school buildings should be. The Indians are all anxious to have such a school and everything seems favourable.\n\nIf the Department decides to act upon my recommendation I would advise that a cottage to accommodate a teacher and a trained nurse be built, and a class room.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your answer No. 334701/1 to my letter in grant for day school. But please know the school we have opened in our mission premises is not without the approval of our Church. With the approval of the authorities thereof there is a small grant for its maintenance, which grant, however, is far from sufficient to keep it open and in full swing any day of the week.\n\nSo far, the school has been so successful in the matter of attendance as to have today 11 pupils, and more likely than the legal minimum. The aim is their education with from the start along with the literary work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. MacKenzie\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the establishment of a school on the Assiniboine (Hurricane Hills) Reserve I beg to say that the purpose of the Department in suggesting a public or rather a non-denominational school on this reserve was to provide educational facilities for all the children, free from any features, in so far as religious instruction is concerned, which might be open to objection by some of the Indians. This cannot be accomplished on a mixed reserve by the establishment of a school where the dogmas of any religious body are taught.\n\nAs you are aware there are a number of Roman Catholic and pagan children on this reserve, many of whom, it is believed, would be sent to a non-denominational school. The Department recognizes that the Presbyterian Church has had a mission on this reserve for years and that the majority of the Indians are members or adherents of that body, but at the same time it desires to do full justice to the minority.\n\nTo carry out the project of a non-denominational school there could not, therefore, be any direct relation between the Mission and the school. The aims and objects\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof the two are to a large extent separate and distinct. It is thought that the duties of the teacher should be confined to secular education during school hours and that any religious instruction desired should be given, as in the public schools of Ontario, after hours. The Presbyterian Church would be allowed the nomination of the teacher.\n\nThe Department in making this proposal has in view the best interests of both Protestants and Roman Catholics, as it would not be justified in incurring as large an expenditure to provide facilities for only a portion, when the minority might call for a school, as they would be privileged to do under the provisions of the Indian Act. It is not the wish of the Department to put any obstacles whatever in the way of the Mission work, but in the interest of all concerned it is felt that a non-denominational school would be of most benefit to the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nProvince of Saskatchewan,\nAssiniboine Agency,\nSintaluta, March 31st, 1910.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit my report on school matters as requested.\n\nEducation.-There is not any school on the Assiniboine reserve. The children of school age are sent to Regina and Qu'Appelle Industrial schools.\n\nThese Indians are asking for a small Boarding school to be established on the reserve, as they are against sending their young children to either of these schools. They state that the young children become sick in these large institutions and are not noticed until they are very ill. The children are often too bashful to tell anyone they feel sick except their mothers. I know there is some truth in this, as a number of children have died at those schools or are sent home sick. Some have died after they came home, others have recovered.\n\nWe have at present about fourteen children who could attend a school on this reserve, but most of them are too young and delicate to insist on sending them to either of those large institutions for the reason I have stated regarding the parents' prejudices against the large schools.\nThey state that if they had a small Boarding school on the reserve they could see their children on Saturday and Sunday and would know if anything was wrong with them.\n\nOf the fourteen children on this reserve eleven are supposed to be Presbyterians and three are supposed to be Roman Catholics.\n\nI may say for your information that about fifteen years ago Professor Hart of Winnipeg arrived here to pick out a place to erect a mission for these Indians I assisted him to pick the place. The Mission branch of the Presbyterian church built a stone house.\n\nRev. E. McKenzie is the present missionary. He is at present teaching a few children. His wife has a sewing class twice a week for the girls, which I think is an excellent thing. They advise them on sanitary subjects and cooking. This couple have no family of their own and are doing all in their power to make these Indians followers of the cross. They also visit the sick, Mrs. McKenzie being a trained nurse.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the subject of starting a Day school on the Assiniboine Agency.\n\nI had a conversation with Mr. Agent Grant on Saturday last and he tells me the Indians are most enthusiastic about a school, and that they are expecting that one will be started in the near future. From the information I gathered while on this reserve last November and from what I have since learned, I have no hesitation in saying that if a school were started at this point it would be a success.\n\nThere are at present 11 children of school age residing on the reserve and within the next two weeks six more will be returning from the Regina Industrial school. This will make seventeen ready to go to school the day it is started.\n\nI would ask the Department to let me spend $1600.00 at once in putting up a nice little frame school, which I am sure could be completed by the first of August, and by that time everything should be ready for opening.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIf the department do not feel disposed to go on with the residence for a teacher or the small hospital, the erection of these buildings could be put off for a time and the teacher could find a place to board with the Farm Instructor on the reserve.\n\nMy idea is that the school should be built within half a mile of the Agency headquarters, which is a central point for the Indians.\n\nIf it is not necessary to let a contract for a building such as we require, I believe I could build it by day labour to good advantage under the direction of a foreman.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The building should be of frame, heated with a furnace and of sufficient size to provide ample accommodation. In your letter you have not mentioned a plan, but it is presumed that you will follow the plan submitted for the school-house it is proposed to erect on the Pile Hills reserve.\n\nThe work may be performed by day labour under the direction of a foreman, and the total cost should not exceed the sum mentioned by you, $1600.00.\n\nThe site should be carefully selected and should be on property belonging to the Indians not to the mission.\n\nThe erection of a residence for a teacher and a hospital will have to stand over for a time.\n\nBe good enough to report when building operations are commenced.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW.M.

She attended the Ewart Training Home here in Toronto and the ladies who were in touch with her cordially recommend her for this position. She is a professional teacher. Whether or not she will accept I am not yet able to answer, but I wrote to her last week even before your letter came to hand.\n\nThe question arose whether or not it will be possible for the teacher to do her duties in the classroom and also do the desired amount of nursing. Allow me to suggest Mrs. MacKenzie's name as the trained nurse,- for she has a professional standing as a trained nurse. I wrote you about her before as in my judgment unlikely to do the teaching satisfactorily, but after conference with some of the ladies here who know her, they think she could do very well what might be required in connection with the duties of a field matron. She would also co-operate very cordially with the teacher,- Miss Gunn, of whom I spoke. Of course that would affect the salary proposed for the teacher should her duties be limited to the one department. I submit that for your consideration and think that possibly it might be the most satisfactory. If Miss Gunn should see her way to accept the situation will be simplified.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/MB.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may be necessary to advertise. Would it not be well to have the salary fixed in order in advertising that we may be able to intimate what the conditions are? I wrote to you the other day about appointing Mrs. MacKenzie as nurse and allowing the teacher to confine herself to the educational department. Of course Miss Gunn's refusal may qualify that situation somewhat, although the fact remains that Mrs. MacKenzie is a trained nurse. I hope it will be possible to secure some suitable personal before the building is completed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/MBA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say that I have just returned from the Assiniboine Agency and to report that the new school building is progressing very rapidly and will be ready for occupancy by July 1st, 1910.

The Department thinks, therefore, that it would be better to have Mr. Grant delay opening the school till such time at least as the greater portion of the work is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

I am afraid it will be difficult to get a teacher for that. You give $400.00 to Miss Armstrong, Moose Mountain, which we supplement up to $550.00. This being a Public School we cannot, of course, supplement, and without such supplement the salary will not attract in the west where $500.00 is not an unusual salary.\n\nThe other day I received the Minutes of the Winnipeg Synodical Committee. I find that they do not regard favourably the Public School. This is a disappointment to me for I thought they approved. It further occurred to me in reading your letter that possibly there lay in your mind the thought of a supplement by us. If you thought it proper at this date to call it a Mission School instead of a Public School, I think our Board would be willing so to regard it and act accordingly.\n\nIn the meantime to get a teacher is the problem, and to advertise $400.00 salary would not help us I fear.\n\nHoping to hear at earliest convenience,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRPM/M\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Whether that would be practicable I am not certain. I am correct, am I not, in the understanding that it is to be an Improved Day School? I am somewhat anxious about it because Dr. Farquharson writes that he has in sight a lady teacher whom he thinks would be satisfactory. It is so hard to find suitable teachers that one would like to seize the opportunity when it offers. What about a cottage for the teacher? I understand the school has been erected some distance from the Mission, which makes the boarding problem less simple. It is the intention, is it not, to erect a cottage for the teacher?\n\nI have just heard from Mr. Heron that the MacDonald Company has made the refund honourably and that now all things are settled as to Regina accounts.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is desirable, however, that the children of Roman Catholic parents, of which there are a few on the reserve, should have the privileges of the school and the Department would ask for their exemption from all religious exercises. I have no doubt that you will grant this request and that if religious instruction is given in the school-room it will be so arranged that Roman Catholic children may be dismissed without interfering with their regular secular studies.\n\nThe recognition of this school as a Mission school will not be allowed to interfere with the plans for the work on this reserve. The school-house is now almost completed and it is proposed to erect also, if necessary, a cottage with accommodation for a teacher and a nurse. The Department was given to understand, however, that for a time the teacher could board with the farm instructor, who lives at a distance of about one-half a mile. Then the suggestion has\n\nRev. R.

There would appear to be no reason why a good day school on this reserve should not provide adequately for the educational wants of the Indians. An endeavour will be made to secure a competent teacher and if the Indians will only evidence sufficient interest there is little doubt that good results will be accomplished. The experience of the Department shows, however, that very much depends upon the interest taken by the Agent in educational work and it is hoped that the record of this school will be one creditable to your Agency.\n\nYou should visit the school at least once a week and make special reference to the work being performed in your monthly reports. You should also visit any parents who are negligent in the matter of sending their children to school, with a view to impressing upon them the advantage that will accrue from the education thus placed within their reach.\n\nYour reports on this school will be awaited with interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

If it meets with your approval I would like to be able to report to Dr. Farquharson lest she should pass into some other situation.\n\nYou have not definitely expressed yourself as to whether or not Mrs. MacKenzie should be employed as field matron. There is time enough for that and I should like that you should feel perfectly assured as to the wisdom of the suggestion. I may say that the ladies of the Board who know Mrs. MacKenzie would favour the arrangement. On the other hand I am not perfectly sure that Mr. Graham would be in full sympathy and it is important that he should be able to do his work effectively through the sympathetic co-operation of his staff. At the present time I do not see any other arrangement so satisfactory.\n\nI am glad that you have been able to secure Mr. Grant for a couple of months, which makes it possible to enter upon the work right away.\n\nI also appreciate the expression of your purpose to build a cottage next year if it is necessary. I have no doubt arrangements can be made in the meantime.\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nR.P.M./MBA.\nOttawa, July 6, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Assiniboine Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before confirming the appointment of Miss Lawrence the Department wishes to know whether she is possessed of any professional qualifications. In your communication of the 25th of May, last, you mentioned in the name of Miss Gunn, but the records of the Department show no reference to Miss Lawrence.\n\nThe Department is most anxious to obtain a qualified and competent teacher for this school, as the existing conditions are most favourable and there is every reason to believe that a capable teacher will be able to produce good results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of above date and number, and I must say it is a little discouraging to me to think that a small matter like the one in question could not have been left to my better judgement. I asked the Department to let me build this school and the work is about completed. Mr. Grant had nothing to do with the work and was not posted when he wrote as he did. There may be some outside painting to do, but aside from this everything should be in readiness for opening on July 1st, 1910.\n\nI am trying my very best to make the Day Schools a success and I have an excellent reason for rushing this work. I wanted to take advantage of an experienced teacher, whom I could get for two months, beginning with July, -a teacher, who knows the Indians and if given two months, could have the school well organised, by the time the new teacher, with possibly no experience, would be ready to take charge.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that the new school will be opened this morning. The Indians on this reserve are very much scattered. Some of the children will have to come about four miles. Their parents or guardians are partly destitute having no ponies or rigs to bring the children to the school and take them back. Would it be possible for the Department to allow a small sum of money to hire an Indian to bring and take those few children who live far away. The children I mean are living with old widows who are their grandmothers in most cases. I beg to suggest that the Department allow about $10.00 per month to an Indian who has a team to gather up all those children living with their destitute parents or guardians and convey them to and from school. I would make this Indian also act as truant officer.\n\nI beg also to ask that some arrangement be made so as the children would be provided with a lunch of some kind at the noon hour. A small boarding school would have been the best for this reserve.\nMay I be allowed to suggest that the teacher be allowed to use the programme of studies as is used in the Province of Saskatchewan. That of course would include the grading of Standards. That due allowance would be made for any attempt at Industrial work.\n\nIt would facilitate matters if a teacher with a Western training were appointed, who understands the Provincial system. It would promote harmony and there would be no difficulty in judging quality of work in comparison with local schools.\n\nI should like to be advised as to how the teacher is to be paid whether by voucher or by pay sheets.\n\nI should like to know the regulations covering the consolidated school.\n\nI shall do my best to carry out all instructions when I receive them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to matters in connection with the Assiniboine school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the questions of supplying a lunch and transporting the children to and from school will receive the attention of the Superintendent of Indian Education, who hopes to visit the West at an early date.\n\nThe appointment of a qualified teacher is receiving due consideration. I may add, for your information, that the nomination of a teacher rests with the Presbyterian Church, but the Department will insist upon having one with a professional training. It is not considered absolutely essential that the training should be received in the West, as a large percentage of the Western teachers receive their professional training in the Province of Ontario.\n\nThe payment of the teacher's salary will be made quarterly upon receipt of returns showing the enrollment and giving other information necessary. These returns should be signed by the teacher and forwarded through your office. A supply of blank forms is being sent you under\n\nW. B. Grant, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nseparate cover.\n\nAlthough a curriculum of studies is provided by the Department no objection is made to the following of the Provincial curriculum; in fact it is preferred that the teacher should use the latter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nwould not recommend her for a heavy or rough school; but as a good, tactful, Christian teacher, I consider her 100%.\n\nVery truly...P.

Graham, Esq.,\nBalcarres,\nSask.\n\nDear sir;-\n\nI received both of your letters of recent date and noted your instructions.\n\nI may say that the readers were received in good time and have used some of them already! The reader is the regular Alexandra in use in the province. They will be entirely satisfactory, and it is of course understood that children are prepared for readers carefully. I usually take three months to do that.\n\nThe school has been open for one week from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m.; recess and noon as in regular school. The attendance average to date is 9.6. Considering that it is opening week and treaty week I consider it a fair average. The highest number in the school at any one time was fourteen. There has not been any difficulty with reference to dinner, as was predicted by outside parties. All that has been received 4 cts. of biscuit per day. There has not been any kick registered yet. The main difficulty is widows with children at a distance from the school and no means of bringing them. I expect a larger attendance during the coming week.\n\nSeventy five pounds of biscuits were received during the week. Four rear end seats were received during the week and are being set in place. Neither blinds, globe or plasticine have come yet. I should like to have the blinds soon as the light is hard on the eyes.\n\nThe\nThe school is running at present under Sask. regulations and that program of studies is being used. We have asked the Department for privilege of using these all together. I do not see why they should apply as well to the Indian as to the Whiteman. It is successfully used among the foreigners and why not among the Indians.\n\nThe Indian children are working with a handicap of English. This of course knocks my discipline. I am forced to overlook rigid discipline until English is acquired a little bit. I would rather give a little than run the risk of knocking the school by disciplining hard.\n\nSo far as I see the children are interested, the parents are interested and father will visit the school twice per week. They have been fairly punctual but I do not expect that for some time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Signed) W.R. Grant.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter I received from the school teacher on the Assiniboine reserve, dealing with matters pertaining to the new school, which I thought would be interesting to you.\n\nI may say that the biscuits used were purchased locally at Sintaluta.\n\nThe blinds have already been ordered and will no doubt be in place by this time.\n\nThe globe is one which was in use at the Regina school and will be sent by first opportunity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 2, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. Grant, who is temporarily in charge of the Assiniboine school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn that a good start is being made in the educational work on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Miss Lawrence, a qualified teacher, has already been engaged. It is not considered essential that a teacher should have Saskatchewan or Manitoba training. Miss Lawrence received her training in the Toronto Normal School and has had considerable experience. Neither is it necessary that she should spend a week under Mr. Grant's supervision, as her qualifications are probably equal if not superior to his.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It was not a matter of high qualifications, but the idea was that Mr. Grant could have given the incoming teacher the benefit of his experience in handling Indian children, among whom he has lived all his life. From my experience in the past with teachers who have never had anything to do with Indians, this would have been of very great assistance to the incoming teacher. I am pleased to note that the new teacher has high qualifications.

I have been doing all in my power to force the attendance. I have succeeded fairly well. The children are getting into the habit of attending school. Their progress at school work is somewhat handicapped by lack of English. Reading, arithmetic, and writing have been well cared for. In these the program of studies for Saskatchewan has been followed. Attention has been given to bodily drills and exercises.\n\nCleanliness has been looked after so far as it is possible in a day school. Further provision ought to be made for cleanliness. Ventilation of the school has been good. The health of the children in the majority of cases has been good. The attitude toward their work is favourable, that of the parents decidedly favourable.\n\nThe number on the roll is 21; the average attendance has been 13.75. The school itself is neat and clean. Proper put houses and play grounds have been provided.\n\nThe children have made good progress for the time.

Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to matters in connection with the school recently opened on the Assiniboine reserve.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education, who recently visited this reserve, is of opinion that with judicious management this school should be a splendid success. The Presbyterian Church has the nomination of the teacher and it is confidently expected that Miss Lawrence, who was recently appointed, will, under favourable conditions, be able to attain the desired ends. It is considered, however, that to obtain these results the work of the school and the mission should be entirely disassociated. Already the officer above referred found a certain feeling of unrest among some of the Indians and it is with a view to removing any cause of dissatisfaction that the present attitude is taken by the Department, and the request made that the secular and missionwork be kept entirely separate.\n\nUnder these circumstances the Department will assume the full payment of the teacher's salary. It is understood that the Presbyterian Church now pays $150.00 to Miss Lawrence, making her total salary $550.00. I shall be obliged if you will say whether the above is the amount contributed by the Church, and advise those interested of the wish of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

The attendance is steadily increasing and last week there were eighteen pupils present. It was necessary for me to order four more seats to accommodate the extra pupils. Mr. Grant tells me that the teacher, Miss Lawrence, is doing very well.\n\nSince my last report on this school, a well has been dug and a satisfactory supply of water obtained. A stable and an Indians' waiting house have also been completed.

Dr. Farquharson of Winnipeg, the secretary of our Indian Mission Committee for the Synod of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, stating that the Rev. E. McKenzie of Hurricane Hills has written asking him to send the supplement to Miss Lawrence's salary on to her.\n\nDr. Farquharson is unaware of any supplement that we are expected to pay her, and it is probable that it refers to your taking over Miss Lawrence as teacher of a secular school. I wish to enquire with regard to the date of your commencing the entire payment of Miss Lawrence's salary, and the amount. I understand it is to be either $550 or $600.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of this information,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.E.A.-ES.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVERRY POOR COPY\nOttawa, December 7, 1910.\n\nRev.

If the Presbyterian Church was to contribute $150.00 that would make the total salary $550.00 and the Department will assume the responsibility for this amount.

[signature]\nSec'y Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived today an official cheque, no. 1847, for $10.41, dated Dec. 10th\u2014 as the balance of my salary for the September quarter. That evidently means that the Department intends paying me at the rate of $550 per year. That is what I agreed on when I accepted the position as teacher here, but with the understanding that I was to have the privilege of teaching in a mission school. I understand, however, that it has\nsince been decided to make this wholly a Government school, and under the changed conditions, I see no reason why I should not receive a salary equal to that of the public school teachers in the West. Many rural districts pay $725 a year, some of them with an average attendance of only eight or ten pupils, while I have had here an average of about twenty this week. (The attendance has increased since the introduction of the mid-day meal about three weeks ago.) In many foreign settlements, where it is harder to secure teachers, the salaries are still higher.\n\nTo make a school like this a success, is a greater demand on one than the work in an ordinary public school\u2014especially with children as yet undisciplined, and only six out of the twenty-four now enrolled able to understand English.\n\nI was led to understand that when the change from a mission to a Government school took place, there would be a substantial increase in the salary. Kindly let me know what I am to expect, before the time to send in this quarter's returns.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGertrude Lawrence.\nOttawa, January 5, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that in view of the certificates held by you and the success with which you have met in your management of the Assiniboine Indian day school since you took charge after the summer holidays last, as shown by the progress of the pupils and the excellent attendance, the Department will pay you at the rate of $720.00 per annum from the first of this month and Mr. Grant, the Agent, will be so advised.\n\nI wish to say that your work here is very much appreciated and the Department trusts that at no very distant date your school will rank among the best Indian schools in the western provinces.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Both these reports are very commendatory and I would ask you to express to Miss Lawrence the Department's appreciation of the work being performed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Grant, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report a visit I made to the Assiniboine Day school.\n\nThere were nineteen children in school at the time of my visit. They were as usual quite as clean as you would find children at Industrial or Boarding schools. The class rooms was perfect in every respect.\n\nMy visit was not expected so there was no dress parade. The children have made wonderful progress in the classroom work. It is hard to believe that such advancement could take place in such a short time.\n\nThe gardening season is now on. Most of the children have individual plots and the garden is well prepared and nicely laid out. The school surroundings are perfect.\n\nLast month there was an average attendance of 18, which is decidedly satisfactory. This Day school is without doubt a decided success and will remain so as long as the present teacher, Miss Lawrence, is in charge. She is thoroughly competent and takes more than an ordinary interest in her work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 22, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant reporting upon the conditions at the Assiniboine School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that they are so satisfactory and is expressing its appreciation to the teacher direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, May 22, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a very commendatory report from Mr. Inspector Graham upon your work at the Assiniboine School. It is evident that splendid progress is being made in the class-room work and the attention you are giving to the gardening, sewing and the mid-day meal, etc., is praiseworthy. The Department desires to express its appreciation of your services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Gertrude Lawrence,\nTeacher,\nAssiniboine Day School,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from Indian Agent Donnelly of the Assiniboine Agency with reference to the engagement of an Indian girl, Clara Williams, who has apparently been assisting Miss Laurence, the day school teacher on the reserve.\n\nI may say that the girl in question was working on and off at the time of my last inspection of this school. I could not see the necessity of her employment and felt that as nothing had been said to the Agent or myself about her, she was employed independently by the Church without the knowledge of the Department, and I think a serious mistake has been made.\n\nIn the first place I do not think the assistance of this lady is needed, and this is borne out by the remarks of Miss Laurence. The idea in the first place was that two of the older girls would do this work and it would be good training for them. When the school was started it was understood that it was non-denominational, and the success that has been achieved is largely due to that fact. Catholics as well as Presbyterians have sent their children to this school, but if the Church is going to send assistance without the knowledge of the Department, the officers in the field there is bound to be serious trouble. The Department are fortunate in having Miss Laurence as a teacher and I think it is a great mistake to interfere with her work.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have a matter relating to certain things in our connection with our Day school at this Agency, which I would like to place before you.\n\nLast April there was a lady of Indian origin by the name of Miss Williams engaged by the Presbyterian Mission Society to assist the teacher to get the noon day meals and to give some assistance in teaching the school girls in sewing and needle work on one or two afternoons in the week.\n\nThis girl is still working at the school. Now I understand that the Mission board are contemplating of asking the India Department to pay her salary in the future. This is rather a strange departure owing to the fact that after due observation, I cannot see that this assistant is of much benefit in the workings or prosperity of the school, as she is doing some of the work which should be done by the pupils in attendance; such as cooking, washing dishes and sweeping. Before she was engaged this work was mostly done by the pupils under the instructions of the teacher, Miss Lawrence. I believe this method was quite satisfactory to both the teacher and pupils. But the Presbyterian Church people did not seem to think so and they recommended that an assistance be engaged believing that Miss Lawrence had too much to do.\n\nMiss Lawrence informs me that she does not want any outside assistance other than her own pupils attending the school.\n\nThis being the case I do not see the necessity of this girl being kept at the school. I hope the Dept. will not consider any proposition from the Presbyterians to\nto pay her salary. If she should be retained I can see trouble ahead for our school. This I want to avoid if possible.\n\nKindly give me your opinions on the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG'dd. Thos. E. Lomelty,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInsp. of Indian Agencies,\nBelcarres.\nOttawa, October 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication from Mr. Agent Donnelly with reference to the engagement of an Indian girl named Clara Williams as assistant to Miss Lawrence, teacher of the Assiniboine Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Donnelly will be instructed to have this girl's services dispensed with, as it was distinctly understood that this school was to be conducted as a non-denomination school and that the school work was to be entirely disassociated from that of the mission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.D.

One child, from another day school, has come in that way on two or three occasions, and during the weeks she remained on the Reserve, attended the school only a small percentage of the time (e.g., 12 days in two months). Another case is that of a regularly enrolled pupil of Pi Appelle Industrial school, who has been on this Reserve since last August, with permission from the Agent, to attend this school. He has however attended very irregularly ever since (e.g., 30 days out of a total of 78 school days), and in this way he sets but a poor example for the others. As he is enrolled at Pi Appelle, he has not been entered on the roll here; but if he is to remain on the...\nReserve, would it not be possible to get a transfer from the Swappelle school to this one? His attendance would then count here, and also it would be easier to enforce attendance.\n\nKindly advise me as to what I should do in the matter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGertrude Lawrence.\nAssiniboia Reserve,\nSintaluta, Sask.,\nMay 25, 1916.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have now definitely decided to resign my position as teacher in the day-school on this reserve, and am sending my resignation to the authorities of the Presbyterian Church, such resignation to take effect on June 30th.\n\nIf a vacancy should occur in any of the Indian Day schools in Ontario, I shall be very glad to know of it, as I think of remaining in Ontario this fall.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGertrude Lawrence.\nOttawa, May 31, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant stating that you have definitely decided to resign your position as teacher of the day school on the Assiniboine Reserve and that you are sending your resignation to the authorities of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is sorry to learn that you have decided to leave this school and should a vacancy occur in any of the Indian schools in Ontario your application will be given consideration.

Our District Superintendent has made every effort for the past five or six weeks, and the Committee of our Women's Missionary Society have been searching in the East. On three different occasions they thought they had secured the right party, only to be disappointed.\n\nI have sent a night letter to W. M. Graham, Inspector of Indian Agencies, telling him of the situation, and asking if it will not be possible for him, in conference with our Presbytery authorities, to secure temporary supply until a permanent teacher can be secured.\n\nI have a letter from our District Superintendent today, and he claims there are many schools that are without\nteachers at the present time. This is the first time that our Women's Committee have failed to secure the help required. They are, however, continuing their search, and I hope may be able to forward a name for your approval soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nBalcarres,\nSask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nYours of September 13th to hand. Sorry to learn that you have not yet been able to get a teacher for the Assiniboia Day School. We have for the last week advertised in the Toronto papers, but only had one application, and since writing that party has declined to consider the appointment. The salary does not seem very inviting. I have a letter today from the Clerk of Qu'Appelle Presbytery, stating that Mrs. McKenzie, who is doing mission work on the Reserve, is willing to undertake the school. She holds a teacher's certificate, and the party writing feels she is a competent person. She is willing to take up the work either in connection with the mission or without. How would it do to put Mrs. McKenzie in charge temporarily, if you have no other person in sight?\n\nWe are just going to our Board Meeting. I will write you later in regard to the other matters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAttached herewith is a letter received from the Rev. J.H. Edmison, Secretary of the Home Board of the Presbyterian Missions. You will note that Mr. Edmison says that Mrs. McKenzie, who is the Presbyterian missionary on the Assiniboine reserve, is willing to take over the school until a permanent teacher is appointed. As this school is undenominational and both Catholics and Protestants attend it, I think it would be sure to make complications if the Resident Missionary took charge of it even for a short time. I should judge from Mr. Edmison's letter that he is laboring under the impression that this school is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian church. Where he got this idea I cannot say, as it has from the very beginning been a purely Government school.\n\nI am not answering the letter one way or the other as I think you may wish to deal with Mr. Edmison direct in this matter. Aside from the religious aspect of the question, you know the very unsatisfactory relations existing between our Indian Agent and Mrs. McKenzie, and I fear the school\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwill suffer is she is appointed, even temporarily.\n\nThe success of this school in the past was largely due to the fact that it was strictly undenominational.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn pr. of Indian Agencies.\nSeptember 30th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, in reference to the teacher for the Assiniboine Day School.\n\nI cannot agree even to the temporary appointment of Mrs. McKenzie as teacher.\n\nAlthough this school is undenominational, the Presbyterian Church was accorded the privilege of nominating a teacher. I hope, therefore, that they will be able to obtain the services of a competent teacher at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H.

I would like to know if it is the intention to keep the school closed during the winter.

Our District Superintendent and our Women's Missionary Society have tried in vain to get someone. I placed an advertisement in the Toronto papers, but no one responded. We then wrote Mr. Graham, and asked him, in conference with our Presbytery authorities, to secure temporary supply. He replied as follows: \"I may say that I have tried hard to get one, but so far have failed. There is a great demand for teachers all through this Province, and I fear there will be very great difficulty in procuring one for this school. In the meantime, I am doing what I can to locate a suitable teacher.\"\n\nWe only learned about a week ago that the school is still vacant. I corresponded again with our Pres-\nbytery authorities, and I have a reply this morning, in which it is stated that \"the Presbytery of Qu'Appelle has agreed to ask Mrs. E. MacKenzie to take charge of the school on the Reserve until a permanent teacher can be found\". Mrs. MacKenzie is at present in charge of our mission work on the Reserve. I understand she has a teacher's certificate. Her mission work will naturally have to be sacrificed to some extent if she takes up this work, but surely it will be better to have her take charge of the school than to leave it vacant. At the request of the Presbytery of Qu'Appelle, I am, therefore, asking that you approve of the temporary appointment of Mrs. MacKenzie.\n\nThe Presbytery also state quite frankly that it is going to be impossible to secure fully qualified teachers for the Indian Schools while the salary is below the average. Our District Superintendent reports that most of the teachers in the Province of Saskatchewan are now receiving about $75.00 per month. The salary paid at Hurricane Hills has been $60.00.\n\nWe will continue our search for a teacher, but we would like to have someone temporarily in charge.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-A.V.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not think we should agree to the placing of Mrs. Mackenzie even in temporary charge of this school; there has been a good deal of friction on her account at the agency, and, while I am not charging that she is entirely responsible for this, I think it would not be conducive to satisfactory administration if she were given any connection with the school work. I say this with regret, as we would like to meet your views if at all possible.\n\nThe Department is willing to pay the current rate for teachers at the day schools where we are in competition with white schools. I do not think Mr. Graham would feel restricted in the amount he could offer if anyone asked a higher rate of pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.H.

He rang up to ask me if I had heard anything of a teacher yet, and I told him I had not. He himself has been doing his utmost to secure one, but up to date has been unsuccessful. He is of the opinion that we shall not be able to get a teacher for the same salary as was paid to the last one, viz., $720.00 a year, but thinks $850.00 would be the least anyone would accept. I agree with him on this point.\n\nDr. Strang spoke about having an assistant to help prepare the mid-day meal and I told him I did not consider this at all necessary, as this meal was a simple affair consisting of a biscuit and a cup of tea or bowl of soup. The kitchen is in the basement and the older pupils keep the fire going and it is a simple matter for two of the senior girls to prepare this meal and wash the dishes. It takes only about an hour each day and is good training for the girls.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nWe had assistance of this kind at one time in the Assiniboine school and it proved to be more of a disadvantage than a benefit. In many of the rural schools in this province a mid-day meal is served, practically on the same lines as has been done at the Assiniboine school, except that the White children bring most of the food.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just received a letter from Dr. Peter Strang, our Home Mission Superintendent for Southern Saskatchewan, in which he states that he has secured Miss Kate MacTavish as teacher for the Assiniboine Day School. She has had thirteen years' experience in the province of Saskatchewan. She has been Principal at Tantallon, Rocanville and Acadie. She is now Principal at Acadie, and is drawing a salary of $900 per annum. She is highly recommended by J. G. McKechnie, School Inspector, who has been in close touch with her work\u2014and she is a graduate of Ottawa Normal School. Dr. Strang met with Miss MacTavish personally, and feels she is well qualified for excellent service.\n\nMiss MacTavish is not able, however, to begin work at Assiniboine School until after the end of June. As Miss Mary McColl will have to leave the work by May 23rd, Dr. Strang secured temporary supply to finish out the school term. He has therefore, secured Miss Tena Sinton of Regina. She holds a first-class, non-professional certificate. She will take charge May 25th.\n\nWe therefore recommend:\n\nthat Miss Mary McColl's resignation be accepted for May 23rd,\n\nthat Miss Tena Sinton be appointed to finish the school term,\n\nand that Miss Kate MacTavish receive the appointment, her duties to begin with the opening of the school in the autumn.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.-C.McC.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 18, 1917.\n\nRev.

Miss MacTavish may begin her duties at this school after the summer holidays and she will be paid a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum.

I have been informed by Mr. Inspector Graham that this school is an Indian Day school but must not be considered as connected with any certain denomination. I have always told the Indians this, but owing to the way the Presbyterian Missionary (Mrs. MacKenzie) lectures it makes the Indians doubtful respecting what I say in the matter. We have two factions (Roman Catholics and Presbyterians) on this Reserve.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo stating that you have just received word from Dr. Strang, your District Superintendent for Southern Alberta, that he has engaged Miss Flora McCallum as teacher for the Assiniboine Indian Day School, her duties to commence October 1st, 1917.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Miss McCallum as teacher of this school is approved. I have to ask you to be good enough to state, however, what arrangements were made with her in regard to salary, as it is not considered that her qualifications would justify the Department in paying her at the same rate as Miss McTavish, viz.\u2014$900.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, B.A.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n**REPORT of Provisions used at Rosinibourne Reserve, for Month ended Sept 30, 1917**\n\nAverage Attendance: 1829  \nMeals Served: 57\n\n| Item       | On hand at end of last month | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month |\n|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Flour      | 6 4/4                       | 25                    | 26 4/4           | 5                      |\n| Bacon      |                             |                       |                  |                        |\n| Beef       |                             |                       |                  |                        |\n| Tea        | 0                           | 6                     | 3                | 3                      |\n| Rice       | 8                           | 0                     | 8                | 0                      |\n| Soap       | 1                           | 6                     | 4                | 3                      |\n| Sugar      | 3/4                         | 27                    | 27 3/4           | 0                      |\n| Salt       | 1/2                         | 10                    | 3                | 7/2                    |\n| Potatoes   |                             |                       |                  |                        |\n| Biscuits   | 0                           | 200                   | 198              | 2                      |\n| Beans      | 7/2                         | 38                    | 20 2/3           | 25                     |\n| Oatmeal    |                             |                       |                  |                        |\n| Peas       |                             |                       |                  |                        |\n| Pepper     | 3/4                         | 0                     | 2                | 1/4                    |\n| Lard       | 0                           | 10                    | 10               | 0                      |\n| Peaches    | 0                           | 25                    | 25               | 0                      |\n| Prunes     | 0                           | 10                    | 10               | 0                      |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher, or Field Matron.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are experiencing a good deal of difficulty in securing a teacher for the Assiniboia Indian School, on account of the salary that is being offered. Apparently all the teachers in that vicinity teaching in the English schools are getting more money than has been paid the teacher at the Indian school. Dr. Strang, our District Superintendent, and Mr. McKechnie, the Inspector of schools for Saskatchewan, have been on the lookout for weeks. I have a wire from Dr. Strang this morning, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I can secure Florence Langton who possesses a second class professional certificate and ten years experience for $100 per calendar month. Will the Government pay this? I can secure a teacher with third class professional certificate for $90 per month. I have an offer from Etta Thompson who has a second class non-professional certificate, but has had no experience, for $75. Please telegraph instructions.\"\n\nBefore making a reply to Dr. Strang I would like to have your judgment in this matter. Dr. Strang does not intimate whether the teachers desiring $90 and $75 respectively want these amounts for the calendar year or for the ten teaching months, but I judge they want these amounts for the calendar months.\n\nHoping to hear from you by return mail,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.E.A.V.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 27, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Assiniboine Day School and embodying a copy of a telegram which you received from Dr. Strang, your District Superintendent, in regard to this matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appropriation for school purposes will not permit of the Department paying a salary higher than $900.00 per annum for a teacher for this school and it is considered that for this salary a thoroughly qualified and experienced teacher should be secured. The Department would not be prepared to pay Miss Thompson, who is mentioned by Dr. Strang, at this rate, as she has only a second class non-professional certificate and has had no experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI have just received a letter from Dr. Strang our District Superintendent, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I have secured Miss Grace Frame of Lenore, Man., for the Indian Day School at Hurricane Hills at a salary of $900 per annum as agreed by the Indian Department. You will note that this is not $75 per month as formerly but $90 per month. This should be made clear to the Department now. Miss Frame has a second class professional certificate for Saskatchewan and has had experience in Lenore school. Miss Frame began work there on Sept. 9th. I enclose her acceptance.\"\n\nI sincerely hope that this appointment will meet with your approval. It becomes increasingly difficult to secure teachers as Trustee Boards in the vicinity of these schools are paying in many instances much higher salary than we are prepared to give.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Frame, teacher of the Assiniboine Indian Day School, to take effect on the 18th of April next.\n\nMiss Frame has given no reasons for resigning her duties. As the nomination of a teacher is in the hands of the Presbyterian Church authorities, under whose auspices this school is conducted, I have to request that you will be good enough to endeavour to secure a teacher in time to begin duties when Miss Frame leaves.\n\nIt is regretted that Miss Frame has seen fit to resign as it will be difficult to obtain the services of another teacher to complete the school year. It is hoped, however, that you will be able to secure a suitable person as teacher of this school for the balance of the school year, namely, to June 30th, next, in order that the children may not be deprived of their schooling. It might be possible to induce Miss Frame to reconsider her decision to resign and induce her to remain until June 30th next.\n\nThe Department will be obliged if you will give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev.

If possible you should endeavour to have her reconsider her decision and induce her to remain until the end of the school year.\n\nThe authorities of the Presbyterian Church are being informed that her resignation has been received and have been requested, in the event of Miss Frame not remaining as teacher, to secure the services of a competent teacher to continue the work until the end of the school year at least, in order that the children may not be deprived of their schooling.\n\nYou should inform the Department as to whether Miss Frame will remain until the end of June next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Edmison, B.A.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison:\n\nIn accordance with your request of the 2nd inst. I have secured a teacher for the Assiniboine Indian Day School. Mrs. Margaret B. Boyce, Regina, whose application I enclose. She is in every way eminently fitted for this position and I hope that the Government will sufficiently increase the salary to make it equal to the salaries paid by School Boards to teachers in the surrounding School districts so that her services can be retained after June 30th. I saw the Principal of the Normal School, Regina, and J. G. McKechnie, one of the School Inspectors for the Province, yesterday. They both assured me that $900 per annum is much below the salaries being paid 2nd class teachers in the Province.\n\nYou will note that Mr. J. D. McLean in his letter of Oct. 7th, 1918, agreed to a salary of $900 per annum. There are 210 days in the teaching year in Saskatchewan. Mrs. Boyce is, therefore, applying for $900 per annum or $\\frac{900}{210}$ per teaching day. I hope that you can persuade the Government to increase this amount after June 30th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Peter Strang.\nApril 15, 1919\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter I have just received from Mrs. Margaret Boyce in which she applies for the position of teacher at Assiniboia Day school. I am also enclosing copy of a letter from Dr. Strang, our District Superintendent.\n\nYou will see the conditions on which Mrs. Boyce agrees to remain in the work after June 30th. Apparently she is willing to accept salary at the rate of $900 for the balance of the term, but after that she wants to be assured of an increase. This question of teachers' salaries is getting to be a serious one. I am quite persuaded that if we are going to get properly qualified teachers to take charge of our schools we will have to pay them current salary.\n\nPlease let us know what the department is prepared to do in this case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. J. Ednuson, Toronto, to the Indian Department Ottawa and have failed owing to the amount of salary paid $900 plus a bonus of $150 per annum. The minimum for which teachers are engaging from the Provincial Government's teachers' exchange who hold only third class standing is $1200.00\n\nI shall be glad if you can assist us to convince the Indian Department that the present scale of salaries they pay is too low for this province.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD) PETER STRANG.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from Rev. Peter Strang D.D., which has reference to his inability to secure a suitable teacher for the Hurricane Hills Day School, on the ground that the salary offered is insufficient. Doctor Strang makes a comparison with the minimum salary paid to teachers in this Province who hold Third Class Certificates, but he has probably overlooked that teachers engaged for Indian Department work are provided with house accommodation, a perquisite which other school teachers do not enjoy.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(W.M.

A. Coles as teacher to succeed Miss Donaldson. It is now presumed that Miss Coles did not accept the position and the Department is taking this matter up with the church authorities and Mr. Commissioner Graham and it is hoped that a teacher will be secured at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, in which he encloses a copy of a letter from Rev. Peter Strang, D.D., which has reference to his inability to secure a suitable teacher for the Assiniboine Indian Day School, on the ground that the salary offered is insufficient. Dr. Strang makes a comparison with the salaries paid the teachers in the white schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer to your letter of the 20th ultimo recommending the appointment of Miss E. A. Coles for the position as teacher at this school. It is presumed that she did not accept this position.\n\nWith reference to the salary allowed, the Department is prepared to make an increase of $100.00, which will allow a salary of $1,000.00 per annum for a teacher having a Second Class Certificate. Besides, I would point out in this case a teacher's residence is provided, and it is considered that the salary allowed at this increased rate with living accommodation will make a salary equal to that allowed teachers in the white schools having similar qualifications.\n\nI am informing Mr. Commissioner Graham of the increase allowed and asking him to be good enough to take up with Dr. Strang the matter of securing a qualified teacher for the Assiniboine Day School. If you consider it advisable you might also communicate with Dr. Strang in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. H.

Peter Strang, D.D., regarding his inability to secure a suitable teacher for the Assiniboine (Hurricane Hills) Indian Day School, as he states, the salary offered is insufficient in comparison with that paid to teachers in the provincial schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary allowed for a qualified teacher for this school was $900.00 per annum, which the Department has decided to increase to $1,500.00 per annum. It is considered that, with house accommodation also provided, the salary paid will compare favourably with that received by teachers having the same qualifications in the provincial schools.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of the 23rd ultimo, the church authorities had nominated Miss E. A. Cole for the position, to begin duties the beginning of the new year. It is presumed that she did not accept the position and I shall be pleased if you will take the matter up with Dr. Strang informing him of the increase in salary and requesting him to endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicants should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. It is hoped that he will be able to obtain the services of a teacher at an early date, in order that this school may not remain closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

In fact, even at these figures it is impossible to supply the demand that at present exists as there are hundreds more summer schools opening during February, March and April then there are qualified teachers for them. Under such conditions we naturally could not hold out very favorable prospects of securing a capable and efficient teacher at a less figure than those which we have quoted above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN TEACHERS' AGENCY.\n\nper (Signed) C.B.

He says that the teachers in Saskatchewan do not regard $1,000, and the little house as sufficient remuneration. Dr. Strang sends us a letter from Mr. McKee of the Canadian Teachers' Agency, a copy of which I am enclosing. You will see his difficulty. If the Department is not prepared to increase the salary, we will continue our search for a teacher. I can assure you we will do our best, but you will appreciate our handicap.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/LM.\nOttawa, February 17, 1921.\n\nRev.

Mr. Wilson has forwarded me a copy of a letter dated 19th instant, which he wrote to the Department regarding Miss Glover's salary.\n\nI made it quite clear to Doctor Strang that as far as the Department was concerned, they could only promise a straight salary of $1000.00 a year, and in the event of the bonus being allowed, she would get an additional $150.00. The Doctor said that he wanted to have something definite to say to Miss Glover, and I suggested that he guarantee the bonus, in the event of the Department not being able to grant it, that the Church would. He agreed to this.\n\nI have today written to the Agent at Assiniboine Agency, explaining the matter fully, and assured him Miss Glover will be paid at the rate of $1150.00.\n\nIn the past, the furniture for the teacher's house has been furnished by the teachers themselves. It appears though that Doctor Strang promised a furnished house. Fortunately we have a lot of new beds and mattresses, and I will send a supply from here, which will overcome the matter of furnishing a house.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 9th instant No.102-I-T in connection with the appointment of Miss Clara Glover as teacher of the Assiniboine Day School here,\n\nI beg to say that Miss Glover was given to understand by Dr. Strang of Regina, that she would have a guaranteed salary of $1150 for the year. She has since received a letter from the Teacher's Agency at Regina, stating her salary would be $1000 and bonus if the Department decided to allow a bonus, which yet is not certain.\n\nMiss Glover informed me last night that she would not consent to stay on, unless her salary was fixed at $1150 for the year; also that she be allowed all fuel for the teacher's residence here and necessary furniture.\n\nI beg to say that the only furniture in this residence at the present time is a cook stove. She would require pipes for the cook stove, a bed, mattress, bedding, a table, an easy chair and 2 kitchen chairs, also a small heating stove and pipes for the inside room.\n\nSecretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI am quite satisfied that Miss Glover understands the work thoroughly, and will make a success of this school if anyone can. I would ask that her request meet with your favorable consideration.\n\nThe school she was teaching in last year is now vacant, where her salary was $1400, and she states she could go right back there, but that if the Department will grant her request she would be satisfied to remain here at least a year.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 30, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the salary to be paid Miss Clara Glover, who has recently been appointed teacher of the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you have taken this matter up with Dr. Strang and that it has been adjusted.\n\nAs you have probably seen by the press, the bonus has again been granted for the next fiscal year, but at a reduction of $50 from that provided for the current year.

The school is conducted by Miss Glover, whom I found to be very interested in her work, and I believe is quite a capable teacher. I, however, found the attendance at the school away below what it should be. There are 28 children on roll - 17 girls and 11 boys, who are entered in the following grades -\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 14     |\n| 2     | 8      |\n| 3     | 4      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n| 5     | 1      |\n\nTaken for the last six months, the attendance in the fall was from 8 to 14 a month, in January it went down to 6.26, which shows that not one-quarter of the number of children were attending during January. As this was not a very satisfactory showing, I had a meeting of the parents, and discussed the school question with them, and assured them that this state of affairs could not continue, as unless the attendance was better than at present, the Department would probably be obliged to close the school, and in that event the children would have to be sent to a boarding school. On no Reserve have I ever found the Indians so averse to sending their children to boarding schools as they seem to be under the impression that it is practically the same to send their children there as to send them to their graves. They are, therefore, very anxious to keep the Day School going, and as seventy-five per cent of the parents are school graduates themselves, they believe in education. The low attendance at the school is not altogether the fault of the parents, although to a great extent it is; a number of the boys are sent to school every morning, but instead of going to school, they play around the Reserve, and about the time the other children are coming from school, they join in with them and go home. In some cases the Indians are really living too far from the school; those living on the south end of the Reserve are about six miles from school, and those living on the northeast portion of the Reserve are about seven miles from school, and several of the children have got to travel from three to five miles, and as a number of them are young, it is really too far to send them in cold weather. The Agent claims he has time and time visited the parents and talked to them and to the children about attending school, but without much results. I think, however, that my meeting with the Indians will stimulate their interest, as I made the situation very plain to them, and the second day I was on the Reserve, there was an attendance of 14 at the school, and on the third day there were 16, although both days were stormy.\n\nSeveral of the Indians made the request that a conveyance be supplied from each end of the Reserve to take\n\n- the children to -\nthe children to and from school, as was the custom a number of years ago. I advised them that the attendance so far did not warrant this expenditure, and as the winter was nearly over, and the summer coming on, this could not be considered at present. If the attendance is good during the next six months, it might be well to consider some kind of a conveyance to take the children to school. This, however, is only a suggestion.\n\nThe school itself is in good repair, and was clean and tidy. The teacher lives in a small residence, just back of the school.\nExtract from Mr. Commissioner Graham's covering letter accompanying Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Assiniboine Agency.\n\nMarch 2, 1922.\n\n(Original on File 77-102.)\n\n\"I would also draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks with reference to the school attendance, in regard to which we have always had trouble at this Agency, although this is one of the best Indian day schools in the province, and it seems to me, in view of the Inspector's warning to the parents of the children, that if there is no improvement in the attendance, the Department should take steps to send three or four of the pupils who absent themselves from school most frequently to a boarding school. I think that such a step would have a tendency to improve matters. You are doubtless aware that at one time two teams were employed in conveying children to and from the school, but this practice was abandoned as the attendance did not warrant such an expenditure.\"\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson, in a report dated February 27, 1922, states that Miss Glover, the Teacher at the Assiniboine Day School, is capable and interested in her work. 28 were enrolled and the average attendance for January was 6.26. The Inspector had a meeting of the parents and informed them that, if the school attendance did not improve, the Department would consider closing the day school and assign the children to residential schools. The parents seem to believe in education, but are adverse to sending their children to residential schools. The Inspector promised consideration to a conveyance to bring the children from the farther homes to the school next winter, if the attendance kept up at an encouraging rate for the coming summer and fall.\n\nThe school was clean and tidy - the teacher lives in a small residence immediately behind the school.\nOttawa, March 16, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of your letter of the 2nd instant, which accompanied Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Assiniboine agency.\n\nThe Department has noted your recommendation to send to a residential school three or four of the pupils who absent themselves frequently from the Assiniboine Indian Day School. In the Inspector's report it is stated that the parents were warned and that an improvement in the attendance was noticeable immediately.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that the Department will keep in mind your suggestion and, if the average attendance continues to show the presence of delinquency, steps will be taken to commit the worst offenders to the proper residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 29, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson, on the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nIt appears that there is considerable delinquency on the part of some of the Indian pupils, and the Department, at the suggestion of Mr. Commissioner Graham, is prepared to commit the worst offenders to residential schools, if the Inspector's warning to the parents is not heeded.\n\nYou might keep this in mind and intimate to the Department, in the course of a few weeks, whether or not there has been a noticeable improvement in the attendance at the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

The Department would be pleased to have a report from you, concerning the attendance at the Assiniboine Indian Day School. At times it is thought desirable to have a communication from our representative in the field, embodying his opinion as to the advisability of continuing Indian day schools which are more or less unsuccessful.\n\nThe report for the quarter ended the 30th September shows an enrolment of 26 and an average attendance of 10. What is the general success and what interest is evinced by the Indian parents living in the immediate vicinity?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. D. Wilson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nRed Circle is drawn around a three mile radius from proposed more central site.\n\nBlack Circle is drawn around a three mile radius from present school site.\n\nN.B. Figures in brackets show number of children & school age also those who will shortly be of school age in the individual homes.\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo No.102-1-I, in connection with the attendance at the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that from the time of Mr. Inspector Christianon's inspection last winter of this school, every effort has been made to endeavour to have the parents send their children to this school more regularly, and some of the worst delinquents have since been sent to Boarding Schools. In some cases it is not altogether the fault of the parents as they have sent their children from home to go to school but the children have not always put in an appearance.\n\nFor some years it has been a source of great dissatisfaction amongst the Indians that the school is situated where it is, and not in a more central location on the Reserve. According to the accompanying diagram it will be seen that most of the children who should now be attending this Day School have a long way to come, and this is an excuse for non-attendance which the Indians have put before me on several occasions.\n\nIt is extremely difficult in any case where the children are living with the uneducated Indians to get the parents to realize the importance of education and any excuse is put forward for their being absent.\n\nWith the younger generation where English is always spoken in the homes the situation would not present so many difficulties if the school was in a more central location; but where children have to go such a long distance especially in stormy or cold weather, there is a constant anxiety resting on the parents from the time the children leave home in the mornings until they arrive home again in the afternoon.\n\nSecretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa\nAnother important factor and objection is that amongst some of the younger Indian parents who want their children to go to school; in order to insure regular attendance they are compelled to have them boarding with some of their older relations (generally uneducated and old time Indians) who live in closer proximity to the school. This means over crowding in the houses which is generally from the stand point of sanitation alone more of a detriment than a benefit.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that this Day School is not a success, and unless some means can be taken to take away the excuses and I may say in some cases valid reasons for non-attendance the probability of making it a success is very remote.\n\nFrom the other view point, supposing the school was moved to a more central location the doubt arises of the difficulty in getting a teacher to go and live near the school and practically 3 miles by the road from the Agency. The teacher here has no means of transportation or of obtaining her supplies except when she goes into town or sends with some of the Agency people who are going to town; and would be isolated to a certain degree from white communication. I know that in certain isolated school districts in the foreign settlements around where the teacher has to live by him or herself at the school the Department of Education has to allow a very high rate of salary in order to get a suitable teacher to live under such conditions.\n\nI understand that some years ago there was a system of having the children driven to and from school. Requests have been made to me from time to time by some of the Indians to have this started up again; but it was not a success then and had to be abandoned, and I feel sure it would not be any more of a success to-day than it was before.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say I have endeavoured to explain to the Department as fully as possible the difficulties there are to contend with in connection with this school: and I would appreciate any suggestions the Department might offer as a means of overcoming our present troubles in this direction.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your careful and clear report has been examined with interest, and the Department agrees with you that it is most difficult to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the difficulties that prevent a complete success at this school.\n\nIt has been suggested that the school building be moved, not to the proposed site as mentioned in your plan, but to the northwest corner of Section 21, provided however, that a suitable site can be secured; that the building is in condition to be moved; and if the expense incidental to the moving is not too high. The teacher and the Hotomani children would be the only ones interested that would be farther from the school if it were moved. The Ferniece, Little Chief and Owatoh families would be about the same distance. The merit in such a move would be that the school would be closer for the children in the following families:- Good Voice, Gray, Rider, Moon Face, Medicine Rope, Haywahe and Iron Star.\n\nWould you indicate whether this plan recommends itself to you, the possibility of securing a suitable site and moving the school, also give a rough estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have noted that Dr. Strang, of the Presbyterian Church, has informed you that Miss Freeman will likely continue her duties until the end of the calendar year.\n\nI expect that the Church authorities will, in due course, nominate a successor to the present teacher. Dr. Edmonson has informed the Department that it is his wish to install a new resident missionary on the Reserve, and he has discussed with the Department the advisability of having this man teach the day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMr. D. C. Scott, Litt.D.,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nWe have just been notified by Dr. Strang, District Superintendent for Southern Saskatchewan, that Mrs. Pearl Clark (Miss Pearl Freeman) teacher at Assiniboina Day School, has tendered her resignation, this to take effect Oct. 5th.\n\nWe have pleasure in recommending Rev. Wm. Millar, B.A., who holds a teacher's certificate for the province of Manitoba, as successor. Mr. Millar, in addition to his care of the school, will do any mission work that is necessary on the reserve. He will live in the Presbyterian Mission House.\n\nSome time ago I took this matter up with Mr. Ferrier and he intimated that it would be quite all right for the Presbyterian Church to secure someone who could take charge of the school and carry on the mission work. We, of course, would advise Mr. Millar that there will be a few Roman Catholic children in the school and nothing sectarian can be introduced into the day school curriculum. We are assuming that the Government will continue the salary of $1000 a year paid to former teachers at this point.\n\nKindly let me know at once, preferably by wire, if this appointment finds your approval. Mr. Millar is at present at Chauvin, Alta., and it will take some time to get released from his charge. We expect that he can begin work at latest by Oct. 10th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have heard that they object to the teacher always being a protestant as the present regulation requires where the majority of the children are of that faith. It may be that the Catholic Indians are being inspired from outside sources to raise this objection but it might be well to avoid even the appearance of partiality by changing, if possible that regulation when throwing the appointment of, when next it becomes vacant, to all comers irrespective of creed and everything else except academic and other fitness for the post. Whatever the cause or the remedy the present situation should be grappled with vigorously if we would avoid the criticism that the education of the Indian children is not being well administered.\n\nJ.

OCTOBER 24, 1924.\n\nThere should be more manual work for the boys and more sewing, cutting out and making up of dresses and other garments for the girls. Out of these exercises might originate much of the reading, arithmetic and composition. The pupils would have a motive for reading, for writing and for composition, if the problems, the reading and the themes were thus taken from their work and with the introduction of strong motivation and interest, much more progress should be made. It is a great pity that most of the pupils leave school with a poor grade III standing. Indian stories and stories of the little people of other lands should be freely used. The interest, I am sure, the children would take in this kind of reading would accelerate immensely their acquisition of reading. Oral Language in conversation lessons should be featured as also singing. Every effort should be made to give the children, while they are in school the ability to express themselves in easy idiomatic English. For this purpose the supply of books is all too scanty. There are more than enough texts\u2014Arithmetics, Grammars, Composition books, Geographies, etc., but a very poor supply of supplementary reading material.\n\nTeacher....... William Millar (Rev.)\n\nI would however repeat my suggestion of last year that oral language lessons should be featured, following the method outlined say in the Ontario Manual and that the ability of the pupils to speak English be specially aimed at.\nOttawa, February 16, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nThe public school inspector in his report of inspection of the Assiniboine Indian Day School, states that there should be more manual work for the boys and more sewing, cutting out and making up of dresses and other garments for the girls, as out of these exercises might originate much of the reading, arithmetic and composition and much more progress would be made. The inspector recommends that Indian stories and stories of the little people of other lands be freely used and that the interest the children would take in this kind of reading would accelerate immensely their acquisition of reading. Oral language or conversation lessons should be featured as also singing and every effort should be made to give the children the ability to express themselves in easy idiomatic English. He further recommends that for this purpose a supply of supplementary reading material should be furnished.\n\nYou should consult the teacher regarding the suggestions made by the inspector to improve the classroom instruction and suggest any action that should be taken.

The question of keeping up the attendance has always been a problem at this school, and I believe the Department would be justified in seriously considering the closing of the school and sending the children to a boarding school, and I think we would get better results. There is accommodation for them at File Hills and Elkhorn.\n\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL INSPECTOR JAMES LITTLE ON ASSINIBOINE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL,\ndated October 6, 1926, FORWARDED BY COMM. GRAHAM.\n\nOriginal on 102-1-6.\n\nSuccess: Fair.\nAttendance: So poor that no teacher could do good work.\n\nSuggestions: That an attendance officer be appointed, who will round up, each day, the children not at school. I understand that the Indian does not take school education seriously; the children remain at home for trivial causes or for no cause at all. An attendance officer might be engaged for three months as an experiment. He might have a conveyance for taking the children to school. The work at school should be made more winsome, more adapted to the nature of the child and especially to the Indian child. I would suggest plenty of singing, school concerts; a good supply of equipment for games and sports. Could you not supply a specialist for a month or two to try some of these suggestions.\nOttawa, November 24, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the attendance is so poor at the Assiniboine Indian Day School, that the Department is seriously considering the advisability of its early closing and the placing of the children in residential schools. The Public School Inspector and others have reported fairly favourably concerning the Rev. W. Miller, the teacher; but it is evident that the attendance is so irregular that good results cannot be secured. Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, recommends that the school be closed. Please let me have your opinion in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H.

Edmison, D.D.,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI got your letter a few days ago with a copy of a letter bearing date of November 24th, from J.D. McLean, Ottawa, advising you that the Indian Department is seriously considering the advisability of the early closing the Assiniboine Indian Day School and placing the children in residential school because of the irregular attendance. You advise me that you would like my judgement on this matter and also that of Rev. R.J. McDonald, the Home Mission Convener.\n\nI at once advised Rev. Wm. Miller, the teacher missionary that we would visit the Reserve and consult the parents about this important matter. I also advised Mr. McDonald and he was willing to make the trip down. In reply Mr. Miller by phone advised me that owing to the deep snow and the cold weather that it would be impossible to get the parents to attend a meeting. I asked him to write me fully concerning this matter. I got his letter today. He says that the average attendance for October was 8.5, for November 9.6, for last week 9.2, for the week before 11.2 and for the week before that 13. He says the attendance is better in the winter than in the summer, except in extreme weather. He told the children that there was danger of the school being closed unless there was a better attendance. He also advised me that he would tell the parents. He says the parents would raise quite a howl if the school were closed. He says that there are only five children within three miles of school and that the rest are from three to six miles.\n\nIn 1913 the Indian Department provided transportation by bus to and from the school and dinner for the children. I am of opinion that this should be done again. The attendance of white children who had to come from three to six miles to school this weather would not likely be at all satisfactory. The transportation plan was discontinued when the war broke out and has not been resumed. I am of opinion that it should be. I hope that the Indian Department will not take any hasty action in this. I think that Presbytery will very strongly oppose closing the school. If a strong resolution from Presbytery and a petition from the parents of the children will be of any value, we shall be glad to get it for you.\n\nI think the bus plan of getting the children to and from school should be urged upon the Indian Department. This would solve the difficulty.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Peter Strang.\nMr. John D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nSome time ago you wrote me in regard to the closing of the Assiniboine Day School. I have been in correspondence with Dr. Strang, the District Superintendent, and I enclose a copy of his letter. If you want us to go into this matter further and submit another report, we will do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/EWS\nOttawa, December 15, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your 301-11 of the 15th ultimo, I have to inform you that the church authorities do not concur in the proposal to close the Assiniboine Indian Day School. I now understand that most of the children enrolled are three miles or more from the school and that it has been urged that the Department convey the children to the classroom. You will remember that this was the practice some years ago. Please let me have a further recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

You inform me that the church authorities do not concur in my proposal to close the school, and that it has been urged that the Department convey the children to the classroom, owing to the long distances which many of them have to come.\n\nI have looked into this matter and find that there are 54 children living three miles or more from the school, twenty of these being of school age. There are 25 children living within three miles, nine being of school age. Nine of the first 54 children mentioned who are of school age have from five to six miles to travel to get to school.\n\nI really do not know what to recommend. We have not had success in the past by conveying children to school, but we might give it another trial. It might cost from $1.00 to $1.50 a day for a man to drive these children, but I am not sure about this. If you wish me to go further into the matter of cost, etc., I will do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 5, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 301-11 of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the question of arranging for the conveyance of the children of school age to and from the Assiniboine Indian Day School each day it is in operation. It is noted that there are some twenty children of school age who reside three miles or more from the school and nine of school age living within three miles.\n\nAs the Church authorities have urged that the Department arrange for the conveyance of the children to the school, I shall be pleased if you will enquire further into the cost of the services of a man and a suitable conveyance to drive the children from their homes to the school and return each school day. If arrangements could be made for this service at a reasonable rate, the Department would be prepared to give the plan a trial. I shall be pleased to have full particulars as to the arrangements that you would advise be made, as well as the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to department letter #102-1-1 of the 5th instant I beg to say that I have ascertained that the children attending the Assiniboine Day School can be conveyed at a cost of $2.25 per day, the distance to be travelled being about 25 miles for the round trip. This would take in all the children who are more than two miles from the school with the exception of those of C. Rider Jr. and P. Moon Face, both of whom live on the West side of the reserve, and who are quite a distance from any of the other Indians. These two men would have to arrange to get their children to school by the best means available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJanuary 28, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nFor some time, I have given consideration to the question of driving to school 14 children on the Assiniboine reserve who are more than 2 miles from the site of the classroom. Mr. Commissioner Graham has secured the offer of an Indian to do this driving for $2.25 per day. If the scheme was successful, the day school would be really worthwhile, as there is already an average attendance of 9 other children. I wish to recommend that the special activity be given a trial for the remainder of this academic year.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 28, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 301-11 of the 24th instant, relative to the conveying of the children of school age to and from the Assiniboine Indian Day School each day it is in operation. In this connection it is noted that arrangements can be made at a cost of $2.25 per day to convey all the children who reside more than two miles from the school, with the exception of the two families mentioned by you who live on the west side of the Reserve.\n\nThe Department will approve of this scheme being given a trial for the remainder of the present school year, to June 30th next. You may, therefore, arrange for the conveying of the children each school day. The cost of this service should not exceed your estimate. Vouchers should be forwarded from time to time for payment of this service. This arrangement is to be carried out, as stated, during the present school year only. The continuing of this arrangement for another year will depend entirely upon the success which is met with during the present year.\n\nIt is hoped that this arrangement will lead to a greatly improved and more regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAset. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nInspector Hamilton's Report on the Day School, Assiniboine Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Assiniboine Day School, inspected January 17th, 1928.\n\nThe roll call here numbers 30 - 11 boys and 19 girls. Those present on the day of my visit numbered 18, and this number has not been exceeded except on one occasion when 19 were present. The average for the quarter ending December was 14.4, and that of September 13.6. The children are hauled to school, but even in spite of this, they remain home if the least excuse can be found.\n\nThe classroom has been nicely decorated since my last inspection, and is much brighter and more cheerful. I noticed a number of children had their coats in the classroom instead of hanging in the cloakroom. However, on examination, I found all the hooks but three either gone or broken. This certainly must be due to carelessness as the remaining hooks show that they were made of heavy material and would not break with ordinary jars.\n\nThe pupils are arranged in three grades, namely:\n\n- Primer with 8 pupils\n- Grade 2 \" 17 \"\n- Grade 5 \" 5 \"\n\nW. M. Graham, BSc.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 1)\nThe work examined was only fair, and in view of the discipline, I doubt if very much progress is made. The children, when in class, stood in any manner and, if possible, leaned against the wall or lounged on the front seat. In fact, they hardly appeared to know what it meant to stand in a straight row.\n\nDinner is served in the basement, but it certainly did not present a very clean appearance. I believe it is difficult to keep this place in decent shape on account of the coal bin and furnace. The floor was quite dirty with coal dust and ashes. I found some dishes not put away and the dirty dish water was still in the dishpan on the stove. I realize that this is far from a satisfactory kitchen and dining room, and yet I believe it could be greatly improved if more strict supervision were maintained.\n\nThe cistern pump would not work, and I found about half the pipes leading from the furnace disconnected, either broke at the elbows or pulled apart. The check damper in the furnace is also apart and should be repaired. The Agent informed me that he had this furnace repaired some time ago, and apparently the present condition is due largely to the rough manner in which the children carry on. Some of the furnace pipes are badly dinged and bent and apparently have been hit by something. The basement wall was whitewashed at one time, but is now dirty. One or two coats of lime would brighten the place and give it a cleaner appearance.\n\nThe school has also been painted outside, and the work apparently well done. The fence was repaired and painted. However, I noticed one or two pickets...\npickets were already broken. Two swings were erected from which the children have derived a great deal of pleasure.\n\nThe wooden pump in the school yard I found frozen solid. The head was split and I have no doubt that the lower pieces are damaged if not destroyed. This certainly shows lack of interest and could have been avoided had anyone been interested enough to attend to the matter.\n\nAs mentioned in other reports, Mr. Millar has only one arm and can hardly be expected to do much repair, yet I do think he could exert himself more; at least the children could be made to use more care as regards government property, and continual repair should not be necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Mr. Hamilton's report on the Day School in the Assiniboine Agency and I regret that conditions are not a lot better than they are. With an enrolment of 30 children and an average attendance of 13.6 and 14.4 respectively for the quarters ending September and December there is something radically wrong and it seems to me that this is a field where we should send the children to Boarding School. As matters stand it just means that these children are receiving a very indifferent education and the Government is paying for it.\n\nI may say that last year I visited this school and saw that the interior of the classroom had been sadly neglected and it was the duty of the teacher and the Agent to report on this matter before allowing it to get down to the condition in which I found it. However, the Department came to the rescue and put the classroom in first-class shape. The fence was also in a dilapidated condition when I was there and it was put in good repair and now the Inspector reports that some of the pickets have already been broken. I think the teacher is responsible for this and it looks as though he is just letting things go, even though it might be a simple matter to keep them up.\n\nThe Inspector reports that the basement was not in good shape. Now there are girls at the school, and even boys, who could keep the basement spotlessly clean if the teacher knew his business, but he seems to be an indifferent, easy-going man. I have gone down into the basement of this school in the early days and found it immaculate, and the furnace being there would not mitigate greatly against keeping it clean if those in charge-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\ncharge of the school were alert. I am instructing the Agent to purchase a bushel of lime and a couple of whitewash brushes, which will not cost very much, and to go to the school and supervise the sweeping and whitewashing of the basement and then instruct the teacher that the place must be kept clean.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the wooden pump in the yard. I think the teacher could have had this repaired, in fact I question whether it would have frozen up at all if proper care had been taken. The cistern pump should also have been attended to, as well as the furnace pipes which are reported to be in very bad shape. The fact is that Mr. Millar is not qualified to fill the position as it should be filled, and it seems to me if the Department cannot get rid of him he should at least be given to understand very clearly what his duties are and what is expected of him.\n\nThe Agent is being instructed to see that the furnace and the pumps at this school are put in proper shape without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 1, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nRecent reports indicate that little progress is being made at the Assiniboine Indian Day School, in southern Saskatchewan. Rev. Mr. Millar is finishing his fifth year at this point and has received considerable departmental support in connection with any suggestions that would make for a successful school activity. A hot lunch is provided for the pupils and they are drawn to school by vans. The average attendance continues to be unsatisfactory, the physical equipment is suffering from lack of care and the school, generally, is not kept in a clean condition.\n\nIt is true that the teacher cannot give his personal attention to the whole activity, but he is directly responsible and I am satisfied that it is time to effect a change. I should be very grateful if you could arrange to have a teacher with bright methods of instruction and with a practical turn of mind appointed to this important day school for the first of September, next. For a fully qualified incumbent, the Department will allow a salary of $100 per teaching month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n256 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nFebruary 1, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 601-11 of the 26th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Assiniboine Indian Day School. I believe the only conclusion that can be drawn from this report is that the Reverend Mr. Millar is hardly suited for this post. I am today writing to the church authorities, with a view to making a change at the end of the academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

I will look into the matter and hope to be able to nominate a suitable person in due course.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning.\nAssiniboine Reserve, Mar. 8th\n\nMr. Russell J. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI need notice that my services as teacher are found on Aug. 31st.\n\nI was informed at the office that the inspector reported the school basement as dirty. It was swept out every school day by the children. If it was not clean, it is because no provision had been made to have it scrubbed as often as the floor upstairs. The floor in the school room is oiled and easily swept clean. The basement floor at the end where the stove and tables are is rough finished and stained with oil in places. It is a dirty gray color and does not look clean even when scrubbed. The nurse who was here the week after the inspector said the only way to clean the basement floor was to have it scrubbed. The caretaker got instructions at the office in regard to her duties. I saw the floor was swept as my duty, so I don't see why I should be punished.\n\nThe basement walls were never whitewashed until after I came. They have been twice since the inspector's visit.\n\nThe health and appearance of the children are much improved the last four years. I think they have made fair progress considering the irregularity of attendance.\n\nI am writing this to let you know how I feel about the matter hoping you will reconsider.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Miller,\nSintaluta,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hodgson and splendid results are being obtained.\n\nThe roll calls for 35 pupils and 32 were present. The average attendance for the three months of the last quarter being October 29.04; November 31.25; and December 30.56, and for the term 30.24.\n\nThe grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 14\n- Grade 2 - 7\n- Grade 3 - 9\n- Grade 4 - 6\n\nThese children speak out well, are attentive, and I found the exercise books tidy. Prior to the present teacher taking over this work, the children would not speak above a whisper and singing was entirely out of the question. They are now able to sing quite well and the selections are bright and entertaining.\n\nA noonday meal is served in the basement of the school. The children do most of the work in regard to preparing the vegetables and the washing and cleaning up of the dishes. This is a splendid training for girls and they appear to take pride in doing well any duties assigned to them. The meal consists of soup made from beef, vegetables, rice and barley.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 2)\nrice, and barley. Biscuits are served, and cocoa or milk given as a drink. I understand fruit and puddings are often served, especially in warm weather in place of soup.\n\nAn effort has been made each year to grow a garden, but with little success on account of lack of moisture. However this work will be tried again and any vegetables raised will be used in the serving of the noon meal.\n\nThe interior of the school was clean throughout and all cupboards tidy. The classroom had been redecorated this year and is bright and cheerful. The new furnace has given good service, and it is much easier now to keep the school clean.\n\nA school van is operated, but does not by any means serve all the pupils. It is however a great help and I believe one reason for the excellent attendance.\n\nThis school is one of the best operated Indian Day Schools I visit, and undoubtedly good progress is being made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Welfare,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor the past twelve years I have been teaching in the Assiniboine Indian Day School. Last July I helped with the Indian exhibit at the Regina Exhibition and during that time had several talks with Inspector Christianson regarding the work of an Indian Day School teacher. We discussed the value and the possibility of holding a conference of Indian Day School teachers and Mr. Christianson suggested that I write to all the teachers in the province to get their opinion of such a conference and any\nsuggestions they might have to offer us to a time and place of meeting.\n\nSome time ago I wrote to the twenty-two teachers and have had replies from seventeen of them. All expressed themselves as being very much in favor of a convention although several of them felt that the great distances and poor means of transportation would make it very difficult for them to attend. Some of them pledged themselves to be present if a conference could be arranged. Several mentioned matters they wished to have discussed\u2014i.e., a course of studies especially for Indian Day Schools and superannuation for teachers.\n\nAn attempt has been made by a few of our teachers to have all Indian Day School teachers of this province included in the Back Teachers' Superannuation scheme from which we are at present excluded because we are employed by the Federal Government. Some progress has been made along this line and it is felt by some\nThat if we had an organization through which to work we might succeed in our aim.\n\nA few of the teachers said that they are in the habit of attending the local convention of white school teachers but have found that these conventions do not prove so very helpful to teachers of Indian schools.\n\nEarlier this month I was in Regina and spent some time with Mr. Christianson. He read the replies I had received to my letter and then suggested that I write to you telling you what has been done and asking for your advice on the matter.\n\nThe teachers are all agreed that a convention would be of great help in our work and I would like to see some action along this line.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Miss) Florence M. Hodgson\nOttawa, March 29, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Hodgson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 24th instant, in which you discuss the desirability of organizing a convention of teachers employed at Indian day schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYou may be interested to learn that a comparatively small group of Indian day school teachers employed at our schools in western Ontario have held a convention annually during the last three or four years. The attendance at such conventions is, however, as you can readily suppose, very small, and it is exceedingly difficult to create at these conventions the enthusiasm usually in evidence at the larger conventions of public school teachers. If the conventions you have in mind were called during the holiday period, the Department could have no valid objection. I am personally of the opinion, however, that the costs involved would prove in many cases almost prohibitive.\n\nI am particularly anxious, however, that no misunderstanding should exist in respect to certain matters that might come up for discussion at such a conference, if it were held. The question of establishing a superannuation fund for teachers employed at Indian day and residential schools has come up for discussion and review on at least a dozen occasions since I entered the Department 5 years ago. I have taken a personal interest in this matter, in the hope that ways and means would be found of enabling our teachers to qualify for superannuation allowances. I am convinced that, for the time being at least, the obstacles standing in the way of a superannuation act are insurmountable. This matter has been discussed with groups of teachers, with representatives of the churches and with representatives of teachers' organizations throughout the Division, and no group at this date has submitted a plan that would be likely to prove practicable and acceptable to the churches on the one hand and the government on the other. In this connection I am sending forward, for your personal information, copy of a letter dated April 3, 1939, directed to the Minister of Education in Saskatchewan by the Minister of Mines and Resources. If it were difficult to establish such a fund in normal times, it is not likely that greater consideration will be given to the creation of such a fund at a time when this nation is fighting for its existence.\n\nIn respect to the curriculum now in use at Indian schools in the various provinces, I may state that\n\nMiss Florence M. Hodgson,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nthe Inspector of Indian Schools in the province of British Columbia, who is an employee of this Department, has over a period of 4 or 5 years completely reorganized the courses of study at his schools. I am sending forward also, for your information, a number of excerpts taken from his most recent reports to the Department. I am convinced that the courses of study now in force at our schools in British Columbia will compare favourably with courses of study anywhere in the Dominion.\n\nWe have now on our staff here a man who has had 28 years' experience in public school work. This man has also had years of experience in vocational instruction. He is engaged at present in a study of the curriculum in use at present day schools in the other provinces of the Dominion. He is making a complete study, also, of the textbooks in use at our schools, including supplementary readers. He has already prepared a text book dealing with the conservation of wild life, for use in our own schools. This book is now in the hands of the publishers. It is our hope that the funds at our disposal will enable this official to visit a number of our schools in the immediate future. We shall be glad to welcome suggestions from our teachers at any time. No doubt, many of these suggestions will prove valuable in working out new courses of study.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Regina, Mr. Christianson. It is just possible that you may desire to discuss this matter with him again before reaching a decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nMay 15th, 1941.\n\nMAY 19 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to report on an inspection made on the Assiniboine Day School.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 37 children present and I was informed that there were 5 more children to come in after the holidays. The average attendance throughout the Winter was around 30 and owing to a lot of sickness such as measles, and 'Flu the average attendance was cut down. However, when you consider the distances some of these children have to travel I consider that this attendance is very good.\n\nThe building itself is in good state of repair and all of the equipment is well looked after. The children all looked very well and my impression was that here is a Day School that is doing splendid work on the Reserve. Miss F. Hodgson, I believe, is an excellent teacher and puts her whole heart into the work, therefore obtaining excellent results. I also believe that both the Agent and Farming Instructor give her every assistance in seeing that the children of this Reserve attend regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant in which you state that owing to illness Miss Florence Hodgson will not resume duties at the Assiniboine Indian Day School until after the Easter holidays.\n\nIf Miss Hodgson does not re-open the school on April 13 you should advise me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Booth,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss F. Hodgson, teacher of the Assiniboine Indian Day School, has just called at my office with respect to the condition of her health.\n\nMiss Hodgson has undergone an appendix operation and consequently the school was closed for 11 days prior to the Easter holidays. She now informs me that her Doctor has given orders that she will have to convalesce for a couple of weeks more and therefore it will be necessary to close the school for another 9 days following the Easter holidays. In other words the school will be closed for 20 teaching days. I do not know whether teachers are allowed sick leave or not and I would like to be advised in the matter.\n\nI might point out here that Miss Hodgson has been teaching in the Indian Department for 14 years and she states that she has lost only 2 days over that period of time as a result of ill health. She is doing very good work in the school and I feel that she should be given leave until she is ready to go back to teaching, which will be about April 24th next. However, if leave is not allowed to teachers Miss Hodgson is willing to make up this loss of time for the sake of herself and chiefly for the sake of her pupils, by starting school about the middle of September.\n\nMay I be advised on this matter by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christierson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nApril 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the teacher of the Assiniboine Indian Day School. We will allow Miss Hodgson leave with pay for the period during which she has been absent from the school owing to illness. I note from your letter that she will resume duties on April 24.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nScarborough & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Paul Moonface & Stephen Moonface, Assiniboine Reserve, Sintaluta, Sask.\n\nOur client, Paul Moonface, Sr. of the Assiniboine Reserve, Sintaluta, Saskatchewan, has asked us to take up with your department the question of having his son, Stephen, excused from further attendance at school.\n\nThe boy in question, who is 14 years of age has been attending day school, but, unfortunately, did not get along very well with his teacher and quit some time before the end of last term. His Father tells us, however, that he is well advanced so far as school work is concerned, but now wishes to help his father on the farm. Mr. Moonface has had a number of other children, but this boy is the only one he has left to give him any assistance. The father is farming 150 acres of the reserve and has 9 head of cattle and 8 horses to look after as well.\n\nFor some time Mr. Moonface has been greatly handicapped in his work on account of having been afflicted with rheumatism during the last ten years.\n\nStephen is large for his age and well suited to assist his father with the farm work and, added to that he is most anxious to begin farming. In these times when help is so scarce we feel that it would probably be a good thing to permit the boy to leave school and we would ask that the necessary permission be given.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for an early reply,\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 2)\nSeptember 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Department from L. McK. Robinson, K.C., Indian Head, Saskatchewan. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThe officials here are not at all sure that the Department has power to grant this request. Sub-section 10 of the Indian Act reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Every Indian child between the full ages of 7 and 16 years, who is physically able, shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General.\"\n\nIn a period as critical, however, as the one in which we find ourselves it might be possible to reach an agreement whereby this Indian would send his son to school during the winter months, at least. This is a matter which, in our judgment, might well be discussed between the Indian Agent and the parties concerned. You might let the Department know, in due course, what decision has been reached and you might also communicate with Mr. Robinson in respect to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary,\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Regina.\nThis letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. It\nis my hope that this matter will be settled to your\nsatisfaction and that you will hear from Mr.\nChristianson in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nL. McK.

Hodgson\nTeacher, Assiniboine Indian Day School\n\nDinataluta, Sask.\nNov. 4, 1942.\nRegina, September 20, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa,\nOntario.\n\nAttention of Dr. McGill\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter and\nto the school on the Assiniboine Reserve, I wrote you a personal\nletter on July 30th last asking that the teacher who is there be\ntransferred and I was advised by you that she was to be transferred\nto the Cote Indian Day School. Behold my surprise when I learnt that\nshe is back teaching at Assiniboine. I then wrote to you immediately\nbut I have received no reply. You know how anxious I am to have this\nwoman transferred from the Assiniboine Reserve and for Heaven's sake\nlet's do it before there is more trouble. You have several reports\non Miss Hodgson's capabilities as set forth by the school superin-\ntendent's reports. Have these checked over and see what her standing\nis. We do not get these here now.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nLionel Grey started school in Sept. 1935 when 8 years of age. He attended 980 days - the equivalent of almost 5 school years. When he left school in June 1942 he was in Grade 5 and ready to enter Grade 6.\n\nFloyd Grey started school in June 1936 at the age of 6 years. He attended 959 days - equal to 4 3/4 school years. When he left school in June 1942 he was in Grade 4.\n\nAlan Grey started school in May 1935 at the age of 7 years. He attended 696 days or 3 1/2 school years. When he left school in June 1942 he was in Grade 3.\n\nElsie Grey started school in April 1939 just a few days after her fifth birthday. There is no record of her birth in the office here, and I was given to understand that Elsie was nearly 6 when she started school. In the first year I found her exceedingly slow and she learned very little more than just kindergarten work. In the following year when she was 6 she started the regular school work and when she left in June 1942 she was in Grade 2. Elsie attended 452 days or 2 1/4 school years.\nI may say that as far as their work was concerned I found the two older children, Lionel and Floyd, to be above average. Alan and Elsie were just average.\n\nFor some years I have maintained that the slowness of Indian children\u2014their inability to concentrate for any length of time\u2014is due to the fact that most, if not all of them suffer from malnutrition. I feel sure the reason the Grey children have done so well in the town school has been in part due to the fact that since their father joined the army their children have been better nourished than ever before.\n\nI might also add that during the time I have been in charge of this school we have had regular visits from Provincial School Inspectors and their report on the progress of the children has been, on the whole, satisfactory. One Inspector who visited us for several years sometimes gave the children tests that had been especially prepared for use in white schools. This Inspector expressed himself as pleased with the results obtained by the Indian children. Knowing Mrs. Grey as I do, I am quite sure that any school Inspector would be a much better judge of what was being done in a school.\n\nFlorence M. Hodgson\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nFurther to my letter No. 311-43M of the 20th instant in connection with a letter written to our Branch by Mrs. Birrel Grey, of Sintaluta, wherein she states that her children did wonders at the white school in Sintaluta whereas they learned nothing at the Indian school on the reserve.\n\nI am herewith attaching copy of the school records furnished by Miss Florence M. Hodgson and our Branch also has the annual reports submitted by the Provincial School Superintendent on this school.\n\nM.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI have been asked, last Sunday, to transmit to you the enclosed petition of the Assiniboine Indians; they wish it to be forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nI may remark on this petition that the Indians want a residential school, by which I was given to understand that they want a semi-residential school (five days a week); I can tell you that I believe Mr. Dan Kennedy is the one who gave them the idea; I told them the only thing they could hope for, and were entitled to, was a modern improved day-school, and perhaps some transportation facilities for the children who live beyond three miles of the school.\n\nThe number of children indicated, both of school age, and under school age, is exact, according to my census; most every Catholic signed the petition; I believe their demands are just, and I am ready to recommend the erection of a day-school, suitable for at least 40 pupils, with facilities for lunches and transportation. There is a likely site, halfway between the Agency and the Kennedys, at which all children would be within three miles of the proposed school.\n\nI wonder if you could send word to Marcel Spencer, who originated the petition, that I have forwarded and recommended the petition, so he will be able to tell the others. I think Marcel Spencer did a good job of uniting the Indians and the members who signed the petition seem well disposed to cooperate with the Dept. and are all anxious to have a good school on the Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith petition signed by many Indians of the Assiniboine Reserve of the Qu'Appelle Agency, asking for the erection of a Catholic Boarding School on their reserve.\n\nI do not recommend the erection of a boarding school but I do recommend the erection of a day school when funds and materials can be made available.\n\nThe present day school under the auspices of the United Church of Canada is not large enough to serve this reserve. A number of Catholic children are attending the Lebret School and would be available for the day school when one is opened. In addition, of course, there are many children on the reserve not attending school and who will be available for school in a short time.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Reverend Father G. Laviollette, O.M.I., the Catholic Missionary for this reserve. With reference to the third paragraph thereof it will be noted that Father Laviollette states that there is a site on the reserve where a new school could be erected where all of the Catholic children would be within three miles of the proposed school. Consideration might be given to transportation part of the year but there are many white children in the West, and some Indian children, who travel three miles or more to school and attend regularly without any assistance from the Government. This should be kept in mind before any decision is made as to transportation.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 31, 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

However, we are prepared to consider the erection of a day school when funds and materials can be made available.\n\nI am making a note of this request and it will receive further consideration when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Day School for the Assiniboines.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Laviolette, in charge of the above Assiniboines Reserve, has requested the building of a Catholic Day School for the Indian children. There are at the present time forty of school age; five of these attend the Lebret school, twenty-four attend the United Church Day School and ten do not go to school at all.\n\nHe informs me that inspector Ostrander has already recommended the erection of a Catholic Day School, so I hope that you will be able to provide for it in the coming estimates.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe Assiniboine Day School.\n\nI wish to report on the Assiniboine Day School and also to recommend some changes regarding it.\n\nThe Assiniboine school has been in operation for well over 40 years and during that time the Indian parents have given the school good support and there is no doubt that these Indians prefer this type of school in preference to the Boarding school, in fact it has always been somewhat of a task to get the parents to send their children away to school, to substantiate this statement I may say that even now some of the Indian parents are sending their children over six miles to this school in preference to having their children away from home, at present 9 of the pupils travel 6 miles to school and 11 more over 3\u00bd miles.\n\nDuring the month of December we had 30 pupils on the roll, with an average attendance of 32.5%, but this month we have 41 on the roll and the average will be possible be 35%, we also have 5 or 6 more children ready for school but these cannot be admitted as the school room is already overcrowded, I may say that 30 pupils would be sufficient for this school room.\n\nWe have a building at this point that used to be the Agent's office and more recently used as a residence for the school teacher, but the present teacher is boarding with the Farming-Instructor and wife, this building is 28 x 30', built on a full size basement, with furnace installed, this building is divided as per enclosed sketch.\n\nI would recommend that the room on the east be used as a class room and a second teacher be engaged, this teacher could be in charge of the junior grades, that is grades 1 and 2, there being 21 pupils at present in these two grades, if these junior grades were removed from the present school room it would allow us sufficient floor space.\nfor thirty pupils.\n\nIf a second teacher was employed, the teacher could occupy the other two rooms in the building.\n\nThe cost of alterations to the room so as to be able to use it for school purposes would be approximately $200.00; this would cover the cost of having three more windows built in the east wall, blackboards installed and the finished room two coats of paint. 15 more schools desks would be required for children ranging from six to eight years old.\n\nThe following items would also have to be inserted in the yearly estimates:\n8 tons coal @ $0.200 per ton $64.00\n10 loads wood @ $3.00 \" load $30.00\nHauling coal @ $1.50 \" ton $15.00\nSawing wood @ $1.25 \" load $12.50\n\nIf the Department decide to operate a two room day school it would be an advantage to operate a school van; a school van route could be planned so as to pick up all pupils who live more than two miles from the school; the use of a van would of course practically make the attendance 100% and would improve the punctuality.\n\nWe used to operate a school van at this point but no doubt to curtail expenses it was done away with; one of the Indians drove the van at a monthly salary of $45.00.\n\nWe have one or two Indians on this reserve who have fairly good trucks and no doubt one of them could be engaged for this purpose.\n\nFrank Booth,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, January 30th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter received from Indian Agent Mr. Frank Booth, in connection with the Assiniboine Day School.\n\nThere are a number of R.C. children of school age on the Assiniboine Reserve and they and their Church are anxious to have an R.C. Day School started on that reserve at a point some distance from the present United Church Day School and which will serve for the R.C. children.\n\nI believe it would be advisable for me to discuss this matter with the officials of the Branch when I am in Ottawa shortly. I am taking a note of this and intend to give it attention at that time.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWill you please send me some application forms for Indian day school teacher, for the Assiniboine Reserve, at Sintaluta (Qu'Appelle Agency, Sask.)\n\nI am wondering whether I should advertise for a teacher just now, as it seems that there is some delay in doing the work necessary to convert the office at the Assiniboine Reserve into a class-room; Mr. Booth, Indian agent, told me to wait until the work began, before advertising for a teacher. If the school room is to open in the first week in Sept. I feel that the work there should begin immediately, as there is quite a large job to do; it will be difficult finding a teacher for Sept. 47 if there is too much delay.\n\nWould you please let me know if there is a set date for the opening and closing of residential schools. For instance, Elkhorn school closed in the middle of June, thereby creating criticism among the Oak River Indians, as the Lebret and Brandon pupils were taken home only at the end of the month (June 27); the Carlyle (White Bear -- Crooked Lake Agency) day schools closed on June 30th, instead of the 27th, day on which residential school pupils were taken home.\n\nPlease allow me to congratulate you on the splendid and practical bulletin which you are now publishing; it feels a great need, and I wish you were able to print it, and enlarge it, with illustrations, etc...\n\nYours very sincerely, with my personal best wishes of success,\n\nRev. L. Laviolette O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1947.\n\nDear Father Laviolette:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, I enclose application forms for those applying for appointment as Indian day school teachers. If you find it necessary to advertise you should do so. Please be sure when submitting vouchers covering these advertisements that as many tear sheets as insertions are forwarded. Furthermore, we would appreciate it if each publisher would state on its invoice, the size of the advertisement, the title, the dates on which it appeared and the rate (if per inch or per line).\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter, we are giving very careful consideration to the action which certain Indian residential schools are inclined to take in regard to holidays and definite instructions will be issued to all residential schools in the near future.\n\nI appreciate very much your kind reference to our Bulletin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

(Qu'Appelle Agency). I hope the references and teaching experience of Mr. Monaghan will prove satisfactory. (There are no advertising costs in connection with this.)\n\nMr. Booth advises me that no word has been received from your office authorizing the alterations to be made at the Sintaluta reserve agency buildings, in order to open the classroom. I am wondering how to arrange for the teacher to wait until the room is ready. It would be unfair to him to tell to wait, as he has other offers in B.C. and has waived them in favor of the Sintaluta school, which is only 60 miles from Regina, where Mr. Monaghan lives, provided school opens on Sept. 2 or thereabouts. I can retain the services of Mr. Monaghan even if he does actually teach right on Sept. 2d, provided the Dept. is willing to pay him his salary beginning in September.\n\nA delegation of Indians brought me a night letter to you, which has been sent this morning; no doubt you have received it. As the present classroom holds 40 pupils at the most, and the list of pupils is over 60, the Indians are anxious to have the room open on time. I am willing to cooperation to the utmost in order to help improve the educational facilities at Sintaluta.\n\nWith my personal wishes and regards,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nFr. G.

The difficulty came up when no suitable boarding arrangements could be arrived at. Mrs. Monaghan did not wish to reside at the Assiniboine Reserve teacherage, nor to board Miss Nelson, the other teacher. The present farm instructor, Mr. Fox did not want to board Mr. Monaghan; Mr. Booth and Mr. Ostrander both advised me to release Mr. Monaghan, and to look for a lady teacher, who would occupy the teacherage with Miss Nelson.

I have just been advised that two Catholic teachers, whom I had intended to send to a school in the Northwest Territories, cannot be sent there for various reasons.\n\nThese two teachers are a young brother and sister named Allard. They both have teaching permits and both have two years' teaching experience. Their address is\n\nMr. Terry Allard, and Miss Leona Allard,\nSt. Francois Xavier, Manitoba.\n\nThe sister is a cripple from infantile paralysis and has to use crutches. Therefore they have specifically requested that they be as closely situated together as possible. I have written to Father Lavige also about the case, in the event that he can use them in Manitoba. We are unable to place them in B.C., where we have a serious shortage of Catholic teachers, due to the fact that the vacant schools are very far apart.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you in the near future concerning these two teachers, as naturally we are anxious to have them placed if at all possible. I am sending a copy of this letter to Father Piche, in the event that you may no longer be living at the Lebret School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Father G.

It is presumed that this application is for the 1948/49 academic year, when our new salary schedule will be in effect. Providing that Miss Vannest continues to work on her Grade 12 subjects, she is entitled to classification as a Grade 2 Indian day school teacher. Therefore, with four years' experience, she would be entitled to a starting salary of $165.00 a teaching month on our new schedule.\n\nPlease find attached, for return to Miss Vannest, the Provincial Inspector's reports which were forwarded with her application.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-5, part 4)\nSintaluta, Sask.,\nOctober 17th, 1933\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. IO2-I-4 dated July 25th, 1933 regarding mid-day meal for the children attending the Assiniboine Day School; I may say that I consider it almost impossible to have a day school approach to anything like success without some kind of a mid-day meal as some of the pupils walk four miles to school and to expect the pupils to be bright and pay attention to their studies after their mid-day of one biscuit is out of the question whereas if a bowl of soup be given it would no doubt be a lot more nourishing and palatable.\n\nAs you no doubt are aware that a considerable proportion of the pupils are always somewhat under-nourished, and if the mid-day meal in winter is abolished it might mean some of the children becoming on the sick list and the cost of providing for one sick child would more than offset the whole cost of the few supplies necessary.\n\nFor $50.00 I could purchase sufficient ingredients to provide a bowl of soup for every pupil attending school all the winter months. As I anticipate an average attendance of 20 for the next 120 school days it would only cost 1\u00bd cents per meal for each pupil. I certainly would be pleased to have authority to purchase supplies for the amount of $50.00.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Doctor Ismane.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Booth\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the midday meal for the children attending the Assiniboine Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure, not exceeding approximately $30.00, in the purchase of the necessary ingredients to provide a bowl of soup for the pupils attending this school during the winter months. You should arrange for the purchase of the supplies required from time to time, obtaining itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is considered that the preparing and serving of the soup should be for the winter months only. It might be advisable to consult the teacher concerning the supplies necessary for this purpose. The serving of the soup to the pupils at midday should be commenced as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Booth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\n| Articles          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Value |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 100 lbs. corn    | 2        | $2.50      | $5.00       |\n| 50 lbs. beans    | 1        | $1.00      | $1.00       |\n| 50 lbs. peas     | 1        | $3.00      | $3.00       |\n| 12 lbs. carrots   | 1        | $0.50      | $0.50       |\n| 12 lbs. tomatoes  | 1        | $0.80      | $0.80       |\n| 6 lbs. onions    | 1        | $1.00      | $1.00       |\n\n**Total Value:** $18.59\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDept. of\n\nDate: Mar. 1, 1933\n\nCity or town:\n\nProvince: \n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                        | FOLIO | DEBIT AMOUNT | CREDIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|--------|---------------------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| Oct. 27| To 1 bag onions                 |       | 2 25         |               |         |\n|        | 50 lbs. rice @ 7\u00a2               |       | 3 50         |               |         |\n|        | 50 lbs. beans @ 3.8\u00a2            |       | 1 90         |               |         |\n|        | 50 lbs. barley @ 6\u00a2             |       | 3 00         |               |         |\n|        | 12 bars washing soap            |       | 50           |               |         |\n|        | 12 bars lux soap                |       | 84           |               |         |\n|        | 6 lbs. wool @ $1.10            |       | 6 60         |               |         |\n|        |                                 |       |              |               | 18 59   |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nMaterial Specified,\n\nVote...........188\n\nSchool Number...601\n\nAllot...........782\n\nE.R.

It has been noticed in the past that this meal has done considerable in maintaining the health of the children.

The children are clean and neat in appearance. The school building is badly in need of paint, both inside and out. The window sashes are very loose and should be repaired. The building could be painted and put into first class shape at a cost of not more than $100.00.\n\nSCHOOL GARDEN\n\nEach child has a plot of his own, in addition there is a potato patch.

Their children have been attending the Montmartre Convent School.\n\nThey will have three more of school age for the coming term and Mr. Kennedy will have one - making a total of seven children from this corner.\n\nThe parents will have no other alternatives but to send them to the Day School on our Reserve. They are not in favor of sending their children to Residential Schools, but their homes are from five to six miles from the Day School.\n\nWill you kindly take the matter up with the Indian Department and ask if they could arrange for a van to haul them to and from School.\n\nIf these children were attending a Residential School, it would cost the Indian Department about $1000 per annum and the services of a van would only cost about a quarter of this amount.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6280, file 601-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach a letter received from Dan Kennedy, the most progressive member of the Assiniboine Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency.\n\nOn enquiry, I find that conditions on this Reserve with regard to the Day School are that the new front and back supplied this year will make it possible for the School to seat 31 pupils. Twenty-five children who attended last year will attend this year; in addition there are nine beginners and fourteen others all within reasonable walking distance of the School, who wish to attend this year, making a total of forty-eight children for thirty-one seats.\n\nMr. Booth some time ago asked for some additional desks, but was advised no funds were available. Consequently, with the exception of the thirty-one, the remainder will have to go to Boarding School. With nine new desks, the School could seat forty, which would be the limit of seating accommodation. If these nine desks could be supplied, a considerable saving would be effected.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, when we have more children within walking distance of the School than we can accommodate, I cannot see that any consideration can be given to Mr. Kennedy's request.\n\nSchool conditions on this Reserve will be covered in a separate letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

The school could accommodate 40 if additional seats were provided.\n\nThere are 80 children of school age on the Reserve, and Mr. Booth, Agent, informs me that this number will be increased. The children are about 50% R.G. and 50% Protestant. Mr. Booth informs me that practically all the parents on this Reserve object to sending their children to a residential school. They want to send them to day schools. I have been personally approached by a member of the Band asking that his children be discharged from the residential school and allowed to attend the day school.\n\nIt is my opinion that serious consideration should be given to the construction of another school on this Reserve, and that this school should contain two rooms for teaching with a full basement equipped for cooking, manual training, etc. This school should also, in my opinion, be erected on the centre of the Reserve about one and one-half miles from the location of the present school.\n\nAs stated before, the present school is in very good condition and the present conditions could be overcome by building a one-room school and continuing to use the present one, but in that event I believe it would be advisable to have the present school moved to a central......\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/756\nmoved to a central location, as this would allow the employment of one R.C., and one Protestant teacher and avoid any religious dispute that might result otherwise, although Mr. Booth informs me that for years both R.C.'s and Protestants have been attending the same school on this Reserve without any friction.\n\nThe establishment of this school would meet the wishes of the people and at the same time relieve the congestion in our residential schools.\n\nSubmitted for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

I am today in receipt of a letter from\nMr. Gardner, Teacher, Kinistino Day School, who states there should be,\nwithin the next year or two, 26 children of school age on that Reserve.\nThere are 36 desks, two of which he is shipping to Dundurn on Mr.\nSimpson's orders. This leaves 6 desks, 3 small and 3 medium, which\nhe will ship me if desired.\n\nThese 6 desks would permit the attendance of 5 more pupils\nat the Assiniboine Day School and avoid the necessity of sending them\nto Residential schools.

You quote as your authority official letter of December 1, 1939.\n\nInstructions were issued to all Indian Agents some time ago to the effect that new authority for expenditures such as the above should be secured in each fiscal year.\n\nAt the time the authority was originally granted for supplying a midday meal at this school certain conditions were in existence that apparently made such action advisable. However, it is possible that these conditions have changed and there may be no great necessity for supplying a midday meal at this school every month throughout the academic year. As a matter of fact the funds at our disposal are so limited that they do not permit our supplying midday meals except during the winter months.\n\nI presume that you have already arranged for midday meal supplies for the month of May but no such expenditure should be made for the month of June. Before this school re-opens on October 1 you should write to me giving your reasons for desiring a midday meal served at this school and also stating at that time the number of months during which it should be served.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.
