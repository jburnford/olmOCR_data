There are several mill sites in this township on the Pipe stone, which intersects south-west corner. Numerous good hay meadows and ponds. The district, too, is well opened up by one of the oldest trails in the country\u2014that from Brandon to Moose Mountain and other points in the far west. For stock farming it would be difficult to find a more desirable locality than this township.\n\nTownship 12.\u2014The line of the Canadian Pacific Railway crosses in a north-westerly direction, and a creek flowing south-easterly drains a large portion of the township. The surface is gently rolling prairie, with a soil of dark loam, clay and gravel subsoil. An abundance of good water and hay makes it desirable for mixed farming.\n\nTownship 13.\u2014Is rolling prairie, traversed in various directions by a number of ravines, into which ponds may be drained. The soil, as a rule, is a dark loam from six inches to two feet deep, with a clay subsoil, in some places mixed with gravel.

The Canadian-Pacific Railway crosses in a north-westerly direction, with Moosomin, one of the most important stations on the line, located in section 33. Here also the Moose and Wood Mountain trail from Fort Ellice is intersected by the Brandon and Qu'Appelle trail, making Moosomin an important distributing point for a large tract of country. The surface is dotted with islands of poplar and clumps of willow. Good water and hay are abundant. Surface is chiefly rolling, with a soil of rich dark loam, and clay subsoil, mixed with a small percentage of limestone gravel. The very perfection of soil for cereals.\n\nRANGE 1, WEST OF 2ND P. M.\n\nTownship 14.\u2014Is rolling prairie, traversed by natural drains, which can be utilized in reducing the area of wet land. The soil is black sandy loam, mixed with gravel, and the subsoil is clay, in which there is a small percentage of gravel. The grass is plentiful and of fair quality, as also is the water; and sections having an excess of ponds and low land can be drained at a small cost. Many of the sections are well timbered, and will afford an ample supply of firewood and fence rails for settlers. The township is well suited for general farming purposes.\n\nRANGE 2.\n\nTownship 14.\u2014Surface is rolling prairie, breaking into hills on the south-west. General slope is towards the Pipe Stone River, which runs through sections 19, 17, 16, 9, 10, 11 and 12. The soil is a dark sandy loam, with clay subsoil, in which there is found a small percentage of gravel. There is a good growth of grass on the uplands, and sufficient hay in the meadows, and around the margins of the marshes to supply every requirement of settlers. Water is to be found in the ponds and marshes, while that of the Pipe Stone River is pure ever running water. Timber, both for firewood and fencing, abounds in the township. The majority of the sections are well adapted for general farming; remainder reported as more suitable for stock raising.\n\nTownship 15.\u2014Is rolling prairie, with occasional patches of poplar suitable for fencing or fuel. In other respects same as preceding.\n\nRANGE 3.\n\nTownship 15.\u2014The surface is rolling, with occasional patches of small poplar and numerous marshes and meadows. There are several natural drains running through the township, which will be available for reclaim-\ning wet lands. The soil is a black sandy loam, with subsoil of clay and gravel. Water is plentiful and good, and the grass on the uplands is of fair growth, while the meadows will give a large yield of hay. This township, until drained, will be best adapted for mixed farming. It lies within easy reach of Percival and Whitewood, both stations on the line of the C. P. R.\n\nTownship 16.\u2014The line of the C. P. R. crosses the township in a north-westerly direction. Percival Station is located on section 19. In other respects the township is the same as the preceding.\n\nRANGE 4.\n\nTownship 15.\u2014Surface is gently rolling prairie. The soil is a clay loam, mixed in some cases with sand and clay with sandy clay subsoil. Water is plentiful and good, especially in Pipe Stone Creek, which flows through the south half of the township. There is a fair growth of prairie grass on the uplands, and the meadows will cut about two-tons of hay to the acre. The township is fairly well suited for general farming purposes, though some sections, by reason of low wet land, are better adapted for grazing purposes.\n\nRANGE 5.\n\nTownship 16.\u2014The line of the C. P. R. crosses the north part of the township, with Broadview, a rapidly-growing town and terminus of a railroad division, located on section 25. Weed Creek, taking its rise in a lake of the same name, winds its tortuous course through a valley about five chains in width and thirty or forty feet below the prairie level, on its way to join its waters with the Qu'Appelle, a little east of Crooked Lake.\n\nWeed Lake, charming and picturesque, is located chiefly in the southeast corner of the township. At certain points the banks are bold and precipitous, with a rugged rock-bound shore; at others, a gentle upward slope from the gravelly beach backward to the sky line, a distance of forty chains, with an occasional oak and poplar grove to lend variety to the scene and enhance the beauty of a most delightful spot. Some of the sections bordering on the east side of the lake are very beautiful, section 1 being reported by the examiner as the choicest.\n\nThe township is chiefly open prairie, with a soil of sandy loam, and well adapted for settlement.\n\nRANGE 6.\n\nTownship 16.\u2014The C. P. R. cuts off the north-east corner of the township. Oakshela Station is located on section 33. The Pipe Stone River\ntouches the south-west corner. The southerly part of the township is broken by the Weed Hills, which are well wooded and furnish an ample supply of fencing, fuel, etc., for settlers. The north half is chiefly open prairie. The soil of the entire township is a sandy clay loam suitable for farming.\n\nRANGE 7.\n\nTownship 17.\u2014Grenfell, a station on the line of the C. P. R., is situated in the south-west corner of the township. The surface is rolling, and water and grass good and plentiful. The soil is a dark sandy loam with gravelly clay subsoil. The township is well adapted for farming purposes.\n\nRANGE 8, WEST OF 2ND P. M.\n\nTownship 16.\u2014Is partially in the Weed Hills. The south half is well wooded with poplar, suitable for fencing, fuel, etc. A lake of good clear water is situated in the southern part of the township. The Qu'Appelle trail crosses the north half, which is almost entirely open rolling prairie, with an excellent soil of sandy clay loam, every section of which may be cultivated. The south half can only be recommended for grazing purposes.\n\nRANGE 9.\n\nTownship 16.\u2014Wolf Hills, so-called, lie almost wholly within the township, in point of fact however, the surface, instead of being hilly, is simply high rolling prairie, beautifully drained by a number of coulees which intersect it. The soil is generally a dark sandy loam with a gravelly clay subsoil. Ninety per cent. is all that can be desired for farming purposes.\n\nTownship 17.\u2014The C. P. R. crosses the south half. Wolf Creek cuts off the north-west corner. In other respects the township is identical with preceding.\n\nTownship 18.\u2014Is traversed by the magnificent Qu'Appelle Valley with its wondrously rich bottom lands of alluvial deposit.
