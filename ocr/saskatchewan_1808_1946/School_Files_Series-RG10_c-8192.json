The children are bright and very intelligent, and it would be conferred a great favor on them if they could be sent to school. If a school was built on the shore near Batchewana Dock it would be accessible on all sides.\n\nI would recommend that a school be given these people. Kindly let me know what you think of the proposition.\n\nAnd much obliged,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Indians at Batchewana submitted a petition signed by the majority of the Indians residing there asking that a school house be erected there and a teacher supplied as there are over forty Indian children at that place which is twenty-five miles from Goulais Bay where there is a school. I would strongly recommend that their petition be granted. I saw many of the children and they are bright and intelligent, and I felt sorry to think that they had no school. As there are a couple of white families at Batchewana, I have no doubt a teacher would get board and lodging with one of them. (Mr. Miller is the name of one of the white men and Jewell the name of the other.) (Goulais Bay)\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. W. Shore,\nOttawa, 30th July, 1912.\nOttawa, August 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo enclosing a petition from the Indians of Batchewana for the establishment of a school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the number of children of school age, the Department is disposed to look favourably upon this request and I have to ask you to make inquiries and advise whether there is any building available which could be used for school purposes. As you are aware this is not a reserve and it is not the policy of the Department to erect buildings outside reserves, but an exception might be made in this case owing to the fact that these Indians have been so long located there, provided a proper title could be secured to the property. Mr. Shore informs the Department that there is a place where a teacher could find lodging accommodation and, if there is any building available, the Department is prepared to pay a rental for it, provide the salary of a teacher and assume the other expenses incidental to the management of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBaillie Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th inst. No. 408014, in reference to school at Batchewana I beg to say that I can secure a house at $3.00 per month on a year or two year lease in a central locality. It belongs to a widow woman and will want some repair before occupying it for a school room. I expect about $50.00 would put it in good shape.\n\nIf you conclude to leave this building and repair it up kindly let me know at once and I will go to Batchewana and have everything attended to at once awaiting your further instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

It is expected, however, that the money that will have to be expended on repairs will go towards paying the first year's rent, if at all possible. In any event the rent should be somewhat reduced to pay for these remains, which, you state, will cost about $30.00.\n\nA lease should be drawn up and signed by the owner. I have to ask you to be good enough to state before having these repairs made whether you know of anyone who would be willing to undertake the work at this school. In the meantime the Department is communicating with a young lady in Sudbury and will let you know as soon as it hears from her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D.

It is the best thing I could do in the matter.\n\nI will have to do some little changes but the Indians will do the work. I will have to build a water closet and furnish a heating stove.

You should obtain an agreement to this effect signed by the missionary in charge and approved by the Bishop, which is all that will be necessary. You may then make the small changes that will be necessary to fit the building for school purposes, the work to be done by the Indians. You should have two water closets erected.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nWould you please tell me by return of mail if you did buy Mr. Chris Thompson house and if you are going to fix it up for a school house and teacher's residence. Indian Agent Dye Hatt promised he was going to have it ready for me. The Indians are all living down near the dock about 2\u00bd miles from here where the Church is, and when I arrived here I had no place to stay only for Mrs. Willard kindness I would have been stuck for a place to sleep. For the present time I am using Father Parcher's House near the Church and am all alone up here my nearest neighbors are about 1\u00bd miles away & can't get settled and don't know where to get the wood piled, as we must have wood this year, Mr. Mr. Hatt did.\nnot come to his office in the Soo while I was there I waited all day for him at his office door and he does not write to me to explain matters so I thought the quickest way was to write to you. That building is much warmer than the one we are teaching in now but it will need whitewashing, new windows, one inside door and I was thinking a partition & wallboard for my bed Room would be cheaper than getting lumber and would be quicker put up and would be finished and look nicer and the ceiling can be of wallboard also. I am only suggesting this; you don't need to have wallboard if you don't want it but it will come cheaper and be a better job. If you answer soon I can let you know what you need and how high the room is also the length so you will know how many pieces of wall board to send or lumber. There are 3 families living near the church just now they are living near the Dock so I am all alone.\nHere, I hope they soon come up. There are just 2 children from the 3 families will attend school. The rest are living down near the building I hear you bought. I hope I soon know what you are doing so I can get settled for the winter just now. I have to be brave and it is hard. Shall I give you a hint as to what I will do if you get the place fixed? I close hoping you will soon write to me.\n\nYours Faithfully,\nIsabelle Peltier\n\nIsabelle Peltier\nBatchewana Bay\nOnt.\n& Dominion Transportation Co. Ltd.\nSault Ste.

The owner Chris Thompson died a couple of months ago and his executor offered me the house for $50.00; there is no land going with the House but we could let it remain where it is and use it, it is right in the centre of the Village.\n\nWhat we paid last winter for hauling the children to school would fix up the house, all we require is a couple of thousand feet of Lumber and some 2 or 3 barrels of Lime.\n\nIt is a Log House and at any time we could move it to the land owned by the Dept., for School.\n\nI met the Inspector today at the Catholic School at Garden River and he urged me to try and buy, as it is so handy for the Pupils, Awaiting your early instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nA.

In reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of this house for the amount mentioned, viz $50, and will pay this sum upon receipt of properly certified vouchers from you covering the cost.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of 2000' of lumber and 3 barrels of lime. You may also arrange to have the necessary alterations made to the building to provide classroom accommodation and living quarters for the teacher. You should consult the teacher as to the alterations that will be required to provide living quarters for her. It may be necessary to erect certain partitions to provide a bedroom. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred in fitting up the building.

L. Porcheron, of Sault Ste.

We purchased a house in October, last, and it has been fitted up and is now in use for school purposes, and the use of the church has been discontinued. It is considered that there is no further amount due for the rental of the church building.\n\nRussell T.

The key was left with Frank Lapointe, fisherman, so that he could, after or during rain storm, empty a pail that was placed under the pipes in the chimney, as the flashing in the roof was so poorly fixed around the chimney that rain usually poured in. This needs fixing.\n\n3. Classroom is too dark. A window 4 x 3 in the gable end will help. Windows are very small.\n\n4. There is no woodshed. Wood is kept in classroom around walls. A lean-to is all that is needed.\n\n5. The only light into the kitchen is from the top half of the door but this is boarded up as window was broken. It needs fixing. 2\u00bd x 2\u00bd.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nOttawa, September 15th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Batchewana Indian Day School, states that the flashing on the roof around the chimney is so poorly fixed that the rain comes through into the building. He recommends that the roof around the chimney be repaired with asbestos or other suitable material. He also states that the classroom is too dark and recommends that a window 4'x3' be placed in the gable end of the building. He further states that there is no woodshed at this school and that the wood is kept in the classroom around the walls, and that the only light in the kitchen is from the top half of the door, which is boarded up as the glass is broken.\n\nI have to request that you will make immediate arrangements to have the roof of the building around the chimney repaired and placed in good condition. You should also arrange to have a window placed in the gable end of the classroom and the door into the kitchen repaired. Regarding the providing of a woodshed, it is considered that a lean-to to the building is all that is required. You may arrange to have an inexpensive lean-to put up to provide storage facilities for the wood. You should engage the services of a competent man to carry out these repairs and put up the woodshed. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred. You should purchase any materials required.\n\nThe Department expects you to have the above work completed at an early date, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of any material supplied and for the labour engaged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I will get the window all glazed and sent there if at all possible. I have had no complaint from the former Teacher in regard to this building and at my visit there in July I could not get in to the building as Miss Peltier must have had the key with her at least I could not find it.\n\nI will at once send up a notice for Tenders for the wood for the School for the coming winter.\n\nI will do my utmost to get this work done outside of the Woodshed and will await your further instructions as to sending up the Lumber required for it.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.

If you can arrange to have the lumber delivered at Batchewana, it would be advisable to have the woodshed completed this fall, in order to have storage facilities for the fuel supply. It is not intended that an expensive woodshed be put up, but a small lean-to of sufficient size to store the winter's supply of wood. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible for having the work done, or, if you consider it undesirable to forward the material this fall, the erection of the woodshed will have to stand over until next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It should be built in the centre of the building to serve both stoves. The inspector states that this building caught fire last fall on account of the defective chimney.\n\n(2) About fifteen lengths of stove pipe should be supplied as soon as the new chimney is completed.\n\n(3) All floors require two coats of ground colour and one coat of oak stain.

You should purchase any material required and have it forwarded to Matchewan and you should arrange for the labour in doing the work.

In addition to the repairs mentioned in your letter we require a woodshed to hold at least 16 cords of wood as our wood is piled outside and we have no protection from theft or fire.\n\nIf this was added I might get a man to go and take a contract of the whole repairs, as it is just now I cannot get any person here to go up as transportation is such that a person has to engage a Launch to get out of Batchewana. The Dominion Transportation Co's Boats calls in on their way up to Michipicoton Island but does not call on their way down which makes it very awkward and expensive as you cannot get a Launch fit to go there less than $25.00.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We note the difficulty in arranging to have this work done.\n\nBesides the work which you were authorized to have carried out in official letter of June 1st, last, you may also arrange for the building of an inexpensive woodshed of sufficient size to store 16 cords of wood. You should endeavour to arrange with a contractor to provide the materials and perform the labour in making the repairs to the school building and the building of the woodshed. The cost of all this work should be kept down to the lowest possible figure, and the work should be undertaken as soon as possible in order that it can be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can and at the lowest cost. This matter should receive your very earliest attention.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nMr. A.D.

Before you certify the accounts, you should, if possible, visit the school and see that the work is satisfactorily completed. It is hoped that Mr. Smit can arrange to begin this work at an early date and have it rushed to completion before the school reopens after the present holidays.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, showing the cost separately of the building of the chimney, repainting and varnishing of the partitions and floors, repairing the plaster and filling up the holes where the roof sits on the walls and for the erection of the woodshed.

The Department will, however, approve of your making the necessary arrangements while you are at Batchewana to have the work which you consider to be absolutely necessary at this school carried out. You should see that no unnecessary expense is incurred. You should arrange for the purchase of any materials required and for the labour in having the work done. You should also see that the work which you arrange to have done is satisfactorily completed.\n\nAfter the work is finished to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the painting, etc., in your hands to have the work completed at the least possible expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to state that I looked over the school and find it requires whitewashing, floors painted, also a number of broken glass replaced in windows. I engaged Mrs Miller the Storekeeper, who is a very capable woman, to supervise the work and she will hire Indians to do it. I am shipping material required for the job. This will be by far the cheapest way to do the work as it would cost too much to send men from here.\n\nI also engaged Joe Tom Sayer to cut 15 double cords of hard-wood at $8.00 per cord and 2 cords soft-wood for kindling at $8.00 per cord.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Agent\n\nJ.D.

Please forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and for the labour in having the work done.\n\nIt is also noted that you have arranged for the supplying of the firewood required.

He also states that the interior walls and floors require painting.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report on the repairs required to this building, stating the cost of re-shingling the roof and any other repairs required, including material and labour, also the cost of painting the interior walls and floors. This matter should receive your early attention in order that if it is decided to have any work carried out it can be performed during the coming summer holidays. If you recommend that any repairs be carried out, you should state whether the work could be done by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman, you to arrange for the purchase and delivery of all material required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Gordon H. Sims,\nIndian Land Agent,\nDominion Buildings,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen making a sanitary survey of the schools in my district I found that your Indian school at Batchewana was badly in need of a water supply close to the school. The children are compelled to carry water from the shore of Lake Superior some 400 feet away and it would be impossible for them to secure water when the drift ice came in in the early Fall. I would suggest that a driven well be located on the school property a convenient distance from the school. The formation of the soil at this point, I believe, would be ideal for a driven well, and if successful there would be no possible chance of the water becoming contaminated.\n\nI also made an inspection of your Indian School at Garden River and found that the toilet accommodation was not sufficient for the number of pupils.\n\nI found on inspection of the Batchewana and Garden River schools that they were kept exceptionally clean and well looked after by those in charge.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you could see your way clear to have these improvements made in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial Sanitary Inspector.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose letter received from R.B. McCauley, Provincial Sanitary Inspector, recommending a pump for water supply at the Batchewana Indian school, also enlarging of toilets at R.C. School, Garden River.\n\nAs the cost would be approximately $100.00, I suggested to Mr. McCauley that these improvements might have to stand over until next year.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Provincial Sanitary Inspector, Sault Ste. Marie, recommending that a driven well be located on the school property to provide a water supply for the use of the Batchewana Indian Day School, and also that the toilets at the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School be enlarged.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, it will not be possible to arrange to have the above work carried out. You should draw both these matters to the attention of the Department early next spring; when, if funds are available, favourable consideration will be given to providing a well at Batchewana and enlarging the toilets at the Garden River R.C.

You are authorized to purchase the supplies, a list of which appears on your requisition. It is noted that the cost will not exceed $50.00, and it is my hope that Indian labour can be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.,\nSeptember 21st, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 20th I forwarded a requisition for supplies required for the Batchewana Indian Day School.\n\nIn this requisition, I stated that a cook stove was needed, the approximate cost of which would be $30.00. I am unable to say just where I obtained this estimate of $30.00 but upon making inquiries at local stores in the Sault, I find that the cheapest stove that I can buy to fill the bill, will cost $57.00.\n\nAs the Batchewana School is badly in need of a new cook stove, I would like to be given authority to purchase one at the above mentioned cost. I might also add that this stove must be a fair sized one, as it is not only used as a cook stove but to heat the teacher's quarters at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. P. G.

I am not sure that his parents see to it that he behaves properly.

Some years ago two or three Indians approached me in regard to the securing of another teacher. Only two or three Indians appeared from the whole community. They were quite emphatic in saying that they held nothing against Miss Robicheau and would, in fact, be sorry to do anything to cause her to \"lose her job\", but they would like a new teacher.\n\nFrom remarks made by Mr. Agent Lawrence to me when I was at the Sault, I would gather that the agitation has not completely died down.\n\nI do hope that it will not be taken seriously, as a very careful enquiry on the part of the late Mr. Agent Sims and myself failed to discover one shred of reason for any dissatisfaction.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should like to see the work in the work book; done a little more neatly, and Miss Robicheau is keeping this in mind when correcting the books. Apart from this, however, I am more than satisfied with the work being done. In counting, for example, the children are more proficient than in most of the Provincial schools visited by me.\n\nIn view of War Conditions, it is difficult to arrange for transportation to this school, which is approximately sixty miles from the Sault, and can be reached only by car. I called down to see Mr. Agar Lawrence in case he might be visiting this reserve during my stay at the Sault. He was kind enough to so arrange his visiting of his reserves as to visit Batchawana and Goulais Bay on November 24th, and to take me with him. I should like to record my obligation to Mr. Lawrence for this assistance, as otherwise it might have been impossible for me to visit these two schools during the school year 1943/44. It will most likely be pretty bad driving when I am next in this locality, just before Easter.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In that report I made certain remarks about Miss Robicheau, and suggested that she might be offered the Rabbit Island School was flattered by the way in which the recommendations made in that report were so cordially accepted. As it turned out, however, Miss Robicheau's mother was ill, and it was not known when Miss Robicheau might have to go home. (As a matter of fact her mother died this spring). For this reason Miss Robicheau felt unable to take the Rabbit Island School for fear of being shown in at some inconvenient time.\n\nI now venture to recommend that she be offered the Serpent River School at Cutler. I spoke to her when I was at Batchawana, and she agreed that she would like the school. Even at that, I was a little late. Mr. Agent Lawrence had already been consulting her about taking the Serpent River School. The Indian Schools Branch may therefore be assured that both the Agent and the Inspector strongly favour the appointment.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had a great deal of difficulty in getting a Boarding place for the Teacher. I thought at one time I would have to take her back, at last I got a man named Joe Robineon a member of the Michipicot Band to take her providing I would furnish him with Lumber to partition off a bedroom, also furnish her own bedding. I hesitated about buying the necessary lumber and bedding but I considered that under the circumstances the Department would overlook my doing so without authority, so I purchased Lumber to the amount of $7.00. I bought her pair of Grey Blankets (all I could get) I also got her some Bedding and Towels, and an Alarm Clock, for which I will forward Bills as soon as received. She still wants a Single Bed, Mattress & Spring and a Red Spread, 4 yds of Oilcloth or Rug for her Bedroom floor, 4 yards of Scrim Curtaining, 1 Broom, 1 Scrub Brush and Water Pail and Cups. Those things should be sent up on a Launch which is going up the beginning of next week.\n\nThe regular Steam Boats have quit running and I must get those up as best and cheapest I can, those articles are needed.

Indian Affairs,\n\nI don't worry if you think you spent too much on this school house and residence. I wish some of the Authorities would see the place it is not a palace by any means. I was real happy in this little home and all the food is taken off it when I get letters from the Indian Agent saying you will kick at the cost of the place. I know the men were slow but Indians are always that way unless you stand and watch them. I had to be at school teaching and that is a mile from...\nhere or more I had to trust them to keep their time and as to getting articles we needed to complete the building such as Tar Paper, Stove Flaps, hinges, White Wash Brushes, Brooms, oilcloth I did need it and if I had waited to write to Mr. Habb I would not have been here yet our mail is sometimes ten days on the way we get mail but once a week.\n\nMr. Mr. Habb did not send me any table or chairs, so I got the men to make two tables for me in the kitchen out of rough Lumber and thought you would not mind if I got a few yards oilcloth to cover tables and Wash stand\nI did my best to get it done cheap but things are not so cheap up here. I had to borrow chairs. I'm real sorry you are displeased but I am real comfortable and the children are happy here we can now do as we like as this is not a church. We are going to have a Xmas Tree and Concert on Dec. 22nd '23. It is the first the Indians ever had here so it's a great event ha' ha'.\n\nOh & forgot to say the men also built 3 closets and banked the house too. It was a lot of work to fix up the\nold place. Write and let me know just how you feel about it, Mr. Dabb should have come up himself I think.\n\nBut I'll say once more this is very much nicer now a teacher will be so much happier in this as it is clean and comfortable.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMiss Isabelle Peltier\nBatchewana Bay\nOnt.\nOttawa, Dec. 22, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the expenditure incurred in fitting up and furnishing teacher's living quarters at the Batchawana Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say the Department is pleased to learn that satisfactory arrangements are now completed for the accommodation of the teacher. Accounts for the supplies, forwarded by Mr. Agent McNabb, have been received and paid. If you have any further accounts for work done by Indian labour, you should forward proper vouchers and receipts to Mr. McNabb, who will certify and transmit them to the Department for payment. While the costs of furnishing the teacher's living quarters and the repairs were higher than anticipated, the Department has raised no question regarding the same.\n\nWe note that you are arranging for a concert and Christmas tree for the pupils. We hope that you will meet with every success in your work as teacher of this school and that, as a result of the supplies forwarded and the work done, you will be comfortable during the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Dept has a very good school here and I would like to get the land to build a house on. There is no wood on the 2 acres. I have lived here with my parents for 25 years and we have kept a little store trusting the Indians when there was no work and saving the Dept the trouble of sending in supplies to them as other Indian camps had the Dept do.\n\nReply Yours,\n\nH.F. Brown\nOttawa, April 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to obtaining two acres of land which you state was acquired a number of years ago by this Department for school purposes at Batchewana Bay.\n\nWe are referring this matter to Mr. Agent Sims, Sault Ste. Marie, with the request that he furnish a report giving full information regarding the plot of land which you desire. It would be advisable that you take this matter up with Mr. Sims. I may add, however, that if the land is situated on the Batchewana Reserve it would hardly be possible to dispose of it to other than an Indian of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. F. Brown, Esq.,\nBatchewana Bay,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 26, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from W. F. Brown, Batchewana Bay, Ont., in which he states that he is desirous of obtaining two acres of land on which to erect a house. He also states that years ago the Department bought two acres of land for school purposes, but that it was situated so far away from the Indian houses that no school was built on same.\n\nIn 1914 the Department purchased approximately two acres of land situated in Section 19 of the Township of Fisher for the purpose of building a school and teacher's residence. The Department understands that the present school was built on this land. We are not aware as to the land that Mr. Brown wishes to obtain, and I have to request that you will make enquiry and inform the Department regarding same. You should state whether the land Mr. Brown wishes to obtain is situated on the Reserve, and whether he is a white man or an Indian. We are requesting him to take the matter up with you, and will await your reply giving as full information as possible. A brief description of the location of the land in question should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H.

Brown of Batchewana Bay asking for information regarding two acres of land in the Township of Fisher owned by the Indian Department.\n\nIn reply I may say that this land is situated one half mile from the present school, is not on any reserve, and is a part of the S.E.1/4 of Section 19 Township of Fisher.\n\nMr. Brown carries on a small store at Batchewana with his mother Mrs. S. Miller, is a white man, and I believe it is his intention to purchase this land for summer cottage sites. I am sure this is the two acres which the Department purchased in 1914 for a school site, but it was situated so far away from the Indian homes that the school was never built on it.\n\nMr. Brown offers $100.00 for the two acres which I think is a fair offer. However, I am of the opinion that in a year or two it may be worth much more, as this is a very desirable site for summer homes.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

F. Brown, of Batchewana Bay, to purchase two acres of land, part of the S.W. 1/4 Section 19, Township of Fisher, which was acquired by this Department for school purposes.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, when the Department purchased this land in 1914, the price paid was $150. We are, therefore, not prepared to accept the offer of Mr. Brown of $100. If he will pay the sum of $150 for this property, and also all costs of transfer, the Department would favourably consider the sale to him of the above mentioned land which is not required for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Further on June 30th, 1895, you issued a Patent to Andrew Crawford covering the whole of the S.W.\u00bc of Section 19, Township of Fisher, and there have been several transfers on the property since that date.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.J.

Our Indian Agent at Sault Ste Marie, in 1914, proposed the purchase of two acres in the S.W. \u00bc of Section 19 as suitable and desirable for school purposes, and in July of that year the Department purchased the site from William Riel. As the property, for various reasons, was never used by the Department it was sold to the Arbuckles, who requested patent and to whom the document issued in due course.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nH.

When she received her salary cheque for the quarter ending the 30th of September, she found that the Department had retained sixty dollars allowing her no salary during the summer holidays. I beg to say that during the holidays she has several times taken a horse and buggy and visited all the homes of her pupils instructing in taking care of their gardens, grains, chickens, sewing &c. The seed and eggs for the same were furnished to them by the Department of Agriculture and I am informed that her pupils won more prizes at their school fair than the other four schools combined for a reference on this matter will Mr. Hiram Gordon, District Representative of the Department of Agriculture. Would you kindly look into this matter, as we believe you will be good enough to send her the amount retained or at least $5 of it which would be a proportionate share of the teaching months.\n\nI am very truly yours,\n\nA. S. McDayall\nOttawa, November 22, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the amount of salary paid your daughter, Miss Annie McDougall, for the period which she taught the Bear Creek Day School during the months of September and October, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your daughter resigned from the position of teacher to take effect on the 30th of September, last, but she remained and taught during the month of October until her successor was appointed. During the month of September she taught twenty days and in October twenty-one days. In paying salaries the Department does not take holidays into account; each teacher is required to teach two hundred days in the school year in order to draw the full yearly salary. Your daughter's salary was at the rate of $400.00 per annum and for the September quarter she was paid 20/200 of that amount, or $40.00, and for the month of October she was paid 21/200 of the yearly salary, amounting to $42.00. Her successor, Miss McGugan, began her duties on the first of the present month and, as there is only $400.00 per year provided for salary for the teacher at this school, the balance will be required to pay Miss McGugan for her services, if she remains and teaches till the 30th of June, next, the end of the school year. This system of payment is the same as\n\nA. S. McDougall, Esq.,\nMelbourne, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have received a check for $40.00\nfrom Mr. Henry James, Indian Agent,\npurporting to be the amount due me for\nservices as teacher of Bear Creek School,\nCaradoc Indian Reservation, and it appears\nyou have made no allowance for Midsummer\nHolidays, which I think I am entitled to,\nas I spent much time during the holidays\npreparing for the School Fair. I regret to say I was\ncompelled to leave school owing to poor\nhealth, but I would be pleased to take\nup the work at a later date, providing\nof course, if the Department so desires.\nIf I am not entitled to the whole amount,\nsurely I should receive the proportion\nwhich the total days taught bears to the\nwhole teaching days in the year.\n\nAs I have given you good service for several years, which all official reports will testify I trust you will look this matter up and remit to me the furthest amount due me.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nAnnie McDougall.\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose a letter which I have received from Miss Annie McDougall, former teacher of Bear Creek Indian School. This letter from her will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to the above I might say Miss McDougall has always given the best satisfaction in this school and as she taught this school until Nov 1st 1916, I should think she should be entitled to pay for the midsummer holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.Jones\n\nThe Sec.\nDept Ind.

S. McDougall of the same date as the letter which you enclose and he was informed fully as the method adopted by the Department in the payment of salaries of teachers of day schools for broken periods.

They are placed in very low situations and there is no arrangement for cleaning them.\n\nIf the cost of cleaning these closets, since the Inspector visited the school, was not included in the account which you submitted on the 24th ultimo for putting down cement walks and gravel paths and cleaning out closets, you should see that they are thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good sanitary condition.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the school yard ground is very uneven and recommends that it be ploughed, harrowed level and re-seeded. I shall be pleased to have your report regarding this matter, stating the cost of having the required levelling carried out.\n\nIt is presumed that you have arranged for the painting of the school building, as authorized in official letter of the 20th ultimo.

This ground is clay and if ploughed would take a long time before it could be used as a play-ground, there were several low spots which have been filled in with gravel, making the yard quite level and in good condition.\n\nThe work of painting the school building will be commenced in the course of a few days.

He says there is sufficient lumber in the old closets to have them taken down and located nearer the school building. I shall be pleased if you will report regarding the inspector's recommendation and state whether you would approve of a change being made in the location of these closets. If so, please give the approximate cost of having the work done.\n\nThe Inspector further states that there is no water on the school premises and that the water used is not fit to drink. He says the necessity for good drinking water is urgent. Please make a recommendation as to what steps you would advise be taken to obtain a supply of water for the use of this school. The cost involved in any suggestion made by you should be given.\n\nThese matters should receive your early attention in order that, if it is decided to have any work done, it can be performed during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Woods, however, has suggested that a glass of milk each day at recess would be more beneficial, as the majority of the pupils do not get any milk at home, and as they are predisposed to tuberculosis, the milk would supply what is lacking in their daily food and help to build their resistance.\n\nIt would require approximately 30 quarts per day for the six schools at a cost of 10\u00a2 per quart; the milk could be purchased from local Indian farmers whose cows and stables are in a healthy and sanitary condition.\n\nWith the approval of the Department I would like to see this suggestion carried out until the 1st April, after which, if found beneficial to the pupils, the milk supply could be continued.\n\nArrangements can be made for delivering the milk at the school each morning, and vouchers submitted at the end of each month in favour of each farmer for the quantity supplied.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that it would require about 30 quarts per day for the six schools.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required in supplying this milk during the present school year. However, at the beginning of the next school year, you might again draw this matter to the attention of the department, when consideration will then be given to providing the funds necessary for the purpose, and also for the providing of utensils, etc., necessary for the serving of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This matter was drawn to your attention in official letter of July 14th, 1926, and I have to again request that you will make a recommendation as to what steps you would advise be taken to obtain an adequate supply of good drinking water for the use of the school.

This water is of excellent quality and has been used by the pupils and teacher for many years for drinking purposes.\n\nWhile visiting the school recently, the water supply was mentioned to the teacher, and she informed me that all the water the pupils could use was available and that several pails of fresh water was used each day.\n\nThere is a well on the school premises, but the water is unfit for drinking; the well has been cleaned out and a top installed, but the water is still unfit for use. I am doubtful if the digging of a new well on the grounds would be satisfactory or the expenditure justified, so long as the water can be obtained from the present source.

He recommends that they be plowed, levelled and seeded. He also states that the grounds should be better fenced and that some playground equipment should be provided.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you as to whether you would recommend that any work be carried out in the levelling and seeding of the grounds and in the providing of any new fencing. You should give the approximate cost of any work which you recommend be carried out.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to furnish a small supply of playground equipment, such as a football and a playground ball and bat, upon a requisition for these supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.Y.

In my opinion the grounds are quite as level and suitable for playgrounds as the majority of white schools in the white settlements. The ground is a heavy stiff clay and if plowed and seeded would require a great deal of work which I believe to be unnecessary.\n\nThe fences on the sides and back part of grounds are not in first-class condition but are quite serviceable and have recently been repaired. A new fence should be erected next year; the cost of this work would be approximately $50.00 for wire, posts and labour.\n\nIn the estimates for 1927-8 an amount of $50.00 was included for putting on two coats of paint on the outside of this school. The school was painted about three years ago but the paint has been absorbed in places leaving it streaky. I would be glad to know if this work can be done during the holidays.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6119, file 380-5, part 2)\nOttawa, August 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to certain improvements which were referred to by Inspector Sexton as being required at the Bear Creek Indian Day School. We note that you consider the grounds around the school are quite as level and suitable for playgrounds as at the majority of white schools. It is, therefore, considered that no action need be taken in this matter. We also note that a fence should be erected next year and that the cost for wire, posts and labour will be approximately $50. You should bring this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, when consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work done.\n\nThe Department will approve of your incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $50 in having any painting required carried out. We note that the paint on this school, which was painted about three years ago, is now in a streaky condition. You should purchase any paint, etc., required, obtaining competitive prices, if possible, and the work should be carried out by day labour. Proper time sheets should be kept. When the small amount of painting required is carried out, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure and labour returns, in duplicate, properly certified, for the labour employed. This work should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.7-3-5 of 4th instant in connection with the painting of the Bear Creek Day School.\n\nI beg to say that this school will require two coats of paint. I enclose an estimate for this work from Mr. Mitchell McArthur, who is a painter by trade and will make a good job of it for the sum of $45.00; the materials will cost approximately $20.00. By this method I consider a better job will be done and at less cost than by day labour which is impossible to get on the reserve at present. Mr. McArthur's tender is recommended for your approval. The work will be completed before school opening.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI.A.\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letters of the 13th and 14th instant, in connection with the painting of the Bear Settlement, Bear Creek and Lower Munsey Indian Day School buildings. I note that you were unable to have this done by day labour; that you are prepared to purchase the materials, after securing competitive prices, and to engage Mr. Mitchell McArthur, a competent painter, for the activity.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm my telegram of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"You may engage Mitchell McArthur to paint three day schools.\"\n\nIt is understood that Mr. McArthur will give three coats of paint to the outside, one coat of murexide to the inside and two coats of paint to the ceiling and woodwork of the Bear Settlement Indian Day School for $140; that he will give two coats of paint to the Bear Creek School for the sum of $45; and that he will give two coats of paint to the Lower Munsey School for the sum of $70. All outside knots are to be shellacked.\n\nWhen the work has been satisfactorily completed, you may forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, in favour of Mr. McArthur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection, I beg to say that the department had correspondence last August with Mr. Agent McCookin regarding the repairs to this fence, and he recommended that a new fence be erected this year, stating the cost to be approximately $50 for wire, posts and labour. I have to request that you will forward a report regarding this matter, giving an estimate of the cost of any work you would recommend be carried out in order to place the fence in good condition.\n\nThe Public School Inspector further recommends that the interior of the school building be redecorated in lighter colours. You might furnish a report regarding this matter, giving an estimate of the cost of any re-decorating you would recommend be carried out.\n\nThese matters should receive your early attention in order that, if it is decided to have the interior of the classroom redecorated, the work could be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lucas of Glencoe, Ont., and which would include the following work:\n\nTo remove the miresco from the walls & ceiling.\nTo put two coats of paint on the walls & ceiling.\nTo put two coats of paint on the woodwork and window frames etc. of the interior of the class room.\nTo repair three patches of ceiling that is off and which would measure ten feet square.\n\nI would recommend the acceptance of the tender offered by Mr. Lucas, which is reasonable and he will also supply all material for the above painting and repairs.\n\nBesides the work listed above I would recommend that a new roof be put on this School before the interior is decorated as it would be waste to paint the interior unless the roof is replaced. The building being 30 feet long and 26 wide it would take about 7 M cedar shingles to re-roof it, with 80 feet of ridge boarding, which material and labour by Indians should not exceed a cost of $75.00. New locks are also needed on the doors and outerhouses and keys secured for both the teacher and caretaker.

To put 2 coats of paint on the walls and ceiling.\n3. To paint the woodwork and window frames of the interior of the classroom (2 coats).\n4. To repair approximately 10 sq. ft. of the plaster and ceiling.\n5. To reshingle roof.\n6. To place new locks on doors of school and out houses.\n\nMr. Moore estimated the total cost of the above work would not exceed $175.\n\nMUNCEY DAY SCHOOL:\n\n1. The present ceiling in the classroom is 18 ft. high, and the agent recommends that a false ceiling be put in, approximately 12 ft. in height.\n2. The plaster of the south wall to be removed and the whole replaced with gyproc.\n3. To put 2 coats of murexco on the interior walls and ceiling.\n4. To make some small repairs to the roof.\n5. To put a new floor in boys' closet and to install locks.\n\nHe estimates the entire cost of the work required to be carried out at this school to be $305.\n\n- Oneida No. 3 School\nONEIDA No. 3 SCHOOL:\n\n1.

To apply 2 coats of murexco to the whole interior of the classroom and both cloakrooms.\n\n3. To remove the plaster from the chimney on the inside of the classroom and replaster same.\n\nHe estimates the total cost of the work required at this school to be approximately $127.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Moore has only obtained prices for the carrying out of this work from Mr. Charles L.

A. D. MOORE, INDIAN AGENT, MUNCEY, ONT., DATED DECEMBER 6TH, 1929.\n\nOriginal on File 7-7-7.\n\nMiss Baird, Miss Comfort and Miss Howe, teachers on the Chippewa section of Caradoc Reserve, have requested that I take up with Dept. the building of car garages at each of their schools. In all three cases, their homes or boarding houses are miles from their school and it is necessary for them to use cars to get there and all day in all kinds of weather their cars must remain outside as there is no building to put them in. I understand a portable garage can be put up for around $100.00 and would ask your consideration of the erection of such a garage at each of the schools of the above-mentioned teachers.\nOttawa, December 14, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your monthly report of inspection of the Bear Creek, Muncey and Back Settlement Indian Day Schools in which you recommend that garages for the teachers' use be erected at each of these schools, I have to say that the Department will approve of the providing of garage accommodation at the Back Settlement and Muncey Day Schools. If weather conditions permit, you may arrange for the erection of a garage of the portable type at each of these schools. You should see that the site selected in each case does not interfere with the playground accommodation or the general appearance of the school building. We note you estimate the cost of the erection of a portable garage to be approximately $100, but, if possible, to do so, they should be furnished at each school at less cost. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the providing of suitable garage facilities for the teachers at both these schools. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nRelative to the erection of a garage at the Bear Creek School, the Department does not consider that this is necessary at the present time. We understand that the teacher resides in the village of Middlesex, which is only a mile distant from the school, and that a car is not necessary to get to and from her school in any condition of weather.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you as soon as the two garages authorized above have been completed, with full particulars as to the type, cost, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dan Albert Sr. who lives on the land adjoining the school had his barn too close to this well and this Indian has now removed the barns and also the manure that was close to the well and I would wish to have this well cleaned out and limed to see if it can again be put in use as this school needs the water badly. It would mean the repairing of the present top on the well and the installation of a pump and the total cost should not exceed $40.00, half being for materials and half of this sum for labour. The water could be tested after cleaning the well out and if not fit for use the pump would not be purchased or any further expense incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D.

The building, fence and grounds were attractive. A closet has been moved to these grounds and is used by the teacher. The boys' closet is kept clean and tidy, but it is in a very poor state of repair. The girls' closet is so open at the back that paper is driven over the lawn. This morning the coal fire went out. On re-lighting it, I found that the fire pot is in bad condition. It should be examined by the agent.

The majority of the children are of Roman Catholic parents.\n\nThere is an old building at Birch Island which was in use some years ago as an Indian school and church and was conducted under the auspices of the Anglican church authorities. Now it is used as an Anglican church and council hall, but it is not in a fit state by any means to be used as a school now.\n\nAs the Band desire that a school be opened, and at the present time there are twelve children of school age along with fifteen children under age residing in the vicinity of Birch Island I would suggest to the Department that a new comfortable class-room and teacher's residence be erected at Birch Island. If a school is opened at this point it will be permanent for years to come as the majority of the Indians of the Whitefish River Band reside at Birch Island and there are a number of young children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing copy of a resolution of the Chief and principal men of the Whitefish River Band requesting that a school be opened at Birch Island on the unsurrendered portion of the Whitefish River Reserve, and stating the number of children of school age and the condition of the building which was formerly used for school purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds available in the appropriation for the present fiscal year for the erection of a building on this Reserve. This request will, however, be noted for next year's estimates, and will receive consideration when the same are being prepared for submission to Parliament. We note that if a school is opened at this point it will be permanent for a number of years, as the majority of the Indians reside at Birch Island, and there will be a sufficient number of Indian children to attend. You may inform the Indians interested that the question of erecting a building and re-opening a school at Birch Island will receive consideration as stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Considering that there is about eighteen children of school age to attend school it is our desire that a school be opened here, also that all the children in this reserve are Roman Catholics it is our desire that the teacher be of the same denomination as the above.\n\nEnclosure are signatures of the principle members of the Whitefish River Band for this resolution.\n\nSigned;\n\nDan Kemhikgonness\nGregor McGregor\nAndrew Paibomesa\nJohn Paibomesai\nAdam Nahwegahbow\nMoses Esquimaux\nJacob Daniel\nDave McGregor\nGus McGregor\nChief William McGregor\n259-36.

I note from earlier correspondence that a new classroom and teachers' residence would be required.\n\nIn reply I regret to inform you that there are no funds available for this purpose. Further, there are so many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, that I cannot promise favourable consideration in the near future. Please inform the interested members of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your No. 259-36 of July 18th, last and to official letter of this file number of the 22nd idem. The Rev. Father Papineau, of Little Current, visited the Department today and it has been decided to give favourable consideration to a trial school to be conducted this academic year in the Roman Catholic Church on the reserve. The Rev. Father informs me that he hopes to secure the services of Miss A. Douglas, who is qualified, and I have authorized him to engage her at a salary of $60 per teaching month if you and he, after conference with the Indians, decide that such an experiment would be worth while. You might inform me as soon after a decision is reached as possible, so that stationery, blackboard and other school equipment can be shipped.\n\nWith reference to the resolutions of the Whitefish River Band relative to a school to be conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, I have to suggest that you cooperate with Father Papineau in securing from the Band in Council a formal resolution, asking for the school and authorizing the Department to apply to His Excellency in Council for permission to use $4,000 of the Capital Funds of the Band for the purpose of erecting a combined school and teacher's residence. The resolution should also set apart a suitable site on dry ground, with good drainage facilities, of approximately two acres. You may inform the Indians of the Band that, if their Capital Funds are used for the erection of a school, the work would be done by day labour under your supervision. A foreman would be appointed and he would be instructed to engage Indian labour. The official name of this school, in future, will be the Birch Island Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nR. J.

Father Papineau for the use of the church for a class-room, and his living quarters for the accommodation of the teacher, but on making enquiries as to where I would find the Reverend gentleman I was informed that he had gone to a hospital in Montreal to undergo a surgical operation and was not expected to return before the middle of October next.\n\nAs I do not feel inclined to take possession of the church and living quarters for school purposes without first making arrangement with Father Papineau it would be advisable to let the matter stand until his return.\n\nThe Indians are all in favour of having the school conducted in the church until such times as a new building can be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 10th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to Departmental Letter No.19-13-I of September the 22nd last, relating to the question of opening an Indian Day School in the Roman Catholic church at Birch Island, I have the honour to report that I have had a communication from Rev.

The Department has received no intimation from Miss Malone that such is her intention. However, in the event of her doing so, Father Papineau has recommended that Miss Priscilla Lavallee succeed her and carry on the work for the month of June, at least. The Department is approving of the temporary appointment of Miss Lavallee, with salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month.

We understand that her address is Sudbury, Ont., and, in the event of Miss Malone retiring, I shall be pleased if you will arrange with Miss Lavallee to take her place as teacher for the balance of the present school year.

Lavallee,\nBirch Island Reserve,\nPonctet, Ont.\nI could not resist the temptation to write you and enclose a letter which Mrs. J. R. Lewis sent me.\n\nI really cannot understand why I was not given an opportunity to ask for continuation as teacher of the Brick Island school. A very unusual thing I think to dismiss a teacher without even the least notice or hint beforehand. I did not ask Mrs. Lewis to come back next year when she was here the other day, but intended doing so when I sent in my reports. It is nothing but self-revenge and unkind work on Mrs. Lewis' part. He did not like it in the least because I did not\napply to him for the school in the first place.\n\nHe was in a much greater hurry to see me than to send me report blanks like I had asked him to, to say Friday am leaving on the afternoon train and no report blank yet, now what will I do does that mean that I'm not to get my salary before I do send them. I would appreciate it greatly if you would see into this matter. I will be idle all summer and you understand that I need my salary.\n\nNo doubt it's too late to apply for the school now. However should there be the least chance I would be so grateful if you helped me in securing it. I will look forward to an answer.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nVery Respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 1928\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to your services for the period you taught the Birch Island Indian Day School.

As you are aware, this school is situated on the Algoma Eastern Railway, near Little Current, and a teacher's residence is provided in connection with the school.

He will bear the same relation to you as a School Board, and you should look to him for advice and for anything that you require.\n\nThe Birch Island Indian Day School is situate on the highway from Espanola to Little Current and is 1/4 mile from the flag station on the railway known as Birch Island. A furnished teacher's residence is provided. It is in the same building as the classroom.

Mr. Murray knows something about it. Miss the Quin has some years of experience and a good record. A beginner would not have so many difficulties, at Gabriel.\n\nSo, I will recommend you miss the Quin to succeed to Mr. Murray. Birch Island's school is the hardest school to manage, all through my mission.\n\nI thank you very much for re-writing.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to inform you that our family is doing well.

MacKenzie\n\nChief Dept.\nI. A.\nTo Mr. McKenzie,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish you a very Christmas and a happy New Year, and I thank you heartily for all that you have done for the welfare of the native missions and schools.\n\nMiss Mary Clarke, teaching at Birch Island, has fulfilled her duties with satisfaction and punctuality, and certainly she deserves credit for having succeeded with so great energy and success, and for being glad to come back, first Tuesday, after the Christmas holidays. The late Mr. Ferrier made certainly a good choice.\n\nTill the end of December Miss Clarke used to go to Kit-tena sometime, for shopping on the Saturday before noon train, and come back in the ferry-boat next day; on Sunday afternoon. But, this is not more possible. The ferry-boat is back up till spring, and the next train from L.C. east to Birch is due at Birch only on Monday 3 p.m., so, she will have to go shopping at Kapunda, east to Birch Island. The train leaves for Kapunda at 3 p.m., at Birch, and the next train could be Monday a.m. 11 o'clock, to come back to Birch. There is no train on Sunday\u2014\n\nSo, then writing you to grant Miss Clarke permission to come back on Sunday morning, at 11 o'clock, from Kapunda, after having taught Saturday morning.\nto make up for Monday before noon\u2014so no time will be lost in the class room, and she will be contented to stay in Birch Saturday and Sunday. With your answer she will be more quiet\u2014I hope that your letter will be satisfactory.\n\nThe last letter you wrote about the government school had a very good effect on the Indians, and I thank you very much for it. A kind cooperation between the Department and the missionary, had always good results for the welfare of the Indians and the teachers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. L. Porcheron\n\nLittle Current\nOttawa, January 3, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that permission be given Miss Clarke, teacher of the Birch Island Indian Day School, to re-open school each Monday morning at 11 o'clock, instead of the usual hour, in order that she can visit Espanola at the end of each week for shopping purposes.\n\nThe Department doubts the advisability of making a permanent arrangement along the lines suggested by you. However, if Miss Clarke wishes to follow your suggestion occasionally, there will be no objection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend L. Percheron, S.

We have received no intimation from the teacher of the Birch Island School of her intention to give up duties, and we are, therefore, not aware that there will be a vacancy. I may say that we have received a number of applications for the positions at both these schools, but it is doubtful, in the event of a vacancy at Birch Island, if we would be able to give your application favourable consideration. However, should the present teacher at the Birch Island School resign, your application will be considered along with the other applications for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

MACKENZIE,\n\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIt has been brought to my attention regarding the school teacher Miss Clark that she is neglecting her duties as school teacher on this reserve. First of all she closes school on Friday afternoon before four o'clock so it enables her to get on the train and does not open the school till Monday afternoon and some time Tuesday morning leaving that much time where she should be teaching school.\n\nAlso the children do not seem to learn much as she does not take any interest in them. Also at recess time the children are over the roads and in the woods she does not keep them in the yard where they have about two acres to stick to play.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6119, file 381-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nAll the parents whose children are attending the school are complaining the way the school is being handled by the teacher.

It would appear that a few of the members of this Band would like to have control over both the teacher and the school.\n\nIt is true that on some occasions Miss Clarke closes the school before 4 p.m. in order to get the train which is due at 4 p.m., as she has to get out at week ends in order to procure her supply of provisions, but as a rule she is always back in time to open school at 9 a.m., Monday morning.\n\nMiss Clarke is a capable teacher and has always given her services to the best interest in the classroom, and under no consideration would I recommend any change in teachers in this school during the academic year.\n\nI re-enclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hertzberg, Commissioner of Girl Guides for the province of Ontario, interviewed me a few weeks ago and appeared at that time to be particularly interested in a group of Girl Guides that had been organized at the Birch Island Indian Day School, Whitefish Falls, Ontario.\n\nIt appeared to me, from what Mrs. Hertzberg said, that one of her field officials had expressed the view that this was one of the best Girl Guide groups in the province of Ontario. I promised Mrs. Hertzberg at that time that I would communicate with the teacher in charge of the school, Miss Eva L. Fortin, and receive from her a brief history of the Girl Guide organization at her school. Miss Fortin, in a letter to me dated March 14, 1942, states:\n\n\"I have been working with this group of Girl Guides ever since I began teaching here, 8 years ago. I am quite satisfied with the results of the Guide movement in this village. The girls have entered several contests and always with good results. I feel sure the school work has been promoted a great deal by the work of the Guides.\n\n\"As soon as the little girls of the village attain the age of reason I invite them to come to Brownie meetings. These meetings are conducted by one of my Guides, whom I have trained to assume the responsibility of training the younger set to become Guides. This helps the little ones very much when they reach school age. When the Brownies have learned the Guide laws and grasp their significance, I enroll them in the Guide Company. From then on we follow very closely the Rules and Organization of the Girl Guides.\"\n\nMiss E. A. Riepert,\nGeneral Secretary,\nThe Girl Guides Association,\n22 College Street,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIt would appear that Miss Fortin has been outstandingly successful in the organization of this group of girls, and I feel sure you will be interested to learn that the Girl Guide movement can render very useful service in the cause of Indian education.\n\nI have already intimated to Mrs. Hertzberg that so far as this Branch is concerned we would be very glad to co-operate with her in the organization of similar groups at other Indian day schools in the province.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

THOMAS FARQUHAR, M.P.,\nMINDEN, ONTARIO.\n\nDear Mr. Farquhar,\n\nThere is a school teacher, Miss Margaret McNulty of 31 Hall St., Renfrew Ont., who is as yet without a school. She resigned her school at Missagami (near Blind River) last April and asked for a transfer from the Indian Department as she had been there nine or ten years. She is a very good teacher as judged from results in her school which I have had occasion to visit a couple of times. It seems that she and Mr. Lawrence the Indian Agent for that district had some little differences, he evidently has taken a rather mean advantage of his position. There is a vacancy at Sagamok reserve but the Department has passed over Miss McNulty without making her an offer of the school even though she applied for the school. She would have no difficulty in getting a school among White people but in view of superannuation, it would entail double annuity which she is not in a position to pay.\n\nWould you be kind enough to see that the lady in question gets a fair chance.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) Joseph Dwyer S.J.\n\n(Reverend Joseph Dwyer S.J.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter explains somewhat fully and in detail the steps that have been taken to secure teachers for the above-noted schools.\n\nWhen the vacancy occurred at Birch Island the matter was referred to your office. We did not feel that the school was one that would appeal to Miss MacNulty. In addition to this consideration, we had, at that date, under consideration the advisability of offering her the Dokis School. Mr. Marleau, who visited the Department about that time, was of the opinion that, in view of the experiences at Dokis last year with a young teacher, a more experienced teacher and one of mature years should be appointed to the Dokis vacancy. The correspondence on file suggests that a great deal of patience has been exercised by the Departmental officials in dealing with Miss MacNulty from time to time. She appears to have reached an age when she resents interference on the part of either the Indian Agent or the Department and is constantly having letters written on her behalf by missionaries and other citizens. When she left the Mississauga School, she did not turn over the keys to the Agent, nor did she leave her address, and this action on her part has led to a great deal of unnecessary correspondence. Were it not for the scarcity of teachers existing at the moment, I am disposed to think that it would be of\n\nP.t.o.\nadvantage to the Department, and perhaps to Miss MacNulty herself, to permit her to resign from our service and perhaps take a position at a public or separate school in the province. Should she refuse the position at Dekis, it is altogether likely that we shall receive, from time to time, a number of letters asking for her appointment to some Indian school that she has selected.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Farquhar:\n\nRe: Appointment of teachers, Birch Island and Sagamook Indian Day Schools.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 14 and also letter received by you from the Reverend Joseph Dwyer, S.J., sent forward therewith.\n\nThe records here indicate that Miss Margaret MacNulty resigned from the position of teacher at the Mississauga Day School on April 18, 1942, on the understanding that her resignation would take effect at the end of the academic year.

There is no other school within reach, and the children of this family have been attending Birch Island School for some time now.\n\nThe teacher objects however, to teaching those two grades as there are quite a number of children in nearly all of the lower grades, and she cannot do justice to these while teaching so many different grades.\n\nI realize of course that we are not obliged to teach the child, who is not an Indian, and I am of the opinion she need not take the Indian girl in Grade 10, but would prefer to have your advice in the matter.\n\nWould it be possible to send this girl to Spanish School, or some other institution, where she could continue her studies as she is a very apt pupil, or must Miss Cahill continue to teach her in Grade 10 at the day school.\n\nWill you please advise at your earliest convenience.\n\nCRJ / JH\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to an Indian child attending the Birch Island Day School who wishes to take Grade 10.\n\nIn many Indian schools throughout Ontario there are pupils taking both Grade 9 and Grade 10. We can make arrangements with the Ontario Department of Education to forward their correspondence course to the teacher of the school. This enables the pupil to work the lessons given by the correspondence branch and the teacher will only have to give general supervision to the pupil's studies. The Department feels that Miss Cahill should be willing to co-operate to this extent, and you might consult her again in the matter. As soon as I hear from you, arrangements will be made with the Department of Education to forward the lessons regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, Ontario,\nDecember 9, 1942\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIn accordance with your letter dated October 30, 1942, File 1055-20, in regard to teaching Grade 10, in Birch Island Day School, I wish to advise the teacher has informed me she is willing to follow the correspondence course.\n\nIt will therefore be in order to arrange this with the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is an Indian girl attending the Birch Island Indian Day School who is taking Grade 10 this year and the teacher would like to have the correspondence course for this grade. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would forward this course regularly to Miss Carmel Cahill, Teacher, Birch Island Indian Day School, Whitefish Falls P.O., Ont. The account covering the cost of the course should be forwarded to this office for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.D.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBirch Island, Ont.,\nJune 14/43.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nAllow me to ask you a few favours.\n\nMy monthly salary for this term was $89.86, which has been cut to $83.85 since April. Owing to the high cost of living here, I am obliged to ask for a monthly raise in salary of $6. for next term. If I do not receive it, I shall have to seek another position.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Hoey, would you allow me to close school June 25th? By so doing, I would receive a ride to my home, instead of travelling by train the proceeding week.\n\nIf I be allowed to do so, I would\nyou please forward my June cheque as soon as it's convenient?\n\nHoping that I have not asked too great a favour\n\nI am\n\nRespectfully yours\n\nCarmel Cahill\nBruns\n\n90.00 15.30 = -105.30\n\nDeductions:\nIncome tax: 10.94\nRent: 4.44\n\nTotal: 89.86\n\n---\n\nBruns\n\n90.00 15.30 = 105.30\n\nDeductions:\nIncome tax: 16.95\nRent: 4.50\n\nTotal: 83.85\nOttawa, June 15, 1943.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Carmel Cahill, teacher of the Birch Island Indian Day School, requesting an increase in salary for the academic year 1943-44. Miss Cahill is apparently under the impression that she can obtain a larger salary at some other school. It is quite possible that she may be offered a larger salary, but when she pays the extra taxes levied on increased salary, her net salary will not be very much better than she is receiving at the present time.\n\nHowever, after giving the matter very careful consideration, it has been decided that we can offer Miss Cahill salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month for the academic year 1942-44. As you are aware, the schools will be open for a 10 month period during the coming academic year, and this in itself means approximately 11% increase for teachers of Indian day schools. Of course, it is understood that in addition to the basic salary of $95.00 Miss Cahill will be paid the bonus at the rate of 17%.\n\nYou should interview Miss Cahill immediately and ascertain if she is prepared to continue as teacher of the Birch Island School for the academic year 1943-44 at the salary offered to her.\n\nMiss Cahill has also requested permission to close the school on June 25. You may advise her that she may do so.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental letter dated June 15, File 19-13-1, relative to the re-employment of Miss Carmel Cahill as teacher of Birch Island School.\n\nMiss Cahill has informed me that she will definitely continue as teacher of this school for the next term at the higher salary.\n\nC.

Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, in which you advise that Miss Carmel Cahill intends to remain as teacher of the Birch Island Indian Day School during the coming academic year.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBirch Island, Ont.\nDecember 11/43.\n\nMr. Hoey, Dept.\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nPlease allow me to acquaint you with my desire to terminate my service at the Birch Island Indian Day School. I feel it difficult to express\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1943.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Carmel Cahill, teacher of the Birch Island School, tendering her resignation, effective December 31. In forwarding her resignation she writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Owing to the fact that it is an extremely cold building, being minus double doors and a furnace, the heating system is poor. It is injurious to my health, being so much so that I do not feel able to continue here after Christmas.\"\n\nIn view of the fact that Miss Cahill was employed as teacher at this school during last winter, which was supposed to be one of the coldest winters for some time, and during that period we have no record of her making any complaint regarding the heating of the school, I cannot see why she gives such a reason at the present time, as we have had, in this part of the country at least, a comparatively mild fall. We are not replying to her letter until we have received a report from you regarding the present condition of the building. If possible it would be appreciated if you could interview her before replying.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nDecember 21, 1943\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated December 15, file No.19-13-1, in regard to Miss Carmel Cahill resigning her position as teacher of Birch Island School.\n\nI have been over to see Miss Cahill, and find that she has definitely decided to resign, and from information I could gather, the chief reason is that Miss Cahill is not strong enough to carry on here.\n\nI was always of the impression this was a warm school as the fuel consumption appeared to be light, and there were formerly no complaints in this respect, but Miss Cahill complains the living quarters become very cold over night, which is due greatly to the fact the pipes from stoves in both kitchen and living room enter the chimney downstairs.\n\nMiss Cahill did ask for a furnace this fall, which I expected there was no use asking for, since it had never been included in the estimates, furthermore the building is not laid out very well for a furnace.\n\nThere are nearly forty pupils at Birch Island School, with some in each grade from one to eight. This no doubt makes it quite a heavy task, and I am afraid Miss Cahill would have a break down, if she were compelled to carry on here any longer, so I would recommend her resignation be accepted.\n\nI believe we might get either Mrs. Lawrence Peltier of Kaboni P. O., or Mrs. Henry Fox of Wikwemikong to finish out this term, if the Department have no one else in view.\n\nMrs. Fox was engaged, I believe, as teacher in Sturgeon Bay, but I understand owing to her mother's sickness she will leave for school nearer home.\n\nI believe we should indicate direct with Miss Cahill that you expect she will leave if you wish me to make any arrangement above as her successor.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Birch Island Indian Day School, No. 381.\n\nPlease note that the Department has accepted the resignation of the teacher, Miss Carmel Cahill, effective January 1, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1943.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the teacher of the Birch Island School. I am advising her that her resignation is accepted.\n\nAt the present time we are not aware of any qualified, Catholic teacher who could be secured for Birch Island. Therefore you may employ either Mrs. Peltier or Mrs. Fox. Please let me know which one you engage. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1943.\n\nEX'D A\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the Department accepts your resignation as teacher of the Birch Island School, effective December 31.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Carmel Cahill,\nCalumet Island, Que.\nMrs. Roy,\n\nThe kids told me that I am supposed to buy their own books. I've been living here for 24 years and they have been going to school for 20 years. Since the school was built, all the teachers that were here never said for them to buy their own things. You're the first one to ask them to do this. If they don't get their books & things in school I will write to the department and ask them about it. Soon as the kids are through with the books they have now, and the school doesn't furnish them with books you can send them home.\n\nSincerely,\nM. R. Kuleba\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nJanuary 18, 1944\n\nWhen Mrs. Fox began her duties as teacher at Birch Island School, I informed her, as I have also informed previous teachers at this school that the Kuleba children, not being Indians, must furnish their own school supplies, with the result Mrs. Fox received the enclosed letter from Mr. Kuleba, who is a C. P. R. Section Foreman, living on the C. P. R. right of way, near Birch Island School.\n\nMr. Kuleba is a naturalized Canadian from some European country, I presume, from his language; and Mrs. Kuleba was an Indian woman.\n\nI do not know what attitude the Department take, as there is no other school within reach of their home, but I would consider Mr. Kuleba very fortunate that he has not been required to pay for tuition fees in addition to furnishing the necessary school supplies, and would like a ruling as to whether these children should be allowed to attend. There are 41 children on the register including four of the Kuleba family, which fill the class room almost to capacity.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa,\nJanuary 22, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant and also letter received by Mrs. Fox, teacher at the Birch Island Indian Day School, from Mr. R. Kuleba sent forward therewith.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. Kuleba appears to be a naturalized Canadian it is just possible that some misunderstanding exists in his mind with respect to the education of his children and the governing body responsible for this education. Mr. Kuleba should be informed, either by you or by the teacher, that the Dominion Government is under no responsibility whatever either to provide school accommodation or text books for his children. This is wholly and solely the responsibility of the municipality in which he lives and the Provincial Government of Ontario. Whether his children should remain at the Birch Island Indian Day School is largely a matter for you and the teacher to decide. If Mrs. Fox is finding the work rather exacting, her first duty is to the Indian children. If, however, she can provide instruction for these children without such instruction interfering seriously with her other work, she can continue to help them. The parents, however, should be informed that the teacher is doing this voluntarily and not because she has been requested to do so by this Branch.\n\nR.A.

The one in Grade VIII is expected. The pupils are nice and have made up quickly. My object in writing is: I find it very hard to get organized. It seems that Grades VII and VIII get all the attention in past years while the junior grades were more or less given work (written) just to keep them busy. They cannot apply themselves to any subject. Reading, spelling and literature are poor while Mathematics are far from personal.\n\nI trust that you will understand the matter. I will do everything possible to make a successful year but I will be unable to accomplish as much as I did in other Indian schools owing to\nI would appreciate a word of advice in the matter as I certainly do not wish to shrink my duty in any way.\n\nI gave Mr. Johnston a list of requirements for the teacher's quarters but since then there are a few other articles that are needed too.\n\nThe water is a great drawback. The people carry it from Mac Sugar Bay which takes our twenty minutes for a trip. Then it is not safe for drinking.\n\nIs there any possibility of having the school ground leveled? There is no place for a ball game as the ground is on a hill, leaving that the boys are dashing back and forth across the road which is very dangerous. Allowed to play near the school the windows will always be broken. Truthfully, there is a vast amount of repair work necessary.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\nMary Brown\nOttawa, September 19, 1947\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Garden River R.C., Indian Day School, No. 390.\n\nMiss Julia Goody, who taught at this school until July 1, 1947, has been transferred to the Sheshegwaning R.C. Indian Day School (#432) and Miss M. Morris has been transferred to the Birch Island School (#381).\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nEverything is going well here. The progress is slow but some undertakings have been successful which makes it very encouraging. Although there are times when it is most discouraging.\n\nYou will be thinking I have some pretty wild ideas when I ask you if there is any possibility of having another classroom with a second teacher to teach so far as Grade X. The children are more intelligent than the ones I have met on other Reserves but with so many grades they do not get the proper attention. I have been taking Grade VII and VIII after school hours for certain subjects, and will have to continue doing so indefinitely because they are far behind in their work and there is no time during school hours to give them adequate attention. I do not mind doing it so I will do all possible to have success.\n\nThe man were here about the well.\nA new pump is needed. The other pump, when taken out, was left outside and now it is ruined.\n\nThe lighting in the school is poor. The time of year from 9 o'clock to 10 o'clock and from 2 pm to 4 pm it is so dark and nothing whatsoever to give a little light. I have been waiting for the Agent to come over to speak to him about some kind of light.

This on the urgent advice of my doctor. While I hesitate to impose upon you this inconvenience, I am convinced it is the best thing to do. I have decided to leave for at least a month beginning March 25th. Whether (and when) I shall return will depend upon the improvement of my health. This decision I have already drawn to the attention of Mr Johnston, my agent.\n\nThere are also a few things I should like to pass on to you.\n\nFirst: the condition in which I found the children (educationally) at Birch Island. Only 3 are in the grades in which they should be by reason of years of attendance. Many are 3 and 4 years in one grade. Their progress has been impeded by the following factors: (1) Poor attendance\n(2) Lack of parents' co-operation\n(3) Generally parents resent white teacher\n(4) Children (and parents) resent correction\n(5) Most parents will not help children at home\n\nYou have probably already been informed re trouble from McGregor element who seem to resent lack of attention given by former teachers. These are the children who are so far behind. The trouble began when I began to use reasonable means to have them do the work assigned and bring them into line with other pupils.\n\nIn case you see fit to doubt any of above, you may consult Rev. M. J. Kelly, the local pastor.\n\nMay I thank you personally for attention given to recent requisitions.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMary Norris.\n\nP. S.

I believe Miss Morris to be reasonably strict as there has been a vast improvement in discipline.\n\nA few of the parents informed me their children have made remarkable advancement since last September and are well satisfied with the teacher. Some families have always been somewhat irregular in attendance necessitating suspension of Family Allowances which is no doubt resented by the parents as I find these are the chief objectors.\n\nMiss Morris is not in good health and is I believe under quite a nervous strain. She has been advised by her Doctor to undergo an operation and is endeavouring to delay the operation until the Easter vacation.\n\nIt would, I presume, be impossible to engage another teacher immediately as the Senior Room in West Bay Village School has been without a teacher since December and I would recommend Miss Morris be retained for the remainder of the term at least.\n\nC.

Your 1055-22(19)\n\nThe Department has received also a letter from Miss Morris advising that she has decided to leave teaching for at least a month, beginning March 25th.\n\nBefore taking any action with regard to her letter, could we please be advised if you concur in the following suggestions:\n\n(a) That we give Miss Morris one month's leave of absence effective 25 March dependent of course on an improvement in her health.\n\n(b) That she report back on April 26 to the West Bay Indian Day School as teacher of the senior room.\n\n(c) That we advertise immediately for a teacher for the Birch Island Day School.\n\nFailing any response to our advertising, we could also consider the operation of the Birch Island School and possibly the West Bay School on a summer time basis. Last year we operated some of our day schools during May to September when we could not get teachers for the winter. It is usually possible to hire teachers for this month from those who have been attending university during the winter.\nHowever, if this were done it must be emphasized with the Indians that it is only an emergency measure to help give their children an education during the present serious shortage of teachers.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/MGD\nLittle Current, Ontario,\nMarch 11th, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI think this is my first correspondence with you, although I have been 7/2 years at Little Current, and attending to Birch Island.\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to acquaint you with conditions at Birch Island. I think you know that the teacher there (Mary Morris) has been ordered by her doctor to go away for a rest. She will leave at Easter. In any event she seems worried that you may think that she has been somewhat of a failure. Why she should think this, I do not know. Since she came to Birch Island in Sept. I have seen more progress and improvement than in the six previous years. Further, I would say that she is one of the best teachers on the Indian list. The teachers there during the last few years have not been the best. She is laboring with children who are 2, and 3, and 4 years in one grade. She is dealing with a band that is dominated by the mentality of a slick (McGregors) who seem to think that they are better than the \"whites\"; better than the teacher; better than the Indian Department. She has gone to all manners to teach them order, respect and co-operation. She has fought with poor attendance (I realize that her attendance before Christmas was the best in the country), lack of interest, and co-operation from the parents; resentment of correction, pitiful lack of facilities, and many others. She has to go half a mile for all water. There is no local post office. There is one train a day. The people have not all realized that she has done her very best to make their children better. But she has. The nicest Christmas concert I have seen for a long time was at Birch Island, last Christmas. She has taught them singing, dancing, good manners, respect for authority, punctuality, and many other virtues. In short: Miss Morris has done a wonderful job. I sincerely hope that you will not get the impression that she has fallen down in any way. She hasn't. At present it is doubtful whether she will teach again. If she does it will most probably be at an Indian school, and I would like you to know that as far as I am concerned she is first class\u2014one of the finest teachers in the north country. I know for sure that any trouble she has had at Birch Island is owing to the traditional Indian mentality\u2014their natural resentment of the Whites, their resentment of correction, their failure to co-operate, their peculiar slowness to improve, and their funny tendency to pull the white man down to their own low level.\n\nI would very much appreciate reply\u2014at your convenience.\n\nWishing you the best luck in your difficult position,\n\nI am yours most sincerely in Christ,\n\nRev. M. G. Kelly.\nP.S. & gather that the B.C. Indians are angling for an Indian teacher to replace Miss Morris. In my opinion, Mr. Phelan, this would be a grave mistake. They would gloat over it, and the children would revert to carelessness & neglect of study.\n\nFor your information\u2014\nRobt Macdonald, Athabasca River, has been consulted by Miss Morris, and expresses a desire to take over school for remaining months of this semester\u2014in case you have difficulty in finding replacement. He has certificate for Sr. Matriculation at present; this boy contemplates going to the seminary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, March 16, 1948.\n\nDear Father Kelly:\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to Miss Morris.

She is an Indian girl with no teaching experience and I spent most of my visit in assisting her with the planning of her classroom work. There are 25 children in Grades 1 to 7 and Miss McGregor will have her hands full in keeping them occupied.\n\nSCHOOL and TEACHERAGE\n\nThis school is about 20 years old but is still in very good condition. The classroom is bright and is heated from a stove. It is well located, with a nice playground, and is on the highway to Little Current from Espanola. It is close to the Birch Island station on the C. P. R. line.\n\nThe teacher's quarters are good, with two bedrooms upstairs, living room and kitchen downstairs. The quarters are stove-heated but there is a basement which could be used for a furnace.\n\n..... General\nBIRCH ISLAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nGENERAL\n\nThis could be a very good school as the children are bright and responsive. They speak English much better than elsewhere on the Island. Because of its accessible location, we should be able to interest a teacher in this position.\n\nWater is from a pump in the kitchen and although no hydro is available, it will eventually come along the highway.\n\nMy recommendations for this school are:\n\n1. The placing of a new roof.\n2. The building of a new woodshed.\n\nBernard F.

He has been recommended by several contractors as a responsible carpenter and a fast worker.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the list of materials necessary and estimate of cost, which has been prepared by Mr. Smith, but I am of the opinion that there will be a great deal more required before the building is complete.\n\nIt is the purpose of the Department to reduce the length of the class room to 36 feet, in place of 31'3\" as shown on the plan, but I would recommend that it be erected of the original length 31'3\" as the attendance of pupils is on the increase.\n\nI might say again for the information of the Department that I believe that it would be more satisfactory to have this building erected by contract as the Whitefish River Reserve is over thirty miles from this office which will make it rather difficult and costly for me to supervise.\n\nMr. Smith has lead me to believe that he will erect a suitable building at a very reasonable price by contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJuly 10, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReference your letter of the 2nd ultimo regarding the erection of a school at Birch Island. I note your remarks with reference to erecting this building by contract, and would say that if the building is built under contract, it will delay operations until late in the season, in order to give time to invite tenders, etc. I believe it would, therefore, be more satisfactory to build by day labour, and give as much employment as possible to the Indians. You state that in your opinion there will be a great deal more materials required than shown on the list prepared by Mr. Smith. I would ask you to please let me know what the cost of the building complete will be including labour, also it might be advisable to have Mr. Smith give you a price for all of the labour required for the building, the materials to be supplied by the Department.\n\nIn the interior finishing of the building the ceiling should be finished with a metal ceiling and the walls sheeted with fibre board or v-joint as plastering does not prove satisfactory in this type of building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If the Department supplies the material the cost of the same will come higher than $2266 as I know very well before the building is complete there will be different articles required which are not included in Mr. Smith's list.\n\nI might say that it would appear to me that the Bugwah School in this agency was built from the same plan as the Department submitted for the Birch Island School, and Mr. Strain erected the Bugwah School including woodshed, two toilets and storm windows for the school building complete for $4900. On Mr. Smith's estimate I believe that this building alone will cost as much as was paid for the building of the Bugwah School, including the toilets, woodshed and storm windows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. 38/230, of February 16th, last, authorizes an expenditure of $4,000 from Band Funds (Whitefish River) for the purpose of erecting a combined classroom and teacher's residence for the Birch Island Indian Day School. Mr. Orr and I have been corresponding with the Indian Agent, with reference to the erection of the building, and the final estimate that has been prepared shows that there will be required at least $4,366. In addition to this amount, there will be needed funds for furnishing fencing, etc.\n\nThe Interest to the credit of the Band is $10,855.40, and I wish to recommend that whatever is needed, over and above the $4,000, to prepare the building for use be taken from the Interest Account.\n\nActing Chief Accountant.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6119, file 381-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAug. 5, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ultimo with further reference to the building of the new combined day school and residence at Birch Island, I beg to say that you may commence this work employing Mr. Smith as foreman. In the purchase of materials competitive prices should be obtained, and the material purchased to the best advantage. Time sheets should be kept for all labour and forwarded to the Department in duplicate, and I am sending you, for this purpose, under separate cover, copies of the time sheets.\n\nAn accountable cheque will be sent you to pay for labour on application.

I should be pleased if you would furnish a report as to what work is required in the levelling of the grounds around the school, and the approximate cost of having it carried out. At the same time, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying the fence posts, wire and gates required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

All the earth and rock taken from the cellar when the building was erected has to be removed, the whole yard plowed, the stones picked and drawn away and the holes filled. The cost of having this work carried out will be approximately $100.\n\nIn order to install a suitable fence around the school equipped with two gates it will cost at least $150.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of levelling and fencing the school grounds around the Birch Island Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the levelling of the grounds, I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work done. The earth and rock taken from the cellar of the building should be placed where required in the school yard and levelled. The whole yard may be plowed, the stones removed and all holes filled in. We note that you estimate the cost of having this work carried out to be approximately $100, and this amount should not, if possible, be exceeded.\n\nRelative to fencing the grounds, I beg to say it is considered that a suitable fence, with 2 gates, including the cost of the wire, posts, staples, etc., should be erected for less than your estimate of $150. However, as the Department is anxious to complete all work in connection with this school, you may make the necessary arrangements to have the fence enclosing the school grounds erected. You should arrange for the purchase of all posts required, and for the wire, staples, etc. Please keep the cost down to the lowest possible point. It is thought that fencing material of the Page wire type would be the most satisfactory for the purpose.\n\nWhen the above work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure for the levelling of the grounds and for the fencing separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A copy of the Inspector's remarks is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you relative to each item as mentioned by the Inspector. You should state what you would recommend be done in each case and the approximate cost of carrying out the work. The Department cannot understand why, if the site for this school building was properly selected, there should be difficulty in drainage. You should give an estimate of the cost of drilling a well and supplying a pump, and state whether you would recommend that this be done. The Department will expect a full report from you regarding each of the matters referred to by the Inspector.\n\nThe Inspector also states that 6 single desks are required to provide seating accommodation. The desks in this school were supplied by the Globe Furniture Company, and it will be necessary, if extra desks are supplied, that they be of the same type in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangements. I have to request that you will state whether you would recommend that this number of extra desks be supplied, and, if so, you should state the size and number of each size of desk required.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the following supplies are urgently needed: 6 Yds. towelling; 6 tea plates, clover leaf pattern; 1 glass butter dish and 1 bread pan. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of these articles, and you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Five in all.\n\n\"The cheap round sheet steel pipe stove is dangerous and unsuitable and should be replaced by a small iron box stove. This stove is only worth about $6.75. Whereas an ordinary box stove, reliable in every way and suitable for keeping a fire in all night, is only $10.00 - Eaton's.\n\n\"No woodshed yet.\n\n\"Built inside the cellar is a cement cistern 6 ft. high and 6 ft. wide open on the top. Consequently, dirt, dead mice & shaving, etc., are floating in this water. Besides being open on top, the moisture causes the cellar to be useless. In summer blue mold comes on everything and in winter even covered goods, potatoes, etc., all freeze. It is a useless cellar and a useless cistern. Cistern should have been covered tightly & should be cleaned out regularly by means of a trap door. This matter should be settled once for all. Cistern should be cleaned and covered tightly and a trap door arranged for.\"\nOttawa, October 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Birch Island Indian Day School, states that 5 storm windows are required for the teacher's living quarters. I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying the storm windows of the size required.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the \"round sheet steel metal pipe stove\" is dangerous and unsuitable and should be replaced by a small iron box stove, and that this box stove will be more reliable in every way and suitable for keeping a fire in all night, and would cost approximately $10 at Eaton's. Please state whether you would recommend that the change in stoves as suggested by the Inspector be carried out.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the cement cistern in the cellar has no cover and that consequently dirt of all kinds is floating in the water. Besides being open on top, the moisture causes the cellar to be useless. He recommends that the cistern be covered tightly and a trap door arranged in order that it can be cleaned out from time to time. I have, therefore, to request that you will have this cistern thoroughly cleaned and a cover placed over same, with a trap door or other arrangement in order to be able to clean the cistern when required. This matter should receive your early attention.\n\nI have also to request that you will state the cost of erecting a suitable woodshed of an inexpensive type for the storage of fuel.\n\nThe Inspector has also recommended that 4 front desks be supplied to complete seating arrangements. Please furnish full shipping directions, when an order will be placed with the Globe Furniture Co., Ltd., to supply same.\n\nThe above matters should receive your early attention, and full information should be furnished the Department.\n\nR.

The stove recommended by the Inspector for sale by T.Eaton Company is not suitable as the firebox is too short. At the present time the wood has to be cut in two different lengths, and if the one he recommends be installed the wood will have to be cut in three lengths.\n\nIf possible a cover will be placed on the cistern, but it will be somewhat difficult as the walls of the cistern has been built up close to the bottom of the kitchen floor and there has been very little space left for a cover and a trap door. All the water in the cistern is caught from the roof of the building and dirt that collects in the cistern is from the roof and not from the cellar.\n\nAn estimate on the cost of erecting a suitable woodshed will be submitted in the near future.\n\nThe number and description of desks required were requisitioned for on the 10th instant, these should be shipped by C.P.Railway to Sudbury, thence A.E.Railway to Birch Island Station.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Indian Agent,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION OF OCTOBER 7TH, 1927,\nfor supplies for the Birch Island Indian\nDay School.\n\nOriginal on File 19-13-4.\n\nRequired - 5 front seats for the front of each\nrow.

They should be furnished with natural colour back and seat and cherry colour top.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, should be forwarded to Mr. Lewis, whose post office address is Manitowaning, Ont.

You should arrange to sell the present heater, and the proceeds should be forwarded to the Department. You should see that the stove purchased is of a suitable type, both as to heating facilities and the length of the wood required. The obtaining of the new stove and the setting up of same should receive your early attention.\n\nIt is also noted that you will endeavour to have a cover placed over the cistern, and this should be carried out if at all possible.\n\nWe are today placing an order with the Globe Furniture Co., Ltd., Waterloo, to ship addressed to you, Birch Island Station, by C.P.R. to Sudbury, thence via Algoma Eastern Railway, the following single fronts:\n\n4 No. 5,\n1 No. 3.\n\nThese desks will be shipped knocked down, and you should arrange to have them taken to the school, assembled and set up in the classroom.

It is not intended that any expensive structure be erected. If the lumber were supplied, would it not be possible to have the Indians do the work without cost? I shall be pleased to hear as to whether it would not be possible to have a small wood shed erected at considerably less cost than mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

You should purchase all materials required and arrange for the labour. It is not intended that an expensive shed be erected. It is thought that you will be able to decide as to the size required, having in view the quantity of wood which it is necessary to store. It will not be necessary to put a floor in the shed, and the roof, which should be of the sloping type, should be shingled. It is not considered necessary to have the walls shingled. A door, of the required dimensions, with lock, should be installed. If possible, you should arrange to have the work completed before the extreme cold weather sets in. All costs should be kept down as low as possible. The Department will leave the matter in your hands to have a woodshed erected at as low a cost as possible.\n\nWhen the woodshed has been completed, please forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should also have the wood neatly piled near the school or, if there is a woodshed, it should be placed therein. The toilets should also be thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition, and any repairs required to the fence carried out.

The report on the analysis, a copy of which I am enclosing, shows that the water is 'unsatisfactory' and unfit for drinking purposes unless it is boiled or chlorinated.\n\nThis well is unprotected from surface drains which naturally contaminate the water. It should be properly stoned up or cemented with a good tight cement covering and banked around to prevent contamination from surface water. Should this be done the water would improve in quality and be satisfactory and safe for drinking purposes.\n\nIn the meantime and until this well has been properly protected a good water supply could be secured from a spring between the school and the road camp.\n\nI will be making a trip down the Algoma Eastern within a month or six weeks and hope to find that improvements have been made to the well.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.B. McCauley\nProvincial Sanitary Inspector.\nOttawa, June 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Provincial Sanitary Inspector, who recently visited the Birch Island Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the water supply. He states that he had a sample of the water analyzed and that it is unfit for drinking purposes unless boiled or chlorinated. He also states that the well is unprotected from surface drains which naturally contaminate the water, and recommends that it be properly stoned up or cemented with a good tight cement covering and banked around to prevent contamination from surface water. Should this be done, the water would improve in quality and be satisfactory and safe for drinking purposes.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have this well properly stoned up or cemented, and a tight cement covering placed over the well. This matter should receive your early attention. Please keep all costs as low as possible, and, when the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my visit to the department at Owen Sound I suggested that the interior walls of the school be painted. This you agreed to and asked me if I could name an Indian who would be capable of doing this work during the Easter holidays. After much enquiry I find there is no one on the Reserve who has any experience in painting.\n\nHowever there are some professional painters doing some work on a tourist's cottage here and I inquired from them if they could do the painting in the school. They are willing to do the work and at a reasonable price also. I know them to be honest and trustworthy men so that we could be sure of a good job.\n\nI think it would be very advisable to engage these men as I don't know...\nof an Indian with whom I could trust the key.\n\nI explained to you at Tomas the condition in which I found the school last September which was due to the Indians having the full run of the school during the summer holiday. They even told me that they had a skeleton key which would fit any door in the school. This difficulty I overcome by putting a Yale lock on at my own expense.\n\nHoping to receive a reply at the earliest date possible I beg to remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nMary Heim\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nMarch 25th, 1930.\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. I9-I3-5 of March 13th instant, enclosing there-with a communication from Miss Mary Wrinn concerning the question of painting the interior of the Birch Island School, and in reply I have the honour to report that I would not advise painting the interior of this building at this time of the year as the weather is too cold in this district to have it carried out successfully, and besides the exterior of this building will have to be repainted during the incoming summer when it is warm and at than time both jobs can be carried out at the same time, and can be done more cheaply in the summer months than now.\n\nThe interior of this building is finished with cedar lumber and has never been painted. It was thought that if this finish is oiled and then given two coats of varnish it would be much better that putting paint on cedar lumber.\n\nI might say also, that there is ample Indian labour available during the summer months to have such work as this carried out.\n\nI am re-enclosing herewith Miss Wrinn's letter, as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 11th inst., relative to the redecorating of the interior of the Birch Island Indian Day School, I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Lewis states that the exterior of the building will also require being painted. He recommends that this work be carried out during the coming summer holidays and if the necessary funds can be provided, the redecorating of the school, both inside and outside, will be done at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary Wynn,\nTeacher\u2014Birch Island Day School,\nPoneet, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant relative to the request of the teacher of the Birch Island Indian Day School that the interior of the school be painted. In this connection, it is noted that you recommend that the exterior of the building be also painted and that all this work be carried out during the summer months. In the meantime, you might furnish an estimate of the cost of the painting required to the exterior of the building and also the interior. It is noted that you consider the interior of the building, which is finish in cedar, be oiled and given two coats of varnish instead of being painted.\n\nYou should furnish full information as to the work that should be done together will your estimate of the cost and if funds can be provided, authority would be granted in due time to have the work carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe teacher is being informed that any painting required to the school building, will have to stand over until the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nApril 30th, 1930.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter No. IOO5-IO of the 31st of March last, and previous correspondence concerning the question of having the Birch Island School painted, I have the honour to report that in order to give the exterior portion of this building two coats of pure whitelead and linseed oil it will cost approximately $150. As there is more surface to cover in the interior painting it will cost somewhere around $200, or a total of $350 to have both exterior and interior painted.\n\nIt was first thought that the interior should be finished with linseed oil and varnish, but as the class room and teacher's living quarters is a little on the dark side it has been decided that if painted in a bright colour would be more suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the painting required to the exterior and interior of the Birch Island Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of having this work done during the period the school is closed for the coming summer holidays, in order that there will be no interference with the classroom activity. In the meantime, however, you should inform the Department how you would recommend that the work be carried out. It is considered that it would be advisable to have the work done under the charge of a competent foreman, employing Indian labour as far as possible, you to make the purchase of all paint, oils, varnish and other materials required, and have proper time sheets kept of the labour employed. However, before issuing definite instructions, you should furnish your recommendation as to how you would advise that this work be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

McCauley, Provincial Sanitary Inspector, Scegont, to the effect that he has been instructed by the Department of Health at Toronto to make a sanitary survey of all schools in unorganized territory in his district, and that on June the 11th he make an inspection of the Birch Island Separate School, and he reports as follows:-\n\nIn regard to ventilation, he would suggest that I would secure glass frames to be used as a baffle against the direct draft when the lower sash is open. These frames are attached to the inside window sill and set at an oblique angle deflecting the draft over the heads of the children.\n\nHe also suggests that a small covered water tank be secured with a tap at the bottom to be used in place of the open pail, and that sanitary drinking cups be provided. This would be the means of lessening the possibility of spreading communicable disease, and he suggests that an effort be made to secure water on the school property, and that it will be necessary for him to make a return visit to this school after the summer holidays and would like to see that the necessary improvements have been attended to.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that some of the Inspector's suggestions, if carried out, will be costly to the Department, such as having a well drilled on the property.

It is considered that a cooler of approximately 5 or 6 gallon capacity, with tap, would be satisfactory. You may also arrange for the purchase and delivery of individual enamel mugs for the pupils' use. After you have made the above purchases, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nShould the Sanitary Inspector, on his return visit, communicate with you further regarding the requirements at this school, you should forward his letter to the Department for the necessary action.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

J. Lewis,\nIndian Land Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report having made a return visit to the Birch Island school on Oct. 6th and was very pleased to find that the Department had granted your request for a covered water tank. I also noticed that eighteen granite cups had been supplied. I think this must have been a mistake on the part of your Department, as it was paper sanitary drinking cups I referred to in my request.\n\nWhen making an inspection of the outside latrines, I found no improvements had been made since my last visit. These two toilets are in very bad condition and require to have a bank of earth around the outside. They are some eight or ten inches above the ground and sitting on blocks.\n\nI expect to make a return visit to this school some time before winter and hope to find that the necessary improvements have been made by that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial Sanitary Inspector.\nManitowaning, October 26th, 1931.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter No. I9-13-5 of the IIth of July last, to the effect that should the Sanitary Inspector from Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., on his return visit to Birch Island School, communicate with me further regarding the requirements at this school, I should forward his letter to the Department for the necessary action, I have the honour to enclose herewith a further communication which I received from the Sanitary Inspector with respect to the granite cups which have been supplied and the condition of the toilets.\n\nThese building are of wooden structures and are raised somewhat above the ground, but are equipped with boxes which are cleaned almost every month during the summer, and whenever possible during winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Provincial Sanitary Inspector reporting on his recent visit to the Birch Island Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the supplying of individual drinking cups, I have to say that this Department does not supply sanitary paper drinking cups. We usually supply granite-ware drinking cups, which has been done in the case of this school.\n\nRegarding the outside toilets, it is noted the Inspector recommends that they be banked up with earth around the outside, as they are from eight to ten inches above the ground and sitting on blocks. I have to request that you will arrange to have these closets banked this Fall, as recommended by the Inspector. It should not cost very much to have this work done. Please give this matter your prompt attention. You can, no doubt, obtain the services of a competent Indian to bank the toilets. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nI might add that if the boxes in the toilets require to be cleaned out you should also have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

B. McCauley, Provincial Sanitary Inspector, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., having made an inspection at the above school, and has advised me that the following improvements will have to be made in order that this school may comply with the Regulations:\n\nIn securing new blinds it will be found that cream will be more satisfactory than green blinds, which the class room is equipped with at present. The yellow shed more mellow light.\n\nA new standard system of ventilation is recommended for rural schools and a blue print is being issued by the Department of Health. I am enclosing a copy of this and also instructions in regard to installation and operation furnished by the Inspector. He states that these are sent to all schools in Ontario, and he would be pleased if the Department could have this system installed at their earliest convenience. He advises that little expense is involved in the installation and that it will be found a great improvement in the ventilation.\n\nWith regard to the above I would advise the Department that all the windows in the classroom are equipped with green shades which are in fairly good condition, and the classroom system of ventilation is from lowering the upper portion of the windows which has proved quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that the present window blinds are in fairly good condition and that the classroom can be ventilated by lowering the upper portion of the windows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

These cracks let a lot of cold in. It was thought by putting some weather stripping over these openings it would assist in keeping the cold out to some extent.\n\nThe sheets that were supplied in the fall of 1934 are almost worn out, and should be replaced by a new pair, also two pillow cases should be supplied.\n\nFive new electric light bulbs should be supplied for use in the classroom and all the bulbs which have been in use during the past are of no further use.\n\nAll the articles asked for on this requisition should be supplied as they are required by the teacher in the classroom and her living quarters.\n\nThe cost of the fire shovel, storm felt, sheets, pillow cases, thread, needles and bulbs will amount to approx. $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 22, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th instant, you may arrange for the purchase of a fire shovel, storm felt, sheets, pillow cases, thread, needles and electric light bulbs required for the Birch Island Indian Day School. It is noted that the cost of these will be approximately $10.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowanings,\nOnt.\nManitowaning, November 28th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMiss Mary Clarke, teacher at the Birch Island Indian School, has made enquiry as to whether the Department allow any grant for a Christmas Concert. She states that if she could get about five dollars to help pay for crepe paper and costumes etc she would be very pleased as she is putting a concert on to get funds for the Girl Guides.\n\nYesterday I visited Birch Island School and had an interview with Miss Clarke concerning this matter. She advised me that as there is very little entertainment for the children at Birch Island during Christmas season she tries to have a concert in the classroom each year for the pupils attending school, but finds it difficult to secure material for decoration, costumes, etc, and the parents cannot provide the same.\n\nIn order that Miss Clarke may make a success of the proposed Entertainment I would most respectfully recommend that the Department allow her a small grant, not exceeding $5.00, to enable her to provide material for costumes etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 3, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your 140-A-5 of the 28th ultimo, you may authorize Miss Clarke to expend an amount not exceeding $5.00 in obtaining supplies required for the Girl Guides at the Birch Island Indian Day School in order to assist them in putting on a concert at Christmas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

There is outcropping of granite not a great distance away, but at the school house it appears to be all limestone, with possibly five or six feet of earth to dig, to the rock.\n\nI have found a man at Little Current who will move his machine over and put down the well for $2.00 per foot.

Johnston, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER RECEIVED FROM MISS E. L. FORTIN, TEACHER, BIRCH ISLAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, WHITEFISH FALLS, DATED SEPT. 5, 1939.\n\n- Original on No. 19-13-4 -\n\nI herewith beg to inform you that the articles, viz., (water cooler, softball and bat) and sewing machine, which you said you would forward upon receiving a note from me at the opening of the school, are anxiously awaited.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nDear Miss Fortin:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding the sewing machine it is possible that this might be supplied this year. On reviewing your annual report, however, it is noted that you state the freight address of the school is Little Current. Is this correct? If not please let me know the freight address to which the sewing machine might be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss E.L. Fortin,\nTeacher,\nBirch Island Indian Day School,\nWhitefish Falls, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI wish to make a report on Birch Island School. The chimney is in bad shape and should be re-built down to the roof. It appears to have been poorly built or at least a poor grade of mortar used although inside where it was not exposed to the weather seems to be alright. In its present condition it is quite dangerous as there is a cement slab on top which I believe was not water proof and has admitted water causing the mortar to crumble. It should also be extended 18\" higher so as to be little higher than peak of roof. It is impossible to determine the exact number of new brick required, but I would estimate it at five hundred to replace the spoiled ones, and make the 18\" extension. It will also need three or four new flue tile. It is a double flue chimney.\n\nHarper Brothers of Little Current have offered to furnish all material and labour to repair for sixty dollars, which I think is very reasonable, as they do excellent work.\n\nThe cellar drain which has been built with ordinary rock needs overhauling, as the basement floods every spring, the teacher informs me. I would recommend using tile instead of rock.\n\nHarper Brothers have offered to furnish the sixty feet of tile necessary and have it installed by Indian labour for fifteen dollars. They could oversee this job while building the chimney, if granted.\n\nWe should also have one bunch of shingles, to repair the wood-shed roof, which is leaking badly in a few places. This will cost about $25 for material and labour.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Fontin, has offered to paint the living quarters herself over week ends, if she could have the paint furnished, which will cost about $3.00. The rooms have become quite dull and gloomy and I would recommend the paint be furnished for her.\n\nThe teacher has also asked for about $3.00 worth of dust pans for the class room.\n\nWe had to drill seventy feet at the Birch Island School, before obtaining water, but were successful in getting a plentiful supply of apparently good water. This will cost approximately sixty dollars more than I estimated, as I expected we would not have to go more than fifty feet deep.\n\nIf funds are available, I would advise having the chimney and drain attended to immediately, as from what I have heard it is difficult to get a good job.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nOctober 4, 1939\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant the Department approves the following expenditures in connection with the Birch Island Indian day school:\n\n1. An amount of $60.00 for material and labour in repairing the chimney.\n\n2. An expenditure of $15.00 for material and labour required in repairing the drain.\n\n3. An expenditure of $2.00 for material and labour in repairing the wood shed roof.\n\n4. An expenditure of $8.00 in the purchase of paint for interior painting which will be done by the teacher without charge.\n\n5. Purchase of dustbane at a cost not exceeding $3.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. R.

It will be noted that the cost has been exceeded by $50.00 which was unavoidable as it was necessary to drill to a depth of 71 feet to obtain water, instead of 50 feet as was thought it could be obtained. This also necessitated the purchase of more pump rod than was expected.\n\nIn beginning the well, it was necessary to dig about 3 feet to the rock and put in a piece of casing and cement it in, to keep surface water out. Mr. Morphet has made a charge of $6.00 for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: G.
