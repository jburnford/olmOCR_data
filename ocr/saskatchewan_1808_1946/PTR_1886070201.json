It is evident that he is still the \"old\" O'Connell to the English populace, and that his presence is as magnetic as ever.\n\nWe trust that no action of the constant trouble taking place from the closing of the old trails, that the Government will take some steps in the matter. Many families make a living by clearing old trails, and this causes endless inconvenience to those cases ending in blows. The trail on Wednesday last is one of the few instances where the participants into the affair are known, and as the magistrates appear not to have done anything in the matter will be settled at the next High Court one way or another.\n\nThe news with regard to the progress of the Hudson's Bay post has of late been of a most favorable character, and there seems reason to hope, notwithstanding the long delay, that the end in view will yet be accomplished. We have always been devoutly hoped that such will prove to be the case. Too much importance should not, however, be attached to the fact that the cargo of the Hudson's Bay vessel Prince of Wales, York Factory, as such a successful expedition, has been delayed upon prior to Mr. Sutherland's departure for England.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun says: The newspapers in the east are busily engaged discussing the result of the new frequencies exchanged and the North West election, and the close kept up for some time, but on the whole leading thereof. That the election was a success of appeal was the practical issue and that the electors wished to return upon the Conservative opposition to the place where the firmest vote was almost blotted out is not denied. In but one county in the province blanket, presumably belonging to the entire Conservative ticket, the wounded Indian. One night while Mr. Gaudry was camping near the town two of his horses were to the result of the first Dominion election off. Just before retiring for the evening Mr. Gaudry heard a noise outside his tent and went out to investigate, when he came upon two Indians standing about a fire. One of them was the only Conservative in sight, Mr. Gaudry connected with the contest to Gaudry's son fired two shots at each of the Indians, thought they had killed them. Mr. Gaudry further proved that the Indians were not dead, but lost in the darkness, Dominion will no longer follow party. At Glaichen a number of lodges without reason. In other respects belonging to Big Bear are compared, the result is a deplorable one. We do not now discuss the question of Nova Scotia, which is now being very properly discussed. The streets are filled with excitement, the Government is doing all it can to suppress the movement. We say, therefore, that it cannot possibly be realized. Our federation cannot be repealed. For good or for ill the union has taken place and must result in a new make. It is not true that all that we would desire the full possibilities of a large extent in that direction, that is the case of every country where it exists, and that exists in Canada. We must therefore be content to neutralize the effects of the other instead of having regard merely to the national side of things.\n\nThere seems reason to suspect the same movement on the part of some of our citizens in regard to the Indians, and although we have not heard any official account of their movements, we may have seen such a state of affairs as might have been expected. We have seen nothing with reference to their actions to the west of us. But should these come to prove incorrect, if we judge the correctness of these in our own minds. Of course a great deal of it may be due to the recent unsettled state since the last rebellion, but when we see them thus so greatly increased, it is impossible to believe, and at all events it is impossible to believe that twenty tepees with men possessing and representing from one place to the other all night of the night, were merely tents for shelter. It is evident to the eye that they are in the habit, previous to the last outbreak, of getting to their places of abode during dark, we cannot help thinking that there is something of a serious nature at the bottom of it, and should our suspicions prove correct, though we do not wish to create alarm, yet it is the duty of everyone to be on the alert and prepared to meet any emergency that may arise by the rising of these Indians.\n\nWe take the following from the Medicine Hat Times: On the 15th June the Indians in the Cypress Hills, charged at the house of Mr. Ritchie and demanded a band of American Indians amongst a large number from their quarters. On proceeding to the Indians' encampment the corporal ordered the Indians to leave their business in the territory, and the Indians received a shower of bullets, which, fortunately, fell short of their mark. Ritchie then commenced his march for the fort, and some Indians discharged a volley of bullets at him, wounding a corporal and wounded several others. We are informed that the Indians were dispersed by a volley of bullets from the fort.\n\nIn order to enable parties to build cheaply I will sell building material at the following low rates for cash, v.v.s.\n\nNails, $6.50 per keg.\n\nHair, 250 per bale.\n\nTar Paper, $6.25 per 100 lbs.\n\nBarbed Wire, $11.\n\nNOTE\u2014Special figures to contractors.\n\nT.J.

It seems to us more than incorrect to say that the practicability of the Hudson's Bay route has not been tested. The Government itself has stated that the Government's inquiry into the subject points the other way.\n\nThe Government's committee has been established to the entire satisfaction of all who have really interested themselves in the matter. It has been constituted, in fact, by the experience of Hudson's Bay Company and others of almost every description, the last two months past. There is every reason to believe that of the two routes, the Hudson's Bay is better and more suitable than the Lake route. There were always those to be found who would dispute the practicability of the latter until it had been tested by actual experience. The evidence collected by Lieut. Gordon in the Albert district was sufficient to prove another route, as any one candidly reading his report to the Government and considering the circumstances must acknowledge.\n\nThere is no doubt that the land through which the proposed railway will pass is not highly productive agriculturally. A great deal of it is a first-class farming and grazing country. The Government's committee will have to depend for its success upon the magnificent stretch of prairie country both north and south of the international boundary, whose products it will carry to the British market. The wheat of almost the whole Canadian-American west will pass over it.\n\nThe best advice which the Government could give the company is necessarily to be selected along the exposed line. Over 12,000 acres of the land which they can acquire in the Northwest will become the property of the company on the completion of each and every mile of road. If, therefore, the company should choose to make a financial expenditure, they need not worry about the future; we may well trust that the future of the Canadian railway enterprise.\n\nWith the exception of the Manitoba government, the Government's statement regarding the Hudson's Bay route is practically demonstrated in their offer to guarantee four and a half millions of the company's capital. The \"doubts\" of the irresponsible and utterly uninformed Canadian Gazette appear altogether groundless.\n\nNo doubt a Hudson's Bay Railway prospectus has been issued, as also beyond prospectus. These will correspond with what \"dearly\" deserves sympathy, but it will be for a reason very different from that immediately by the Gazette. It will be because they have been forced to regret their confidence in the undertaking. The Hudson's Bay route will shortly be abandoned by the company, notwithstanding the Gazette's terrible, if bitter opposition to it.\n\nROUGH ON MORMONS.\n\nThe Utah bill is amended by the house judiciary committee, in some respects strengthening it when referred to the senate. Among the noticeable amendments of the new measure are the abolition of the federal charter of the Mormon church and its dissolution and the amendment of the incorporation of the church so as to make it subject to the amendment of the territorial militia laws and the provisions uprating the Mormon legislative system and equalizing the status of religious organizations.\n\nThe annulment of the charters of the Mormon church and immigration society makes away with a substantial part of the political system and other proposals destroy the power of the Mormon to reduce the church and influence the general elections by the territorial offices with Mormon churchmen.\n\nTo prevent this, Gov. Murray vetoed the bill, saying that the church cannot maintain this organization, and that is by no means the least good act that the church has done for the advancement of civilization when he was in office. The placing of the Mormon church on an equality with other religious organizations tends to the trend of prosperity, a terrible threat to the hierarchy, which may be recognized with the bill goes into effect. The church will wind up this Mormon organization by sweeping legislation within counties and cities. This is a cruel thing. The bill is severe, but in the main it is in the right direction. Religion must be protected from the encroachments of a mongering hierarchy, based upon local laws and local customs, puts in the religious organization the same rights as the democratic party.\n\nThe system must be slain. \u2014 St. Paul Pioneer Press.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nTo promote economy the French Government has established savings banks in connection with the post offices.
