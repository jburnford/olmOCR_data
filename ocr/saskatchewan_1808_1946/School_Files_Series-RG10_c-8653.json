Father Chamberland, Principal of that institution and which I have approved. These are as follows:\n\n(1) Nancy-Jane Balfour,\nNorway House Band #531.\n\n(2) Elisabeth Collon,\nNorway House Band #676.\n\n(3) Joe Allan Harper,\nIsland Lake Band #244.\n\n(4) Henry Lawrench Miswagan,\nNorway House Band #641.\n\nUpon reference to our Agency records I find that the parents of the first two children named are listed as adherents of the United Church of Canada. Father Chamberland tells me that these children were admitted to his faith and to the school after repeated requests from the parents. The third named child resides at Island Lake and I am unfamiliar with the circumstances attending the child's conversion. The parents of the last named are listed as Roman Catholic.\nThe aforesaid is for your information and approval please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Minnis,\nSupt. of Indian Agency.\n\nJDM/MWS\nEncs.

Your File A-A (123)\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department approves the admission of Joe Allan Harper and Henry Lawrence Miswagan to the above school.\n\nWe have noted your remarks regarding Nancy-Jane Balfour and Elisabeth Collon. You should obtain a written statement from Father Chamberland with regard to his reasons for submitting applications for their admission to the Cross Lake School, in view of your statement that the Agency records have them listed as adherents of the United Church of Canada.\n\nIf the parents have joined the Catholic Church, the date of their admission to that Church should be stated. You should also point out to Father Chamberland that in the case of children whose religious affiliations are doubtful, all the facts should be placed before the Department through your office before such children are admitted to the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nI feel certain that he will co-operate with us in the manner just mentioned, as it has been a long standing rule with the Department that the procedure outlined in the preceding paragraph must be followed.\n\nAs one copy of the application forms is all that is required by us, the duplicates are being returned for your file.\n\nBernard F.

Res. School of Elizabeth Colon and Nancy Jane Balfour. I am glad to explain these cases.\n\nRe: Elizabeth Colon\n\nThe child was admitted into our Residential School on account of the persisting wish of her parents to have her Catholic and educated in our school. She had been attending our day-school for three years. I can say emphatically that in no way whatsoever were her parents or herself solicited by any one of the school staff in this regard. On the contrary, I had refused to take her in the Res.School for two years before. This last fall, as her parents were insisting again, I thought it was fair to grant their demand. The child has been admitted into the Church and is now R.Catholic according to the wishes of the parents.\n\nRe: Nancy Jane Balfour\n\nThe same statement applies to Nancy Jane Balfour. I had delayed the admission of this child to have more certitude about the parents' real intentions. As themselves persisted and as the mother had freely decided a year ago to join the R.C.Church, I did not hesitate to admit this girl into the Church and into the Res.School.\n\nI hope these informations will be satisfactory,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert Chamberland, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you are aware, all United Church children now have to be sent to Portage or Brandon Residential Schools. They have been agitating strongly for the re-erection of the Norway House Residential School and such instances as this will only make our position here more difficult.\n\nHow far do these children live from the schools now existing?

The parents of Nancy Jane Balfour are resident in this settlement only about half the year, being engaged in fishing and trapping activities in areas remote from Norway House. At the moment of writing, the parents of Elizabeth Colon are in winnipegosis, Man., where they have been most of the winter, I am informed, and, as the father and mother work at various fish-camps around Lake winnipegosis, it would be most difficult for them to take the child along.\n\nI have discussed the matter of admissions to residential school with both Father Chamberland at Jack River and Father Trudeau at Cross Lake, especially where children of other faiths are concerned, and I do not anticipate any re-occurrence of a situation such as we are now dealing with. Both have agreed to submit applications for admission to Department through this office before admitting the child or children.\n\nMr. Neary points out (in his letter of Jan. 13th to me) that the above procedure has been a long-standing rule of the Department. However, as this procedure was not followed by Father Chamberland in the case under discussion, (applications being received by the writer late in December, while children were admitted at opening of term) it might be helpful if Department were to circularize principals of the\n\n(over please)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nResidential Schools to this effect, particularly just prior to opening of the Fall term. In fact, the time and correspondence devoted to the case under discussion could all have been avoided had the Principal adhered to the rule. I feel that if, in future, this procedure is not followed, then the explanation should be demanded of the Principal involved, and not the Indian Superintendent.\n\nI trust that the reasons outlined for the presence of the m/n children in Residential School instead of Day School are considered sufficient, and I am sure that reasonable cooperation between Residential School Principals and this office will obviate the necessity of explaining such instances as this in the future.\n\nJ.D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMemorandum\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nJack River Indian School\n\nThis institution has become a significant outpost of the Cross Lake Residential School and its existence is used to support a demand for replacing the United Church Indian Residential School at Norway House. The late Mr. Superintendent Goodman intended to review the necessity of providing residential facilities for a number of the children who have been admitted as boarders. He maintained that the previous Superintendent had been unnecessarily generous in his recommendations for admission. As the Department is now encouraging the day division organization in residential schools, Mr. Superintendent Minnis might be requested to undertake a study of the situation.\n\nI get the impression that the teaching staff is better than that of the parent institution at Cross Lake, and I suggest an inquiry whether this condition will continue. It seems to me that the parent institution ought to be better staffed.\n\nThe scattering of pupils through the grades suggests that some transfers of pupils might be made to the parent institution thus reducing the number of grades taught and releasing a much needed teacher for duty elsewhere. Mr. Inspector Moffat stresses the fact that the classroom...\nis congested and lacks good lighting and ventilation.\n\nIt is notable that there has been considerable correspondence on file 577-10 regarding admission of Norway House children to a residential school which they formerly attended as day pupils. There is a letter on file 577-10 from Mr. Superintendent Minnis in which he suggests that residential school Principals be requested to adhere more strictly to the Department's wishes in the matter of admission procedure.\n\nG.A.F.

A. Chamberland, O.M.I., Principal of the Hawk River Section of the school, a copy of which is enclosed for your information.\n\nIn view of the cooperative attitude evinced by Father Chamberland in his explanation of the admissions of these children to his school, I am pleased to enclose approved applications covering these children.\n\nApplication of Muriel Sinclair to Cross Lake Res. school has not yet been received from Father Trudeau. This application was delayed awaiting medical examination, and it is possible that same will arrive in first mail after break-up.\n\nEncl. (3)\n\nJ.D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMr J.D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Minnis:\n\nI acknowledge yours of April 5th about the Applications for Admission to Residential School of Marion Menow and Emily Menow. (File 123/25-2-577)\n\nI regret not to have followed the procedure you wanted me to follow. I did not understand you when the other cases were talked about. For the present Admissions it would have been very convenient to submit them to you and I would have done so with pleasure if I had realized it was your desire.\n\nIn the past, I have usually sent the Applications to the Principal of Cross Lake School. I have no doubt that it has been the ruling of the Department to have the Applications submitted to the Superintendent before admitting a child to a Residential School, and I understand it is more regular. The fact is that it was not frequently done and I don't remember that we have been requested to do so. I have looked over the past correspondence I had with the Department about this subject and I have found no mention of this ruling. I state this to have you understand why I did not realize just what you meant.\n\nFor future Applications, I can assure you that I will do my best to comply with the requirements of the Department in this matter. However, I can foresee cases where this way of doing will be very embarrassing if not completely impossible. Parents very often decide to put their children in the school just when they are about to leave for their camps or in such circumstances. The greatest difficulty arises from the medical examination. Quite often we have to wait quite awhile before the children are examined; the doctor or the technician are away, the weather is not permitting etc ... It is not so simple as one might think. Practically the children must be in the school. In any case, I would like you or the other officers of the Department to feel free to give your approval or refusal even if already the child is in the school. We do so at our own risks.\nRe: Marion Menow\n\nShe is an illegitimate child, adopted by her grandparents: Mr & Mrs J Charles Menow. Her mother is married with David Ross of Grand Rapids. The reasons given by them when they asked to put her in school was their old age (both are 70 and over), the actual state of health of J. Charles. Under such conditions they felt that they could not keep this child properly.\n\nRe: Emily Menow\n\nTwice this winter I have been asked by Johnnie Menow, her grand-father and guardian, to take this girl in our school. I could not give him a favorable answer until a few children from Cross Lake School would be discharged.\n\nShe was received in the Catholic Church at her entry in the school. Her admission was not the reason but the occasion to join the Church. It had been their intention to have her Catholic prior to their demand to put her in a Residential School. But she had to be instructed first. I don't think that it is surprising as all the Menows at the exception of a few, are Catholics and among these most of them will eventually join the Catholic Church.\n\nThis child is ten years old and had just a few days of school. Johnnie and his family, under ordinary circumstances, are away from the reserve the greatest part of the year: from October to January and from March to the middle of May on his trap line, from June to August at the Landing for fishing.\n\nAgain I apologize to have given you this trouble. I hope that I have answered to all you wanted to know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) A.

Mission,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Father Chamberland:\n\nI am in receipt of applications for admission to Residential School in respect of Marion Menow and Emily Menow (Dixon), as enclosed with quarterly return of St. Joseph's Residential School, Cross Lake.\n\nI note that these application forms are dated, respectively, Feb.6/50, and Feb.28/50; and that Doctor's examination of the children took place Feb.28/50.\n\nIn correspondence with Education Division of this Department recently, I was advised that it has been a long-standing rule of Department that applications such as these should be submitted to the Superintendent of the Agency, and thence to Department, before the children are admitted to the school. In fact, at the time we discussed the matter of two previous admissions which required correspondence with Department, I felt that you would follow that procedure in future.\n\nConcerning the two outlined in first paragraph\u2014\nI would like your advice as to the circumstances under which Marion Menow was admitted to the school. This child is of your faith, but could she not attend Day School?\n\nOur records show that Emily Menow (child of Jemima Dixon) is of the Anglican faith. Please let me know when she became an adherent of your Church, and also why she is a boarder instead of attending Day School.\n\nThe reason for which these applications were not\n\n(over, please.)\nsubmitted prior to admission of the children to School is also required.\n\nFrankly, I can see no reason why the applications cannot be submitted to this office before the children are admitted, except in cases of orphans left without care or of children returned from hospital or sanitarium, and it is not my intention to recommend admission to Residential School unless applications are submitted prior to the children entering the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Education Division,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPlease find attached quarterly return of Cross Lake Indian Residential School for quarter ending March 31, 1950. Statement of admissions and discharges for this period is also attached, plus letter (copy) sent Father Chamberland concerning admission of two children shown on report. No application for admission of Muriel Sinclair was received in this office, and the matter will be discussed with Father Trudeau at Cross Lake in the near future.\n\nApplications for admission referred to in copy of letter sent Father Chamberland are being held pending his reply, and have not been recommended by the undersigned. Quarterly return is submitted in the meantime as a matter of convenience to Department at year end while question of admissions is being taken up with the Principals concerned.\n\nJ.D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent agency.\n\nEnc.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT CROSS LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1950\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Band | State of Education |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------|--------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |      |                    |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                   |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Trudeau that application for admission of Muriel Sinclair to the institution is being held pending the doctor's examination.\n\nFather Trudeau further advised me that this procedure is almost always followed at Cross Lake. The child is admitted almost invariably prior to both the doctor's examination and the superintendent's approval of admission application. About the only exceptions to this procedure occurs when the doctor is able to examine children during the summer on the various reserves, when it is known definitely that these children will enter residential school in September.\n\nIn view of the difficulties inherent in the transportation field in this part of the country, it would seem that, in the past at least, departmental regulations concerning applications for admission to Cross Lake school have been relaxed somewhat, for good reason, as otherwise, a long period of time might elapse before a child's admission to school could be approved.\n\nI would appreciate your views on the permissibility of this relaxed procedure insofar as this school is concerned.\n\nJ.D.

Superintendent Gowans advises that these children are United Church faith. Therefore, he has not signed the forms. I have advised all Superintendents not to sign an admission form unless they are certain of the child's religious denomination.\n\nI am having Mr. Waite visit Gods Lake on the next regular flight in order to investigate the above mentioned cases. If these children are as Mr. Gowans states they should be returned to their homes at once.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs Branch, Winnipeg.\n\nRegarding the application for the admission of the following pupils to the Cross Lake R.C. School, the following report is submitted:\n\nMary Ann Okimaw\nLouis Watt\nVictoria Osborne\nJob Ross\nAnanias Ross\n\nMary Ann Okimaw. The parents of this child are on their trap-line in the vicinity of God's River. There is no actual record of the location of their camp and it would be a useless trip to try and find them. They may return to the Mine at Christmas.\n\nMr. Gibson, the United Church Minister, was interviewed, and he stated that the father, Henry Okimaw is Protestant, married into a Roman Catholic family. The children would be educated in a Roman Catholic School. This statement was corroborated by Rev. Fr. Rivard.\n\nLouis Watt. This family is on their trapline located between God's Lake and Norway House. Will not return to God's Lake until open water, sometime in June.\n\nRev. H.Gibson claims Watt the father of the above boy married a Roman Catholic woman. He made application for one girl to be admitted to Brandon Residential School two years ago, but as nothing further was heard concerning the application, the girl and her sisters were admitted to Cross Lake last year and the family, with the exception of the male parent, is now Roman Catholic. This statement was also corroborated by Rev. Fr. Rivard.\n\nVictoria Osborne. The family is trapping at Grassi Narrows. If trapping is good, the family will not return until June or open water. If trapping is poor, then the family will return for the fishing after Christmas.\n\nRev. Gibson, in this case claims that the man is United Church married into a Roman Catholic family, and the wife and family are Roman Catholic. Statement corroborated by Rev. Fr. Rivard.\n\nJob and Ananias Ross. Father Simon Ross. In this case the father is United Church and the woman believed to be Roman Catholic. Rev. H.Gibson claims this is a mixed family, but the two above noted boys were baptised in the Roman Catholic Church and should attend the Roman Catholic School. This case also was corroborated by Rev. Fr. Rivard. The Ross camp is 20 miles west of Grassi Narrows near Norway House. This family may return to the reserve for Christmas. Again, this depends on the trapping; they did not return to the reserve last year until open water.\n\nMr. Gibson claims he has a close watch on the pupils going to Cross Lake School and would report if there was any injustice. Fr. Rivard claims that there are enough Roman Catholic families on the reserve without encroaching on other preserves.\n\nR.C.\n\nI am reasonably satisfied that the children at Cross Lake School from God's Lake Reserve were baptised in that faith. I feel that the Superintendent has obtained his information from the Family Record, which would show religion of the parents. In most cases the father collects the treaty and the record would show his religion, which in the cases above would be incorrect. There is a tendency on God's Lake Reserve among some of the Protestant family's to give one or two children to the Roman Catholic Church, and the Family Record to be correct should show the religion of every child.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Minnis,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nThe Department approves\nthe discharge of the following pupils from\nthe Cross Lake Indian Residential School:\n\n185\n0185\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nNorway House, Manitoba,\nMarch 15, 1951.\n\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Education Division,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI attach hereto applications for admission to Cross Lake Indian Residential School in respect to the following children:\n\nSarah Osborne - Born 5 Nov. 1936.\nJames Osborne - Born 9 Dec. 1939.\nMurray Osborne - Born 1942.\nJoseph Osborne - Born 15 July 1945.\n\nThese children are the sons and daughter of Thomas and Priscilla Osborne, No. 656 Norway House Band. The father has been confined to Sanatorium for the past three years, and the children have been at Norway House in care of their mother. About the end of January the attached applications were submitted to this office along with a note from the mother approving their adoption of the Roman Catholic faith and their entry to residential school. At that time, I advised Father Kerbin of the local R.C. Mission that I was not prepared to approve the applications until written consent had been received from their father. This has now been secured by the clergyman, and is attached.\n\nWhile waiting this approval from the father, I discussed the matter with Rev. K. McLeod of the local United Church Mission, as this family is shown in our records to be of that church affiliation. Rev. McLeod stated that the family has never shown any interest in church attendance, and that he would not protest their adoption of the R.C. faith nor their entry to Cross Lake School.\n\nSince the father entered sanatorium, their mother Priscilla has been leading an immoral life. She has had certainly one, and possibly two children fathered by other than her legal husband since his departure to Man. Last fall she appeared in court on charges of disturbance of the peace, found guilty and fined.\n\n(over, please)\nDept.: (c)\n\nIt was strongly suspected that she was indulging in considerable home-brewing and drinking, but evidence was insufficient to support such a charge. However, a young man found under the influence of liquor at her home received a three month sentence at the time.\n\nJoseph, Murray and James Osborne were in sporadic attendance at Rossville H.C. Day School this term. After repeated warnings given the mother, I was forced to suspend Family Allowance payments in respect of these children for reason of continued poor attendance, which action was taken in December of 1950.\n\nThis woman is employed at Norway House Hospital, and has also been receiving assistance under T.B.Rehab Vote on account of her husband's hospitalization. This aid has now been suspended. I have no doubt that some expediency on her part was concerned in the conversion of her children and their application to enter Residential School; However, I feel that the environment these children were exposed to at home was of the worst, and that they will be immeasurably better off at Residential School. I have since received a letter from the father in which he deplores the life he hears his wife is leading and evinces his satisfaction at their entry into the Residential School.\n\nWith the above facts in mind, I must overlook completely the childrens' hypothetical United Church affiliation, and unreservedly approve their applications for admission to Cross Lake R. C. Residential school as attached, in which action I trust you will concur.\n\nJ. D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent, Indian agency.\n\nEnclosure.\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nI, Thomas Osborne, of the Norway House Band of Cree Indians, at present in the Brandon Sanatorium for treatment, of my own free will and without any outside solicitation or influence, wish that my children\u2014\n\nSarah\nJimmie\nMurray\nJoseph\n\njoin the R.C.

D. Minnis,\nSuperintendent of Indian Agency\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Minnis:\n\nI received only today your letter of June the 30th regarding the admission of Titus Robinson to our Residential School.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the parents of Titus Robinson to put him in the school is that the father has a large family and on account of health conditions is having a hard time to provide for the needs of the whole family.\n\nMany times also the child had to miss school as the father would need him to help him on his trap line. Also when the father would be away with the canoe the child could not attempt to come to school. As the parents wanted to give him a better education to their boy and seeing they could not do so by keeping him home to attend only day school they decide to put him in the Residential School.\n\nThese are the reasons which made me accept the boy in our Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. E. Trudeau, O. M. I.\nPrincipal\nYour 577-10 (E6) of June 13th, 1952, Res Titus Robinson.\n\nWith reference to your letter as above noted, please find attached a copy of a letter received from Father Trudeau at Cross Lake explanatory to the reasons for admission of this boy to Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I trust you will find the Principal's reasons sufficient, and I can certainly vouch for the fact that it is extremely difficult for the children from this portion of the Reserve to attend the Day School regularly. They live across the bay from the Day School, are often unable to travel on account of weather conditions and as pointed out by Father Trudeau, when the family canoe is being used for other purposes, it is impossible for the child to get to Day School.\n\nI trust the reasons given will enable you to approve admission of this boy to Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nJ.

Question of this child's admission to Residential School was discussed by the writer with the boy's father, Thomas Muskego, and with the Principal of the School.\n\nMy reasons for approving this application are the nomadic existence led by this child's family and the distance he lives from any Roman Catholic Day School\u20142\u00bd miles across the water. For the short periods during which the family are in the settlement, school attendance is difficult. The father is a War Veteran and a good trapper, and is very anxious for his son to secure at least a little bit of education, which, under the family's circumstances, he can only secure through attendance at Residential School. The boy, now age 13, has only about a Grade 2 or 3 standing by reason of his broken schooling.\n\nAlthough I am reluctant to approving admission of children of his age, under ordinary circumstances, I feel that, in this case, if the boy is to receive any education at all, he should attend Residential School, and Department approval of his admission is requested.\n\nJ.

We have instructed Mr. Bunn to purchase the two teachers' desks, two teachers' chairs and the four visitors' chairs and arrange to have them forwarded to the school.\n\nBefore placing the order for the school desks and front and rear seats, I shall be pleased if you will state the necessity for the extra number asked for. In June, 1926, Mr. Bunn purchased and forwarded twelve double desks and two front and two rear seats, which would provide seating accommodation for 26 pupils. Please state why the fourteen double desks and four front and four rear seats asked for in your requisition are now required. When we have your report as to the necessity for this extra number of desks, consideration will then be given to authorizing the supplying of same, and Mr. Inspector Bunn will receive the necessary authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He has fixed his choice on one manufactured by Dor\u00e9 and Son of Laprairie, Que. The order sheets herein inclosed give a description of the machine. The price is $528.00 delivered at Winnipeg.\n\nThe L\u00e9gard Company of Quebec, Que. offered for sale a smaller thresher at the price of $548.00 delivered also at Winnipeg, but the machine was not as highly recommended by users as the other was.\n\nAs the transportation of the thresher will take quite a long time, it might be well to place the order as soon as possible.\n\nBINDER - FAN MILL -\nBought from the John Deere Plow Company, Winnipeg. Invoice to hand. Brother M\u00e9nard saw the Binder and found it to be light and easy to operate.\n\nHe forgot to order twine for the binder. Would the Department order the same for about 25 acres.\n\nPotato DIGGER -\nThe School needs a potato digger. About 1,000 bushels of potatoes are going to be sown this year. The digging up of the potato crop has always been done under great difficulties. It must be done inside of a couple of days, for there is almost continuous rain in the fall. In some cases the potatoes could not be left to dry on the field; they had to be taken to the house, spread on the floor to dry, and then carted to the root-house. This work occupied about two weeks. With a machine, the potatoes might be dug up on the morning of a clear day; they would dry up on the field in the afternoon and they might be picked up in the evening and be carted directly to the root-house.\n\nPer J.A.

Power 6 to 8 H.P.\n- **24\" x 30\" rear:** Capacity from 50 to 75 bushels an hour. Power 9 to 11 H.P.\n\n**OVERSHOT**\n\n- **22\" x 29\" rear:** Capacity from 50 to 65 bushels an hour. Power 8 to 10 H.P.\n- **21\" x 39\" rear:** Capacity from 45 to 60 bushels an hour. Power 9 to 11 H.P.\n\nWhen a straw blower is required add 1 H.P.\n\nNote: staffs may flow any specified quantity of grain that passers will that those crops will have full capacity.\n\nDescription:\n- **FRAME:** Made with two castings of a good lasting machine in the shape of arches twice as high and longer than usual with end trusses made by heavy drawn bars and bolts.\n- **CYLINDER:** Of well-proved type, cylinders are large and heavy, plated with iron well secured to the bar with brass rivets at its ends, fitted with four drums driven by pinions, etc., and so arranged that they work but once each revolution.\n- **TURBINITE:\"** Are heavy, well secured to the bars with brass rivets at their ends. They run on cast iron bearings, which can be easily removed when they become worn.\n- **CONVEYORS:** Nothing better; made of steel bars with 5\" grate plates fastened to them and driven by vanes, brass shafts and gears; where no chain or trash can prevent grain from going into the throat, etc., the conveyors will discharge grain evenly and quickly.\n- **STRAW DESK:** Well made. A long grate is right at back of desk. The grain flows from the desk through a chute lined with deep grooves so that the straw can block the free passage of the grain and thus be thrown to the side.\n- **EXTRACTION:** Two well turned coppers of 44\" x 12\", with cutts in the extreme ends, so that their diameter changes as the grain flows toward the extractors; this makes smooth running and less wear.\n- **SHEAVE:** Made of cast iron, crank placed in the middle. The throw is 5\" lifting, assureing steady operation of the whole systems even under heavy load without noise or vibration or loss of power by friction in the bearings.\n- **THRESHING RACK THAT OPERATES THE RALES:** Every bearing is mounted with shoulder, assuring a tight action of the racks to the bearings. Everything is so constructed that the racks work after years of service. Oiling once in every month will keep them always in good condition.\n- **THREE GRAIN PATH TO OPERATE THE RALES:** Three bearings of cast iron placed between the swings to support the shafts and carry the parts of the rake. Six bearings are used for the rake itself.\n\nThe \"DOR\u00c9\" also new way gains away in time:\n\"DORE\" overshot thresher with tallis elevator and bagger. This machine is the ideal thresher for 3 to 5 acres in spring. It will do satisfactory work in all kinds of grain.\n\nSkeleton view of the cylinder, concaves and straw rakes of our undershot threshers.\n\nNote the general appearance of this machine.\n\nNO CROSS BELTS:\nThe slats and deck grates operate separately and simultaneously eliminating the possibility of cross belts which increases the life of the machine.\n\nIn every shoe and deck are set purposeful openings to ensure proper separation of grain and to avoid the accumulation of dirt.\n\nSkeleton view of the cylinder, concaves and straw rakes of our overshot threshers.\n\nTwo deflector plates are used to retain and assure better separation.\n\nAdjustment of concaves is made to have lever. Note the way separation of grain by straw is made in an undershot thresher.\n\nEach row of teeth is separated by a gate through which, when grain falls at the rate of 50% of the grain is separated from the straw; the cylinder separating 85% of the grain than the straw deck. This 85% of grain will be more readily separated from straw than in an OVERSHOT thresher where all the grain and straw are thrown on the straw deck.\n\"Dore\" Overshot Thresher\n\nSkeleton view of the cylinder, concaves and straw rakes of our overshot threshers.\n\nNote how these are adjusted from outside of the machine and are held in place by a \"notched plate.\" This is a great grip and stay which will never rattle and it is also a great feature over other makes of threshers.\n\nSkeleton view of the cylinder, concaves and straw rakes of our undershot threshers.\n\nDon't lose your grain in the straw.\n\nHave your thresher equipped with Dore \"New Way\" Grain Saver.\n\n\"Dore\" Undershoot Thresher\n\nEach row of teeth is separated by a grate through which the grain falls. Each tooth pan of the grate is separated from the straw at the cylinder and only the grain thrown on the straw deck.

The grate is made of metal 18\" wide x 36\" long, according to size of the thresher, and placed in the bottom of the blower shell. Grain falling with the straw will go through the grate instead of falling into the blower fan as it does in the common blowers.\n\nThe straw is carried into the blower by a travelling web and this web on its course delivers the gathered grain on a spiral conveyor and this latter delivers it into the tailings elevator.\n\nLa gravure \u00e0 gauche montre l'arri\u00e8re de la grille et le manche de la machine et montre comment le grain est sauv\u00e9 de la paille.\n\nLa grille se compose d'une passe ou grille de 18\" de largeur x 36\" de longueur, soit 254 x 36 de long sur la largeur de la machine, et est plac\u00e9e dans le fond du souffleur. Le grain sortant de la passe avec la paille est d\u00e9vers\u00e9 par les ouvertures de la grille tandis que la paille est entra\u00een\u00e9e le souffleur par le haut. Le tailleur en bas de la grille en-dessous de la passe entra\u00eene le grain \u00e9conomiquement et le d\u00e9verse \u00e0 un spirale qui le d\u00e9verse dans le chapeau de l'agriculteur.\n\nSELF-FEEDER.\u2014Is one of the best attachments to a thresher; made of steel except the bearings.\n\nIt requires very little power; there are two governors, one controls the volume of straw, no choking can occur, the other controls the speed.\n\nTwo sets of trays, operated by bell crank, run on different speeds, feed the straw to the cylinder. No matter how badly the shaves are thrown on the carrier they will not plug the chute.\n\nFeatures of our self-feeder:\n\n1. Feeds fast and even under all conditions.\n2.

He asked that Messrs. E. Dore & Son supply the equipment, as it was most suitable. He compared prices with three other firms. This morning a letter went forward to Dore & Son, ordering a steel truck thresher with straw blower, grain bagger and tailing elevator belts, at a price of $525 complete, f. o. b. Winnipeg. An item of $1,000 is in our Main Estimates for the purpose of supplying agricultural implements for this school.

Ever since its foundation it has managed to clear a few acres of land each year, and it is now in a position to raise enough grain to feed a large number of fowls. It is felt that if the school could develop its poultry department according to modern methods, it could furnish a much needed addition to the bill of fare of its inmates.\n\nHe therefore asks the Department to procure for the Cross-Lake School the following equipment:\n\nFrom Ashdown's Catalogue 1929.\n(Winnipeg, Man.)\n\n1 No. 16 Buckeye Incubator Style \"E\" Capacity 110 eggs.\n1 No. 80 Blue Flame Colony Brooder, Capacity 350.\n3 Long Chick Feeders, 20 holes.\n1 Box (3 doz.)

STONE\n\nWith reference to your inquiry regarding the cattle at the Residential Schools in Manitoba I enclose, for your information, a report on the herd at each of the Residential Schools in that Province.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReports of Principals of Manitoba Residential Schools regarding action taken to prevent tuberculosis infection from milk.\n\nBIRTLE: We are milking 15 cows at the present time. We have them tested every year in the month of May. I have been Principal for four years and five months and during that time we have had no reactors. In the summer of 1936 I had all tested for Bang's disease and here also we found no reactors. We do not purchase any milk.\n\nBRANDON: A new herd of pure bred dual purpose Shorthorns was started in the fall of 1930. Every animal purchased was T. B. tested. In 1933 we received our accredited herd certificate and fortunately have retained it constantly ever since. The last annual test is dated May 18, 1937. We have 56 females in the herd, about 20 milking at one time. We also maintain annually the blood test for Bang's disease. We do not purchase any milk.\n\nCROSS LAKE: We have at present time seven milking cows. None of them was tested for bovine tuberculosis. They appear healthy and we have no signs of such disease amongst them. We are not purchasing milk and the school herd does not mix with any other animal from outside.\n\nELKHORN: The number of milking cows at the present time is 30. The herd is tested regularly by Government veterinarians from Brandon. The last occasion being the first week in November, 1937 when Mr. McConnell, who made the tests, pronounced the herd to be free from bovine T. B. Since November 1, 1936 it has not been necessary to purchase any milk from outside sources for use at this school. Should this at any time become necessary we should certainly secure it from T. B. free herds.\n\nFORT ALEXANDER: Our herd was tested last summer (1937) at which test one cow we had bought from Pine Falls was found to react and was killed the same day. The herd was re-tested last fall (1937) and found in good order. At present we have 14 milking cows 10 of which were purchased before the last test. We do not need to buy any milk.\n\nNORWAY HOUSE: We have eleven milking cows. To my knowledge they have never been tested for bovine tuberculosis. Because they have not been tested and therefore we cannot be sure they are free from disease we scald all the milk and cream we use, both for table use and butter. We do not purchase milk from any other source.\n\nPINE CREEK: We have altogether 16 milking cows, 9 of which are giving milk at present. Our cows are tested regularly twice a year by Dr. Caldwell, from Dauphin, Manitoba. The last test, made in November 1937, proved to be satisfactory. We do not purchase any milk. Our cows supply all the milk necessary.\n\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE: Have a herd of registered Jersey cows from fully accredited herds. They are tested annually. The last test was last summer and no reactors. There are 17 cows in the herd. We are situated in a T. B. free area.\n\nSANDY BAY: At the present time we are milking 10 cows. They have never been tested for T. B. and I cannot say if they are free or not from T. B. So far I have never bought milk to be used in the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Undoubtedly there will be difficulties to establish them, but at any rate they should be undertaken, if we want to assure to our Indians a living.\n\nOn the land owned by the Res. school, there are some creeks.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM NO. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? March 17th\n\n2. At what time of day? In the morning\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? 17 March\n\nThe Nurse of the school saw that the girl was looking sick and put her to bed at the infirmary.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? Rest in bed and abundant food\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? Cod liver oil\n\n6. When was the doctor called? The girl was not sick enough to call the Doctor who could not have come at this time of the year\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport?\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school? The girl was put in a private ward and the Nurse of the school attended to her very conscientiously every day\n\n9. Add any other useful information here.\n\nThe girl started to be sick when the communications with the outside were interrupted. When the Doctor from Norway House came to Gross Lake on the 24th of May he thought it was useless to send the girl to the hospital as she was already too sick.\n\nG.E. Trudeau, Principal\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Marguerite-Jane Bee from March 17th 1942 to June 29th 1942.

Ind. Child - Cross Lake, Man.\nDeath of - by Drowning.\n\n1. On Aug. 10th 1942 I was informed by Dr. R.S.G. Corrigan of Norway House, that he had received a report from Rev. Fr. G.H. Trudeau, OMJ of Cross Lake, that one William Miller, and Treaty Indian student of St. Joseph R.C. School at Cross Lake, had drowned at Cross Lake the day previously (Sun.Aug.9th.) Dr. CORRIGAN who is a Coroner, informed me that he had satisfied himself that death was accidental, that an inquest was unnecessary, that he had signed the necessary papers and permitted burial of the body.\n\n2. In view of the fact that the writer hereof, was preoccupied with other matters (Treaty escort), and it was obvious from the Doctor's remarks that there would be no pressing need for police investigation, the matter was held over pending our next patrol to Cross Lake, which was anticipated to be the end of August. This patrol however, did not materialize till Sept 11th-13th.\n\nFirst.\n\n3. On 12-9-42 whilst in Cross Lake the matter was investigated. It appears that William MILLER, Treaty Indian child aged nine years, attending St. Joseph's Residential School at Cross Lake, went bathing too soon after eating his dinner, and was drowned, at approximately 12.45 p.m. on Sun.Aug.8th. The body was recovered at 1.15 p.m. and artificial respiration was applied for some two and a half hours by competent members of the school staff, without result.\n\n4. The following statements were taken. There were two other witnesses from whom I should have taken statements but they were not available. These were Stanley HAMILTON, Tr. Ind., and Michel SCATCH Tr. Ind., the latter a 16 year old boy, who was the first to arrive on the scene and went into the water to try to get out the MILLER Child, HAMILTON arriving a few moments later and also trying to recover the boy.\n\n5. Statement of Lydia MCKAY, Indian girl aged 16, of Cross Lake, Manitoba.\n\n\"On a Sunday in August, I think it was the ninth, I was picking berries and eating them, over at the Mission, with three other girls. We were near the water and I saw about four small boys swimming near the sawmill. One of them was William MILLER. I could see that William had got into deep water, and I saw him struggle and his head go down. None of the other small boys who were there were near William, they had stayed in shallow water. Us girls went down to the water, but William was too far out for us to reach him. So I ran up the hill from the water and saw a man passing and told him the boy was drowning. That was Stanley Hamilton.\"\n\n(Continued)\nRe: William MILLER Tyendinaga Lake, Man.\nDeath of - By Drowning.\n\n(Statement of Lydia McKay, cont.)\n\nHe went down and tried to get William out of the water. Before this though another big boy, Nicholas SCATCH had heard us calling for help and he came right there and tried to get William out but he could not do so. I did not go to the Mission, but one of the people had heard us calling and sent for the Father. I was still there when the men got William's body from the water. I do not know why he should drown, but I do know that he had got too far out into deep water, for such a small boy, and there was no one close to him.\"\n\nWitnessed.\n\n(sgd) 'Lydia McKay'\n\n(R.A.Kirk, Cpl., RCMP)\n\nStatement of Rev. Fr. G.E. Trudeau O.M.I. of St. Joseph's Mission, Cross Lake, Manitoba:\n\nOn Sunday August 9th about 12:45 p.m., an Indian woman informed me that a small boy was drowning near our sawmill. I went to the place by canoe, with Father DANIEL, Brother MENARD and others, and two other canoes came along. Approximately 1:15 p.m., the body of one William MILLER, aged approx. 9 years, a student at St. Joseph's School was recovered from the water by the searching group. Immediately artificial respiration was applied continuously for two hours and a half by myself and Sister Francoise Therese R.N., at the end of which time the child was adjudged dead by the sister. In my opinion the child's death was due to accidental drowning, possibly caused by swimming too soon after his dinner.\"\n\n(sgd) 'G.E. Trudeau O.M.I.'\n\nStatement of Sister Francoise Therese R.N., Nursing Sister of St. Joseph's School, Cross Lake, Manitoba:\n\nOn Sun., Aug. 9th at 12:45 p.m., Father Trudeau sent me a message requesting my presence as a boy had been drowned, and I went as requested. I was present about 1:15 p.m., when the body of William MILLER was found, was recovered from the lake. In company with Father Trudeau I applied artificial respiration to William Miller, which was applied for two hours and a half, long before which I knew that William Miller was dead and could not be recovered. In my opinion death was due solely to drowning caused by swimming too soon after his dinner.\"\n\n(sgd) Sr. Marie Francoise Therese R.N.\n\nWith regard to the last sentence of each of the two preceding statements, the students at the School begin their dinner about 11:30 a.m., finishing somewhat after 12 noon. The boy was drowned at 12:45. Father Trudeau informed me that Sister St. Maximin overheard some of the boys discussing swimming after dinner. She told them that they must not swim after dinner. It is not known however, if the MILLER lad was amongst those so warned.\n\nIn view of the contents of these statements this file will be considered concluded.\n\n(Signed) R.A.Kirk, Cpl.\n\nIndian Affairs.

After carefully going through the list and marking the different articles I would like to obtain, there are several in particular which I am most anxious to have and it is for this purpose that I now make the request that I be given the whole outfit and equipment belonging to the gasoline engine. The articles to which I allude are spoken of as follows: \"Stover Engine, 6 H. P., 1---Gold Shapely and Moor Engine 5\u00bd H. P., 1 assortment of pipe fittings. These are the articles which I am most keen to obtain, for during my deputation through the east I made several requests for these same articles but am not sure as to whether same will materialise. Consequently on seeing the list submitted I could see my chance of installing with the assistance of the above mentioned articles not only an electric light plant but also power for other purposes in connection with the institution. There is also an item of 64 desks, may I obtain 50 of these, for since the erection of the new school building I have had to content myself with the old fashioned desks and am naturally anxious to procure modern ones. Further the office equipment consisting of office\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\ntable, typewriter desk, one typewriter, revolving office chair, side table, gramophone and records, one magic lantern and slides.\n\nI therefore make these personal requests asking that it might be granted in addition to the list which I have submitted to the principal of the Elk Horn school.\n\nKindly accept my deepest thanks for the cheque received a short time ago for expenses to Ottawa. As I have yet received no definite information relating to our conversation I will write you later giving full details.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nELKHORN MAN JULY 9-18\n\nD C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENL INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nLISTS HAVE BEEN RECD FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS GOODS SHOULD BE SHIPPED AT ONCE WIRE INSTRUCTIONS RUSH MESSAGE IN MORNING\n\nW M GRAHAM\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, July 10th, 1913.\n\nW.

Archdeacon Mackay has also put in a request that they be sent back as they are short of pupils at this School and these children are Anglican.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSLM/M\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 7, 1918.\n\n6016-113\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the case of the two Persegius children who were placed in the Elkhorn Industrial School on December 14th last, and who, upon the closing of that school on the first of May last, were transferred to the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may inform the principal of the MacKay Boarding School that these two children may be placed in his school as they are anglican and their father is anxious to have them near him. Archdeacon MacKay can make the necessary arrangements to have them taken from Brandon to his school and the Department will pay the cost incurred upon receipt therefore, of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate. He should await an opportunity to have these children accompanied to the school by some one who may be travelling between these two points, and any expenditure incurred should be kept down to the lowest possible figure. The principal of the Brandon Industrial school is being instructed to allow these two children to be transferred to the MacKay Boarding School as soon as suitable arrangements can be made for their transport. You will be good enough to inform Archdeacon MacKay accordingly. It might be well for him to consult with Rev. T. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The request for their transfer is made by the Venerable Archdeacon MacKay and it is considered that his wishes in the matter should be complied with. You will, therefore, be good enough to grant the discharge of these two children from your school and hand them over to the care of the person whom Archdeacon MacKay, the Acting Principal of the MacKay Boarding School, shall arrange to take charge of them during their journey to The Pas.

As it is desirable that the Board should be informed as to our wishes as soon as possible I should like to have your views as to the advisability of our reacquiring this property for our Indian work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Would it not be a good idea to advertise it or call for tenders?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMarch 17th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant in reply to mine of the 1st instant with regard to the reacquisition of the Elkhorn school property. It would not be possible for us to sell the property and thus derive any monetary advantage. If we do not take it over again it will revert to the Department of the Interior and if sold the proceeds would go to Casual Revenue. However, in view of the extreme cost of building at the present time, and our lack of facilities should we wish to actively put into force the amendment of last session regarding compulsory attendance at schools, it seemed to me that it might be advisable for us to reopen this institution, either under the direct control of the Department or under the auspices of one of the religious bodies. There is a large field in the northern part of the Province of Manitoba and also in the northern part of Saskatchewan in which the facilities for education in residential schools are very meager.\n\nIt was this that I had in mind when I wrote my letter of March 1st, in which I might then more fully have expressed the object that I had in mind in writing you. Will you, therefore, give this matter further consideration and advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 18th, 1921.\n\nDear Archdeacon Snowdon,\n\nIn 1919 the Elkhorn industrial school at Elkhorn, Man., which had been conducted by this Department for a number of years, was closed and the property transferred to the Soldiers Settlement Board to be used as a training centre for ex-service men. I am now advised by the Board that they do not wish to utilize the property any longer in connection with their work, and that they desire to re-transfer it to the Department. When transferred to the Board the buildings and equipment in connection therewith were in splendid condition, and in view of the lack of facilities for the training of Church of England children in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it occurred to me that it might be well for the Church to undertake the management of a school at this point, it being understood that the Department would be responsible for the upkeep of the plant.\n\nUnfortunately the school is somewhat remote from the reserves from which pupils would be drawn, which are in the northern part of each of the provinces above mentioned, but under our present arrangements the Department would be responsible for the cost of the transportation of pupils. When the school was previously in operation the Indians objected to sending their children so far away, although it might be considered that their objections were not very well founded. However, as the\n\nVery Rev. Archdeacon J. M. Snowdon,\n66 Liegar Street,\nOttawa.\nIndian Act now stands we have the power to place their children in this or any other designated school.\n\nI should be very glad if you would take this matter up with Canon Gould and let me have your views. As you are aware the cost of building is now very high and our appropriation limited and it might be well to make use of this property rather than anticipate the erection of any new buildings in the future, to serve the constituencies referred to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 21st, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo and my reply of the last instant, regarding the Elkhorn Industrial school property, I think it would be well for the Department to reassume possession of this property for industrial school purposes. Will you kindly take the necessary action to have it re-transferred to us by Order in Council as was done when transfer was made by this Department on 22nd October, 1919.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th inst. regarding requisition of the Elkhorn school property. I am of the same mind as you in regard to this matter. I think it would be too bad to sacrifice this property when we are short of school accommodation in this Province, particularly in Northern Saskatchewan. Sometimes I think it would be a splendid idea if we could run a school independent of the Church organization. What I mean by this, is that the Government would control the purchase, management, staff, etc.\n\nAs you know, I have been pressing for a Boarding or Industrial school in the northern part of this Province. There is a large number of children there that are not attending school very regularly. If we could get the right man, I would be very keen to have the school established. With the enormous amount of equipment we have\u2014beds, blankets, mattresses, furniture of all descriptions\u2014we could almost furnish the Institution without any outlay of cash. I think the matter should be seriously considered, and if you fall in with this, and have any further suggestions, I can assure you I will do everything I can to start up such a school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

I think, therefore, you should at once take necessary steps to place someone in charge of the property. I may add that the Church of England has under consideration the question of assuming the management of the institution as an industrial school, and I hope to have a definite decision from them in the near future when I shall advise you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

April 16th, 1921\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nReferring to my letter of March 22nd on the subject of re-opening the Elkhorn, I would ask if the Department has come to any decision in regard to this, as I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Westgate, Field Secretary M.S.C.C., in which he states in part as follows,-\n\n\"The Indian Department have informed our Society that the Elkhorn Industrial School at Elkhorn, Man., which had been conducted by the Department for a number of years, but was closed in 1919 and the property transferred to the Soldiers' Settlement Board, and is now being re-transferred to the Department who suggest that it might be well for the Church of England to undertake the management of an Indian School at this point. I have been asked to arrange if possible to meet you there to confer with you on this suggestion. If you will kindly fix a date when it will be convenient for you to visit Elkhorn I shall endeavor to meet you there, so that we may study the situation on the spot.\"\n\nBefore arranging to meet Mr. Westgate I should like to have your reply to my letter above quoted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\n(2) The Elkhorn Boarding School.\n\nOur Executive Committee at its meeting on March 31st, agreed, in principle, to accept the responsibility of the management of this school, subject to such further arrangements concerning the same as may be necessary to discuss with you. In the meantime, I have sent a copy of your letter to our Field Secretary, resident in Winnipeg - The Rev. Dr. Westgate, whose office is in the Bible Society House, Winnipeg, and who will be, as I informed you, our official in immediate touch with the Anglican boarding schools - suggesting to him that perhaps it would be advisable, if he could arrange with the Indian Commissioner, Mr. Graham, to visit the property and to submit his report concerning the same.\n\nWe understand, I may say, that, as in the case of the Blackfoot institution, the land attached to the school is not very suitable for farming operations and that to make the school the institution it should be some additional land of a good quality will probably be necessary.\n\nThere is also the need of getting together a suitable staff of which we have already, I may say, some members available.\n\nIn a general way we have thought that the best time to reopen the institution would be after the summer vacation, thus allowing, both, the Missionary Society sufficient time to deal with matters from its side, and the Department sufficient time to assign the necessary number of children to the school. If you think that an earlier date would be advisable, kindly let me know and we will take the matter up at once.\n\nBelieve me, Yours very faithfully,\nS.

That they left Winnipeg on Thursday, May 26th, at 3.25 p.m. and reached Elkhorn the same day at 9.30 p.m. Before leaving Winnipeg they secured from the Synod Office a copy of the Report on the Elkhorn Industrial School prepared by the special committee appointed by the Synod of Rupert's Land for the purpose, dated April 15th, 1918, and carefully examined this on the way.\n\n2.

SEPTIC TANK & PUMP HOUSE\n\nThe tank itself, which is not sufficiently large, is covered by a small frame building along side of which there is another building containing the pump, and from which has been constructed a wooden gutter or take-off.\n\n4. STORE ROOM\n\nThis is a small brick building situated quite near to the main building.\n\n5. PRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE\n\nThis is a 2\u00bd story frame building, containing 11 rooms, in all with a good basement in which has been installed a hot water heating system.\n\n6.

In this building is stored twenty hole Massey Harris Seeder, practically new, which belongs to the Soldier's Settlement Board, and was offered for sale a few months ago for $150.00.\n\n16. **SAND-POINT WELL & PUMP HOUSE**\n   This is a small wooden structure standing on the extreme Western side of the school grounds.\n\n**REAL ESTATE**\n\nSo far as your committee were able to ascertain the area of the land belonging to the School at present is approximately 320 acres (but the exact extent remains to be ascertained from either the Synod of Rupert's Land or the Land Titles Authorities.)\n\nThis area comprises the S.W. \u00bc sec. 4 and S.E.\u00bc Sec. 5, Township 12, Range 26, situated in the town of Elkhorn and immediately adjoining the C.P.R. station.\n\nThe buildings stand on the first of these two divisions and about 300 yds. from the railway depot.\nCONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. THE MAIN BUILDING\n\nRe Buildings, speaking generally your Committee found the buildings in fairly good condition but before any attempt is made to re-open the Schools as a Church institution the following repairs should be made:\n\n1. Walls kalsomined or painted.\n2. Plumbing thoroughly examined and put in order.\n3. Pupils' stairs re-treaded.\n4. Connect spare boiler with heating system.\n5. Have an additional tank to supply hot water.\n6. Get more powerful engine to drive machinery in laundry and to pump water.\n7. Fire extinguishing hose examined and when necessary replaced.\n8. Plastering attended to in one room.\n9. Range in kitchen, new lids and fire brick.\n10. Pantry, more cupboard room.\n11. Metallic roof and railing to be repaired.\n12. Paint all woodwork and stain softwood floors.\n13. New lighting system to be installed, such as Delco or Jenco, with wires laid on to all important buildings and light and power building mentioned above to be adapted to this purpose.\n14. Woodwork outside to be painted.\n15. Cement stairs to take the place of those now on N. and S. sides of building.\n\nREPAIRS TO PRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE\n\nPaint the kitchen.\n\nFARMER'S HOUSE\n\nPut in hot air furnace.\nKalsomine walls and repair soft water tank.\n\nCARPENTER'S HOUSE\n\nPut in hot air furnace.\nRepair the chimney.\nKalsomine the walls.\n\nBARN\n\nRepair inside walls.\n\nIMPLEMENT SHED\n\nRepairs to roof.\n\nGYMNASIUM\n\nRoof, floors and partitions repaired and painted. It will then be a serviceable building.\nSEPTIC TANK\n\nTank examined and the carry-eff placed under ground.\n\nMost of the buildings need paint outside.\n\nSCHOOL FARM\n\nComplete fencing of the School Farm and acquire an extra half section of land.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing requirements it will be obvious to the Commission that complete furnishings and equipment will be necessary, the nature and extent of which will depend on the type of School to be established.\n\nWhile your Committee feel that having completed their survey as set forth above and that the making of definite recommendations was not expected of them, they beg, however, to present to the Commission the following suggestions for their consideration:\n\n1. In view of the splendid buildings already in existence and the nature of the land which seems well adapted for farming purposes, it would be well to have the School reopened as an Agricultural and Industrial Institution wherein practical subjects would be taught, such as farming, gardening and care of stock, carpentry etc., for the boys, and home economics for the girls.\n\n2. That as the School is not situated on or near any Indian Reserve, a distinct and definite understanding should be required from the Indian Department to supply the pupils, using the power vested in them according to the Amended Indian Act.\n\n3. As a creamery is already operating in the town of Elkhorn and as much of the land is suitable for grazing, it seems to your Committee that there is a possibility of deriving considerable revenue from the sale of milk.\n\n(Signed) W.J.

I have read this with interest and I am pleased to note that taken all in all the plant appears to be in a very satisfactory condition considering that it has been idle for some time.\n\nI propose to obtain an estimate of the cost of making the repairs which the committee have suggested. I have noted also the three conclusions on the final page of the report. The acquisition of additional land would, however, be a matter for consideration at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\n131 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nReferring to the matter of the Elkhorn School my understanding of the present situation is as follows;-\n\nI. The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada accepts responsibility for the administration and management, through its Indian Commission, of the re-opened Elkhorn Institution on the conditions;-\n\n(1). That the necessary repairs and re-equipment of the Institution be carried out by the Department prior to its re-opening.\n\n(2). That the Department will provide, as soon as possible after the same is shown to be necessary for the welfare and support of the Institution, such additional land as may be needed for the conduct of satisfactory agricultural operations.\n\n(3). That the Department undertake to supply the number of pupils needed to maintain the school in operation at the full capacity of its accommodation, and further should the number of pupils placed in the Institution fall short of the full capacity of the Institution, then the Department shall be responsible for the difference in the amount of the total per capita grants as between the capacity of the Institution and the actual number of pupils in residence.\n\nThe only point in connection with the re-opening of the Institution concerning which I have any doubt, in my own mind, is the precise place it shall take in, or the part it shall contribute to, the general Anglican Scheme of Indian education. The Indian Commission, for example, has put forward the suggestion whether it could not be best used as a centre of \"secondary\" education to which the brighter pupils from other schools might be transferred for more advanced training. In any case I assume that the Institution would probably have to be re-opened on the basis of an ordinary boarding school since a centre of more...\nadvocated training, such as has been suggested, would, if adopted, require to be developed in a gradual manner.\n\nI hope to discuss this matter fully with the members of our Indian Commission on my forthcoming visit to the West, and subsequently, if necessary, consult with you further on the matter. Any possible developments in the direction noted need not, however, in my opinion delay the Department in carrying out the repairs and re-equipment necessary to the re-opening of the school.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\nOttawa, January 13, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 23rd, with reference to the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nYour third proviso requires careful consideration. The capacity of the school might be placed at 100, and we must decide upon the districts from which our pupilage might be drawn.\n\nIf we were to accept the responsibility of keeping the school full, we must of course expect the close cooperation of your Board and the district missionaries. There is no reason why we should not transport pupils from some distance to this school, and I propose to prepare a statement of the number of children of school age in the agencies which might be called upon to supply the pupils. I will submit this list for your attention.\n\nI do not think the school could be a success if it were used as a centre of secondary education. I doubt very much whether we could get the support of the Anglican Boarding schools to a policy which would take the older pupils away from them. I should like to open this school with the good will of the Indians whose children will be expected to attend, and while we have control through our statutes, I do not wish to use any methods that might be interpreted as harsh in putting it into operation as it might defeat the best ends we have in view.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society, Church of England in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nA request was recently made by the Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, asking that Mr. Shaw, lately the Farming Instructor at the Old Sun's School, might be afforded accommodation in one of the cottages at the Elkhorn School pending the final decision whether this school is to be re-opened or not, and I informed Dr. Westgate that there would be no objection to this. At the same time I pointed out to him that this proposition was in no sense a guarantee that the Department would approve of the appointment of Mr. Shaw as Farming Instructor at Elkhorn as the Department reserve the right to approve of appointments of all officers at Indian Boarding Schools. Dr. Westgate wrote to state that this caused him serious concern, and that he took the matter up with Canon Gould, the General Secretary of the Society, who took issue with me in regard to my statement, taking the ground that the only officer over whom the Department have control is the Principal. I have forwarded Dr. Westgate a copy of the pamphlet issued by the Department relating to the maintenance and management of Indian Boarding Schools, which was forwarded to me by the Department in May last, to which I presume no changes have been made.\n\nI shall be glad if you will advise me if my understanding of clauses 7 and 8 on page 7 of the pamphlet referred to is correct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nAs I have received no definite information in regard to the matter of the Elkhorn Indian School being taken over by the Church authorities, and as the cultivated land there should not be allowed to become overgrown with weeds, I am making arrangements for the leasing of the school farm to Mr. Earl S. Dixon of Elkhorn for this season on the basis of two-thirds of the proceeds of the crop sales being retained by him, and the remaining one-third paid to the Department, provided that Mr. Dixon agrees to summer-fallow any land not cropped on the farm in question for which work he will be allowed the sum of $3.00 per acre. I am also arranging to lease to Mr. Dixon the pasture land in the vicinity of the school buildings for this season at a nominal rental the amount of which has not yet been agreed upon.\n\nWill the Department be good enough to bear the above in mind when any arrangements are being made with the Church authorities in regard to the re-opening of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hall of Pipestone, Man. re the opening of Indian school. What he says re school is all true and it seems a pity those building them are able to do so. It is possible to utilize them.

Clingan, M.P.P.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor over a year the Indian Dept have been negotiating with the Anglican Church re the question of the Indian School located here. The Dept is willing to make the usual grant per capita but the Church authorities feel that this is not sufficient. They want a specific grant and the Dept to at least cooperate in serving the pupils and so matters have reached a deadlock. The building are expensive to keep up and equip and it is felt that the government or Indian Dept should be more liberal in their offer.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe buildings are suffering from the lack of a tenant and need a few from the repair work necessary will for exceed what little extra the Indian Dept grants to the Church.\n\nIt is false economy to hold up the Church authorities (who have none too much money to invest) and in the meantime allow those splendid and expensive buildings to go to waste. It is doubtful if a more up-to-date building under healthier location could be found.\n\nThe reopening of the School would be an inspiration and help to this Community\u2014and the leading and influential persons here feel that pressure should be\nthought to be upon the Indians to make a more liberal offer in order to induce the Church to come to operate the building so admirably suited for Indian work. The following statement urge you to bring this matter before the Hon. Stewart and others who are responsible for particular branch of government duties.\n\nGeorge Lidster\n\nP.S.

Until a definite understanding has been reached we are not in a position to go ahead with the alterations and repairs to the plant and equipment of this school.\n\nThe sum of $6,000 was provided in our Main Estimates for the present fiscal year for furnishings and repairs to the building. We have on file from Commissioner Graham a statement of the repairs that would be required to place the buildings in good condition.\n\nRev. Canon Gould requested, besides placing the building in good condition, that additional land be secured for agricultural operations, also that the Department undertake to supply the number of pupils needed to maintain the school in operation at the full capacity of its accommodation, and further that should the number of pupils in residence at any time fall short of the full capacity of the institution, then the Department is to be responsible for the difference in the amount of the total per capita grant as between the capacity of the institution and the actual number of pupils in residence. He also requested that the school be carried on as a centre of \"secondary\" education to which the brighter pupils from other residential schools could be transferred for more advanced training.\n\nThe Department does not desire to accept the responsibility of recruiting and keeping the school full, also, we are doubtful of the success if it were used as a centre of secondary education.\n\nIn the meantime, in order that the cultivated land should not be allowed to become overgrown with weeds, Mr. Commissioner Graham has leased the school farm to Mr. Earl S. Dixon, of Elkhorn, for this season on the basis of two-thirds of the proceeds of the crop sales being retained by him and the remaining one-third paid to the Department. The Commissioner also suggested to lease to Mr. Dixon the pasture land in the vicinity of the school for this season at a nominal rental, the amount of which has not yet been agreed upon. The Commissioner has suggested that we be good enough to bear this lease in mind when any arrangements are being made with the Church authorities in regard to the re-opening of the school.\n\nUntil a complete understanding is arrived at between the Department and the Church authorities regarding the above mentioned matters, we are not in a position to take any action towards having the necessary repairs carried out, or the school re-opened.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nPursuant to our interview on the morning of Saturday, September 9th:\n\nRe Elkhorn Boarding School\n\nThe General Secretary M.S.C.C. agreed to recommend to his Executive Committee that the M.S.C.C. undertake responsibility for the re-opened Elkhorn School on the following conditions:\n\n1. That the per capita grant be paid at the rate of $150.00 for 100 pupils. The condition concerning bonus, if any, to apply to this School as to any other Institution.\n\n2. That the Department co-operate closely, under the powers given it by the Indian Act, with the Indian and Eskimo Commission of the M.S.C.C. in securing an attendance of pupils to the full capacity of the Institution.\n\n3. That the Department make all needed repairs to the building including the lighting of the same from the electric supply of the town of Elkhorn.\n\n4. The School to be re-opened on May 1st, 1923.\n\nThese proposals were submitted to the Executive Committee M.S.C.C. at its meeting held on Wednesday, September 13th; the Executive Committee cordially approved the proposals, and undertook the responsibility for the re-opening of the Institution on the date given, May 1st, 1923. The Committee noted the fact, however, that to secure adequate results from the land connected with the Institution, it would be necessary for a certain amount of agricultural work to be done this Autumn, and requested the Secretary of the Indian Commission to take up the matters connected therewith.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nCanon Gould has secured the sanction of the M.S.C.C. to the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School, on certain conditions.\n\nThe first condition might mean that Canon Gould expects the Department to pay for the 100 pupils, whether or not that number are in residence.\n\nThe second condition suggests that the Department cooperate closely in the matter of recruiting. If this means other than active assistance on our part, we would be in danger of having other institutions call on us for the same help.\n\nThe third condition, that we put the institution in repair and arrange for electric light, is quite reasonable. Inspector Murison, in November, last, estimated the cost of the work at $4103. This includes electric lighting. Funds for this work are on deposit in Regina to the amount of $4018, as on the 31st ultimo.\n\nThe fourth condition mentioned by Canon Gould is that the school be re-opened on May first, 1923. I cannot agree that this is the best date for the recruiting of pupils. The experience of most principals is that Indian parents are more easily convinced of the advisability of educating their children as soon as possible and as clothing and food are more difficult to provide. I would suggest that staff be appointed as from May first and that their duties consist of supervising the farming operations, the repairs to the building and active recruiting. I am of the opinion that 4 or 5 men and women, including the new principal, should be on the Indian reserves during the summer of 1923, giving particular attention to the Prince Albert and Battleford areas in Saskatchewan; the Fairfield, Pemuis, Brokenhead and Black River reserves in Manitoba; and the Lac Seul district in Ontario.\n\nIn answer to Canon Gould's suggestion that the land be worked this autumn, we might inform him that the farm is leased for this year and that summer-fallowing is being done on certain fields that are not being cropped.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th, concerning the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School. I am pleased that the Executive Committee of the M. S. C. C. is prepared to cooperate with this Department in this matter.\n\nThis Department is ready to actively assist in the recruiting of pupils for the Elkhorn School, but the onus of the responsibility will have to rest on the Church Authorities. My suggestion is that a staff be appointed as from May first, 1923, some members of which should spend a summer recruiting. Your missionaries in the field and our agents could cooperate closely. I believe particular attention should be paid to the Prince Albert and Battleford areas in Saskatchewan; the Fairford, Pinguin, Brokenhead and Black River Reserves in Manitoba; and the Lac Seul District in Ontario. Other members of the staff could be at the school, supervising farm activities, taking an interest in the general repairs and renovating that will be undertaken by this Department and receiving the recruits that would be coming in from time to time. I am prepared to make a special type of grant for the current expenses for the summer of 1923. By the first of October the school would have to be placed on the regular basis of $150 per capita for those in attendance.\n\nIn answer to your suggestion that the land be worked this autumn, I wish to inform you that the farm is leased for this year and that summer fallowing is being done on certain fields that are not being cropped.\n\nAn inspector from the Indian Commissioner's office at Regina has made a detailed report concerning the needs at this school in the event of a re-opening. The total estimate is in the neighborhood of $400, which includes the provision for electric lighting. Funds are available for this purpose whenever we wish to commence operations.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you, with a view to making definite plans for the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Board of Management, M.S.C.C., at its recent annual meeting, approved in the following terms the proposal that the Elkhorn Indian Boarding School should be re-opened under the management of the M.S.C.C.:\n\n\"The Department (1) to provide a per capita grant of $150. for 100 pupils, (2) to co-operate with the Indian and Eskimo Commission, to the full extent of its powers, in securing and retaining at the school the full number of pupils, (3) to connect the buildings with the electric lighting system of the town of Elkhorn, and to make all the other needed repairs and changes in the building, (4) the school to be re-opened on May 1st, 1923\".\n\nKindly substitute this letter for the one recently received from me, dated Sept. 16th, 1922, on the same subject.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary\nTORONTO, Ont., Oct. 2nd 1922\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRe Elkhorn Industrial School\n\nI am sending a copy of your letter dated Sept. 28th to the Rev. Dr. Westgate, with the request that our Indian and Eskimo Commission shall take up the matters requiring attention at an early date.\n\nI am leaving this evening for England en route to India and the Far East, otherwise I should like to have had some further personal conversation with you concerning the precise meaning of the phrase used in your letter \"The onus of the responsibility will have to rest on the Church Authorities\".\n\nI understood at the time that the reason why the Department closed the Elkhorn Industrial School was on account of the fact that its cost of maintenance worked out at $225 per capita; a per capita cost which the Department felt could not be justified. Under these circumstances it is most desirable that no possible ground of misunderstanding regarding the basis upon which the Institution will be re-opened, should be left undetermined.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Westgate, Secretary of our Indian and Eskimo Commission, will be Acting General Secretary of the Society during my absence. He is now absent on a visit to the Lac La Ronge School, on his return he will\nI have no doubt, make an early opportunity of waiting upon you at the Department with a view to making such further precise and definite arrangements as may be necessary.\n\nYour statement that the land at the School has been leased does not mean, I trust, that it has passed out of immediate control. The School authorities would have to be in possession of the land for some weeks at least before the date of the re-opening of the school in order that the necessary agricultural operations might be under way, cattle purchased, etc., etc., against the date of re-opening.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\nThe Royal Bank of Canada\nIncorporated 1869\n\nRegina, Sask.\n\nOct., 2nd, 1922.\n\nW.M.

Westgate\nField Secretary & Acting General Secretary M.S.G.C.\nOttawa, Feb. 22, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the needs at the Elkhorn Industrial School in connection with its re-opening during the present year. The Department is pleased to have the list of equipment that is required; and I have to inform you that the regulations of the Purchasing Commission are such that care will have to be exercised when authority is being given in this connection. Certain repairs can, of course, be undertaken by day labour, under the supervision of an officer of the school. Further, the principal appointed by your Board will receive in his own authority to purchase, after obtaining competitive prices, the equipment, seed and stock that can be secured to advantage, locally. Classroom, dining-room and dormitory equipment will be purchased, after securing competitive prices and a minute number from the Purchasing Commission. This Department will give the necessary authority, if funds can be found for the purpose, when the securing of each lot of equipment is timely.\n\nIn the interim, I would be pleased if you would offer the Department definite information as to your plans in connection with the re-opening. Is it proposed to engage a staff, whose duties during the ensuing summer could be supervising the renovating and equipping for the school? Furthermore, would it be advisable to arrange for the purchase of the equipment, live stock and seed necessary for the farm, in the early spring? The purchase of the staff furniture, agricultural implements, live stock, seed grain, kitchen equipment, etc., should be made by the principal and a department representative.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary &\nActing Gen. Secretary, M.B.O.C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nFebruary 23, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Featherston:\n\nAttention: Mr. Pratt.\n\nPursuant to our telephone conversation, concerning the farm at the Elkhorn Industrial School, I have to inform you that in the past, when the school was in operation, this Department rented a half section (the East half of Section 32 T.11, R. 28, West of the First) from Mr. J. A. MacKray. This Department owns, for the purposes of this school, the S.W. quarter of Section 4 and the S.W. quarter of Section 5, T. 12, R. 28, some 20 acres of hay land in Section 33 and a few lots in the township of Elkhorn immediately adjoining the C.P.R. station. Not all of this land is suitable for farming purposes, and it is true that, when the school is re-opened, it may be necessary to rent, or purchase, some additional farm land. I should state, further, however, that it is not the intention of this Department to arrange for any purchase, or rental, until such time as the renewed school activity has developed the need.\n\nIt is proposed to re-open the Elkhorn Industrial School this coming summer. The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada will assume the responsibility of staffing, and will assist in the recruiting campaign. Funds are available from the sale of equipment and stock at the time of the closing of the school, in 1918, and, in addition, there is an item in the Main Estimates of 1923-24, of $3,000 as a supplementary provision in this connection.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have received from your Accountant's office statements, with vouchers, up to December 31st, last, of Mr. W. M. Graham's Elkhorn School Account.\n\nThis account, which appears to be of the nature of a trust account and which dates back to July, 1916, may be summarized as follows:\n\nBalance received from Rev. A.E. Wilson, principal, $191.60\nProceeds of sales of grain, hay and potatoes, 4243.66\nProceeds of sale of cattle, 487.00\nRental of buildings and pasture, 147.50\nCompensation for tent burned, 35.00\nInterest allowed by bank, 295.08\n\n$5400.04\n\nLess expenses in connection with gathering and marketing crops, 1321.62\n\nBalance, December 31st, 1922 $4068.42\n\nI have been given to understand by your accountant that it is the intention of your department to re-open this school in the coming spring and that the balance of this account will be applied to the re-establishment of the school.\n\nIt appears to me that this manner of dealing with the earnings of the school is a wrong one, and contrary to the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act which requires in Section 35, that all public moneys, from whatever source of revenue derived, shall be paid to the credit of the Receiver General. Since the whole expenses in connection with the maintenance of this school are paid from public funds, I am of opinion that any earnings of the school must be regarded as public.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nas public money, and so much should be dealt with in accordance with Section 35 of the Audit Act referred to above.\n\nI should also like to have some information with regard to the amount of $1641.80 handed to Mr. Graham by Rev. A. E. Wilson, and also the balance of a Trust account administered by him. Wilson, and if so what was the nature of that account.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Auditor General.\n\nJWR/MVP\nOttawa, 27th February, 1923\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the Elkhorn School accounts; I beg to say that the Auditor General has written for information respecting the balance handed over to you by Rev. A.E. Wilson on the 15th July, 1918, viz., $191.80.\n\nCan you say from what source these funds were derived?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nW.M.

Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 22, No. 116823-1, in connection with the re-opening of the Elkhorn School, I beg to inform you that a definite recommendation has just gone forward from our Commission to the General Secretary of our Society in Toronto, to the effect that the Rev. Fred Eley, curate of All Saints' Church, Montreal, be nominated to your Department for appointment to the Principalship of this institution, and I have no doubt that you will hear from our General Secretary in this connection within the very near future. Should Mr. Eley receive the appointment it is the desire of our Commission that he should proceed to the School at the earliest opportunity, so as to superintend any repairs which the Department will undertake, all arrangements in connection with the farming operations, and assist in the recruiting and receiving of children for enrolment. It is therefore, a matter of great urgency that the man who is at present occupying the Principal's residence, should be given notice to vacate that building, and that the necessary repairs and renovations preparatory to its being occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Eley, should be undertaken in the immediate future.\n\nIn response to your request for an outline of the plan of procedure which our Society contemplates following in connection with the appointment of a staff, and the re-opening of this Institution, I beg to state that these will be as follows:-\n\n1. Engagement of a Farmer. Mr. J. Murray Shaw, who was the Farm Instructor at the Blackfoot School and gave every satisfaction, has already been engaged in this capacity, and was placed on salary from the 1st of February. Mr. Shaw is not only thoroughly reliable, but thoroughly competent, and our Society engaged him as being one of the best men they could procure to advise them in all matters pertaining to equipment, such as implements, live-stock, feed, seed grain, etc., which will be required for the farming operations. As prices are liable to\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nadvance as spring approaches, our Society beg to recommend that steps be taken at the earliest date possible for the purchase of the farming equipment, live-stock, and seed-grain, mentioned in my letter of February 9. As Mr. Shaw will probably be a much better judge of these things than the Principal or any other man our Society could appoint for the purpose, I beg to suggest in view of this fact, that he be given permission to act on behalf of the Principal, along with your representative in purchasing all the agricultural implements, live-stock, seed-grain, fodder, etc., which will be required for the beginning of the farming operations.\n\n2. The appointment of a Principal. The Principal should reach the School by April 1, if possible, and certainly not later than the 1st of May. His immediate duty would consist of superintending all the repairs to the buildings, and in furnishing our Commission with requisitions for all supplies necessary, as well as reports on the progress of repairs, etc.\n\n3. The appointment of a Vice-Principal, and other members of the staff would follow as they are required until the staff was completed. During the summer months, and after the Vice-Principal has been appointed, the Principal would be free to travel through different centres and bring in the children, and it is hoped that everything would be in readiness for the opening of the School on October 1.\n\nTrusting these arrangements may meet with your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nTBRW/FEO.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs arrangements are now being completed for the re-opening of the Elkhorn School I shall be obliged if you will furnish me with a number of Application Forms (say 150) for the enrollment of pupils. As soon as the Principal has been appointed and has taken up his residence at the School these will be handed over to him but as the Diocesan authorities are co-operating with our Society in this work at present it is important that they should have some of these Forms when they visit the different Reserves in order to avoid any greater expense in the way of travelling than can be helped.\n\nBelieve me sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/IMC.\nOttawa, March 10, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 27th ultimo, applying for 150 Application for Admission forms. In reply I beg to state that these will be directed to you, under separate cover.\n\nYour communication of the 26th ultimo, relative to the re-opening of the school, is receiving the Department's attention. Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, has been instructed to have the lessee, Mr. Dixon, vacate the property. A communication concerning the purchase of seed grain, feed, certain live stock and some agricultural implements will be directed to you in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary &\nActing Gen. Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41 - 43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMarch 5, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nIf it is your intention to proceed with the re-opening of the Elkhorn Industrial School, I would be pleased to have your sanction for the following action. As you are aware, we have over $4,000 in a special account, and there is in the main estimates an item of $3,000 in this connection:\n\n1. To instruct Mr. Commissioner Graham to have the lessee, Mr. Dixon, vacate the principal's residence and the farm. Mr. Dixon's lease expired at the end of the last harvest season.\n\n2. To instruct Mr. Graham to have our inspector proceed to Elkhorn and, in conjunction with a Mr. Shaw, who is at present occupying the farmer's house and who has been appointed, temporarily, by the M. S. C. C. to the position of farmer, to purchase, after securing competitive prices, seed grain, feed, certain live stock and some agricultural implements. This equipment is detailed hereunder, and will cost in the neighborhood of $2,600.\n\n3. To instruct our inspector to see that the principal's residence is in fair state of repair, so that it can be occupied at an early date by the new principal.\n\n4. To authorize our representative, in conjunction with the Rev. Principal, to engage a carpenter and plumber and other labour that may be necessary to go over the main and other buildings.\n\n5. To ascertain what equipment Mr. Commissioner Graham has in the Regina storehouse, that would be suitable for the re-opening of the institution.\n\n6. To purchase, after securing minute numbers from the Purchasing Commission, such other furniture and equipment as is necessary to the proper conduct of the school.\n\n7. To assist the M. S. C. C. and their local representatives, financially and otherwise, in their recruiting campaign.\n\n8. To make some provision for the initial expenses of the members of the staff on duty at the school, before classroom activities commence.\n\nThe action indicated above can be taken when timely, and as the activity develops.\n\nFarm Equipment:\n- Harness - 2 set\n- Wagon - 1 complete\n- Plough - 1 2-12\" furrows, Gang.\n- Harrow - 1 with 14 discs\n- - 1 drag, 2 sections\n- Cultivator - 9 ft.\n- Seeder - 1 shoe with 20 drills\n- Manure spreader - 1\n- Small water carts - 1\n- Fanning mill - 1\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was merely the general balance in connection with receipts and expenditures at the institution.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M.Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n| Date     | Amount | Initials | Cheques |\n|----------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Nov 14   | 100    | M        | 375     |\n| Nov 16   | 525    | M        | 30      |\n| Nov 20   | 50     | M        | 20      |\n| Nov 25   | 3446   | M        | 19      |\n| Dec 3    | 525    | M        | 1312    |\n| Apr 28   | 93     | M        | 920     |\n| May 17   | 65     | M        | 15      |\n| June 18  | 230    | M        | 15      |\n\nTotal: 110271\n\nBalance: 110271\n| Date       | Amount | Initials | Cheques |\n|------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Nov 30     |        |          |         |\n| Dec 1      | Bal    |          |         |\n| Dec 1      | 48     |          |         |\n| Dec 1      | 70     | M        |         |\n| Dec 1      | 85     | M        |         |\n| May 29     | 562.35 |          |         |\n| May 31     | Bal    |          |         |\n| May 31     | 562.35 |          |         |\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Date     | Amount | Initials |\n|----------|--------|----------|\n| Nov 14   | 100    | M        |\n| Nov 16   | 525    | M        |\n| Nov 20   | 50     | M        |\n| Nov 25   | 346    | M        |\n| Dec 3    | 525    | M        |\n| Apr 28   | 93     | M        |\n| May 17   | 65     | M        |\n| June 18  | 230    | M        |\n\nBal: 433\n\nIndian Affairs.

This method of dealing with the small fund would be preferable to a refund to Casual Revenue. Any purchases charged to this credit would, of course, be made under the control of the Purchasing Commission and would be subject to your audit.\n\nI would point out that these amounts accrued from the sales at the closing of the school; the item of $191.50 as shown in the bank book kept by Mr. A. E. Wilson - trust account - may have arisen from the sale of produce. The bank book is open to your inspection.\n\nIf you find any unsurmountable difficulty in the way of letting us use the funds, kindly let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

In that letter you state that the intention was to use these funds for the purchase of necessary equipment at the re-opening of the Elkhorn school, by doing which the appropriation for Indian education would be supplemented.\n\nThis proposed method of supplementing your vote is entirely at variance with the principle of parliamentary control over expenditure and with the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act. Section 2 of that Act defines the term \"Public moneys\". Section 25 of the same Act directs that all public moneys, from whatever source of revenue derived, shall be paid to the credit of the Receiver General; Section 41 directs that the Auditor General shall see that no cheque issues for the payment of any public money for which there is no direct parliamentary appropriation.\n\nThese provisions of the Act form, in my opinion, an insurmountable difficulty against the proposed use of the funds in question, which should be deposited forthwith to the credit of the Receiver General as Casual Revenue.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAssistant Auditor General.\n\nJWR/MVT\n\nIndian Affairs.

This institution has been closed for some years, and as the number of children in this vicinity is limited, I have made arrangements for the reception of 40 orphan, destitute and any other Protestant Indian children that are available in the Lac Seul and contiguous areas.\n\nYou will please keep these facts in mind during the next two months and make out a list of the names, ages and localities of the children that could be taken or recruited for Elkhorn. Early in September an officer of the school, acting under our instructions, will report to you for assistance in locating and gathering these children for their journey, ensemble, to the school.\n\nIt is understood that only Protestant children will be recruited, and I would like you to give preference to those who are either orphan or destitute. You may assure parents, guardians and others that the Elkhorn Industrial School is splendidly situated on the main line of the C. P. R. and every opportunity will be given the children to receive an academic and vocational training that will fit them for lives of usefulness. It has occurred to me that you have a splendid opportunity to prepare lists of available applicants during the treaty payments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

M. Sanderson to accompany the party paying Treaty in the northern areas of the Diocese of Kewatin.\n\nMr. Sanderson, being an Indian, is undoubtedly the best person who could be sent on this Mission. I understand from the Superintendent of Indian Education that his travelling expenses, when so engaged, will be paid by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, July 5, 1923.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you state arrangements have been made to have the Rev. Mr. Sanderson recruit pupils for the Elkhorn Industrial School, at the time of the annuity payments to the Indians of Western Ontario. Mr. Sanderson should communicate with Mr. Indian Agent Frank Edwards, Kenora, Ont., to whom he should present his expense account.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that arrangements are being made at once to have the septic tank repaired and to proceed with the general renovation at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

M. Sanderson accompany your treaty paying party in the northern areas of the Diocese of Neewatin. As Mr. Sanderson is an Indian, it is felt that he is undoubtedly the best person who could be sent on this mission. The Department has agreed to pay his travelling expenses during the period he is engaged in the work. He should submit his accounts to you. If you consider them to be satisfactory, you will be good enough to certify and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Sanderson and yourself will meet with success in persuading the Indian parents to allow their children to attend the Elkhorn School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letters No. 116823-1 of the 20th of June and 6th of July, re- children for Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nThese letters did not reach me until after my return from Treaty payments at Lac Seul. Rev. M. Sanderson accompanied me on the payment and I will see that his expenses are paid. After the payments we discussed with the Indians the advisability of sending their children to Elkhorn School but they seem very much against this as they do not wish to send their children so far away from the Reserve and requested me to ask the Department to excuse them not sending them so far away. They promised that if a school was started closer to the Reserve, they would send practically all of the young children.\n\nWe shall no doubt be able to get a few children from the Reserve but it will not be very many unless we use very strong pressure. Mr. Sanderson stayed up at the Reserve to see if he could not talk the Indians over. I expect him back in a few days and will then communicate further with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFE/CP.\n\nAsst.

Under separate cover, there is being directed to you Classroom Registers, Quarterly Return forms, Applications for Admission forms, Requisition for Classroom Material forms and the Indian Act. Later, the report for the fiscal year 1922-23 will be sent to your address.\n\nI am enclosing copies of circular letters, with which you should acquaint yourself. No. 1 has reference to the keeping of classroom registers. No. 2 refers to accounts which are to be met from Parliamentary Appropriation. No. 3 was addressed to all agents, and I should be grateful in guiding you in the recruiting of pupils. No. 4 refers to the arrangement with the Provincial Department of Education for the inspection of the outcome in Indian schools. No. 5 refers to the advisability of having classroom instructors attend local teachers' institutes. No. 6 is a request for a dietary scale and it might be well for you to comply with this a few weeks after you have commenced regular activity.\n\nThe Elkhorn Indian Residential School comes in the category of institutions which are not directly supervised by a local Indian agent. Letters for the Department's attention may be directed to Ottawa, unless you desire to have the recommendation of Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, attached. Relative to the return of children to their school and to recruiting and to the application for admission of children, you should correspond with the Indian agent in whose agency the particular child lives when at home.\n\nWith reference to the expenditure of per capita earnings, you will have, no doubt, received full instructions from your Church Authorities, the M. S. C. C. It is not necessary for the Elkhorn School to pay Sales Tax on goods or equipment which are to be used at the school and which are not purchased for the purpose of resale. I wish to direct your attention particularly to circular letter No. 2, with reference to incurring expenditure which is to be met from Parliamentary appropriation and which is not being paid from per capita earnings. Requests in the case of the Elkhorn institution should be forwarded either direct to Ottawa or to Dr. Westgate. As there is no agent to certify to accounts which are to be paid in Ottawa, you should certify to them yourself, as Principal.\n\nPlease address all communications for the Department, dealing with routine matters, to the Secretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The certificate should not be affixed on the left hand upper corner as you did in some cases, but below the details of expenditure. When accounts are rendered on small bill heads it would be advisable to paste these on the Department's form of voucher and sign the printed certificate.\n\nWhen the items are not self explanatory, a short note should be written on the face of the vouchers, giving the nature of the expenditure.

While I think it is a weak system It would only be fair for the same rule to apply to all schools.\n\nWhile passing through Winnipeg I heard that it was not the idea to permit the Elkhorn school authorities to recruit on certain reserves in the Lake Winnipeg district, on the grounds that we had some Indian Day schools there. If I had known that the Church had the right to say where we should recruit, I should certainly have opposed the expenditure of $75,000.00 which I understand has already been spent on this Institution. I am doing my best to recruit for this school, but I think the Department should insist on the Church doing more than they have done. Of course, if they are being paid whether the pupils are in the school or not I can understand their non-aggressive policy.\n\nWill you kindly let me know just what understanding the Department and the School authorities have. It seems absurd that I should be kept in the dark in matters of this kind.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wrote to you regarding recruiting for Elkhorn Industrial School. I had heard \"directly\" that the Department were paying the school authorities a certain amount of money, in lieu of the per capita grant, in order to carry on this school. I asked the Department if this rumour were correct, and have not yet received a reply to my letter. Would you kindly let me have this information, as I think it is necessary that I should know? This school has been put in repair at a great expense, and we seem to be working at odds. I ask the Department for information, and so far have been unable to get it.\n\nThe report is, the Church authorities are not allowing recruiting to take place in certain reserves in Manitoba. I may have made a mistake in inviting Mr. Eley to go into Bishop Lloyd's diocese and recruit. Bishop Lloyd would have more grounds for refusing recruiting to take place in his constituency than the Bishop or Church authorities to refuse recruiting to take place in their diocese for a school situated in the diocese.\n\nIt seems to me my letter regarding this might have been answered. I am inclined to think it was not brought to your attention. I have no desire to write unpleasantly on this subject, but it seems to me we should have some understanding on such an important matter. My letter referred to was written on April 4th. It is now the 23rd, and I have not yet had a reply.\n\nI may say I am now in receipt of a letter from the Department regarding the building of a new school on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve. Have you seen the last report on the Little Saskatchewan school, made by Mr. C. W. Bartlett? Do you think our children\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHere are getting the training they should get? Personally I do not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.V. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 30, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of April 23rd with reference to the Elkhorn Industrial School. My attention was drawn to your letter of April 4th but I had had it amongst papers that I was discussing with the Minister and overlooked it. I have also been in Toronto for four days.\n\nWhen a new school is opened we have found it necessary to pay expenses incidental thereto until the pupils' grant is large enough to support the institution. Payment will be made to the Elkhorn school by per capita grant from the 1st April, 1924.\n\nI understand that portion of your letter which dealt with recruiting has been answered on another file.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWe enclose herewith the account of the Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., for desks for our junior room.\n\nThere have been temporarily set up.\n\nWe hope soon to have a third teacher on the staff. When same is appointed, we will inform you as to the number of small desks we are unable to utilize to advantage, and will forward you a plan of the seating arrangement in the different rooms.\n\nThe kindergarten pupils will attend classes morning and afternoon. The pupils in the intermediate and senior rooms will attend on the half day system.\n\nKindly send us another Classroom Register.\n\nThanking you for your kindness in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Elk Horn Indian Residential School on the 16th of July and was much impressed by the splendid condition of the main building and the principal's residence. There has been a complete renovation and a replacement wherever necessary and these two buildings are practically as good as new. The management has done commendable work in putting the school grounds in shape and working the farm. I was considerably deceived by the nature of the soil on the school farm and, upon making enquiry, I learned that it was extremely doubtful if any of the neighbouring properties would be of value. I learned that the M. S. C. G. had requested the Department to purchase a half section from a Colonel MacKee. Mr. Menzies, the farm instructor of the school, does not consider the land suitable and not worth more than $10 an acre.\n\nThe building is well equipped and the only requirement brought to my attention was a hotel size hand power mangle for the laundry. I purpose assisting their boys' activity by supplying a snare drum and 5 bugles.\n\nI was impressed with the Rev. Mr. Riley's ability and his interest in the work. His staff appears to be but fair. The assistant, Mr. Dawson, has great possibilities but is evidently not satisfied with the work.\n\nI intend to protest to Dr. Westgate concerning the M. S. C. G. lettering on equipment that has been purchased from Parliamentary appropriation and will suggest the name of the school instead. The outbuildings are scattered and are in only fair condition. The drill hall is in poor condition.\n\nI knew very little about stock but was not impressed with the cattle that had been purchased for the school. They were producing very little milk per head at the time of my visit.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa - Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Elkhorn School has now 116 pupils in residence and the Rev. F. Eley, the Principal, is proceeding shortly to the Little Saskatchewan Reserve to bring in a number of others, who according to information received from the Anglican Missionary there and the Indian Agent for that part, are desirous of being admitted to this School.\n\nAs all schools are allowed, I believe, a certain number of pupils over and above the capacity I shall be grateful if, in the case of this School, our Society may be permitted to enroll say an additional six pupils, thus bringing the maximum enrollment up to 126 pupils, the number which can safely and comfortably accommodated.\n\nFor your information I may say that I have consulted Mr. Inspector Bunn in this matter and he approves of the above recommendation.\n\nPrompt reply will oblige\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the pupilage at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a grant will be allowed from the last instant for an average attendance up to 120 pupils. As the residential schools are allowed to enroll an excess of one pupil for every 20 grant earners, the Elkhorn School may, therefore, enroll 6 extra pupils in excess of the number for which grant will be paid, or a total enrolment of 126 pupils. This is the full number of pupils that should be in residence. We note that there are now 116 pupils in residence, and approval is, therefore, granted for the enrolment of 10 more pupils. The total enrolment at this school at any one time is not to exceed 126 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that a per capita grant for 120 pupils is being provided at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School from the 1st instant. The school will also be allowed to keep one pupil in excess for every 20 for which the grant is paid. This will allow for a total enrolment of 126 pupils, the full number for which accommodation can be provided. There are at present 116 pupils in residence, and permission is being granted Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, to recruit up to 126 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nReg. Sack.\nThere are experiences which live in the memory, and become a source of constant inspiration. Such an experience was mine when I visited the Anglican Indian Residential School at Elkhorn to attend the confirmation of 65 of its scholars, 35 boys and 30 girls. As we drove down the Main Drive to the residence of the Principal, the Rev. Fred Riley, we noted the tidy shipshape appearance of the grounds and buildings. Across the front entrance of the School was a banner with the words \"WELCOME TO OUR BISHOP,\" and we could see by the faces of some of the children we passed that they meant it, and were all agog with excitement over the visit of their Bishop, and the coming Confirmation. At the supper hour we saw all the children, 127 of them, and very bright happy children they seemed to be as they marched in to their light cheery dining-room to the tune of \"Onward Christian Soldiers.\" In the grace which was sung, and in the responsive service after supper, which was led by the Principal, they showed by their hearty response that they not only knew the service, but thoroughly enjoyed it. The Bishop spoke to them for a few minutes on Ascension Day and its message, and the close attention and eager response to his questions gave ample proof of an intelligence and an alertness of mind which would do credit to any body of children in Canada.\n\nA splendid discipline prevailed, a discipline evidently based on loyalty to the School, and affection for the Principal and his staff, for there was an entire absence of fear and nervousness on the part of the scholars, every face was radiant with smiles and happiness. The Confirmation Service was held in the Parish Church, and the whole school was present, filling the entire body of the Church. The Rector of the Parish, Rev. J.E. Finch, conducted Evensong and the Rev. S.R. Hammond read the Lessons, and the hearty manner in which the congregation sang the responses and joined in the service would put to shame our average congregations.\n\nThen the Confirmation Service. The Bishop spoke to the candidates from the last verse of Psalm 106: \"Through God we shall do great acts,\" and they listened with rapt attention as he spoke to them in simple eloquent words of the mystery of Confirmation, and the possibilities of a life which possessed the consecratedness of Confirmation, and the Living Presence of the Holy Spirit. When the Rev. Principal presented the confirmees there was no question in the minds of any as to whether they were duly purposed, there was abundant proof in their earnest demeanour, and in the spiritual atmosphere which prevailed during the whole of the service, a thoroughly sound spiritual preparation. It was a most impressive and inspiring sight, those long lines of Indian Children as with earnest serious faces they came...\nforward to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit in the laying on of hands. It was a service full of promise, a wonderful tribute to the work of Rev. Klay and those associated with him, and a striking commentary on the words of the text \"Through God we shall do great acts\".\n\nThe following morning we were shown over the School, and its various buildings. Everywhere there was the utmost cleanliness. Every room was bright and cheerful, and as comfortable as one could make it. The dormitories well lighted and aired, with the beds covered with the red and white counterpanes. The School-room with every facility for efficient work; the power-house, kitchen, store-rooms, everywhere evidence of careful businesslike management, and a keen eye for details.\n\nA drive around the farm and an early lunch at the School brought to a close a most enjoyable visit. The Rev. Principal and Mrs. Klay were the souls of hospitality, and we left the town of Elkhorn feeling that the Canadian Church should know more of the wonderful work which under God's grace is being accomplished in the School by Rev. Klay and his staff. Let us not cease to pray for them that this work may continue to receive the abundant blessing of God.\n\nS. R.

If half the stories are true which I hear, there is something wrong with the Elkhorn School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

(RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\nOttawa, July 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, reporting that some six children, who are on holiday from the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, appear to be suffering from tuberculosis and that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction concerning the treatment they received at the school. Please make a definite statement as to the complaints that have been made, so that the Department can take action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

There are certain reasons why the Department would like to have this special report on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School at the present time. If an inspector has not already visited the institution to this end, please make arrangements at the earliest possible date. I am interested particularly in the general management of the school and the care and training of the children enrolled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., June 2nd, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to inform you that I visited the Elkhorn Residential School on the 28th ultimo and noted conditions in a general way at this institution. I went through the school building from the basement to the top floor and found it clean and tidy throughout. I was particularly pleased with the basement. Last year there was rather a sour smell in the dairy; this has been eliminated and the air is pure and fresh throughout the building. The dormitories are kept well aired, and there was no disagreeable smell in any part of the building. The Principal informed me that they had no difficulty in keeping the building warm and comfortable during the severe winter months. I took particular notice of the condition of the boys' and girls' toilets throughout the building, and noted that they were kept in a clean condition. The inside toilets are being used regularly. I visited the septic tank which appears to be functioning in a satisfactory manner, as there is no disagreeable odour from the point where the fluid is discharged. The washrooms in the basement are small, and there has been practically no provision made for inside recreation rooms for the girls.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nThere are now 129 pupils in the school, and they presented a cleanly appearance and were well clothed. There were four who were being kept in the infirmary on account of their physical condition. Dr. Johnson of Elkhorn looks after the health of the children at this institution and the Principal tells me he is giving very good satisfaction, being very thorough in connection with his work.\n\nI visited the children's dining-room during their noon meal hour and noted the food they were getting. Their meal consisted of meat, potatoes, beans, a milk pudding and good bread. They appeared to have all they wanted to eat and I considered that they presented a well-nourished appearance. They had eleven cows milking at the time of my visit and the Farmer informed me that these cows were giving 22 gallons of milk per day. This would provide a little over a pint per head for the pupilage including the staff, but I may say that they do not get the full benefit of this milk as I found that they were making about 30 lbs. of butter a week, and a great deal of the milk given to the children is separated milk, which has not much food value.\n\n**STAFF**\n\nThe staff at this school at the present time appear to be getting along very harmoniously. There have been a number of changes made recently. Miss Hart, the boys' supervisor, has been replaced by Miss Reed, and Mrs. Duncan who was cook has been replaced by Mrs. Hall. Mr. Harris succeeded Mr. Minnielly as Farming Instructor and Mr. W. A. Harrison succeeded Mr. Tate as engineer.\nI gathered that previous to the making of these changes there was a lack of harmony and co-operation and a great deal of back-biting amongst the staff, which had a bad effect on the work. I regret to report that the Principal and his wife spoke very strongly regarding the attitude taken by Nurse Colvin when she visited the school last winter.\n\nMr. Eley complains that she sided with the malcontents and interfered in matters which were not her concern at all, and it had the effect, not only of disturbing the harmony but set a bad example to the children by criticising the Principal of the school in their presence. Mr. Eley, as I said before, spoke very strongly, and said that while he would welcome the visits of any nurse which might be sent, he did not want Nurse Colvin to be permitted to return to the school. There were certain charges made by this Nurse in her report of last February, regarding the treatment of the children by Miss Hart, the boys' supervisor. As Miss Hart is no longer at the school I consider this matter closed. I found the discipline at the school very good, and saw or heard nothing which would lead me to think that the children were not receiving kindly and sympathetic treatment.\n\nWith reference to the statement made by the Nurse, that children were sent to the dormitories at supper time for three weeks with only dry bread to eat and nothing to drink, as a punishment for laughing at table, the Principal said that this was a deliberate mis-statement of facts. He stated that in some instances children were sent to the dormitories as a punishment for infraction of discipline, but in all such cases their meals were taken to them\nin the dormitories; they were not deprived of their food. He stated that he attempted to explain this matter to Nurse Colvin and she would not believe him. He considered her attitude towards him in connection with this matter as insulting.\n\nThe foregoing will show you the feeling towards the Nurse at this school. I was, of course, only able to hear one side of the story, as the other parties affected by the report are no longer there and I feel it my duty to let you know the situation as it was presented to me. I may say, however, that I heard enough while at the school to convince me that the situation was an impossible one, and it is my opinion that the Nurse showed a lack of tact in permitting such a situation to arise in connection with her visit. It appears to me that she took upon herself responsibilities that she should have passed on to the Doctor, and to the Principal of the school. For example, I noticed a list of 67 children posted up in the dispensary for whom she had ordered tonics. It seems to me that instead of taking this action she should have referred these cases to the Doctor for attention. In any event it is wrong, and not conducive to getting results to have such a spirit of antagonism existing between officers of the Department.\n\nSTOCK\n\nI may say that I found the stock in good condition. The cows have a much healthier and better cared for appearance than they presented at the time of my visit about a year ago.\nThe Farming Instructor is a married man and is living in the farm house. He appears to be a very energetic worker and the Principal is greatly pleased with him. They have the following acreage seeded to crop this year:\n\n- 75 acres Crops\n- 23 \" Barley\n- 10 \" Corn\n- 3 \" Sunflowers\n- 11 \" Potatoes\n- 5 \" Garden\n\nThis leaves 30 acres of land for summerfallow.\n\nTheir farm land is badly infested with noxious weeds, particularly twitch grass, which is a very difficult weed to eradicate. In my opinion they should have at least one-third of their cultivated land in summerfallow until they get it cleaned up.\n\nI may say in conclusion that the appearance of the premises at this institution indicate that the Principal is taking an interest in his work. I noted an improvement in the whole appearance of the place since my last visit. Owing to the place having been neglected for so long it will take a little time to get it into first class condition.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Department #106-0-1, dated the 19th instant, referring to Department letter of the 11th of February, 1926 on the subject of the submission of a report on the Alkern Indian Residential School. This institution was visited by Inspector W. Morrison on the 28th of May, 1925, and I find that through inadvertence a copy was not forwarded to the Department. It is enclosed herewith, and probably the Department may find in it the information they desire to procure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, No.106-0-1.\n\nAndrew McKay, of Dauphin River, makes the complaint that his boy came home sick.\n\nMrs. Andrew Stevens, of Birch River, makes the complaint that her children are not well fed and that one of her boys died and she was not notified in time that he was sick.\n\nHenry Anderson, of Little Saskatchewan, makes the complaint that his boys were compelled to steal by the bigger boys.\n\nMrs. Robert Kekwash, of Crane River, complains that her children were not kept clean and did not get sufficient to eat.\n\nAll these parents complain that when their children came home for holidays they were not properly clothed.\n\nCouncillor Eddie McDonald, Crane River, complains that the Principal Mr. Sly was never in the school when he was there.\n\nWhen the Crane River children from Elkhorn arrived at Alonsa, the parents took them to Dr. Waldon and Dr. Waldon advises me that 7 out of the 11 were not in good condition and should be under the doctor's care at the present time.\n\nThe Asst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nThe majority of\nThe majority of these parents all advise me that they will not have their children return to the Elkhorn School; and unless something is done to change conditions at Elkhorn, it will be impossible to get these children back after holiday's.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, concerning complaints by parents of pupils of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. A thorough investigation into conditions at this school was made by Mr. Inspector Murison two months ago. I am satisfied that the stories that have been brought to your ears are in the main ill-founded. As you are aware, it is quite common for Indian parents, who do not wish their children to remain at a residential school, to do everything possible to delay their return after the expiration of the holiday period.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison was specifically requested to enquire into discipline, diet and health conditions and I am pleased to state that he found the building clean, tidy and comfortable throughout. The pupils were clean and well clothed and their diet very satisfactory. He reports that the medical officer is painstaking in his efforts; that the present staff are working as a unit; that the discipline is very good and that he believes the children are receiving kindly and sympathetic treatment.\n\nI am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the children of your agency, who are on leave from the Elkhorn School, to return promptly at the end of their summer leave. I should be grateful if you would bend every energy to this end. Some months ago there was difficulty at the school, largely due to lack of harmony among the members of the staff. Changes in the personnel have eliminated this trouble, which was indirectly creating considerable dissatisfaction on the part of the pupils themselves.\n\nYou should inform Indian parents that the Department is carefully supervising the conditions at the Elkhorn School; that we believe them to be very satisfactory and that their children must be returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\nAs I pointed out to you in a former letter, I wanted an investigation re management of the Elkhorn School, on account of the condition the children were in when they arrived home. You will understand the difficulty in getting the children back to the Elkhorn School, as these children were all in good health when I took them from Crane River.\n\nThe reports about these children have gone all round among my Indians and the result is that the parents will not consent to any children going back to Elkhorn. Joe McKay from the Dauphin River has been sick since he returned from Elkhorn. Wm. Bruce, Frank Bruce and Jemima Shorting of the Little Saskatchewan Band, who were at the Elkhorn School, are very sick. The Doctor says they will not live long.\n\nI would recommend that all Elkhorn School children be allowed to stay on their reserves for one year, until such time as we can show these Indians that conditions are improved at the Elkhorn School.\n\nI do not think it advisable to force these children back, as it would be a case of force and I do not think the Department can blame these parents very much. We took these children in good faith, and until we have a new management at the Elkhorn School, I do not consider it fair to ask these children to go back.\n\nFrom what I can learn and the reports I receive, I am under the impression what they require at Elkhorn School is a change in the principal, as I do not consider Mr. Bley capable of handling the situation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\nOttawa, September 9, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, on July 10th, advised the Department there was a great deal of dissatisfaction in his agency, concerning the treatment that the Indian boys and girls received at the Elkhorn Residential School. He suggested an investigation. I asked Mr. Ogletree for a definite statement in connection with the complaints and he named parents from various reserves, who complained of sickness in the school, improper feeding and that the children were unclean. Our agent also stated that the Crane River parents, when their children arrived home for holiday, took them to Dr. Waldon at Alonza and Dr. Waldon advised him that 7 out of the 11 were not in good condition and should be under doctor's care.\n\nOn July 27th I informed Mr. Ogletree that a thorough investigation into conditions at Elkhorn was made by Mr. Inspector Murison, in May, and that the Department was satisfied the stories that had come to his ears were in the main ill-founded. I recapitulated Mr. Murison's remarks concerning discipline, diet and health conditions and added:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the children of your agency, who are on leave from the Elkhorn School, to return promptly at the end of their summer leave. I should be grateful if you would bend every energy to this end. Some months ago there was difficulty at the school, largely due to lack of harmony among the members of the staff. Changes in the personnel have eliminated this trouble, which was indirectly creating considerable dissatisfaction on the part of the pupils themselves. You should inform Indians parents that the Department is carefully studying the conditions at the Elkhorn School, that we believe them to be very satisfactory and that their children must be returned.\"\n\nOn August 11th, Mr. Ogletree writes that he considers the Department should hold an investigation concerning the management of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. He writes in part as follows:\n\n\"The reports about these children have gone all round among my Indians and the result is that the parents will not consent to any children going back to Elkhorn. Joe McKay from the Dauphin River has been sick since he returned from Elkhorn. Wm.

I am recapitulating, for the information of Mr. Commissioner Graham, the correspondence which the Department has had with you in this connection and I am asking him for a recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant #106-0-1, dealing with conditions at the Elkhorn School, and I note the recommendations made by Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree.\n\nI am not prepared to say that conditions are as they should be at the Elkhorn School, but I am satisfied in my own mind that the recommendations of Mr. Ogletree are not wise. The idea of allowing children to remain out of school for one year is absurd. If conditions are to be improved they can be improved in one month if the Department will take prompt and proper action. I may say that we have trouble on almost all reserves in getting children to attend school. Mr. Ogletree is far from being a success as an Indian Agent, and I very seldom act on his recommendations without personally investigating the matters in question, either personally or through an Inspector. However, I am not saying that conditions at Elkhorn are good, and I will either go there myself or have an Inspector go and investigate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11B of the 14th instant, concerning conditions at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I shall be grateful for your report or that of the Inspector at the earliest possible date, so that definite action can be taken with reference to the children from the Portage agency who have not yet been returned following the expiration of their leave.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I visited the Elkhorn Industrial School, for the purpose of investigating certain charges made against the Principal, by Indian Agent Ogilvie of the Portage la Prairie Agency. I felt that I would like to go down to the school personally, in order that I might see for myself just how things were, and I must say that I was agreeably surprised. The whole school building, from basement to garret, I found in immaculate condition. I visited the dormitories and found good comfortable beds, with plenty of blankets and sheets on each bed, and the bedding was clean. The Matron informed me that the flannelette sheets are changed once every two weeks, which I think is quite often enough. I tested the waterworks in each dormitory and found them in splendid shape. The windows were all down and the dormitories well ventilated. On making inquiry I was told that these windows are kept open continuously except when there is a pouring rain or heavy snow. I examined the clothing supply and found it to be abundant, in fact I would say enough to equip a school with double the number of pupils. The underclothing of the boys and girls is changed regularly, and each child has a bath once a week. I next visited the dispensary and found it in the very best of shape. A complete record is kept of what has been given to each child in the way of drugs, and the result. The dining-room was in perfect order; stables and floor were shining, and the kitchen was all that could be desired. The engine room and boiler room were like the engine room of a ship.\n\nI then visited the pumping, sewage and lighting plant in a separate building, where I found everything in splendid shape. The stables were also in good order. The roots have been harvested and I am told the school will have about 1800 bushels of potatoes, a large quantity of carrots - sufficient for their use during the winter, and over 2000 cabbages. The driveway leading up to the school was in excellent shape, and is just such a driveway as one would expect to see at a well-kept, well-run institution.\n\nThe school\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\nThe school have thirteen Holstein cows, which were giving about twelve gallons of milk per day at the time of my visit. This, of course, is not sufficient. They also have five horses, four sows and 25 chickens.\n\nThe field crop consists of 2500 bushels oats and barley. Their summerfallow has given them a lot of trouble, as it is polluted with twitch grass. The land has been plowed twice and disced four or five times and it is just a mass of twitch grass roots. It will take a lot of work and time to eradicate this weed.\n\nI examined all the children in the school, and with two exceptions I never saw a healthier lot. One boy has a slight enlargement of the neck, and the other a small swelling behind the ear. Both these cases are being attended to by the Doctor. I went into the question of food supply, and I find that it appears to be ample, although it might be well to increase the milk supply and add a little more meat. In this the Doctor agrees with me, but he will not admit that they are underfed, and I quite agree with him. My recommendation is that they do not use separated milk for the children, but give them the whole milk, and instead of twelve gallons a day they should have twenty. When this is supplied, conditions would be ideal. I saw the children at their evening meal, which consisted of three thick slices of bread spread with pure lard, a bowl of hot soup, stewed prunes, and tea with sugar and milk, - rather a fair meal, I would say. They were not restricted to the quantity of bread mentioned, but could have more if they asked for it. The tables are supervised by two members of the staff, who remain with the children during the meal. In the mornings they receive oatmeal porridge with sugar and milk or syrup, bread with lard or jam and tea. Before leaving the school I made it a point to see the Doctor, and he informs me that in his opinion the children are well fed, but that it might be well to have a little more milk, and also a little added to the beef supply. I have requested the Principal to add a little more meat to the menu, and to see that the children get whole milk instead of separated milk.\n\nI have before me your letter of September 8th., containing an excerpt from Mr. Ogletree's letter of August 11th, in which he states that the parents will not consent to any children returning to Elkton. It seems to me that if the parents thought they could keep their children at home from school they would not be above trying to trump up excuses for the purpose, especially if the Agent encourages them in this by believing everything they tell him, without endeavoring to obtain the true facts of the case. His recommendation that the children should be allowed to remain at home on their reserves for a year until matters are improved is absurd. This school is as well conducted as any school we have in the province. The Agent says that he does not think the Department can blame these parents very much for not sending their children back to Elkton. I blame the parents very much, and I do not think they had very much encouragement from the Agent to send them back. On the 10th. of August last, Mr. Ogletree wrote to Mr. Eley, complaining of certain children who had returned home from the school suffering from T.B. glands. Amongst others he mentioned Peter Moar. This boy had not been in school for over a year, as he did not return from holidays in 1925. Another case was that of Mary Ann Moar, whom the Principal states is not and\nnever has been enrolled at Elkhorn School. Helen and Mary Ahmo are also mentioned as being ill as a result of treatment received at Elkhorn school, neither of whom are or ever were enrolled there. I do not think the Department need go much further into Agent Ogletree's statements. There is no justification for his remarks at all. The lack of his going in and making complaints about children returning home sick from the school, who have never been there, is sufficient proof to me that he does not know very much about the subject he is dealing with. I think Agent Ogletree should be severely censured for sending in such unfounded and damaging reports on this school. You know as well as I do that any person who wants to listen to the complaints of the Indians and agree with them can make a great deal of trouble, and I believe that is what has been done in this case.\n\nMy recommendation is that the Department supply this school with four additional horses, as they have only five at the present time, which number is not sufficient for their needs. I would also ask that they be given four more cows, which owns. I think the Department should insist on the school being filled to a capacity of 120 pupils without delay, as I feel sure the children who are attending this school are getting as good a training as they would get anywhere in the West. I found a well balanced staff here. The female members, from the cook to the matron, were all dressed in white uniforms, such as are worn by nurses. The Farming Instructor knows his business, and judging from the condition in which I found the engines and machinery in general, I would say the engineer is well qualified. The Principal has no Assistant, as the man who was filling this position was recently transferred to Alberta. I hope no time will be lost in providing him with an Assistant, as he will have too much to do with the full number of children in the school. At the time of my visit there were 69 children in residence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nNotes on letter received from Indian Agent Ogletree\nFortage la Prairie, dated August 10th, 1925.\n\n1. McKay, who is reported sick, left this School in excellent health in June of this year. He was never a day sick while in residence. Mary Moar was seen by the Medical officer here before leaving on holidays. Louise Moar was also pronounced well enough to go home, although her return to the school was not recommended by the M.O. Peter Moar has not been in residence here for over a year, as he did not return from holidays in 1925. Mary Ann Moar is not and never has been enrolled at this school. Margaret Moar was examined by the Dr. before leaving here for holidays. Helen Ahmo is not and never has been enrolled at this school. Mary Ahmo is not and never has been enrolled at this school.\n\n2. With respect to the charges made by the Indians, I beg to make the following statements:\n   1. These sick cases were direct result of these pupils being sent to the School. This is obviously impossible, as tubercular diseases are of slow growth and development, and, while T.B. in some form is present in all these children it usually manifests itself in an active form at ages varying from 12 to 18 years. In addition to this fact when these children were brought in their general health etc., was so poor, that there was serious discussion as to the advisability of keeping them here, since when every effort was made to improve their health.\n   2. These children were not clothed properly. These children were living in such poverty and dirt that they had no clothing fit to stand the rough cold journey. Therefore, before they could come into the school we were obliged to send them a supply of warm clothing, which they wore to come in to the school. In spite of this they arrived in a filthy condition, infested with head lice and other vermin. Upon leaving here this summer for holidays, every child was provided with a bountiful lunch, a complete outfit of clean clothing and a kit-bag (bearing pupil's name, number, and the name of the school) containing an additional supply of clothing. List of outfit is attached to this statement.\n   3. The children got bad treatment while sick. The medical care of the children is in the hands of the Medical Officer appointed by the Department of Indian Affairs, and under him, the Matron and Supervisors carry out every recommendation and order for the care of sick children. The dispensary work is regulated and supervised by the Medical Officer, and the treatment given the children is exactly what they would receive at the General Hospital in Winnipeg or any other large hospital. It is in every way superior to that given to white children in attendance at ordinary Boarding Schools. This I know from personal experience. In cases where a special diet is advised, everything is done, in our power, to follow it out.\n   4. Children had to work too hard and were compelled to play in the cold and snow. The children are not overworked in any way, and if at any time a child seems tired, the person in charge of that department arranges a change. At no time are the children compelled to play out in the cold and snow. On the contrary, the supervisors have to exercise vigilance to prevent the children from playing out in unsuitable conditions.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nweather. There was practically no snow here last winter, so that they could not have been compelled to play in it.\n\nIn reference to the statement that seven out of the eleven children examined should be in hospital, I can only repeat that these children were all seen by the M.O. before leaving here. As a matter of fact all the Indian children are suffering to a greater or less extent from syphilis or tuberculosis in some form, and should, therefore, be undergoing hospital treatment. These children referred to above arrived here filthy, infested with vermin, and starving. We CARED, CLEANED, and FED them, in an effort to counteract the evil effects of their earlier years. Unfortunately, in some cases the evil was too deep-seated, and developed in spite of the best care.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that I, with the rest of the staff, have looked after these children physically, mentally and morally as very few white children are looked after. Therefore, on their behalf I take great exception to the statements made by this or any Indian Agent in this respect. The hours of supervision are practically eighteen hours a day, so the last duty at night is a trip through the dormitories, etc., to make sure that all is well.\n\nAs for the statement that there are now three children dying who were in attendance here, I can only say that the probabilities are they would have been dead long ago, along with several others had they not been in attendance here.\n\nFred Eley\nPrincipal\n\nSept. 29th, 1926\nAll children who sent home for holiday this summer took with them the following list of clothing.\n\nBoys\n\n1 kit-bag with name, number, school, town, province printed on the outside of same.\n\nLunch provided for two meals.\n\nContaining\n\n1 suit underwear (new or in good condition)\n1 night shirt or 1 pyjamas (new or in good condition)\n2 day shirts or blouses (new or in good condition)\n1 pr. overalls\n1 pr. stockings\n1 towel and soap\n1 handkerchief\n1 tie\n1 tooth brush\n1 hair brush and comb\n1 sweater\n\nEach boy wore the day he left\u2014\n\n1 pr. boots (new)\n1 suit underwear\n1 pr. stockings (new or in good condition)\n1 handkerchief\n1 shirt or Sunday blouse.\nUniform suit or Sunday suit\n1 cap.\n\nAlso any money they had in the bank.\n\nThese children went away absolutely clean and free from head lice.\n\nAll boys were seen by Dr. Johnston prior to leaving.\n\n(sgd) Myrtle Reid\nSupervisor\n\n(sgd) C.

S.\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\nSept. 30th, 1926\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th inst. re Mr. Wheeldon, I beg to inform you that upon hearing from him a statement endorsed by Dr. Johnson will be sent forward without delay, as per your instructions.\n\nLast June certain rumours were in circulation, which, I feel certain we can trace back to Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree of Portage la Prairie. Undoubtedly he is doing his best, in his way, to secure a new Principal for the Elkhorn School, and behind all this, I feel, is Mr. Minnelli who is, Form Instructor in Mr. Ogletree's Agency.\n\nWhen interviewing Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham last week, he kindly read a copy of letter received from Ottawa, written by Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, in which was stated the fact that he, as Indian Agent, would not return the children from his agency to the Elkhorn School until a new Principal was appointed. Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham also read me his reply, in which he stated that a year ago when his Inspector visited Elkhorn, things were in a flourishing condition; but he would not commit himself at present as to whether conditions were right or wrong now. But he was of the opinion that it was not a new Principal they required, but a new Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, as he had often stated before. Confidentially, the Commissioner also told me that Indian Agent Ogletree gave him more trouble than all his other Agents put together. The Commissioner stated he would come down with his Inspector before very long and investigate things at the School then he would write Ottawa. Hence one reason for my not getting into Winnipeg this week.\n\nMr. Wheeldon, as you no doubt know, is teacher at Sandy Bay, Indian School. Councillor J. G. Shorting (Indian) whom you sent down last week to inspect the School, is also from Sandy Bay, the same Reserve. I believe that his impressions of the School were entirely favourable, as he seemed exceedingly pleased with everything here. Therefore, he should be a help to Mr. Wheeldon at this time.\n\nDr. C. W. Johnston, who is the Medical Officer appointed by the Dept. for this School, has been outside of his professional visits, a frequent visitor at all times of the night and day. Therefore, he has seen the children under all conditions, sickness, work, and play. We have on several occasions discussed matters such as: food, clothing, sanitation, recreation. Several times he has brought visiting Doctors and Specialists to inspect the School and their comments have always been highly favourable. After consulting him with Dr. Johnston this morning about this matter, he gave me his double assurance that he would both sign statements and testify as to general conditions and health.\n\nI herewith enclose a copy of letter dated August 10th, from Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree, also have attached notes on letter which may be of assistance to you. You will also find list of clothing, etc., which each boy and girl had in their kit-bag when leaving.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(sgd) Fred Eley.\n\nThe Rev. T.B. R.

Knee.\nHelen Almo, discharging ear.\nMary Almo, Goitre of the neck.\n\nThe Indians made the following statement to the Doctor:\n\nFirst. These sick cases were direct result of these pupils being sent to the school.\nSecond. These children were not clothed properly.\nThird. The children got bad treatment while sick.\nFourth. Children had to work too hard and compelled to play in the cold and snow.\n\nThe Crane River children were examined by Dr. Weldon at Alonge, on their way home and out of 11 children Dr. Weldon advises me that 7 of these should be in the Hospital, on account of the state these children were in when they returned from school. How do you expect me to have any of these children returned. When I took these children from Crane River, you promised the parents to look after them. Look at the result.\n\nThe Indians are very much excited over the condition of the children and it would take an army to return them to the Elkhorn School. I am ashamed to look any of these parents in the face. They look on me as responsible for the condition of their children for taking them away from the Reserve all these children were healthy when we took them away.\n\nWe have three children dying now at Little Saskatchewan Reserve who were in the Elkhorn School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I am convinced that the delinquents that are physically fit for institutional routine should be returned without delay - the services of the police to be used if necessary. I am not hopeful of securing best results if this matter is placed in Mr. Ogletree's hands, and I should be grateful if you would send an inspector without delay to have the pupils on the enclosed list returned to the school. Any exceptions that you wish to make, because of special reasons, will meet with the Department's approval. The Rev. Mr. Eley is being informed of this action, and, if he knows of reasons why any child should not be returned, he will communicate with you immediately.\n\nI am corresponding with the Church authorities, with a view to the improvements suggested in your report, and there will be directed to you further communications concerning any special grant for stock and equipment that can be allowed at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

He is\n20 years of age and is very highly recommended by the Rector of\nSt. John's Cathedral, Saskatoon, to whom he is very well-known,\nand also by the Principal of Emmanuel College in the same City.\nHe will enter on his duties as soon as he has given the required\nnotice to the trustees of the Canora School, and I am hopeful\nthat he may be able to discharge the duties of the office to\nwhich he has been assigned with efficiency and satisfaction.\n\nBelieve me,\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 23, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 18th instant, concerning the appointment of an assistant principal at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. E. C. G.,\n41-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to submit the following information with regard to the difficulty I have had with Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree of Portage la Prairie regarding the returning of children after Holidays from his Agency to this School, also his failure to carry out the Department's instructions with regard to the sending of five children of Mrs. Alfred Hourie of the Fairford Reserve to this School.\n\nOn August 12th, 1925 the said Indian Agent wrote to me and in a letter mentioned that the parents were dissatisfied with things at Elkhorn. He also made the statement that \"if half the stories they tell me are true I do not blame these people for refusing to have their children returned to school\". And by the tone of the letter one would take it that he did not intend to have them returned. Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree visited the school on a previous occasion and certainly was in a position to advise and tell the people the conditions at Elkhorn himself. It seems to me that he is given to listening to any story that may come along which has absolutely no foundation.\n\nAfter reporting to the said Indian Agent on November 3rd, 1925 the request made by Chief Woodhouse of the Fairford Band with reference to the admitting of the Hourie children to Elkhorn, I received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree on November 20th, 1925 stating that he had received instructions from Ottawa to return all children who had not returned from Holidays also the five of Mrs. Alfred Hourie of Fairford. This latter has never been carried out and when taking the matter up again I received a letter from you, Sir, as the Indian Commissioner, on March 15th, 1926 advising me that the agent at Portage la Prairie had been written to by the Department at Ottawa directing him to give this matter immediate attention. Since that time I have heard nothing further, but the children have not been brought to the School.\n\nOn March 22nd, 1926 I wrote Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree again upon receiving a letter from the Lord Bishop of Brandon telling me of four children living at Shoal River who should be sent to the Elkhorn School. This information I passed on in the letter mentioned above to the Indian Agent asking him to be good enough to look into the matter and advise me. In reply, received a letter dated March 25th, 1926 from Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree stating that it would be better to wait until June and bring the children down after Treaty Payments. Moreover, he invited me in this letter to accompany him on the trip to Shoal River for Treaty Payments. However, for some unknown reason he wrote me on April 28th, 1926 to the effect that his plans had changed but if he decided to go to Shoal River later he would let me know. Since that date I have heard nothing in regard to his trip or the children.\n\nUpon receiving instructions from the Department at Ottawa regarding Holidays for the Summer of 1926 I wrote to each Indian Agent giving them the said information, and also gave word for word the paragraph with reference to the fact that children were not allowed to go home unless special protection was made for the safeguard of their return at the expiring of their holidays, to the school.\nMoreover, in spite of this Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree sent word through others ordering the returning of most of the children from his Agency. As I did not have Transportation Requisitions on hand at the time word was sent back to the Indian Agent to this effect. The following Sunday morning during Divine Service he called up the School by Long Distance. The Matron answered the telephone and I am told by Miss Lindsay that Mr. Ogletree was decidedly rude to her. Tickets were then wired by the Indian Agent to Elkhorn and the children went home for their holidays.\n\nYou will understand, Sir, on account of the geographical situation of this school, the difficulties of obtaining children etc. to fill the School. When we have the co-operation of Indian Agents and Missionaries one does not mind but if an Indian Agent like Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree is allowed to take such a stand it seems to me that he is seriously hindering not only the work of this School but the Great Work of The Department in the education of Indians.\n\nI am, Sir, putting the best years of my life into this work on account of the early years spent on the Indian Reserves and conditions witnessed there. I am fully of the opinion that children in residence in such a school as this are certainly given a chance in life, if they wish to make use of it later on, a chance they would never have living on an Indian Reserve.\n\nI shall be most grateful and appreciate it very much, Sir, if you will kindly give me advice upon such a matter stated. Thanking you for your kindness and interest in the past.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Fred Eley.\nPrincipal.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nGFD/FE.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. January 13th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th September No. 106-0-1 and subsequent correspondence, with reference to the difficulty in getting the children to return to the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, and the suggestion of Indian Agent Ogletree that an investigation be held into the manner in which the children are treated at that institution, I beg to inform you that I again visited the Elkhorn school last week for a few hours, and while there I examined the children and have nothing to say further than what was said to you in my letter of the 8th October last. I think that the Principal is doing good work, but he is laboring under many disadvantages. I am quite sure that Mr. Ogletree, the Indian Agent at Portage, from which agency a great many of the children come, is of very little assistance to him, and Mr. Eley's work is made more difficult on that account.\n\nMr. Ogletree is holding down a good position at Portage la Prairie, and a great deal could be done there if we had the right kind of an Agent. He is most disagreeable with everybody and he is not aggressive. I have no faith in his ability to carry out any important instructions, and it seems too bad that this man should stand in the way of the progress of the Indians. The Swan Lake reserve in the Portage Agency has made most outstanding progress in the last four years; it has come up from nothing to be one of the most progressive reserves in the country, and the Government should be proud of it. At Long Plain there has also been progress. This is attributable to the fact that the Inspectors and the Instructors are carrying it on almost independently of the Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Eley, Principal of the Elkhorn School, has a big job on his hands, and he should receive all the assistance possible from the Department. My only reason for supporting him strongly in this matter is that I know he is in earnest and is energetic. He has possibly made some minor mistakes, but these are of little importance. He is energetic and has a fairly good idea of what should be done. I was unable when there to purchase cows and horses for him. There are none in the district and they will have to be located elsewhere and shipped in.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I received from Mr. Eley before I visited the school, with reference to his difficulties with Mr. Ogletree. I have already reported to you that Inspector Christianson and Mr. Eley are now in northern Manitoba for the purpose of getting children to return to the school who did not return last September, and I claim that if we had the right man at Portage la Prairie as Agent it would not have been necessary to send an Inspector to do this kind of work. Our Inspectors are kept on the jump all the time, and to have to send them to attend to matters of this kind on account of inefficient Agents makes it difficult to carry on. The weather at the present time is very severe and I have some anxiety regarding getting the children to the school, as they will have to travel long distances in covered bobsleighs.\n\nI have already suggested that, if it is proposed to continue Mr. Ogletree on in the position of Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, he be written to and told very emphatically what is expected of him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 209-11B of the 13th instant, concerning the return of children to the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I have read the copy of the communication from the Rev. Principal. Your remarks with reference to the Indian agent at Portage la Prairie are receiving consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have returned from making a visit to the Elkhorn Indian Residential School and I was greatly pleased with all that I saw there. Mr. Eley is very energetic and has the place in good shape, and one of the most wonderful gardens I ever saw, about five acres in all. In addition to this he has ten acres of potatoes, 75 acres oats, 25 acres barley, and 30 acres of summerfallow. The work on the summerfallow was well done.\n\nMr. Eley has made arrangements with a farmer who owns 300 acres of hay land to cut and stack all the hay on this 300 acres, the school to get two-thirds of the quantity. In order that he might do this in short order and secure the hay I have taken it upon myself to authorize him to purchase another mowing machine, as it would be impossible to carry on this work with one machine in view of the large quantity of hay that will be put up, and also other pressing work. Ordinarily one machine would have done, but this is a great opportunity to secure hay and the extra machine is badly needed.\n\nThe children, some forty in number, who were at the school at the time of my visit were all in good health. The milk supply is quite adequate, and I am glad to report this because we have always had trouble here through not having a sufficient quantity of milk for the number of children, and this difficulty has now been overcome.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM.

I hope that it will be finished early in December. We would like very much to have a brief message from you to our readers, who will include various supporters of the School, graduates, parents and pupils.\n\nSchool routine has settled down for another winter's work, and we are looking forward to it with pleasure.\n\nWith personal regards,\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.

Residential School,\nElkhorn, Man.\nIndian Industrial School,\nELKHORN, MANITOBA.\n\nMay 8th, 1918\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou will I am sure understand just what it all means to me giving up the work here, in the which I have been engaged since 1890, and parting with my girls and boys whom I have become so much attached to; but circumstances have been such as to bring this about and our school of which we have all been so proud has now practically passed out of existence much to our deep regret.\n\nI do so trust, however, that the pupils who have gone out from here will make good use of the training they have received and will succeed in the various occupations of life they may enter and so reflect credit on themselves and their Alma Mater.\n\nIn regard to myself, I may say that for several years past I have felt the strain of Institution Life and the heavy responsibilities connected with it and as you know I have also had family sorrows to bear all of which have helped to bring about a very much run-down condition of health.\n\nDr. Goodwin, under whose treatment I have been for sometime past says, that, I am quite broken down in health and that it is absolutely necessary that I have a complete rest for a protracted period, and he has given me a certificate of health to this effect, a copy of which is herewith enclosed.\n\nI feel the need of a complete change and rest for a good long period; but It would be impossible for me to consider\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa.\nconsider having this, unless the Department would kindly grant me an extended leave of absence on salary.\n\nAfter I have settled up my affairs here I will have little left, and it would be out of the question for me to think of taking the rest I need, unless I were on salary and had the means to provide for the expense I would be under while away and the support of those who are dependent on me.\n\nI should feel most grateful to the Department, if a year's leave of absence on salary were granted to me, and I trust, owing to the condition of my health, the long service I have had and the sudden termination of what I had so hoped would have been my life's work, that, my request will receive your kindly consideration.\n\nI don't know just how long it may take to get everything packed up at the school and shipped away, if this should be the wish of the Department; but, I should be glad to be allowed to remain in our present home until July next, as this would allow of my children completing this school term and give me the time I want to go over the correspondence, returns, documents, etc., which have accumulated during the past 28 years and which will not again be required.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\nApril 22nd, 1918.\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. A.E. Wilson is under my care for neurasthenia and anemia. He has been at work steadily for a great number of years with practically no holiday. He has had a life full of worry over school matters, and also the worst worry a man can have over family matters. He is quite broken down in health. It is absolutely necessary for him to have a complete rest for a protracted period.\n\nSigned. R. Goodwin, M.D.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn my letter of the 15th inst., I thanked you for your exceedingly kind letter of the 11th inst., and said that I would reply to it more fully within the course of a few days. It was a great relief to me to receive your letter and I deeply appreciate the kindly consideration you have shown both for Miss Vidal and myself.\n\nIt is very difficult for me to know, just at the present time, what is really the best thing for me to do or what plans to make for the future, as so much depends on you and what you may consider advisable in my case.\n\nFor instance my Mother, who is very frail and in declining health, is very desirous that I should move out to B.C., with my family, and be near her during the closing years of her life. This is also what all the members of my family who are living there wish; but, more particularly since this school, which was established by my late Father, is now closed.\n\nI should very much like to move out to B.C. after my work is finished here, but, more particularly for the Winter as I feel that the change and rest out there would be most beneficial not only to myself but also to Miss Vidal and the family. This would, however, necessitate heavy expenses in moving and as we would have no home to go to it would also mean renting a house which with the additional high cost of living would make it most difficult for me to manage on my present salary.\n\nAs regards continuing in the Service. It is very necessary that I should do this, as I have spent the best years of my life in the Indian Work and owing to my not being in good health and having nothing on which to retire it means everything to myself and those dependent on me to be allowed to continue. This is one of the questions troubling me and which makes it difficult for me to make any plans for the future, as I have no idea of what you may wish me to do, or where you may send me, after my extended leave of absence should have expired.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa.\nWhen you and Mrs Scott were here in September 1912, you thought that I was entitled to a visit to Ottawa, as it was then over a number of years since I had been there, and you then very kindly expressed your willingness to allow me to go; but, at that time and since I have not seen my way clear to accept your kind offer. I should now, however, feel most grateful to be allowed to go and to have the privilege of consulting with you personally, in regard to my extended leave of absence, my future employment in the Service, the length of time it may be possible for you to allow Miss Vidal and myself to remain in the service here, and also in regard to matters connected with the disposal of the equipment still in the school and the final winding up of affairs here.\n\nThe Lists of the Government property which I was instructed by the Department, in its letter of the 10th inst. No.116823/1, to send to the Principals of the different Church of England schools mentioned have been sent out and some have since been returned to me as directed. When they have all been received I will forward them to the Department as instructed. I might mention, however, that some of the articles shown on the lists are, in my opinion, hardly worth shipping to other schools. Several of the articles of furniture are homemade and of little worth, also some of the equipment which was sent to our school from the Rupert's Land Industrial School, after the fire there, is in a very much worn condition and would not be of much value to whatever school the Department might decide to send it.\n\nThere is also the stationary equipment, such as the gasolene engines, gas machines, and laundry machinery, most of which are embedded in cement\u2014which would have to be taken down and packed for shipment and this would require the help of mechanics. Mr. Jas. Goldie, formerly mechanical instructor at the school, has obtained employment in Winnipeg, and other help would have to be obtained, if the Department should decide to dispose of all this equipment.\n\nI thought that, if you would kindly sanction my going to Ottawa, I could take the Lists with me and go over them with you and then receive your final instructions in regard to the disposal of everything here. It would mean much to me, in this my time of doubt and difficulty about so many things, to be allowed to see you personally and I would appreciate the concession more than I can say.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nJuly 5, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nI have your letter of June 29th. I do not think any good purpose would be served by incurring the expense of bringing you to Ottawa at the present time. When Mr. Graham was here I discussed with him the question of distributing the supplies of the school, and asked him to undertake the disposal of this property, so that we might know when the institution was finally closed. It was never the intention to move such bulky machinery as the gasoline engines, gas machines and laundry machines.\n\nI am quite at a loss how to consider your outlook for the future; personally I would like to continue you in the service of the Department, but it is extremely difficult to find anything for which you are specially fitted. I think that you would enjoy living in British Columbia, but there is no Indian work in\n\nA. E. Wilson, Esq.,\nIndustrial School,\nElkhorn, Man.\nthat province to which you could be assigned; if you went there to live with the idea that you might sever your connection with the Department and find some congenial employment, it might be possible that you would be successful. Under these considerations we would give you the year's leave of absence.\n\nI must have an opportunity of discussing this matter with the Hon. Mr. Meighen when he comes back from London.\n\nI did not count on keeping Miss Vidal on the pay-list longer than the end of December.\n\nI am sympathetic with your present position, but it seems quite impossible for me to be more definite than I have been, but you might write me further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nAfter receiving your kind letter of the 5th inst., I communicated with my Mother and relatives in B.C. and have since received word to the effect that it would be most unwise of me to go to the expense of moving my family and Miss Vidal out to the Coast without the assurance of some employment in the Service after my extended leave of absence should have expired. I have therefore decided to give up all idea of going to the Coast, as, in face of the heavy travelling expenses which would be incurred, the very limited means at my disposal, the high cost of living out there, the present condition of my health and there being no position in the Service which you could offer me, it would be folly for me to attempt the undertaking, and with this I am sure you will agree.\n\nIt would now appear that the only alternative is for myself, family and Miss Vidal to remain in our present home as long as you will kindly allow us to do so, and for me to get out and around as much as possible and in this way obtain the change and rest I so much need.\n\nWhen Mr. Graham, Commissioner, was here he mentioned that he thought there would be no objection to our remaining in our present residence until it were needed for some other purpose and that this might not be for sometime to come. In any event it would be in the interests of the Department to have someone residing on the School premises to look after the property in general and this condition would be met by our remaining.\n\nI do so trust that the plan suggested will meet with your approval and that you will kindly allow us to remain in our present home. It will be such a relief to us all to have our plans for the future somewhat more settled than they have been, and I am sure that you feel for us in this matter.\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, the Medical Certificate which you wished me to forward and trust that it meets requirements.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nPersonal.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Aug. 20, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nYou have no doubt heard of the death of Mr. Jowett at Gleichen. This will, of course, create a vacancy at the Blackfoot Agency.\n\nMr. Mast at Carlton has expressed a desire for a change to a point where he can obtain educational facilities for his children, and I would suggest that he be transferred to the Blackfoot Agency.\n\nTo fill the vacancy at Carlton it might be a good idea to try Mr. Wilson there. There is however a disposition on his part to feel that the Department owes him a good deal. I know that the Battleford Agency was mentioned to him, but as far as I am aware he took no notice of the suggestion.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsuggestion or any steps to try and secure it. If you are prepared to consider the advisability of sending him to Carlton, I would not like him to accept the position under the impression that he is receiving consideration for past good services. He should be given to understand that he must make good there, and I should like to be in the position of being able to dispense with his services if he does not prove efficient. I believe that the question of giving him leave is under consideration but if he should be offered the position at Carlton and accept it, it is clear that he should relinquish the idea of procuring leave of absence. I make the suggestion of offering him the Clerkship at Carlton somewhat reluctantly, as our work is of such a nature that it is important appointments should be filled by capable men and those who are prepared to put every effort into their work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nAugust 29, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nI have your letter of July 31st. I had hoped that when you wrote me again you would, at least, make some suggestion as to the future, because, as I told you on July 5th, it seems it is extremely difficult to find any continued work for you in the Department, but you make no suggestion whatever as to future employment. I do not think you could administer an Indian agency successfully, and the clerical positions which would be suitable are very few.\n\nA vacancy has just occurred at the Blackfoot agency, which I have pleasure in offering you. Mr. Jewett, the clerk at that agency, died a short time ago, and we must have a competent clerk, the salary is $1,000.00 per annum with one ration and a free house. It would be necessary for you to assume this position at once and to give satisfaction to the Agent. If you do not feel inclined to accept the\n\nA. H. Wilson, Esq.,\nElkhorn, Man.\nposition, I will recommend to the Minister that you be given extended leave and that your service with the Department will terminate with the leave of absence. Kindly let me know by wire or by return mail, at the latest, as the position at the Blackfoot agency, Gleichen, Alta., must be filled immediately.\n\nAs there is no increase in salary, the transportation of yourself and family from Elkhorn to Gleichen will be paid by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n182 RA E 10 COLL\n\nELKHORN MAN SEPT 3/18.\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENL\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nGRATEFULLY ACCEPT POSITION OFFERED LETTER FOLLOWING BY\n\nFIRST MAIL\n\nA E WILSON\nSeptember 4, 1918.\n\nThe Accountant,\n\nPlease have the necessary action taken for the appointment of Mr. A.

I wired you this morning as follows. \"Gratefully accept position offered. Letter following by first mail.\" I can assure you that I will endeavour to the best of my ability to give satisfaction to the Indian Agent and to render faithful service in the new position to which you have so kindly appointed me.\n\nIf it meets with your approval I should be glad to be allowed to remain here until about the 15th inst. or until the salary cheque for August arrives, as I need funds before leaving. It means much to us to be allowed transportation for myself and family to Gleichen and I am most grateful to you for granting this concession. We propose shipping our household effects and belongings to Gleichen by car, as it will be less expense and trouble in sending in this way. I shall be glad to receive a transport requisition to cover the freight on the car, and also two railway requisitions for the railway fares of myself and daughters to Gleichen. It is my intention to leave my daughters, Melita and Muriel, to look after the packing and shipping of our household effects and when the car arrives at Gleichen I will advise them and they will follow and get things settled in our new home. Miss Vidal and my son, St Clair, will remain with friends in Elkhorn for the present.\n\nIn regard to some of the furniture, at the principal's residence, shown on the stock-sheet. I should be grateful to be allowed to take this when we move, as we will need it in our new home. It has been in use a number of years and for the sake of old associations is of more value to us than it would be to any one else. I can conscientiously say that during\nduring the 26 years I have been principal of this school I have spent a very considerable part of my income each year, directly and indirectly, in the work of the school, so that it would be some compensation and a help to myself and family, in making a start in our new home, if you would kindly allow us to have what is there.\n\nMy daughters are pleased over the thought of going further West and being nearer the Coast, and I am sure that we will find the life at the Blackfoot Agency interesting and congenial. Again thanking you for your kindly interest in our behalf and with sincere regards from us all.\n\nBelieve me.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nDuncan C.

I think you will enjoy living at the agency. It is just a few minutes walk from the town of Gleichen. We have two boarding schools on the reserve, and it is within an hour's run from Calgary. The agency is an important one and you will find plenty to do.\n\nYou are at liberty to take the furniture you mention to Gleichen, it will, of course, remain the property of the Department. I am asking the Accountant to issue your transportation. I presume the house will be vacated before the 15th, but you had better communicate with Mr. Gooderham.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On top of this, to get your letter appointing him to a far more important position, was to say the least, a great disappointment. Now Mr. Scott, you are aware that my whole interests are in the new work that has been given to me, and that I have worked night and day to make it a success. You are also aware that I have had a large experience, not only with the handling of Indians but with farming as well, and when I make recommendations\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI do so with the sole object of improving matters. When I hear of appointments such as this, it takes all the stamina out of one and gives the impression that the work is not worth while and that the Department is prepared to go along in the same old way. You know what Wilson is. I discussed him with you, while in Ottawa, and in the face of this he is sent to one of the most, if not the most important Agency in the West. I would ask you, how I can go to that Agency and expect to get the work speeded up, where such a large amount of money is handled, receipts to be given etc., with a man of Wilson's calibre? You may say that Wilson will have to make good. From this I gather that you have the idea that he will be able to make good, as otherwise you would not ask the Department to be put to the expense of sending him there.\n\nI have had very bitter experience in the past trying to get rid of incompetent men, who have not only caused me embarrassment but have cost the country thousands\nthousands of dollars through their mismanagement, to say nothing of retarding the progress of the Indians. I had thought from the understanding we had in Ottawa that nothing but competent men would be appointed for these positions for the future, and you can naturally understand how I feel in the matter and how the securing of results will be retarded by such a handicap being placed on the work.\n\nTo be candid, I cannot see how any real results are to be obtained, if we are to go along in this way. It may be that the Minister has taken this action thinking Wilson is competent, without referring the matter to you, and not knowing Mr. Wilson, in which case I have nothing to say only that I hoped you would have been able to post the Minister as to the nature of the work required and the lack of qualifications of the man who has been sent there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nSir,\n\nCOPY\n\nNight Lettergram\n\nDuck Lake, Sask\n\nOct. 5th./18\n\nTo Hon. Arthur Meighen,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nReported for duty as clerk at the Duck Lake Agency on the 26th ultimo, and have given position a trial, but find I am physically unfit to do the work required. Under the circumstances it is necessary for me to ask for the year's leave of absence and to leave the Service, as stated in the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of July fifth last.\n\nSigned, A.E. Wilson.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nOctober 4th, 1918\n\nPrivate.\n\nSir,\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham and Mr. Crombie, Inspector, were here on the 2nd inst., and I had a chat with the former in regard to my position, as clerk, at this Agency. I told him that it was utterly impossible for me to continue in this position, as I was physically unfit to do the work required. He said that you were absent from home, and advised my wiring the Hon. Arthur Meighen, Minister of the Interior, and informing him of my physical unfitness for the position and asking that I be granted the year's leave of absence and to leave the Service, as stated in your letter of July 5th last.\n\nThe Commissioner, however, did not wish his name mentioned in connection with the matter.\n\nI am, herewith, enclosing a copy of the Lettergram which is being sent to the Minister, and I sincerely trust that my request will be kindly granted.\n\nI may mention that in accordance with the instructions received from the Department, I left for the Blackfoot Agency, Gleichen, Alta., on the 23rd of Sept., to take the position of clerk there, but about two hours after my arrival, I was informed by Mr. Gooderham, Indian Agent, that, I was to be transferred to the Duck Lake Agency, and I arrived here on the 25th of Sept. I have given the position a trial, with the result that I find I am physically unfit to do the work required.\n\nIt is very necessary that I have a good long rest and a complete change, and when in better health I hope I may be able to find some lighter work, in Insurance, or some other line of work. I therefore trust that the year's leave of absence, at the rate of salary allowed me after the School was closed in May last viz. $1500.00 per annum will be kindly granted. In my present state of health and being without a home and short in funds, it will be difficult for myself and family to manage on less.\n\nThe Department has as yet been put to no expense in paying freight charges on our personal belongings and house effects being moved from Elkhorn to Gleichen, or to this place, so, that I would feel most grateful, if, you could see your way to allow freight charges on a car.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\nSir,\n\nfrom Elkhorn to Calgary, where I think it best for us to go, until our future plans have been decided upon.\n\nOur Home at Elkhorn has been broken up and the furniture, etc., all packed and ready for shipment, so that it would be better for us, in every way, to now move from there. My daughters and son are still at Elkhorn and will wait there until I have heard from the Department and am able to advise as to our future plans. The cold weather is coming on and I am most anxious to get my family settled somewhere, in a home of our own, at as early a date as possible, but, I know you will understand the situation and will do all you possibly can to help us at this trying time.\n\nI have felt the cold Winters of late very much and in my present state of health feel that it would be better for me to move further West where the weather will not be so severe. Furthermore, my Mother is again very seriously ill and she has been taken to a private Hospital in Victoria, B.C., and from recent accounts, it is not expected that she will live much longer. If we were to move to Calgary it would be less expensive for me to go and see her, than if we remained in Elkhorn, so that when everything is duly considered, I think it advisable to go further West and to make Calgary our head-quarters, at least for the time being.\n\nI trust you will pardon me for writing to you so freely about my personal affairs, which I know are of no interest to the Department, but, I do feel that you will take them into consideration and make some allowances, when deciding as to my year's leave of absence and therewith severing my 28 years service with your Department. I feel it very deeply doing this, but, under the circumstances and owing to my being so run down in health and needing a complete change and rest, I fully realize that it is the only course I can follow.\n\nAssuring you that I deeply appreciate the many kindnesses that you have shown myself and family during the many years it has been my privilege to be connected with your Department, and trusting that the Hon. Mr. Meighen, Minister of the Interior, and yourself will favourable consider my request.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa.\n\nAlways yours sincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you have forwarded a medical certificate, it has been decided that you will be allowed a year's leave of absence from the 1st of November, with pay, and, at the termination of that period, your connection with the Department is to cease. We do not feel it possible, however, to meet your wishes with reference to transportation. It may be necessary for you to furnish further medical certificates from time to time.\n\nI hope that you will be able to find something congenial to do, and that you will be very successful in what you undertake, and, if at any time I can further your interests, I shall be glad to do so.\n\nWith kind regards to yourself and Miss Wilson,\n\nI remain,\n\nA.

It is doubtful now whether I shall be able to spare the time to make another trip to the East, but I am in communication with the other representatives of the other Churches which have Indian Boarding Schools and when I hear from them, I will let you know what is likely to be done. With the enormously increased cost of living, it is claimed to be quite impossible to carry on the Schools on the present per capita grants. The Schools in Calgary seem to be in a very bad way.\n\nDo you know what has become of Mr. Wilson lately of Elkhorn? Did he obtain any employment from your Department? He was so hurt at me on account of the closing of the School that he has never communicated with me since.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. A.E. Wilson, of Elkhorn, decided that he would sever his connection with the Department and we have agreed to give him a year's leave of absence at which time he will cease to be one of our officials. You have always given him cordial support, and as you had nothing whatever to do with the closing of the school, I cannot understand his conduct.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev.

Would it be possible to get your scheme for our own utilization of these buildings on paper before very long? The Military Hospitals are considering the possibility of using them for soldiers who have become mentally unbalanced, and the Soldiers Settlement Board is considering the possibility of using the buildings. Your scheme would, of course, receive first attention, and we would not make any disposal of the buildings without considering it, but I think it would be advisable to present it without evitable delay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Please note this so that salary cheques may be sent to the new address.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nI have been intimately associated with Mr. A.E. Wilson, since he came to Victoria in November 1918, and have watched him make a manly attempt to establish himself in a new line of work, but the state of his health has as yet proved too great a handicap.\n\nAs a professional man I consider that the condition of Mr. Wilson's nerves, as well as his general physical condition, will for some time yet render him totally unfit for the steady hard work necessary for self support.\n\nD.B.

Tolmie,\nMinister of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Tolmie,\n\nIn the interview you kindly granted me, shortly before you were leaving for Ottawa, you said that I might write to you, in regard to my being granted an extension of my leave of absence and that you would take the matter up with the Department and see what further could be done for me.\n\nAt the time when I wrote to Mr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General, it was out of the question my continuing in the Service owing to the condition of my health. On this account and owing to my Mother's failing health and the desire on the part of my relatives that I should move out to B.C., I decided, after duly considering everything, that this was the wisest course to follow. Since coming here my health has improved, but I am not as yet physically fit to undertake strenuous work, or to undergo any heavy strain.\n\nI mentioned to you that I had met the late Dr. J.A.J. McKenna, shortly before he died out here, and that he had asked me about the School and what had been done for me. I told him and he said, \"Wilson you should have been granted a pension after the many years (26) you have spent in the Indian Work\". He also said, that, it would be difficult for me at my age in life and handicapped as I was, by being in ill-health and without capital, to make a new start in life. He advised my applying for an extension of my leave of absence when the time should come and said that there was no reason why it should not be granted, owing to the circumstances of my case.\n\nThe cost of moving out here, and buying such things as were needed for the house, was over $700.00. Then living expenses are very high and I have obligations to meet, which all makes me feel anxious as to the future, especially, as I am not yet physically fit to stand any strain. The work in which I am now engaged and which keeps me in the open most of my time is without doubt the best for me to follow, if I am to regain my health.\n\nIf the Department will kindly grant me an extension of my leave for six months, or at least until the end of the present\nfiscal year ending March 31st./20, I would hope by that time that I would be in good health.\n\nIn this regard, I am enclosing, herewith, a report from Doctor, D.B. Holden of this City, in which reference is made to my general physical condition. I am also enclosing a copy of the letter I wrote on Oct. 4th./18, to Mr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General, and a copy of his reply thereto.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott and Dr. H.P. Whidden, M.P., who have both shown me much kindness, will I am sure do what they further can to bring about an extension of the leave now asked, as they will fully understand the circumstances of the case.\n\nI feel deeply grateful to you and Mr. McIntosh for the very kindly interest you have shown in my behalf.

E. Wilson, Clerk in the Indian Agent's office at Duck Lake, Sask., who is now on sick leave at the coast. I promised Mr. Wilson before leaving for Ottawa to interest myself in his behalf, and since my arrival here I have received a letter from him asking me to implement my promise. Mr. Wilson enclosed copy of letter to the Hon. Dr. Tommie, Minister of Agriculture, a medical certificate from Dr. D. B. Holden, Victoria, and copy of his letter for extension to you, as well as your reply. I enclose you the two former and will be glad if you can accede to Mr. Wilson's request and be in a position to so advise me when I see you personally.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilson, formerly an officer of this Department. Mr. Wilson was granted a full year's leave with pay on retiring and I do not see how we can possibly further extend his leave. This was granted, not on account of Mr. Wilson's health, but because we had to close the Elk Horn Indian Industrial school, of which he was principal.\n\nIt is quite true that we offered to continue him in the service in a clerical position and transferred him to the Duck Lake Agency, but he stated he was physically unfit to do the work required and accepted the alternative offer, that is that he should have extended leave of absence with pay, and that his services should be terminated with the leave of absence.\n\nAs I have stated our regulations would not permit of anything more than a year's leave with pay, but I am making an explicit statement of the case because I have always been friendly to Mr. Wilson and have considered his interests on every occasion.\n\nI shall be absent from the city for a couple of weeks beginning Monday next and I thought it best to write you this letter in case you might not be able to pay me your promised visit. The subject will, however, be discussed when we meet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. C. McIntosh, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nSince you were here, I have had the pleasure of meeting Sir Henry Drayton, Minister of Finance, and in having a short chat with him in regard to the matter, which you and the Hon. Dr. Tolmie, Minister of Agriculture, have so kindly taken up on my behalf.\n\nSir Henry Drayton was most kind and sympathetic and said that he would be pleased to support yours and Dr Tolmie's efforts in the direction stated.\n\nI thought it advisable to let you know of this and I might further mention, that, owing to the short time I had with Sir Henry Drayton I was unable to go into details with him, in regard to the case in question.\n\nAs explained to you, it will mean everything to myself and family, if the Department should, in view of the circumstances of my case, kindly grant me some further substantial consideration at this time, and I cannot tell you, Mr. Scott, how very deeply it would be appreciated.\n\nWith very sincere regards from myself and family to you and Mrs Scott.\n\nBelieve me.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Dr. Tolmie, Minister of Agriculture, and with Sir. Henry Drayton, Minister of Finance; also that I had gone fully into the particulars of the case with Mr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Sup't General of Indian Affairs.\n\nI might also mention that when the Hon. Mackenzie King, Leader of the Liberal Party, was here I was enabled, through the kindness of the Rev. Mr. Chadwick of this City, to have an interview with him. Mr King was most kind and sympathetic and said that he would gladly do anything he could to further the cause in question.\n\nYou will readily understand that after being accorded these kindly interviews and being assured that everything possible would be done for me, that, it was hard for me to credit the contents of the letter, which I received yesterday, from Mr. W. E. Bitchburn, Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies, B.C. A copy of the letter is attached herewith.\n\nIn fact I had felt so certain, that, at least the account for $1,300.00 which I had submitted and which was supported by a Statutory Declaration, would be allowed, that, I obtained a loan of $400.00 to tide me over for the time being. This and other obligations which I have to meet make it most trying for me, and you have, conception, Mr. Meighen, of what it is going to mean to my family, my Mother and myself, if nothing further is done.\n\nI was in ill-health at the time when obliged to leave the service, and in August 1919 a letter from Dr. D.B. Holden (of this City) to this effect was forwarded to the Hon. Dr. Tolmie.\n\nSurely the case is worthy of further consideration, when everything is duly considered, and I earnestly trust you will look upon it in this light and make some concession.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRight Hon. Arthur Meighen,\nPrime Minister of Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that it would create a dangerous precedent and would lead to all sorts of vexatious claims.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) W.E.

Wilson, since he came to Victoria in November 1918, and have watched him make a manly attempt to establish himself in a new line of work, but the state of his health has as yet proved too great a handicap.\n\nAs a professional man I consider that the condition of Mr Wilson's nerves, as well as general physical condition, will for sometime yet render him totally unfit for the steady hard work necessary for self support.\n\n(Signed) D.B.

E. Wilson, Esquire,\n1452 Vining Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, April 27, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Prime Minister directs me to forward to you herewith a letter from Mr. A.E.

Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 25, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Bitchburn,\n\nIn April the Right Honourable the Prime Minister had a letter from Mr. A.E. Wilson on the subject of his claim. It was sent to me for action, but I delayed writing you about it as there seemed to be nothing new to report. I wrote you on April 12, 1921, stating the facts\u2014that I could not get any support for his claims and would therefore have to drop them. When it is known that we have given Mr. Wilson a full year's leave with pay the conclusion was immediately arrived at that we had treated him fairly generously. The claims were not in themselves convincing and therefore the task of obtaining recognition was all the more difficult.\n\nI wish you would tell Mr. Wilson that while the Right Honourable the Prime Minister handed these papers over to the Department, the Superintendent General cannot give favourable treatment to his claims, which personally I do not\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.B. Bitchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nNovember 9, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Lynton,\nPrivate Secretary to Honourable Dr. Tolmie,\nMinister of Agriculture.\n\nI have pleasure in giving you the facts regarding the claims of Mr. A.E. Wilson, formerly an officer of this Department, Principal of the Elkhorn Industrial school.\n\nWhen this school was closed we endeavoured to accommodate Mr. Wilson with another position, but he found it impossible to accept anything that we could offer him, and he decided to take the year's leave of absence that we offered him in trying to obtain other employment, when he moved to Victoria, B.C.\n\nWhen we were endeavouring to give him employment in the Department, it was suggested that he should be appointed clerk at the Blackfoot Agency with headquarters at Gleichen. I mention this now in order that you may understand the reason for one of the claims that he has made.\n\nMr. Wilson claims that his health was so impaired that he could not take proper advantage of the year's leave of absence, and in fact failed to establish himself as he had hoped.\n\nIn the first place, if I remember correctly, he asked for an additional year's leave of absence, but when I was in Victoria in 1920, he decided to claim from the Government $1,300, which he had spent in prizes and like disbursements when he was principal of the school, and this he supported by a statutory declaration. He also wished to be paid his travelling expenses from Elkhorn to Gleichen and sent in his account therefor. These were the principal claims he made.\nI discussed the claims with the Minister, but he could not see his way clear to put an amount in the Estimates. This would be necessary. I was always willing to take this action, although I felt that we would be treating Mr. Wilson with great consideration by asking Parliament to recognize the claims. I thought it was preferable to put them before the Minister in this form than in the form of an additional year's leave of absence, which would also have required a vote of the House. There has been very generous sympathy for Mr. Wilson, and the Minister was not in any sense hostile to the claims but found it difficult to find reasons to support them.\n\nI should be very glad, if Doctor Tolmie wishes, to take the matter up again with him and Sir James Loughhead, and to present the case in as favourable a light as possible. Unfortunately, Mr. Wilson's claim, supported by affidavits, has been mislaid, and as yet I have not been able to find it.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 17, 1921.\n\nDear Doctor Tommie,\n\nI had the opportunity of laying the case of Mr. A.E. Wilson before the Honourable Sir James Loughhead, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and yourself this morning. As there is at present no Parliamentary appropriation from which any payments might be made to Mr. Wilson to meet his claims, it will be readily understood that the matter cannot be dealt with until the next session of Parliament. I have to assure you that at the proper time I will take a personal interest in laying the matter before the Minister and presenting Mr. Wilson's case in as favourable a light as possible, so that the Government may be induced to favourably consider the claim and provide the necessary funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHonourable S.F. Tommie,\nMinister of Agriculture,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 27, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nWith reference to the papers attached hereto, consisting of a claim made on behalf of Mr. A.E. Wilson by the Rev. E.A.P. Chadwick, of Victoria, B.C., I beg to report as follows:\n\nMr. A.E. Wilson was for many years the principal of an Indian industrial school at Elkhorn, Man. This school was the only institution conducted wholly by the Government. All our other residential schools are conducted by the denominations interested in them with the financial aid from the Government, but the Churches contribute generously towards the support of these schools. The cost of conducting this single Government institution was very much higher than the per capita grants paid to denominational schools and was, therefore, a constant mark for invidious comparisons. As it was difficult to get pupils for the school we decided to close it.\n\nWe endeavoured to find a place for Mr. Wilson in our service, but failed in that, as he did not find it possible to take a clerical position, and was not fitted either by temperament or experience for the position of Indian Agent.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we gave him a full year's leave of absence with pay, with the hope that he would establish himself and be successful. Unfortunately, it seems that this has not been the case, and he has applied to the Department for further consideration and assistance.\n\nWhen I was in Victoria in 1920 I had several interviews with him. I think I may say that he preferred that his\nclaim should take the form of an additional year's leave with full pay, but as I pointed out that that was difficult to grant now that he had completely severed his connection with the service, he submitted the claim for $1,300.00, consisting of small amounts which he had spent in the interest of the school during the term of his principalship. This was supported by statutory declarations. He also wished to have his travelling expenses paid from Elkhorn, Man., to Gleichen, Alberta, and sent in an account therefor. Unfortunately these papers were mislaid and cannot at present be traced.\n\nMr. Wilson has had several influential men support his claim, and I am personally sympathetic with it, and have always so expressed myself to the Ministers who were dealing with it; although I must say that favourable treatment of the claim would be a remarkable precedent.\n\nI am sending herewith copies of letter which I wrote to Chief Inspector Dittohurn, of Victoria, on June 25, 1921; a memorandum which I made for Mr. Lynton, Hon. Dr. S.F. Tolmie's Private Secretary, on November 9, 1921; and a letter which I wrote to the Hon. Dr. S.F. Tolmie on November 17, 1921.\n\nI present the facts of the case somewhat in detail, as I see from Rev. Mr. Chadwick's letter that he thinks the action of the Government, (I presume he means the Department) most extraordinary, and that there was absolutely no reason for the treatment Mr. Wilson received. Mr. Wilson was fairly and considerately treated by both the Department and the Government.\n\nIt will be observed from my letter of November 17, 1921, that the matter was to be further considered by the Hon. Sir James Lougheed and the Government, and that I was to lay the matter before the Minister in due course. I am quite willing to do that now, and then it may be decided whether an item or items may be placed in the Estimates for the special purpose of relieving Mr. Wilson.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to the claim advanced by Mr. A. M. Wilson, late of the Elkhorn School, I thought it best to advise you that I am of the opinion that unless something is done in trying to meet his request you will not get much peace. As you, no doubt, are aware, some time ago he enlisted the sympathies of a number of prominent people in the city of Victoria and had the Rev. Mr. Chadwick write to the Honorable Arthur Meighen and Sir James Lougheed, the late Premier and Superintendent General of Indian Affairs respectively, advancing reasons why some compensation should be given to Wilson. This resulted in a letter from Hon. Dr. Tolmie, then the Minister of Agriculture, stating that the Government intended to ask Parliament to provide in the Estimates a sufficient amount to cover the claim, and everything appeared to be rosy for Mr. Wilson. I understand, however, that the new Government are not favourably disposed to doing anything in the way of carrying out the promises of the late Government in this particular case and Mr. Wilson and his friends have got very busy lately and had further letters written to the \"powers that be.\" I thought it best to give you this information. I had an interview recently with Rev. Mr. Chadwick, who asked me if I could not do something in the matter but I absolutely refused, stating that it was a question entirely outside of my jurisdiction and that I did not care to take any official action in the matter nor did I care to express any opinion as to the merits or demerits of the case. To you, however, I may say officially that it may be possible that Mr. Wilson's claim has never been viewed from the standpoint of his being so long tied up in the Indian work in the Prairie Provinces and then being retired and as there were no commercial opportunities in the immediate vicinity of his field of activities it was necessary for him\nto come to the Coast to try to recuperate his health and to establish himself in order that he might make a living. This naturally must have taken a considerable portion of the year's salary which he was paid on retirement and as the work in which he had been employed for so many years was so different from commercial life it would necessarily take him some time before he could settle himself down to meet the public and talk business. I may say that he is very far removed from being an up-to-date insurance agent so far. Possibly viewing the case from this angle might be sufficient to warrant a reconsideration in his favour. I may say that Mr. Wilson nor his friends do not know that I am writing this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 2, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th April, regarding Mr. A.B. Wilson's claim, I have to say for your own information that I reported to the Minister on January 27th last, with reference to it, and he will, I am quite sure, be ready to consider any representations that may be made. The representations mentioned in the latter part of your letter have, I think, been considered, and I agree that they should be given due weight. I think that all that you and I can do is to wait further developments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\n(Dictated but not read)\nVictoria, B.C.,\nOctober 20, 1921.\n\nTo the Hon. S.F. Tolmie,\nMinister of Agriculture,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nHon. and Dear Sir,\n\nThis was in October, and on arriving at Duck Lake it was found that the house in which he was expected to live was really not fit to move into at that time of the year and spend the winter with his family. Mr. Wilson was not in good health at that time, and the whole experience was, in my judgment, a terrible ordeal. He resigned in 1918, under conditions that must have been heart breaking.\n\n(4). Mr. Wilson was given a year's salary and came to Victoria in 1918 with his family, and has been making a brave endeavour to re-establish himself and provide home for his family consisting of two daughters and a son. One of the girls is not very well and the little boy has had a dangerous illness and requires constant medical attention. Mr. Wilson himself is unfit for steady work. At the same time Mr. Wilson is working very hard endeavouring to make his way. The year's salary that Mr. Wilson received is not at all sufficient compensation for the whole lifetime of devoted service that he rendered to his country. It will be admitted that when a man gives all his consideration to one occupation as Mr. Wilson has been engaged in he is by that very experience unfitted and untrained for other lines of work or business. It is unfair to Mr. Wilson to be cast off without further compensation and it is my opinion and the opinion of a great many friends of Mr. Wilson, that he should receive an appropriate pension, at least equal to that which other Civil Servants are entitled to. I cannot help but feel strongly that from a moral point of view, careful and impartial study of this case, that Mr. Wilson's case is an exceptional one, and that considering his long service, his ill health and the extreme difficulty he is experiencing in getting re-established, he should receive generous financial recognition, as follows:\n\n1. A stated pension of $(Such as would have been entitled to if retired.\n\n2. Remuneration for expenses in moving to Victoria, B.C. - $700.00\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) F.A.P. Chadwick (Rev.)\n\nIf you cannot see your way to secure this, the least remuneration he should get would be -\n\nTravelling expenses for himself and family to Victoria...$700.00\nA further year's salary.................................\nOFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS\n\nOttawa 6th October, 1922.\n\nPersonal\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI enclose copy of correspondence relative to the case of Mr. A. E. Wilson.\n\nDr. King intended seeing you personally regarding this matter, but he has had to leave for the Maritime Provinces and was therefore unable to do so.\n\nWhile in Victoria, Dr. King was interviewed by many prominent people, who manifested very great interest in Mr. Wilson's case. They feel that injustice has been done him and, although his retirement took place before the Calder Act became effective, they urge that everything possible be done to afford relief to Mr. Wilson, in view of the splendid record which he had when an employee of your Department.\n\nThe Minister would be glad if you would advise him if it is possible to have a recommendation made and an item noted in the Estimates to provide the necessary funds to reimburse Mr. Wilson his expenses, as outlined in the attached memo, which were incurred when he was moved to Victoria; an additional year's salary of $1,500, and such a sum as he would have been entitled to had he been retired under the Calder Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Wilson. I have read the papers and I am returning them herewith.\n\nAlthough I have never been able to agree that any injustice was done Mr. Wilson, I have always presented his case in as fair a light as possible. The difficulty is to get the Government to make a precedent in his case. I hope you will assure Doctor King that I will take the matter up with my Minister when we are discussing the Estimates. Mr. Stewart has already received several communications in Mr. Wilson's behalf, and the circumstances of the case are well known to us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

King\nPrime Minister of Canada.\n\nDear Mr. King,\n\nI feel that I should again address you regarding the case of Mr. A.R. Wilson of Victoria, late Superintendent of the Indian School at Elk Horn. The reason for my doing so is that I had the honour recently of a most encouraging interview with Mr. Scott, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, when he was in Victoria.\n\nMr. Scott knows very thoroughly the details of the case, and is sympathetic towards Mr. Wilson.\n\nI need not weary you at this time with all the reasons why Mr. Wilson should receive your best consideration, but I do feel that after nearly thirty years of service, and service of a most efficient and patriotic kind, as is attested by men and women of the highest standing in Canada, Mr. Wilson should receive a worthy financial recognition.\n\nI feel that if you insisted that justice be rendered in this case it would have the required \"punch\" to bring it to pass.\n\nSo I plead with you to advise that either one of two things be done\u2014\n\n(1) A pension be granted for the amount he would have been entitled to if he had not been practically ejected, and remained till age for retirement, which would have been very soon.\n\n(2) A special money grant of $2200.00 to pay or compensate for the unexpected and emergent expenses he was put to at the time of his retirement. (I know that he received some compensation at the time, but it proved to be altogether inadequate, and his necessary outlay in getting a house &c would in all conscience require far more than he received.\n\nMr. Wilson is in dire need at the present time, the blow has been too great for him, and it would only be a matter of human justice for him to receive what I now ask for him.\n\nWith many thoughts of the old times, and with continued wishes for your future success,\n\nI remain Your sincerely,\n\nF.A.P.

The Minister did not, however, come to the conclusion that it would receive favourable attention by the Treasury Board, and he did not authorize me to insert an amount in the estimates, nor could I receive any authority for paying the bill which Mr. Wilson left with me when I was in Victoria for rent of house from the 1st November 1918 to October 31st, 1919, $480.00.\n\nUnder the circumstances you will understand that I regret very much having to write you so unfavourably but so far as the actual presentation of this claim is concerned, and the attention of my Minister, you can be assured that everything possible was done to come to a different decision.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Wilson to Mr. Robert Forke, M.P., I regret that there is nothing further that can be said in this case. The only way to give Mr. Wilson any relief is for Parliament to vote a sum of money for him. His friends have asked us either to give him a pension or a special grant of $2,200.00. Although it has been before several successive Ministers, I have never received authority to place an amount in the Estimates.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 4, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, written on behalf of Mr. A.

Under these circumstances, we gave him a full year's leave of absence, with pay, hoping that he would during that time establish himself and be successful. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and he has on many occasions applied to the Department for further consideration and assistance. His case has been most sympathetically considered, but the only way to assist him would be to obtain a special Parliamentary appropriation, and it has not been found possible to have favourable consideration given to this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Wilson, late of the Elkhorn School.\n\nHe has been anxiously awaiting my return to the Coast and apparently expected me to be able to give him some satisfactory assurance that something would be done for him. I gathered from him that he has been standing off his creditors with this hope. He seemed very down at heart when I informed him of what you told me, which was to the effect that although you had placed items on the Estimates in his favour, these had not been allowed and that he must go after the politicians who had knocked him out.\n\nAs I explained to you in Ottawa, he will lose his home unless he can get something to at least meet the interest on the mortgage. It appears that he cashed-in on a life insurance policy to make the first payment on his home and gave a mortgage of $2,500 which he has been unable to lift or even keep up the interest.\n\nOf his two daughters, one is working in a dentist's office at a salary of $65.00 per month; the other stays at home to look after the house; a boy of fifteen goes to school. Mr. Wilson informs me that he has not earned over $300 during the past year.\n\nTo-day he informed me that he would be willing to give up all claim against the Department if he were allowed $480 which he paid as rent for the house when he first came here, together with the amount of bonus he would have received for the seven months,\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nApril\nApril-October, 1919, inclusive, had he remained in the service. What amount this will be I do not know, but his salary as principal of the school was $125 per month with residence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWED/HM.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It appears he is in rather a desperate plight.

Wilson.\n\nI think it well to send you a copy of the memorandum which I wrote to the Hon. Dr. Tolmie's Private Secretary on Nov. 9, 1921, in which I deal with this case. Since then, although it has been before the Minister several times, there has been no change in the decision which was come to by Sir James Loughhead, and I have not received any direction to place an amount in the Estimates.\n\nWhile I have very active sympathy for Mr. Wilson's condition, as I have received letters from him and have seen him twice or three times at Victoria, I must acknowledge a certain weakness in his claim. It really rests on his statement that his health was impaired when he began the year's leave of absence and, therefore, was not able to establish himself in commercial life. I do not think, therefore, that there is much use in bringing the claim before the Minister again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt. Hon.

Buckingham, of Brandon, Man., I have to say that Mr. A.E. Wilson's claim has been before various Ministers for several years and has not been favourably considered. His case has received most sympathetic attention, but the only way to assist him would be to obtain a special Parliamentary appropriation, and it has not been found possible to have favourable consideration given to this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMiss Agnes G.

E. Wilson, 618 Island Road, Victoria, B. C. In view of your representations, I made careful enquiry into his case; but I regret to state I cannot give a favourable reply.\n\nMr. Wilson was, for many years, the principal of an Indian residential school at Elkhorn, Man. In 1918 this school was closed, and the Department endeavoured to place him in another position. Mr. Wilson found it impossible to accept, and he decided to take a year's leave of absence with pay, which was all that could be granted.\n\nSince that time, on many occasions, Mr. Wilson has applied to various Ministers for further consideration. Most sympathetic attention has been given; but the only way to assist him would be to obtain a special appropriation. I regret that it has not been found possible to make any further payments in his case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. B. Flunkett, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular.

Bley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM RE LANDS AT THE ELKHORN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nIn 1891, the Department purchased from the Rev. E. F. Wilson, for the purposes of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, Lots 4 to 11, in Block 2, and Lots 1 to 8 in Block 3, Plan 2939, town of Birtle. (Abstract of Title entered under #14.) The purchase price was $1,546.64. This was the site of the first school which was burned in 1895. Before rebuilding, it was decided to secure a better site.\n\nOn October 6, 1898, an Order in Council set apart Sec. 35, T. 11, R. 29, W.P., for the purposes of the Indian Industrial School at Elkhorn. This section had been relinquished by the C. P. R. for this purpose - the consideration being other lands. It was in error that this section was set aside for the Indian School. It was acquired for a trade with Mr. Wilcox, who owned land which was suitable. P. O. 2914, of December 30, 1898, rescinded the earlier O. C. and set apart, under Sec. 31, of the Dominion Lands Act.\n\n(a) The S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 4, and the S.E. \u00bc of Sec. 5, T. 12, R. 28, W.P., excepting 4-1/5 acres in Sec. 5, which comprised the C. P. R. right of way.\n\n(b) Lots 1, 2 and 3, in Block H. and all of Blocks K. & L., in the town of Birtle.\n\nThe certificates of Title for the parcels in A. and the deed for the parcels in B. were forwarded to the Interior Department with No. 116823 of October 31, 1898 (Interior Dept. File 178746). The parcels mentioned in A. had been owned by W. J. Wilcox, who had given a patent, by the Interior Department, to Section 35, which had been inadvertently set apart. The town lots mentioned in B., which are the actual site of the school buildings, were a free gift from the town of Birtle or the C. P. R., or both, account of the location of the Indian School at Birtle. These town lots were deeded on July 7, 1897, to the Federal Crown and were included when the Department of the Interior set apart lands for the school. It later developed that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the trade with Wilcox, and a Mr. Cushing, who acted for him, having pointed this out, received a special payment of $604.50 in lieu of the fact that the original town lots, which were purchased from Wilson in 1891, were not deeded to his client.\n\nOrder in Council of May 5, 1904, approved of a trade between the C. P. R. and the Department, whereby the N.W. \u00bc of L.S. 14 of the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 35, T. 11, R. 28, W.P. (50 acres) was given to the Department for the purposes of the Elkhorn School, for a consideration of $150, and for 4.28 acres in the S.W. \u00bc of Sec. 4, T.12, R.28, which was deeded to the C. P. R. as a gravel pit. A description of this gravel pit will be found on this file.\n\nIn 1901, it developed that the old town lots, the site of the original school, were not really required any longer. O. C. of March 23, 1906, authorized the Superintendent General to dispose of these lots. They were advertised for sale in January, 1913, and sold by auction on April 21, 1917. The sale of Lot 1, was cancelled and the land resumed by the Department, December 27th, 1924, the sale of Lots 2 to 8, Block 2, and Lots 5 to 11, Block 2, was cancelled and the land resumed by the Department.

Secy-Treas.\nIndian Residential School Commission.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man., December 2nd, 1932.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, inspected between November 20th and 22nd, 1932.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss A. C. E. Field who was ill with rheumatism at the time of my visit. Miss Field is a qualified teacher, and from previous observation, I would judge that she is doing splendid work.\n\nThe senior classroom is in charge of Mr. Wm. H. Bradley who also acts as Assistant Principal. His classroom is only open during the afternoon on account of the extra duties falling on him due to the absence of Rev. Fred Eley, the Principal. The time table is so arranged that all the senior boys attend the classroom in the afternoon, and thus the half day system is carried out. In September Mr. Bradley was ill for two weeks, therefore the classroom work has been somewhat interrupted.\n\nThe children were all well dressed, clean and tidy in appearance. The discipline, both in the classrooms and around the building, was good and the children are well mannered. At present there are 95 pupils in residence, and these, with the 6 absentees, bring the total up to 101. Mr. Bradley informed me that they could accommodate 120 pupils.\n\nThe kitchen is supervised by Miss Plant, and the food appeared well prepared. The food served\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nNovember 22nd\nNovember 22nd was as follows:\n\nBreakfast - Porridge with milk & sugar, Bread with syrup; Tea & cocoa for the small children.\n\nLunch - Vegetable soup, bread, tea, milk, and milk pudding (rice).\n\nDinner - Beans, bread & jam, tea & cocoa\n\nThe children were in good health and according to the chart of weights all, with the exception of one or two, show fair gains. The food served was wholesome and well prepared, but, as noted by the menu, vegetables or meat do not play a large part.\n\nThe laundry work is supervised by Miss Shaw. The laundry is well equipped. Monday is used as wash day, and Tuesday and Wednesday for ironing. The balance of the week Miss Shaw spends in the sewing room teaching the girls to mend, etc. A few new clothes are made, but most of the children's clothes are provided by the church societies and arrive ready to wear. This arrangement is a great help to the Principal, but does not give the girls much opportunity to learn sewing, and this is one side of their training which should be stressed.\n\nThe dairy and bakery is supervised by Miss Smith. In this department the girls do most of the work, and as a result, are good bread-makers. Small bakes and buns are made from time to time, but bread required for the children is made in large quantities and mixed by a power mixer. Bread is made four times a week, each of the three mixings, 100 lbs. of flour is used; the fourth baking on Saturdays requires 200 lbs. The bread seen was of\nseen was of good quality and wholesome. At present the milk is all used for the children and baking, but later, when the cows begin to freshen, butter-making will again be carried on.\n\nThe boys' supervisor is Miss Harvey. She has charge of their dormitories and playroom. I found these to be tidy, well aired, and clean. The toilets were all in good condition, and both tube clean. Some of the mattresses are in poor condition - in fact, a number have been replaced by the use of cotton ticks filled with straw.\n\nThe girls are supervised by Miss Topping, and she is apparently rendering good service. The girls' dormitories were in good condition, and all wash basins and toilets in working order.\n\nThe fire escape door in the senior girls' dormitory was locked, but the other doors were unlocked. In my last report dated November 28th, 1931, I recommended that these doors be wired and attached to the fire alarm. This would safeguard anyone opening the door to enter or leave, unknown to the staff, and would do away with the locks. I still think this precaution should be taken. The light switches for the dormitories have been changed as recommended, and are a great improvement. I had two fire drills while at the school, one during the day and one during the night. The children got along well and were out in less than four minutes. The engineer, Mr. Caniff, keeps all the fire equipment in good condition, and extinguishers and axes can be found on each floor. The fire alarm bells appear too small, and when the laundry and pump are operating, it is difficult to hear the alarm throughout the basement. Larger bells should be installed.\ninstalled or an additional one placed in the laundry. The engineer is capable of doing this work and only the material would be required.\n\nThe Matron, Miss C. L. Gibson, is a graduate nurse, and appears a capable woman for the position. Miss Gibson is a new appointment since my last visit.\n\nThe garden did not yield well, and by Christmas they will have very few vegetables except potatoes. The potato crop was also light, and the supply will hardly last until spring.\n\nThe farm crops were poor, but they are fortunate in having sufficient rough feed.\n\nThe cattle are in fair condition, and within the next few months several cows will freshen. The cattle stabled number about 20 head. In addition to this stock, they have 11 horses and about 16 pigs. At present no poultry is kept.\n\nThe interruptions in the classroom work, due to sickness, is very unfortunate, and, in cases of prolonged sickness, a substitute teacher should be provided.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Fred Eley, had not returned from England, where he has been spending some weeks in the hopes of regaining better health. Mr. Bradley, the Acting Principal, I believe, is doing good work and, during the absence of the Principal, has handled the situation well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

It is about \u00bc mile from the village of Elkhorn and 197 miles west of Winnipeg.\n\nThe School property, which belongs to the Dominion Government, consists of the main building, three residences, barns, implement sheds, granaries and other outbuildings that go to make up a well-equipped school and farm.\n\nIn addition there are 320 acres of arable land. The quarter section on which the buildings stand includes a large vegetable garden and pasture for cattle and horses.\n\nThe School rents a further 480 acres of land adjoining the Federal property and most of this is under cultivation.\n\nWHAT IS ITS HISTORY?\n\nThe history of the Elkhorn Indian School has three distinct chapters.\n\nThe first chapter started in 1885 when the Rev. E. F. Wilson, founder and principal of the Indian Home at Sault Ste. Marie, took a journey through the North West and was impressed with the needs for a school similar to the one he had already established.\n\nOn his return to Ontario he endeavored to raise funds to bring such benefits to the Indians of the plains.\n\nUnsuccessful at first, he resolved to make a last effort. He issued a pamphlet setting forth the need and stating that if anyone would give $1,000.00 to make a beginning he would go forward in faith and leave the rest with God.\n\nThis pamphlet fell into the hands of Mr. Rowsowell of Elkhorn, who offered the $1,000.00 required. This gift was supplemented by others and the Dominion Government then came forward with a grant.\n\nThe new home was opened on June 10th, 1888, with four pupils and one teacher. These four children stood the new and unusual life for twelve days and then all ran away together!\n\nOthers arrived, however, and on August 6th, 1889, the home was formally opened by Archbishop Macray and given its name, \"Washakada Indian Home,\" out of compliment to Mr. Rowsowell, whose Indian name was \"Washakada,\" meaning \"all that is good.\"\n\nIn 1892, Mr. A. E. Wilson, son of the founder, was appointed and the success of the school was assured.\n\nThe School was at this time situated in the village itself and pupils came to it from reserves as far distant as the Blackfoot and Blood. Many came from pagan homes and accepted Christian baptism while\nunder tuition. Bootmaking, printing, tailoring, carpentering, tinsmithing and harness making were taught by trade instructors. Some of these instructors were resident at the School and others were local tradesmen who accepted Indian boys as apprentices.\n\nIn 1895 a destructive fire consumed most of the buildings. Within three days, however, the work was resumed in other rented premises in the village.\n\nThe second chapter opened when the Government decided to erect a new and substantial pile of buildings on the present site, which would make more extensive farming operations possible.\n\n1897 saw the new plant occupied and under the efficient work of Mr. Wilson, who gave his best years to the Indian, the School held a leading place among the institutions of its kind.\n\nIn 1918, the Federal Department made a change of policy, which, unfortunately, resulted in the closing of the Elkhorn Indian Home after three decades of splendid service.\n\nThe third chapter started in 1923, when it was decided to make extensive alterations and additions to the School which had been vacant and neglected.\n\nThe Rev. F. Eley acted as Principal during the difficult period of reconstruction and in January, 1923, the first new pupils were admitted. The School was reopened under the administration of the Indian Residential School Commission of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nMr. Eley, who gave ten years of constant service, won for the School a reputation for efficiency and discipline.\n\nThe present Principal was appointed in August, 1933.\n\nWHERE DO THE CHILDREN COME FROM?\n\nThe Elkhorn School is unique in that although a school for Indians it is not located near to any Indian reserves.\n\nThe nearest Reserve is at Griswold, over fifty miles away, whence come the Sioux Indians\u2014a non-treaty band\u2014originally refugees from the United States, seeking sanctuary in Canada.\n\nIn addition to the Sioux there are Crees, Ojibway and Saulteaux children coming from Fairford, Lake St. Martin, Little Saskatchewan, Scantebury, Peguis, Fort Alexander and the many reserves north of The Pas, reaching up to York Factory and Port Nelson on the Hudson Bay, 1,000 miles away.\n\nJanuary 1st, 1935, saw 155 pupils in residence, ranging in ages from four years to seventeen years, and coming from about sixteen different reserves.\n\nWHAT ARE THEY TAUGHT?\n\nIn the schoolrooms the curriculum of the Provincial Department of Education is followed and the Provincial Inspector makes regular visits, as in the White schools.\n\nThere are at present two classrooms and the children attend school on one half day each day. The Grades go up to and include Grade VII. One girl is doing her Grade XI. at the High School in town.\n\nThe Junior Class Room\n\nThe many bench trades taught in Mr. Wilson's time, forty years ago, are no longer on the curriculum, but more emphasis is put on farming, gardening and kindred occupations.\n\nSawing Wood\nDuring the half day out of classrooms the boys work on the School farm under the direction of the Farm Instructor. While the senior boys handle the farm, others work in the garden or care for the herd of 35 Holstein cattle and attend to the horse barns, piggery, etc. Rough carpentering, engineering, painting and incidental work is done as occasion demands.\n\nThe girls put 2,000 garments through the Laundry every week, about half of these being repaired in the Sewing Room under the direction of the Sempstress.\n\nButter making is taught in the Dairy and more than 700 loaves are baked every week in the School Bakery.\n\nIn addition, the boys milk the cows, assist in the Dairy and Laundry. They wash dishes, lay tables, make beds, scrub and sweep.\nGeneral cooking is done in the main kitchen and the girls perform other necessary duties of housekeeping in various parts of the building.\n\nThe success of the children in the classroom and practical arts is illustrated by the fact that at the Regina, Brandon and Elkhorn Fairs in 1934, the results achieved were as follows:\n\n- Sewing\u201454 entries: 34 prizes.\n- Cooking\u20145 entries: 2 prizes.\n- School Work\u201436 entries: 15 prizes.\n\nA School Council, consisting of six senior pupils, assists the Principal in some of the tasks of School government. This Council consists of two captains and four councillors elected from the boys' and girls' sides of the school. These chosen leaders exercise a limited measure of authority and so are trained in initiative.\n\nThus, the School objective is not merely a schoolroom education but a many sided development, which will enable the graduates to take their places in life as industrious and efficient members of society, able to do many practical things reasonably well.\n\nWHAT ARE THEIR RELAXATIONS?\n\nThe School lantern gives entertainment and occasionally a movie picture show is provided. The usual social evenings and a \"visiting\" night once a week gives opportunity for boy-girl contacts under proper supervision. A club night in cold weather and a radio, presented by an ex-member of the staff, fills in a pleasant evening.\n\nThe girls have a branch of the Woman's Auxiliary and some belong to a Glee Club.\n\nIn Winter, there are two skating rinks\u2014one for the boys and another for the girls. Hockey teams play with the White boys in the village and the Indian boys have gained an excellent name for good sportsmanship.\nIn Summer, football is played and baseball is played by both boys and girls. Basketball is provided for the girls.\n\nThe School has a cadet corps and a gymnastic team.\n\nA daily treatment is given for Trachoma. Frequent doses of cod liver oil and Parrish's food help those who need it. A carefully balanced diet in the dining room is provided and a monthly weighing of every child tells its story of progress. So little is the larger room of the School hospital used that it has been turned into a dormitory for the babies.\n\nThe girls have drill and hikes in the summer and all children unable to go home for their holidays have a happy time at picnics and other such treats.\n\nWHAT IS DONE FOR THEIR HEALTH?\n\nA resident nurse with a well-equipped dispensary cares for the sick, while the School doctor lives only a few hundred yards away.\n\nWHAT IS DONE FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS LIFE?\n\nAs the School crest indicates, Religion is at the heart of all that is done.\n\nReligion is the key stone of the bridge between the old life and the new.\n\nNo matter how well-formed and laid the stones of health, farm and classroom training may be, the passage of the pupil from admission to graduation cannot be safely accomplished unless the key stone of the bridge is well and truly laid.\n\nSo Religion is at the centre of all the work. Christ is in the kitchen and at the plough, as He is in the Chapel.\n\nEvery day is The Lord's Day. Rising bedside prayers, dining room prayers at breakfast and supper, grace before and after meals, retiring bedside prayers\u2014all these emphasize the place of prayer in the daily Christian life.\n\nEvery Sunday morning at 7:15, and on Saints' Days there is Holy Communion in the School Chapel. These are voluntary services and always well-attended.\nThere is a daily Bible reading and religious instruction is given in the classrooms. Sunday School lessons are taught by the staff and in 1934, thirty-two children received certificates for success in the examinations set by the General Board of Religious Education.\n\nConfirmation Class, 1934\n\nThe Sunday services inculcate the habit of public worship and the closing minutes of the graduating pupil\u2019s life in the School are spent at the Altar, as the Principal prays a blessing.\n\nThen the graduate goes out to battle against the wiles of the Devil, so often seeking his or her undoing on the Reserve.\nWHAT OF THE GRADUATES' FUTURE?\n\nHow the graduate meets the future depends largely on how he has been prepared during the years at Residential School. How he measures up to the strange contrast of Reserve life depends on how deeply the Christ life has been seen and lived while at School.\n\nToo often going back to the Reserve means \"going back\" in more ways than one. Will the reader pray for the graduate pupils?\n\nCharacter is made by the impact of personality upon personality. In the Residential School character must be made by the impact of the White man's character upon that of the Indian.\n\nDear Reader! Will you pray that the workers in our Residential Schools may live so near the Great Personality that our Indians may find Him Whom to know is Life Eternal!\n\nTHE SCHOOL PRAYER\n\nO Almighty God, grant Thy blessing, we beseech Thee, to the Elkhorn Residential School and its activities; bless the Missionary Society and its endeavour; the Missionaries and all Christian Workers: the pupils and their witness; prosper with Thy favour all our undertakings, especially our efforts to make this institution a light to all Thy children. Forgive our failures, kindle our love and unite us closely in the service of Thy Kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\nELKHORN, MANITOBA, May 1st, 1935\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept'f of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a booklet illustrative of the work done at the above School.\n\nUnder the paragraph \"What is its history?\" you may be interested in seeing a part explanation for the strange location of this School.\n\nIf you would be good enough to hand a copy of the booklet to Mr. Sutherland I think he will be glad to see it.\n\nI am,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nS.J. Wickens\n(Principal)\nThe conditions noted in my 1933 report still prevail, the large enrolment (146 at time of inspection) making it necessary to relay classes in both rooms. This means that each pupil is receiving only from two and a half to three hours daily instruction in the classroom. This is not such a serious matter for the older girls who receive valuable training in the performance of household duties under supervision nor for the older boys EXCEPT during the summer months when they also may be usefully employed on the farm. But the latter during the winter months and the younger children throughout the year lose much through lack of suitable activities and spend too much time in which they are not profitably employed. In my opinion, the addition of another classroom and teacher would do away with much of this loss, permit a more efficient organization of the work of the school and make possible much better results.\n\nDuring my inspection, I looked over the unused power building. While this would not make an ideal classroom, it might with the removal of the machinery and some alterations be made to serve as such for a time. The upper storey might also be fitted up to carry on in a small way some work in manual training.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAugust 29th, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nIt is represented to the Minister that the position of Farming Instructor at the Indian School at Elkhorn, Manitoba, is about to become vacant. In the event of the present Farming Instructor tendering his resignation will you please appoint Mr. Carl C. Dahl, of Elkhorn, as his successor. Mr. Dahl has had long experience as a farmer and in the breeding of live stock.\n\nGeorge Buskard,\nPrivate Secretary.\nSeptember 5, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 29th ultimo, relative to engaging the services of a farming instructor at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, I have to say that, as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, the church authorities engage the staff and pay their salaries, from the per capita grant which the Department provides the school. While we insist that the various members of the staff be qualified for their positions, the appointments, as stated, are in the hands of the church authorities.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that owing to the condition of his wife's health, the Rev. Canon S. J. Wickens, B.A., B.D., has resigned from the Principalship of our Elkhorn School and is leaving at the end of the current month of October to take charge of a parish in the suburbs of the City of Victoria, B.C.\n\nAs Canon Wickens made a valuable contribution to Indian educational work during his tenure of the Principalship of this School, our Commission sincerely regret the circumstances which have made it necessary for him to retire, for the time being, from the Indian Residential School service. The members are very glad, however, to be able to report that they have secured the services of the Rev. Arthur E. Minchin, B.A., as Canon Wickens' successor, from the 1st November next. As Mr. Minchin is quite well known to your Department, having filled for some time the position of Principal of the Mackay School near the Pas, Manitoba, it does not appear to me to be necessary to furnish you with a detailed statement of his qualifications. His knowledge of the Indian people, and his very keen interest which he takes in the general welfare of their children, along with the experience he has already had as Principal of an Indian Residential School, appear to our Commission to fully justify his appointment.\n\nAs the appointment to a Principalship such as the one before us, can only be made by your Department, on the recommendation of our Society, I am sending a copy of this letter to our General Secretary, and you will no doubt hear direct from him in the matter in due course. In the meantime arrangements have been made for Mr. Minchin to take charge of the School at the date specified in the capacity of Acting Principal, and I shall be glad to know if this arrangement has the approval of your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 5, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, informing the Department that Reverend Canon S. J. Wickens has resigned as principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School as from the end of October, last. It is noted that you nominate Rev. Arthur E. Minchin, B.A., to act as principal, succeeding Canon Wickens, from the first instant.\n\nThe Department regrets that Rev. Canon Wickens has found it necessary to give up duties as principal of the Elkhorn School, where his services were entirely satisfactory. The appointment of Rev. Arthur E. Minchin as acting principal is approved, as from the first instant. The Department is aware of Mr. Minchin's qualifications, from his former services as principal of the MacKay School, The Pas, Man. It is hoped that he will meet with every success in his work at the Elkhorn School.\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, is being informed of the approval granted for the appointment of Rev. Mr. Minchin as acting principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C., Winnipeg, informs the Department that Rev. Canon S. J. Wickens has resigned from the principalship of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, owing to the state of his wife's health.\n\nOn behalf of the M. S. C. C., Dr. Westgate nominates Rev. Arthur E. Minchin, B.A., as acting principal, to succeed Canon Wickens, as from the first instant. Mr. Minchin is known to the Department, as he was principal of the MacKay School, The Pas, Man., some years ago. The Department is approving the appointment of Rev. Mr. Minchin, in the capacity of acting principal. It is hoped that he will meet with every success in the work, and I would request that you give him every possible assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Minchin, B.A., was appointed Acting Principal of our Elkhorn School, he was informed that, in due course, a specific recommendation would be made that his status be changed from Acting Principal to Principal.\n\nFor your information I may say that Mr. Minchin was for some time Principal of the Mackay School at The Pas, Man. From there he went to Prince Albert to fill the responsible position of Principal of St. George's College. After leaving Prince Albert Mr. Minchin had charge of an important parish in the Diocese of Brandon until he accepted the Acting Principalship of our Society's Indian Residential School at Elkhorn. He is a graduate in Arts of Saskatchewan University, and in Theology of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon. In view of his faithful and efficient services in Indian educational work, our Commission would recommend that this appointment to the Principalship of the Elkhorn School now be made.\n\nThanking you in advance for your sympathetic consideration of this request.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Westgate,  \nSecretary, Indian Residential Schools,  \n184 Alexander Avenue,  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nThe Department of Education wishes to acknowledge with sincere appreciation, the cooperation of your schools in sending to us art materials for the Manitoba Art Exhibit sent recently to the Exhibition of Children's Art in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nIn approximately one hundred school districts, different schools forwarded contributions for this exhibit. The Honorable, the Minister of Education examined the exhibit before it was mailed to New Zealand and expressed pleasure at the quality of the work.\n\nCareful selection was made of the specimens in order to choose for shipment the best work from different types of schools, in city, suburban or rural communities. Much material has been retained at the Department and it has been suggested that a Manitoba Art Exhibit some time next year, be arranged for the school year.\n\nIn cases where a special request was sent to the Department for return of materials, these will go forward to you in the near future, or when the New Zealand Exhibit comes back next winter.\n\nThe work from Indian Schools was arranged as a special unit in the total display and comprised a prominent part of the exhibit. One of the teachers of Art who assisted the Department of Education in assembling the Manitoba exhibit commented very favorably on the excellent work done by some of the pupils in Indian Schools. A quotation from his report follows:\n\n\"One of the bright spots is the contribution from Indian Schools. One must congratulate the staffs for their discrimination in encouraging the pursuit of native designs characteristic of their charges. One would regret any attempt to substitute the insanity of much of our design expression for that of the splendid school of native creations. The salvation of the Indian does not lie in inducing him to think along our decorative channels but in carrying on the sense of beauty portrayed in his traditional crafts.\"\n\nThe cooperation of your Church in this gesture of Empire goodwill is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Harold G. Etter,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThinking you would be interested in the opinion of a man of Dr. Etter's standing in the work of our Indian Residential Schools, I am sending you the attached letter recently received from him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclosure 1.\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nMr. Hoey has left for British Columbia on business and in his absence I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant enclosing copy of letter received from Mr. Harold C.

I took the matter up with the principal and he promised to give it immediate attention.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nOn January 10th last I wrote to you recommending that the Rev. Canon A. E. Minchin, B.A., Principal of the Indian School at Elkhorn be appointed Principal of the Shingwauk School at Sault Ste Marie in succession to the Rev. C. F. Hives.\n\nOur Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission in Winnipeg, after very careful consideration have recommended that the Rev. C. N. Middleton, B.A., Principal of the Residential School at Wabasca, be appointed in succession to the Rev. Canon A. E. Minchin as Principal of the School at Elkhorn.\n\nThe Rev. C. N. Middleton was born in Calgary, Alberta, on July 29, 1912. He graduated in Arts from St. John's College, Winnipeg in 1934; was ordained Deacon in May 1936 and advanced to the Priesthood in May 1937. He was incumbent of the parish of Morden, Manitoba, prior to being appointed Principal of the Wabasca school in August 1938. His services as Principal of the Wabasca school and as missionary to the Indians in that district have been satisfactory both to the Commission and the Bishop of Athabasca in whose Diocese the school is located.\n\nI am accordingly forwarding to the Indian Affairs Branch the recommendation of our Commission and am writing on behalf of the Executive Committee to recommend that the Rev. C. N. Middleton be appointed Principal of the Elkhorn School in succession to the Rev. Canon A. E. Minchin.\nThe Commission are anxious that Mr. Middleton proceed to Elkhorn as soon as satisfactory arrangements can be made at Wabasca.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy for information sent to The Rev.

N. Middleton, B.A., as principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. Mr. Middleton has been principal of the Wabaseg C. E. Indian Residential School for the past 35 years.

H. Middleton, B.A., from the principalship of the Wabasca C. E.

Canon Dixon recommended the transfer of Rev. C.H. Middleton from the Principalship of the Wabasca C.E. Indian Residential School to the Principalship of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. His transfer was approved but I have not yet been officially advised that Rev. Mr. Middleton has taken over his duties.\n\nRecently I received a report, dated April 31, from the R.C.M.P., with regard to a truant and in that report they refer to \"Acting Principal G. Hicks\". It might be considered, from this information, that Mr. Middleton has not yet reached Elkhorn. I am particularly anxious to know if he is in charge due to the fact that we are very much concerned with the number of cases of truancy that have occurred at this school within the past few months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just received your letter of the 4th inst., #106-0-1, requesting information regarding the date when the Rev. G. N. Middleton will be able to take charge of the Elkhorn School, and beg to state, in reply, that it is fully expected he will be able to reach Elkhorn sometime during the current month of May.\n\nI may state for your information that when Mr. Middleton wrote to me last month, requesting instruction as to the date he should leave Wabasso, he was authorized to do so as soon as he considered the road safe for him to take his wife and children over the ninety odd miles between the school and Slave Lake on the railway. As Mrs. Middleton had not been enjoying good health, and as their children are quite young, our Commission did not feel justified in asking them to make the journey during what is known in the Northland as the break-up season. As soon as he reaches Elkhorn I will advise you of that fact.\n\nWhile writing, I may also say that, until an ordained man has been secured for the Principalship of the Wabasso School, Mr. C. E. Barnes, the Farm Instructor, will take charge of that school in the capacity of Acting Principal. Mr. Barnes has been on the staff for many years, and is well and favorably known to the Indian peoples in the Wabasso district. As so many of the ordained men of our Church have been called to serve as\nR. A. Hoey, Esq. - 2. May 7, 1942.\n\nChaplains with the Active Forces, our difficulty in securing one for the Principalship of this School is quite a real one, but I hope to be able to tell you before many months have passed that the one required has been found.\n\nI should have stated above that until Mr. Middleton reaches Elkhorn, Mr. Gilbert Hicks will continue in charge of that school as Acting Principal, a position he has held from the time the Rev. A. E. Minchin left to take charge of the Shingwauk School.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW: A.\nR.A.

Middleton will be able to take over his duties as Principal of the Makhorn School, I beg to state that I have just received from Mr. Middleton a letter in which he states that he expects to be able to leave Wabasca at the end of May. He further states that \"As Mrs. Middleton is hardly well enough to travel out over the trail, she will go to Edmonton, with the baby, by plane\".\n\nI think I can assure you that there has been no unavoidable delay in arranging for Mr. Middleton's transfer, and that in this, as in all matters relating to the administration of our Society's Indian Residential Schools, our Commission are giving your Department the fullest possible cooperation.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nThe Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY, M.S.C.C.\nREV.

He reported that a delegation of Indians of which he was one attended at the Elkhorn School to check up on complaints made by their children as to conditions obtaining there.\n\nThe Indians claim to have found conditions in the school very unsatisfactory and report in particular:\n\nThe downstairs toilet in the boys' playroom was plugged and a condition of indescribable filth exists.\n\nThe upstairs toilet in the girls' dormitory was also out of order and the girls compelled to bail it out with pails.\n\nThe beds in the girls' quarters were in a dilapidated condition tied together with the girls' stockings, strings and any other contrivance that would keep them together.\n\nThe clothing and shoes the children were asked to wear were in a deplorable condition and I asked Mr. Lovell to send you the samples that were presented for my examination.\n\nThey reported that there was no butter and no bread on the table an enquiry elicited the information that the lack of butter was a punishment handed out to the students because they would not squeal on a boy who had stolen a pound of lard to assist in making a rabbit stew which formed the piece de resistance at a feast they held in the bush utilizing rabbits snared by some of the boys. They also complained that no vegetables had been served for weeks but the School Principal showed them an order that he had that day placed for fresh vegetables.\n\nOver\nThe delegation also complained that in a dormitory of 30 or 40 boys there were only two towels made available to them.\n\nThey also complained that the school was improperly heated and the youngsters locked themselves in the clothes closets because they were the only places that were comfortable.\n\nMr. Cornelius Bignell who was the spokesman for the group said that they were afraid to press their complaints very strongly to the Principal as they were sure that he would take it out on the youngsters as soon as they left. Mr. Bignell is a very quiet-spoken, rational sort of person who confessed that their complaints to the Principal were made with a great deal of restraint as they felt that it was the duty of the Department rather than that of the Indians to see that the conditions in the School were remedied. He made the statement that while it was admitted that living conditions in an Indian village were not of a very high standard, they were much less crude, much less insanitary and much more convenient than their children enjoyed in the Elkhorn School. I am sorry that I overlooked discussing this matter with Inspector Hamilton when I saw him later in Winnipeg. You, however, have his report.\n\nThis memorandum is only designed to place the text of the Indian complaint before you. The Indian presentation to me was made in an entirely rational way; nobody was abused and the delegation was so restrained in their language that I was very much impressed with their sincerity. If half of what they report is true a surprise inspection of the School should be made.\n\nD. J. Allan\nSuperintendent\nReserves & Trusts\nOttawa, March 7, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

Hoey\n\nRe Elkhorn School\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am given to understand that an official inspection of this school was recently carried out and I have reason to anticipate that the report will not be altogether favourable. May I, therefore, be allowed to state a few considerations which I think should be borne in mind in regard to this particular school.\n\nBefore definitely assuming my duties under the Commission I visited Elkhorn last May. It was the first of our schools that I had seen and I must confess that in many respects I was really disappointed. The building was manifestly rundown and in need of very considerable work to repair floors, stairways and plaster walls. There was also much need of painting and decorating, particularly in the basement section. One amazing feature to me was the fact that in this large school there was absolutely no provision for recreation. The boys and girls had to use their respective washrooms for indoor play and the results can readily be imagined. With this consideration foremost in my mind I welcomed the plan already authorized by the Department of converting the large building on the grounds, formerly used for Manual Training, into three classrooms. This would allow for the two classrooms in the main building to be set apart for recreation and while this was not ideal it certainly represented a great step forward. I urged the Principal to do everything in his power to press forward with the completion of this plan during the summer months.\n\nWith a large enrollment and the handicaps mentioned above, I was not surprised to find trouble in the staff. I have learned to expect trouble when conditions become too difficult and the strain too great. Personal differences had developed under these conditions and I found serious friction existing among our workers. We took steps to correct this situation and made a number of changes, so that by the Fall we had enrolled eight new members of our staff and felt that we were facing a new school year with hope.\n\nUnfortunately I soon learned that a new problem had developed in connection with the Principal. Mr. Middleton had done a good job at Wabasca but my personal opinion is that he had not the\nnecessary strength or maturity of character to handle such a large and difficult situation as that existing at Elkhorn. His domestic difficulties developed and it became evident that he was laboring under a personal strain which prevented him from concentrating upon his school duties. In an endeavour to keep in touch with the situation I have paid three visits to this particular school and have done my best to press forward the completion of the new classrooms. It was difficult to secure labour and especially skilled help such as bricklaying for the new chimney and also the installation of the furnace. The men on the school staff did considerable work in excavating a complete basement to serve as a vegetable storage, but I think they usually undertook more than they could manage and other duties suffered. I visited the school one Saturday morning towards the end of last year and was greatly disappointed to find the work almost at a standstill by reason of these factors. It was a day when the snow had melted and the grounds were so wet and muddy that the children were not allowed out. The classrooms had been scrubbed and made ready for the new week and consequently the children were milling about in the inadequate washrooms and adjoining corridors. It is easy to imagine what damage is done to walls and woodwork and plumbing under these conditions, and I felt deep sympathy for the staff in trying to cope with an impossible situation. I was again assured that the work on the new building would be pushed forward during the Christmas holiday, with every prospect of the playrooms being ready early in the New Year. A little later we gathered that Mr. Middleton would probably be resigning and I gather that he has been unable to put his plans into effect for some time now.\n\nOn receipt of some complaints about the school, our Assistant Secretary, Colonel Marmagen, paid a visit a few weeks ago. He took strong measures to see that necessary material was secured to finish the classrooms and also to install or repair plumbing that had been broken or removed. It was with deep chagrin that we heard since then at the time of the inspection one of the most necessary installations had not been made, although the new equipment had been ordered and sent to the school.\n\nI have stated these facts to make it plain that this particular school has not been neglected but has been the object of special concern to us. I feel that the personal difficulties of the Principal have operated against efficiency and we are now bending our energies to find the strongest possible man to take hold of an admittedly difficult situation. I fear that the enrolment shows the need of this school particularly in view of the fact that the Mackay School at The Pas has never been replaced. I trust that the Department will keep in mind our reiterated request for a new school to be built on the Hudson Bay line between The Pas and Churchill. I am convinced that it is not sound to bring these bush children down to a prairie school like Elkhorn, and that they could much more helpfully be cared for in a building situated in the north. As far as Elkhorn is concerned, I cannot feel there is need for despair if we can secure the right Principal, the provision of playrooms in the building and a sufficient expenditure to repair and put it in good order.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Allenwood\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI regret to advise you that a change in the Principalship at our Elkhorn school has become necessary. The Rev. C.N. Middleton has been unsettled for a considerable time on personal grounds and has given us to understand that he would probably be returning to parish life. We now understand that Mr. Middleton will be leaving the school some time this month although we have not yet received word from him as to the exact date.\n\nWe have for some time been in touch with various men with a view to securing a suitable nomination for presentation to the Department. To safeguard ourselves against any period without a head to the school, we have asked Mr. B. Hodkinson to assume the duties of Acting Principal until a successor to Mr. Middleton is able to take charge. Mr. Hodkinson has just retired from the teaching profession and was commended to us by Dr. Fletcher. Both he and his wife formerly served on the staff at Lytton and he has had a wide experience in ordinary schools. He went to the school at the beginning of this month, so that he would be able to get a general knowledge of the business before Mr. Middleton left.\n\nIt is our confident hope that a new Principal may be appointed in time to allow him to assume his duties during the summer in good time for the reopening of the school in September.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 17, 1944.\n\nRe: Elkhorn School.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 10, in which you submit information in respect to conditions at the Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nI may state by way of comment that a delegation representing Indians of The Pas district waited upon Mr. Allan, Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts, at The Pas a few weeks ago and complained somewhat bitterly about conditions at the Elkhorn School. These Indians appeared anxious to have an Indian day school established at The Pas. In view of the representations made to Mr. Allan at that time, it was decided to have Dr. Simes, Superintendent of the Qu'Appelle Sanatorium, and Inspector Hamilton make an inspection of the institution, particularly the sanitary conditions. However, I have not yet received a report on the investigation, but it is altogether likely that I shall hear from either Dr. Simes or Inspector Hamilton in the course of a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

I can only express the hope that you will find it possible to make a permanent appointment prior to the opening of the next school year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

We are very anxious to secure a copy of the report made by Dr. Simes and you, immediately following your investigation of conditions at the Elkhorn School. If a report was sent forward by either Dr. Simes or yourself, it has not reached this Department. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

He is extremely anxious to receive your report on this with as little delay as possible. There are urgent reasons why this should not be delayed. Please advise me by return air mail when you expect to go there.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services\n\nA. B.

I, therefore, arranged my work and met Dr. Simes at Elkhorn on April 4th.\n\nI understood from the Director, Dr. McGill, that Dr. Simes was being asked to make this special investigation and it was my understanding that Dr. Simes was reporting direct to Ottawa.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nElkhorn School\n\nWhen visiting the above school a few days ago I was delighted to find very definite improvements already effected under the leadership of Mr. Hodkinson. He is certainly handling affairs in a business-like way and seems to have secured the hearty co-operation of the staff.\n\nOn a previous visit I urged again the full use of the military uniforms which your office is kindly making available for the schools, and was assured that Mrs. Hodkinson, who is acting as seamstress, would follow through the suggestion, and I have now had pleasure in sending you a sample pair of boy's shorts which is one of a number shown to me. I took up the question of the terrible items of clothing which were sent to you, and may say that I still find it difficult to believe that any pupil was sent home with such garments. It rather seems to me that they represent the results of some hard wear through the summer and were used to make a good case. However, I am assured that by reason of the work now being done in the Sewing-Room every boy will go home with a new pair of khaki trousers, reduced to size in the case of the bigger boys and pairs of shorts for the juniors. New clothing is also being made for the girls and we have for some time been making strenuous efforts to secure running shoes and other footwear. As you know, it is exceedingly difficult to obtain supplies of some of these items, but we are hopeful that there will be no cause for complaint on this occasion.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood.\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI inspected the Elkhorn Indian Residential School on May 18th and wish to report as follows:\n\nThere are 134 pupils enrolled: boys - 55; and girls - 79. There are three teachers and the pupils appear to be making fair progress in their respective grades. All were neatly dressed and clean in appearance.\n\nThe dining-room has been painted and now is much brighter. The floors are hardwood, but have no filler or finish. I would recommend that these floors be treated with two coats of Tremco penetrain. It will require about five gallons to do this; but the floors will have a good finish and be much easier to keep clean.\n\nThe dormitories were well aired and clean. Two have been painted and the walls and ceiling are now bright and clean.\n\nThe new class-rooms are not in use yet, but should be ready for the fall term in September. This change will provide a nice playroom and reading-room for both the girls and boys. In digging the basement under the proposed new class-rooms provision has been made for a large root cellar. The Principal found to his disappointment that some water appeared so it will now be necessary to fill in the excavation at least one foot, after which a cement floor may be required. This cement floor will involve extra expense and he requested that the Department pay for the cement. In view of the circumstances I think this should be allowed.\n\nThe children appear well fed and attached is a copy of the menu followed. You will note the quantities used for one meal are inserted in red. The children receive all the bread they desire and I found the brown bread very wholesome. Miss Long is a graduate nurse and is the matron. She is greatly interested in the children and gives careful consideration to their food requirements.\nThe cattle number thirty head and a fair supply of milk is provided. The milk is served to the children to drink or on porridge or in milk puddings.\n\nThe sewing-room, laundry, kitchen and bakery are well supervised and the girls receive a good training in the work of these departments.\n\nThe farm seeding was well along and they also expect to have a large garden in addition to several acres of potatoes.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Middleton has been at Elkhorn for less than one year. He appears greatly interested in his work and I find him willing and anxious to co-operate in every respect.\n\nI hope funds will be made available to carry out the enclosed recommendations.\n\n(Sgd.)

The sanitary and heating applicances were very poor, clothing and food far worse than what the parents had ever given their children. What the visitors saw said that condition were so bad that it was utterly impossible for any body to believe unless one actually saw with his own eyes. We therefore demand that an investigation be made immediately before some sickness breaks out. The school in our opinion should be closed and children be sent home. We are ready to be questioned on our findings during our visit there. We even brought back some samples of clothing which we found our children wearing.\n\nThere are enough Treaty and Non-Treaty children here right in the Pas for a large improved Day School to be built. The Governments expense would be far less and the children could go home every evening.\n\n(signatures) Chief\n2 Councillors\n7 Band members.\n\nTHE PAS, MAN.\nJanuary 18th, 1944.\n\n1. A meeting was held in The Pas Reserve. The Chief and his Councillors including the President of the Halibreed Association with his Councillors were present.\n\n2. The meeting was for the purpose of discussing matter pertaining to\neducating the Treaty Indians with the non-Treaty Indians of this district.\n\n3. A resolution was passed to petition both the Federal and Provincial Governments for an improved Day School sufficiently large enough to accommodate all the treaty and nontreaty children living round the vicinity of The Pas, as the Day Schools in the Reserve cannot take any non-treaty children being too small.\n\n4. We have always been informed that the Government was not much in favor of Residential Schools.\n\n5. That the halfbreed Day School be opened with a teacher who has taught in Indian Schools and who is able to talk the language until such time as an improved Day School could be built. By past experience it has been found that children under such a teacher always got along better.\n\n6. The reason, this petition (5) is if the children come back home (Treaty children) from Elkhorn there will not be enough room in the Day Schools in the Reserve to accommodate the above children much less the Halfbreed children.\n\nSigned:\n\nChief Pas Band, Indian Reserve,\nCouncillors\n\nLouis McGillivary\nCornelius Bignell\nAntoine Constant\nAntoine Cook\nDonald Lethlin\nJohn William Harris\nJos Nesikepow\nMatthew McGillivary\nWm.

Allan\nSuperintendent\nReserves & Trusts\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Canada.\n\nRE: Elkhorn School\n\nI was at this school on September 19th. A Principal has not yet been appointed and things generally are in a hopeless condition. The school is not being operated, it is just running. Mr. Young, the Indian Agent, had the day before rounded up four or five children who had run away and had them escorted back. The same night eight others left and these were still away, and several are girls.\n\nThe dormitories were none too clean\u2014toilets, washbasins were dirty. The staff seemed unimpressed, even after pointing out the existing condition. A new toilet bowl is needed in the boys dormitory. A toilet bowl complete with flush tank is needed in the girl's washroom. Towels were scattered about the washroom with perhaps five or six on hooks.\n\nThe roof of the school is, I understand, covered with tin or some such metal. It leaks in various places and should be repaired. It might be advisable to have this examined by someone from the Survey's and Engineering Branch, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Winnipeg, of which Mr. Gow is in charge, and a recommendation obtained. The roof on the outside classrooms also leaks and this could be examined at the same time. This roof is covered with roofing paper and tar. The school authorities have stood by all summer and fall and did nothing, while the rains soaked through and ruined the tent set used on the classroom ceiling.\n\nI have ordered the new fire escape doors and Mr. Young will try to get a carpenter to hang them.\n\n(Cont'd)\nand at the same time make the other alterations suggested by the Fire Inspector.\n\nI am greatly concerned about the existing conditions at this school. I am convinced the pupils should not have been allowed back until the church provided a suitable Principal and Staff. Even now I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion the school should be closed before cold weather sets in, unless the Church appoints a well qualified Principal. The man need not be a minister. An alert active business man with experience in handling a staff and knowing how to administer discipline is the requirement. A real driving force is needed and even then he will have a full time job.\n\nIf this school is left open under present management and the children continue to run away, someone will be frozen to death or killed in riding trains. I think the Department should set a date beyond which they cannot wait longer for a Principal, and that date should not be later than October 15th. There is altogether too much delay in securing a Principal whom they knew was urgently required more than 6 months ago.\n\nI hope this matter will be taken seriously by all concerned and that I may be advised concerning the outcome.\n\nA.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Elkhorn Residential School.

As soon as I hear further from him I will advise you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 25, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI inclose a copy of a letter which has just been received from Mr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, regarding a recent inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nI would appreciate an immediate reply from you indicating what action you consider could be taken.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indians & Eskimos,\nResidential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House, 164 Alexander Ave., E.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nThe Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMISSION\nREV. H. A. ALDERWOOD, D.D.\n\nTELEPHONE 24612\n\n38-43 THE BIBLE HOUSE\n184 ALEXANDER AVE. EAST\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nSeptember 27, 1944\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have to acknowledge your reference 106-0-1 of the 25th in regard to the Elkhorn School and have read with deep concern the letter from Inspector Hamilton.\n\nI think the Inspector scarcely gives us credit for the continual efforts we have made to secure a Principal since the withdrawal of Mr. Middleton less than five months ago. We have endeavoured to secure the transfer of three of our experienced Principals but all in turn did not desire to change. We have twice been disappointed by an applicant withdrawing after the somewhat involved procedure had been followed and we were ready to suggest his appointment. My last disappointment was the information given to me by Canon Shepherd after my conversation with you. He has accepted a teaching position for the winter in Eastern Canada and is not available. I had hoped that he would have been able to go out almost immediately and take charge of the school for at least a few months.\n\nWith much of Inspector Hamilton's letter I am compelled to agree and can assure you that the state of this school has been a genuine burden to us. We have a number of excellent staff members who only require a strong lead to place the school on a satisfactory footing. Unfortunately, the Acting Principal has not been able to maintain a happy relationship with the Head Matron and Farm Instructor and thus internal dissension has led to the weakness described. I may say that a number of visits have been paid from this office and we were so confident that a new Principal would be secured that we urged the Acting Principal to secure the usual number of pupils. In view of the information about runaways I have asked our Assistant Secretary Treasurer to go to Elkhorn at once and he expects to spend a few days in a thorough review of the position. Beyond this I am asking the Rev. J.W. House of Gleichen; in whose judgment we have complete confidence, to spare a little time from his school in taking hold of the Elkhorn situation while we speed our efforts to reach a satisfactory conclusion. We are in communication with a former\nmember of our staff who would make an excellent Principal and if he fails us have another applicant who might be secured without too much delay. I mention these things to assure you that we do not for a moment despair of finding the right man. We could have closed the matter long since if we had not been particularly anxious about this appointment.\n\nI shall write again as soon as Col. Marmagen returns from the school, and do not think there will be any necessity to suggest so drastic a step as closing down at this juncture.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant and my reply of the 25th instant, I am now in receipt of a letter from Reverend Doctor Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Commission.\n\nColonel Mermagen from Doctor Alderwood's office has already proceeded to the Elkhorn School and he will spend several days there reviewing the whole situation. In addition Reverend J.W. House, Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, is being sent to Elkhorn temporarily. In the meantime Doctor Alderwood is making every possible effort to secure a qualified Principal and he feels that he will be successful in this regard within a reasonable time.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant and have noted with particular interest the efforts that you are making to improve conditions at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will be successful in obtaining a competent man as Principal of this school. I trust that you will keep me closely in touch with developments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Elkhorn School,\nYour file 106-0-1 - September 30th.\n\nI am glad that at last provision has been made for a Principal for this School.\n\nI called today at the Winnipeg Paint and Glass (Sash and Door Factory) regarding the fire escape doors, but it will be ten days yet before they can deliver the doors. There is a heavy building program going on in Winnipeg and the sash and door work is weeks behind. They have, however, promised to give my order early consideration. Only one other firm quoted and their price was almost double that given by the Winnipeg Paint and Glass.\n\nMr. Young, Indian Agent at Griswold, has a man in view to hang the doors and make the other alterations authorized and we hope he will be available as soon as the doors arrive. It seems rather difficult to get repair work started at both Elkhorn and Brandon, although I think Mr. Strapp will do well if given a chance. He has lots of worries at the school and in addition I understand his wife is very ill in the East.\n\nI would, however, like to definitely recommend that Mr. Young be requested to inspect both these schools once a month and submit a report, in duplicate, through this office. If this is done we will then know exactly the conditions existing and also what improvements have been carried out. All our other schools are tied in with some Agency and checked by the Indian Agent; there is no reason why Brandon and Elkhorn should be exceptions.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nOctober 5, 1944.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Elkhorn School\n\nFurther to my letter of the 27th I now beg to give you the report of our Assistant Secretary-Treasurer who has just returned after spending several days in the school. You will note that Colonel Mermagen has dealt in order with the matters raised by Inspector Hamilton and I believe you will agree that the conditions are scarcely as bad as suggested.\n\nWe are taking up strongly with the Principal of the Elkhorn Public School the matter of discrimination and unfair criticism which led to the truancy of the older girls. This is not an isolated example and certainly suggests one of the difficulties under which our boarding schools labour. The location of the Elkhorn School is far from ideal in this connection and the proximity both to railway and highway makes it very easy for children to run away when they are upset in any way.\n\nI trust that the Inspector is following through his suggestions in regard to necessary repairs to the roof, both of the school and the new classroom building, and that he will be successful in securing a carpenter to attend to the alterations suggested by the Fire Inspector.\n\nI am happy to advise you that the Rev. J.W. House will be at Elkhorn on the 9th and in the following month will alternate between the two schools so that his own duties may not be neglected. I have offered to co-operate with him in making this possible. We are also in touch with the Rev. C.F. Hives of Lytton, who has offered us the services of his Vice-Principal and it is possible that he may be appointed in an acting capacity in the very near future. Mr. Hives knows the Elkhorn situation and feels that his nominee is quite capable of meeting the situation.\n\nI trust that you feel that we are doing all that is possible in the circumstances and that there is no need of making any such suggestion as drastic as closing the school if the Inspector will co-operate with us in the carrying out of the necessary repairs.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nOctober 3, 1944.\n\nREPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY-TREASURER RE ELKHORN SCHOOL\n\nReferring to the letter dated 22nd September, written by Inspector Hamilton to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont. I beg to report as follows:\n\n(1) That a Principal has not been appointed is due to the fact that the Commission has on several occasions been disappointed at the last moment. Prospective candidates have seemed interested until they have been asked to set a date upon which they will be able to take over their duties. In each case some obstacle has always arisen. The Acting Principal should be commended, not censured, for making the best of a difficult situation.\n\nMr. Young, the Indian Agent, of Griswold, did not \"round up\" the four or five children who had run away, but had been notified by telephone of their absence and as they were from his Reservation was requested to keep an eye open for them. They were apprehended on the main road between Elkhorn and Hargraves. Of the eight others who left the same night, Mr. Hamilton states that \"some of them were girls\". As a matter of fact all were girls, and the reason for their leaving was because three of them, who were High School pupils, considered they had been insulted by their teacher at the Public School, who said they were only Indians and not up to the standard of work required for their grade. The remainder went out of sympathy or because they had some cause of offence against the staff. They were all picked up by the Mounted Police and returned to the School inside twenty four hours. One other girl who disliked her teacher went away on the morning passenger train to her home at Griswold but returned the next day of her own accord. All are now back at the school and appear quite content. I made a point of interviewing each one of them and with one exception secured a promise that they would not run away again. The exception was one of the biggest girls in the school who comes from Hodgson and does not seem to get on with the other pupils.\n\n(2) I visited the school unexpectedly and found the dormitories clean and swept. Toilets were clean and working properly but the wash basins needed cleaning. Partly this is due to the fact that the crop is now being harvested and many of the boys are being used until late in the fields. The great point is, however, that the plumbing is old and basins and taps should be renewed. The building was erected in 1897 and the whole of the interior is in a dilapidated condition which no amount of scrubbing or sweeping will eradicate. Shortage of man-power has also contributed largely to the difficulties of administration. In his report, Inspector Hamilton states that even after pointing out existing conditions, the staff seemed unimpressed. What he actually said to the members of the staff was that they were \"indifferent\". Owing to an incomplete staff every member was doing more than their fair share of work and objected to being accused of being indifferent. A new toilet bowl is being installed in the Boys' dormitory at the present time and another toilet bowl, complete with flush tank should be provided by the Department at once. In spite of my unexpected visit I found possibly five towels on the floor or forms and all the rest hanging up.\n\n(3) The Inspector reports that he understands that the roof of the school is leaking in several places and should be repaired. This\ncondition has been reported to him several times during the past two years but has not been remedied. The roof of the outside classroom also leaks and this also was reported. The suggestion that someone from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Winnipeg, might examine these roofs, is most timely and should have been made before this.\n\nI further recommend that at least two extra Bath rooms be provided for both boys and girls and also than an extra toilet compartment for each be supplied.\n\n(4) The report states that new fire escape doors and other alterations suggested by the Fire Inspector have been ordered and that Mr. Young will \"try\" to get a carpenter to hang them. If such difficulty is being experienced by the Indian Agent why should the School staff be expected to be more successful?\n\n(5) Under existing conditions, I submit that everything possible is being done to carry on. The school is being administered, not just running, and as already stated the Acting Principal is doing his best under adverse conditions. He is an experienced teacher and administrator and is receiving the loyal support of the staff of twelve, nine of whom have had experience in other schools. The one exception is the Farm Instructor who has been responsible for much of the discord and insubordination and whose removal is reluctantly recommended.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) E.W. Mermagen.\nOttawa, October 10, 1944.\n\nRe: Conditions at Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 5 and also copy of a report submitted to you by Colonel E. W. Mermagen, immediately following his inspection of the Elkhorn Residential School, sent forward therewith.\n\nI was particularly pleased to note that the Reverend J. W. House will visit Elkhorn on the 9th instant and that it is his intention to alternate between the two schools until conditions at Elkhorn gradually re-adjust themselves. It is unnecessary to add that your courtesy and thoughtfulness in sending forward this information is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-45 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, in connection with the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I note from the last paragraph of your letter that you suggest monthly inspections of the Brandon and Elkhorn Schools by Indian Agent Young.\n\nThe Department feels that both of these schools require very careful supervision during the next year at least and consequently it is desired that you inspect these schools every two months during the next twelve-month period and submit a report to this office. You should make your first inspection of these two schools about the end of the present month, the next at the end of December and subsequent inspections every two months thereafter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIn a further letter just received from Doctor Alderwood he encloses a report made by Colonel E.W. Mermagen, regarding the Elkhorn School. One of the recommendations contained in this report reads as follows:\n\n\"I recommend that at least two extra bathrooms be provided for both boys and girls and also that an extra toilet compartment for each be supplied.\"\n\nOn the occasion of your next inspection of the school you should ascertain if it is feasible to make the installations recommended and, if so, you should let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to know if it would be possible for me to get a position as manager on one of your school farms in Manitoba or Saskatchewan.\n\nI am a Protestant, 46 years of age, married Scotch and clean. I have a lifetime experience in farming in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nNames of people for reference could be furnished at request.\n\nI understand that the school at Elkhorn, Manitoba is in need of a farm manager. Would it be possible for me to get this position?\n\nYours truly,\nErnest Walliday\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the possibility of securing a position as farm manager at one of the Indian residential schools in Manitoba or Saskatchewan.\n\nAll staff at Indian residential schools is engaged by the Church which is co-operating with the Department in the management of the school concerned. I note that you state that you are a Protestant and I, therefore, suggest that you communicate with either, or both, of the following gentlemen:\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. G.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Ernest Halliday,\nDoncrest, Sask.\nOctober 19, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are already aware, we have been experiencing some difficulty, owing to war conditions, in finding a suitable Principal for the Indian School at Elkhorn, Man. I think, however, that we have now found such a man in Mr. Ralph E. Hiltz.\n\nMr. Hiltz has been serving for the past year as Vice-Principal of the school at Lytton. On the basis of his service he has been strongly recommended by the Principal, the Rev. C. F. Hives. He is twenty-eight years of age, has been a student for two years in the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, and has had considerable experience in school work. Mr. Hives has reported very favourably of him as a man of high Christian character, and one with remarkable influence for good over Indian children. He would be available for duty at Elkhorn by November 1st.\n\nOn the recommendation of our Commission, therefore, I write to ask that Mr. Hiltz be appointed Principal of the Elkhorn School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nOctober 21, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have given careful thought to the contents of your letter of October 10th in regard to the Elkhorn School and the possibility of securing another building north of The Pas. As our Commission was meeting last Friday, I introduced the general subject in a tentative way but fuller consideration was deferred to a later date owing to pressure of business. As I had the opportunity of spending the weekend at Elkhorn, I think it well to give you my personal reaction to your suggestions.\n\n1. I am in full sympathy with the criticisms often made as to the unwisdom of sending \"bush children\" from the north to such a prairie school as Elkhorn. We have one of our best school farms at this point and there is no doubt that the pupils receive valuable training in it, but this is not worth much to boys who are returning to a hunting and trapping life and will not have the opportunity of using their agricultural knowledge. The more serious objection lies in the undoubted fact that they lose the opportunity of learning the very things needed for the kind of life they will probably live, through being entirely removed from the bush environment in a number of years. It is easy, however, to understand why this is done, in the light of history. I find that the situation only arose after the destruction of the Mackay School at the Pas by fire in March 1933. This school apparently had 84 northern children in residence at the time and 50 of these were afterwards transferred to Elkhorn when the Department decided not to rebuild. I am confident that this was a mistake, has worked a hardship on the bush children, and has overcrowded Elkhorn in a harmful manner. My mind is therefore clear that whenever possible a building should be secured or built north of the Pas. The present American Hospital building might be a good solution, though I am a little doubtful of the wisdom of trying to have both school and hospital at the one spot. I think your files will show that we have on numerous occasions asked for the building of a school up the Hudson's Bay line. The Bishop of Keswatin has been particularly anxious for this, claiming that he has a very large number of children in the direction of Churchill who are without educational privileges. If the present building north of the Pas should be found\nsuitable it might well serve the area to the north as the pupils could readily be transported by train.\n\n2. In regard to the present building at Elkhorn I cannot feel that it should lightly be abandoned. I find that at present there are roughly 70 children in residence from the south of the province and 60 from the Pas and north. Some of the latter travel 900 miles to the school while from the Pas the distance is 680 miles. In analyzing the attendance from southern reserves, I find that 37 are from Oak River and this number will probably be increased by at least five. About 30 come from the group of reserves in the Interlake area especially Peguis and Fairford. I am told that this number could be considerably increased but for the fact that the school is already overloaded. There are also three from Sintaluta and again it has been said that there should be at least ten from this point. I think it a fair conclusion therefore that Elkhorn could without difficulty have a hundred pupils from the southern part of the province and this is about all the building should be asked to carry. It would take much of the present tension out of the building with a smaller number of pupils, a smaller farm and the unity which could be attained when the pupils are all pretty much of one type. If Elkhorn should be closed and no building substituted in the south we should have the present problem reversed, for our Peguis and Fairford Indians in particular would have to come into Winnipeg before travelling to the Pas and there would be many objections to this.\n\nIt is true that the present Elkhorn building is badly run-down and I am expecting a full report from Mr. House, who has naturally been shocked at the contrast with his own splendid building. My personal feeling, however, is that the building has been well constructed and is sound in the main. It could certainly be put in good order at a very small cost compared with the construction of a new school.\n\nIt seems to me that our Church has really suffered a good deal since the loss of the Mackay School. Whereas according to the 1939 Census we had a larger number of Indians in the province than either the United or Roman Churches we have only had inadequate provision for 155 pupils at Elkhorn, while the United has been allowed 365 in three schools and the Roman Church 340 in four residential Schools.\n\nI have thought it well to write at length as various matters related to this question are likely to be decided before long. I am giving merely a personal opinion at this moment when I say that I believe the situation calls for the retention of Elkhorn and the provision of another Anglican School north of the Pas. I shall obtain further information regarding the whole question and bring it before our Commission at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. H.

The grounds were very untidy, articles of clothing and other wearing apparel were scattered over the yard, school entrances and steps. Many window panes were broken. The unbroken panes had the appearance of having been treated for a BLACOUT, they were so dirty. Inside the building these impressions were confirmed by findings wherever you went.\n\nAt the time of my inspection, April 4th, and 5th, 1944, this school was in charge of Mr. B. Hodgkinson, who had just been appointed acting principal.\n\n143 pupils were registered, 86 of these were girls. Your pupils, two boys and one girl were taking grade 8 and one girl was taking grade 10 in the local High School. Four patients, three girls and one boy were confined to bed in the school infirmary.\n\n1. DORMITORIES\n\n(A) Air Space\n\nThe attached chart shows the available air space per pupil in each dormitory. The Saskatchewan Government Public Health Regulations require 800 cu. ft. of air for each hospital patient and at least 400 cu. ft. for each person in any public hotel. In view of these regulations it should not be unreasonable to ask that 600 cu. ft. be provided for each occupant in any room used as a dormitory, for ten months of the year.\n\nIf such is the case, this chart shows a definite overcrowding exists.\n\n(B) Ventilation\n\nSmall slides at the bottom of some windows were the only source of ventilation. Broken window panes indirectly supplemented this means of ventilation. It certainly was not adequate or satisfactory. A draft passed over the occupants of the beds opposite the open windows.\n\nProvision could be made for all windows in dormitories to open at least six inches from the top.\n\n(C) Beds & Bedding\n\nAll that can be said in favor of the beds is that they are of pre-war manufacture. As such they are sturdier built than it is possible to purchase at the present time. Their appearance would be improved by a coat of enamel. The springs are held together by every conceivable means, wire, cord, etc. It should be possible to secure wire links and coils to repair these springs. The springs on every bed will require extensive repairs.\n\n\"Filthy\" is the only word and even that does not adequately describe the condition of mattresses, pillows, and bedding. The majority of the mattresses have long since served their usefulness.\n\nOnly the pillows in the junior girls' dormitory were noticed to have pillow slips. In all other dormitories they were conspicuous by their absence.\n\n2. PLUMBING\n\n(A) Toilets\n\nThe attached chart also shows toilet facilities and condition of same in each dormitory.\n2. PLUMBING - continued.\n\n(A) Toilets\n\nThree toilet bowls were situated at the south end of the girls' wash room. Two of these were in proper working order. One did contain fecal matter. Another had a bad leak from an over head flushing tank, which flooded the floor surrounding the toilets. This leak could not be of recent origin, as there was a piece of wooden duck walk in front of the bowl, to keep the user's feet out of the water. The door at the entrance of one toilet was off its hinges.\n\nThe toilet paper containers were located outside of the toilet on the wall between the doors.\n\nIn the boys wash and play room on the south side of the building, there was plumbing for three toilet bowls but only two were installed. There were no urinals.\n\nNot a single toilet bowl in the whole school had a seat. The majority of the bowls were badly stained, and had an uncared for appearance.\n\nI have no recollection of seeing any outside toilets.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Provincial Health Regulations require one toilet seat to every 18 pupils.\n\n(B) Wash Basins\n\nThe girls' washroom, which is 27' by 14' is located on the ground floor in the west half of northern portion of the building. This room is cold and uninviting, possibly due to its cement floor and poor lighting.\n\nTen wash basins provided with two taps each, are situated on the west wall of this room. Examination revealed that neither tap on one basin, and only one on three others were in working order. Some of the basins contained dirty water. On investigation it was found that the stoppers were made of toilet paper.\n\nTwo roller towels were hanging in this room.\n\nThe boys' washroom, which is 26' by 14' is located in the southern portion on the ground floor. It also was cold and uninviting, similar to the girls for the same reason.\n\nTwelve basins provided with two taps each, are situated on the west wall. Neither taps on one, and only one on two other basins were working.\n\nTwo roller towels were hanging in this room.\n\nNot a single stopper was found in either wash room. All basins had an uncared for appearance.\n\n(C) Bathing Accommodation\n\nTwo tubs for use of the girls were partitioned off in the northern end of their play room. The floor is of cement. It was moist at the time of our visit. There was a wooden duck walk beside each tub. Both of these were in broken condition. There was a shower fixture over one tub, which was leaking. The handle for its control valve was missing. As the tub had a rusted spot, where the shower dripped, one would conclude the leak was not of recent origin.\n\nOn the boys' side a small room 9' by 14' adjacent to their play room, contained two tubs as well as a shower. The waste water from the baths and shower flows out over the floor to an open drain in the boys play and wash room.\n\n3. HEATING FACILITIES\n\nEven if the building had been kept in first class repair, difficulty in maintaining a satisfactory temperature would be experienced on account of its age. With the neglect, which is evident in toilets, wash basins and bathrooms, is equally evident in not maintaining the building in good repair. Poorly fitted storm windows,\n3. HEATING FACILITIES - continued\n\nAbsence of storm doors, and innumerable broken panes of glass, increase the heating difficulties.\n\nThe heating plant is a Gurney Hot Water Furnace, equipped with an automatic stoker. One section of the furnace was reported cut off when the stoker was installed a few years ago. The engineer admitted difficulty in maintaining a comfortable temperature in many of the rooms during the cold weather, especially if it was windy. From personal experience, this furnace does not appear to be any more than large enough to satisfactorily heat this building, if all its sections were in perfect working order.\n\nIf the welfare of the children had been considered, steps would have been taken to have the defective section repaired and put in order. The inability to maintain the building at a comfortable temperature did not originate during the winter months of 1945-46.\n\n4. FIRE HAZARDS\n\nThe fire escapes in the dormitories lead through a window using only the lower half. The steps up to these windows were not solid, with the confusion during a fire they are apt to cause the pupils to fall. Serious consequences could easily result. In the laundry there is an old kitchen range used to heat the sea irons. While it was located adjacent to the chimney it had to be continually operated with all drafts wide open. Clothes on lines and on clothes horses were near this stove. This did constitute a serious fire menace as it was on the basement floor in the center of the building.\n\nThroughout the building were fire extinguishers.\n\n5. CLOTHING & GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CHILDREN\n\nNo matter where the children were contacted, in the class rooms, in the dining room, about the school, or out of doors on the play ground, they were dirty and their clothes were disgraceful. The clothing was not only dirty but torn and ragged. Their stockings were full of holes. Not a single child was observed to be wearing a good pair of boots. No difference was noticed in the clothing worn at meals, in the class room or outside. Several of the boys took off overalls when they came into the wash room from outside.\n\nMany of the children playing out doors had a half frozen appearance.\n\nThere is no doubt about these children being very poorly clad. They certainly were not provided with sufficient clothing to keep warm during the cold winter months, if they did not have on more appropriate clothing than worn the day of this inspection.\n\nThere was no evidence of extra clothing having been issued, except what seen in the laundry and sewing room. The quantity observed in these two places did not impress one as being sufficient for a complete change for all pupils.\n\nThe provision made, for the care of clothing in use, was not such to induce or teach any child to care for their wearing apparel. For example, in the girls' washroom, along the wall 27' in length was supposed to be sufficient hooks for 88 girls to hang their coats and hats up. Along this same wall was a row of seats, which had open pigeon holes underneath. These were crammed with old boots, rubbers, dirty clothing and everything else. In the boys' washroom exactly the same unsatisfactory and untidy condition existed. Here there was a wall 28' long to provide space for 55 boys to hang outside wearing apparel.\n\nNo provision has been made for the children to keep any personal belongings they have or receive. Apparently a few did try to keep them underneath the mattresses. There are good lockers in the small boys', intermediate and junior girls' dormitories, but not a single one was in use.\n\nWhen a good wind breaker was found in the manure at the cow barn, Rev. C.H. Middleton, stated, although every boy had been issued with a new wind breaker last fall, at Christmas time only five could be accounted for.\n5. CLOTHING & GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CHILDREN - continued\n\nAs regards dental hygiene, a tooth brush rack containing two brushes was noticed above the basins in the girls' wash room. On the boys' side the tooth brush rack was noticed in the linen room. On enquiring why it was located there, the Boys' Supervisor replied, that brushes were given out to be used immediately before going to class. From what was seen, one would conclude that dental hygiene was given very little consideration.\n\nWhile visiting the laundry, it was observed that the children were getting their clothing and shoes sopping wet, during the process of removing the contents of the washing machine into a tub for rinsing. This work seemed very unnecessary, as the rinsing could have been done in the washing machine. Miss Allison, the Laundry Matron, was asked why this extra work. She replied her instructions were to get two washings from one lot of suds.\n\n6. FOOD\n\nA copy of the menu SUPPOSED to be in use is attached hereto, also a list of weights of all pupils taken on the day of inspection.\n\nIt is to be expected that a large percentage of pupils on returning to school, following their summer vacation, will be under weight. Such a condition should not exist a month or so before they are leaving for their summer vacation, if they have been receiving sufficient and proper diet. At the time of inspection 28% of the girls and 69.9% of the boys are underweight in this school.\n\nThe dining room was visited for the mid day and evening meals on April 4th, breakfast and mid day meal on April 5th, while these meals were being served and eaten. From observation during these four meals, it was apparent there were more OMISSIONS than SUBSTITUTIONS in the menu.\n\nThe meals were not appetizing. Each child received an enamel plate, enamel cup and a spoon. Not a single knife or fork was noticed in the dining room at any of the meals. Beans and bread appeared to constitute the main item of food, the former being the principal and only vegetable observed. The latter was the most abundant item of food on the tables. The bread was baked in the school and was of very good quality.\n\nAll food except the bread was placed on the enamel plate. The bread previously to being brought to the table was smeared on one side with warm grease. Bread was served with each meal but only at two meals was it served with lard. Approximately three slices, more properly described as hunks were placed directly on the table beside each pupil's plate.\n\nAt no time did the children receive butter.\n\nAt the mid day meal the younger children were given milk, the older ones received water. For breakfast and the evening meal all were SUPPOSED to have cocoa made from milk and sweetened with sugar.\n\n7. FOODS AVAILABLE\n\nMrs D.A.Oakley, Kitchen Matron, informed me they had just been out of potatoes for four or five days. Rev. C.N.Middleton, former principal, also informed me that it would be necessary to buy potatoes and other vegetables from now until the new crop was available.\n\nVegetables were supposed to be on order.\n\nIn the vegetable bins below the kitchen were a few small heads of cabbage and a small number of turnips. Neither here nor in the root cellar beneath the new class rooms, where the vegetables were supposed to have been stored, could a sufficient quantity of one or any combination of vegetables be found, for one meal for this school.\n7. FOODS AVAILABLE - continued\n\nThe meat is bought at the local butcher store. Apparently they do not buy any particular cuts of meat. On checking the counter slips for meat purchased during the month of February, they bought 40 to 60 lbs. of meat per day. The Matron and Lady in charge of the kitchen, explained that the butcher delivered hamburger very frequently. At no time did the children ever get roast meat.\n\nDuring my conversation with the Matron, mention was made about securing eggs for Easter. I availed myself of the opportunity to enquire from her, how frequently the children were given an egg for breakfast or any other meal. She replied that since she had been the Matron, not on a single occasion had the children been provided with such a luxury.\n\nBread pudding constitutes an important item in their noon day meal. On enquiring about the source of the bread used for this purpose, I learned that it was the left over bread gathered up after each meal.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING OUTSIDE BUILDINGS WERE INSPECTED\n\n1. PUMPING PLANT - from the septic tank which was in all working order.\n\n2. NEW CLASS ROOMS - in what was formerly the old gymnasium building. They were nearing completion. I understand that this will make available for play rooms the two rooms now being used as class rooms in the main building.\n\n3. HORSE BARN - showed the usual evidence of lack of care. Windows were broken or absent. Doors off hinges. There was an accumulation of manure. Parts of harness were lying about the barn in the manure.\n\n4. FIG PEN - This really was the only building which showed evidence of receiving any attention. The most galling part here was when I enquired, if it was the intention to butcher the three pigs which appeared ready for market, I was told they were not for the school use, but were to be sold to the local butcher.\n\n5. COW BARRS - Two or three of the younger boys were attempting to clean this building. All the cattle were out. The barn had not been cleaned for one week if not longer. It certainly did not have a sanitary appearance to insure a satisfactory milk supply. There was an excellent silo, which was liable to be blown down and destroyed at any time, due to carelessness in not keeping the guy wires in position and tight.\n\n6. POULTRY HOUSE - There was a flock of poultry. The replies to my enquiries led me to believe that they received sufficient eggs to supply the school requirements. Later I learned that it supplied only the requirements of the staff.\n\n7. VEGETABLE STORAGE & FACILITIES - Provision was made for the storage of vegetables adjacent to the furnace room under the new class rooms. The provision made was much too small for the quantity of vegetables required for the school. On the other hand it was too close to the furnace to provide the proper temperature to insure vegetables keeping well. There was an old root house in the yard. Unfortunately I did not have a flash light with me so was unable to examine its interior.\n\nScattered about the yard was the Machinery and Implements. These should have been under cover. They were being destroyed by the children.\nQu'Appelle Indian Hospital  \nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.  \nOctober 19th, 1944\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\n\nAttention: Dr. Harold W. McGill\n\nRe: Conditions at Elkhorn Indian Residential School\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of March 7th 1944, I have the honor to submit the following report:\n\nI sincerely regret that this report has not been completed at an earlier date, but it has been rather difficult to accurately describe the findings.\n\nOn my return from the East, arrangements were made with Inspector A.G. Hamilton, when passing through Winnipeg, to meet him at Elkhorn at 9 a.m., Tuesday, April 4th, 1944. These arrangements were carried out.\n\nThe entire day was spent at the school. Rev. C.N. Middleton, former principal, Mr. B. Hodgkinson, acting principal and Miss H.K. Davies, Matron, accompanied us through the school. As I wished to be present for the serving of a breakfast, dinner and supper, and to recheck some of my findings, I remained in the district over night and revisited the school on April 5th, 1944.\n\nI regret to have to report that I never anticipated finding conditions in any school, as existed in the Elkhorn Residential School. Mr. Cornelius Bigwell's statement, made to Mr. D.J. Allan, sums up the situation perfectly when he says:\n\n\"While it was admitted that living conditions in an Indian village were not of a very high standard, they were much less crude, much less insanitary and much more convenient than their children enjoyed in the Elkhorn School.\"\n\nThe Indians have every justification to complain. They are to be congratulated on the gentlemanly manner of action taken to have matters remedied. This lack of supervision and interest in the school and pupils, as well as mismanagement, is not of recent origin. It has been going on for an indefinite period. A climax has been reached, which calls for drastic action, if this school is going to properly serve its pupils and obtain the results which are expected by the Indian Department, in return for their Per Capita Grant.\n\nWhen the findings are considered from every angle, nothing favorable can be said for the present administration of this institution. To permit present conditions to continue will eventually not only bring severe public criticism on the Indian Affairs Branch, but serve no useful purpose in uplifting or helping the Indians.\n\nA satisfactory school staff no doubt can be obtained.\nCan the necessary expenditures to replace worn out equipment and purchase the necessary new not on hand, in addition to repairing and renovating the buildings, to make this school satisfactory for occupancy be justified, when you consider the age, construction, layout and present state of repair of this building.\n\nM.D.\nMedical Superintendent\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nNo. 2\nOttawa, October 27, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a report on conditions at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, submitted to this Branch by Dr. A. B. Simes, Superintendent of the Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital.\n\nI am sending forward also a copy of my letter to Canon Dixon. You will note that it is my intention to visit Toronto during the week ending November 18, if I can possibly spare the time to do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A.

Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n35-45 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, October 27, 1944.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a report on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, submitted to this Branch by Dr. A. B. Simes, Medical Superintendent of the Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital.\n\nI may state, by way of explanation, that immediately following this inspection Dr. Simes was called upon to accompany the members of a treaty party into the North Country - hence the delay in sending forward his report.\n\nThere are certain sections in this report that are really very disturbing. The Elkhorn school is old and in a somewhat dilapidated condition, and it has been my feeling for a number of years that it should be abandoned, or rather that a school to replace it should be built in the territory immediately north of The Pas. I was not surprised, therefore, to find that the physical condition of the building was somewhat unsatisfactory from the standpoint of sanitation and comfort. What disturbed me most was the fact that 28% of the girls and 69.9% of the boys were under-weight. This supports to some extent the contention made by a group of Indians who interviewed Mr. Allan, Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts, at The Pas, early last spring. These Indians were emphatic in their declaration that children were poorly clad and poorly fed at the institution.\n\nI am well aware, of course, that these are exceptional times in which we are living and I know something of the attempts made by Dr. Alderwood to secure\n\nRev. Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., O.B.E.,\nGeneral Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto Ont.\na principal for this school, and I have no intention at the moment to focus responsibility for the conditions that exist at Elkhorn. A regrettable feature of the whole matter, however, would appear to be the widespread publicity given to conditions at the school. I am not speaking in any exaggerated sense when I state that dozens of reports have reached me during the last year or so on conditions at the school and the treatment to which the pupils were subjected.\n\nI have already discussed the subject matter of this report very fully with the Director. I am this morning sending forward a copy to the Minister for his information. Dr. McGill is of the opinion that I should discuss this matter with you, personally, and has suggested that I visit Toronto, if at all possible, some time during the week ending November 18. If I find it possible to visit Toronto at that time, I will be glad to take advantage of the opportunity to discuss with you also the future of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 27, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a report received by this Branch from Dr. A. B. Simes, following his inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nI may state that immediately following this inspection arrangements were made whereby Dr. Simes accompanied one of the parties engaged in the payment of this year's treaty money. This explains, no doubt, to some extent, his delay in sending forward the report.\n\nDr. Simes, accustomed, as he is, to a well equipped, up-to-date hospital, may be somewhat severe in his criticisms of conditions at the Elkhorn School. The school, however, is an old one and is, no doubt, in a somewhat insanitary and dilapidated condition. This school was closed during the last war and was re-opened in the early twenties. The most disturbing feature of the report is the underweight of the children in attendance. The figures submitted by Dr. Simes bear out to some extent the contention of the Indians who met Mr. Allan when he visited The Pas early last spring. A large group of Indian parents, on that occasion, took the position that the children in attendance at Elkhorn were under-nourished and were not properly clad.\n\nI have discussed the subject matter of this report very fully with the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, and it is our opinion that Mr. Hoey should visit Toronto, perhaps during the week ending November 18.\n\np.t.o.\nand discuss conditions at Kirkton, not only with Canon Blum, but with members of the Anglican Mission Board.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nOn the recommendation of Reverend Canon L.A. Dixon, General Secretary of the M.S.C.C., the Department is approving the appointment of Mr. Ralph E. Hilts as Principal of the Elkhorn Residential School. Mr. Hilts is 28 years of age and has had considerable experience in Indian school work, having served as Vice-Principal at the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton. The Principal of the latter school recommends him very highly. It is expected that he will be available for duty early in November.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON ELKHORN SCHOOL\n\nThe Secretary,\nI. R. S. Commission,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just come back from a ten days' visit to Elkhorn School, and I would like to give you some of my impressions and to ask that you take up certain matters concerning building and equipment with the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAt the outset I must confess that I went to the School with an idea of recommending it be closed. Current stories coupled with Inspector Hamilton's report led me to believe that it wasn't fair to keep that number of Indian children under our care when everything suggested our accommodation being inadequate, and the administration poor. After staying a week at the school and trying to investigate all angles of school life I came to the conclusion that my first ideas were all wrong. I found that the school staff was able and efficient. They were working under a great handicap of not having a settled principal nor matron, but they were doing an excellent job. The children were well fed, clothed, and properly cared for. To a certain degree they were quite happy. There were a number of adjustments necessary in routine matters, but these were not of a very serious nature. The school was quite well cared for and clean, but the building is in need of considerable repair.\n\nI find that the most serious difficulties connected with the school concern:\n\n1. Overcrowding with diverse tribes.\n2. Lack of co-operation from the Reserves.\n3. Unsound general policy.\n\n(1) This school was originally built to take one hundred pupils, but since the Makay school was burned down an attempt has been made to cram in anything up to one hundred and fifty pupils. Some adjustment to the building was made supposedly to allow this. Outside classrooms were built and original classrooms were turned into playrooms. This gave children more floor space for rainy days, but nothing was done to increase washroom, bathroom, toilet or laundry accommodation. That means half the school is capable of handling a hundred and fifty pupils, but the other half is barely sufficient to handle the original one hundred. I found there were two toilets, six wash basins, and only two baths on each side of the building. On the girls side there are eighty children, and you can see how utterly impossible it is for two toilets to accommodate them. On this score alone the children have to be fetched out of bed an hour earlier than necessary. Before meal times it is absolutely impossible for each child to wash or relieve itself. There isn't a chance to have these places as clean as they should be because even the toilet flush system will not operate fast enough to handle the enormous demand. What really surprised me was the efficiency of the Supervisors' organization. This is the only thing that kept the system in operation and possibly sanitary.\nI understand Inspector Hamilton and others inspected this building, and complained about the unsanitary conditions, but I am of the opinion that they must have complained without much thought and a thorough investigation. If they had faced the situation with an open mind they would have realized that any criticism they made was really levelled at themselves because it is the Department's responsibility to provide adequate toilet and washroom accommodation. It was their business to get to the root of the thing, and it certainly does not reflect credit on their administration when none of them saw the very thing which made effective sanitation and operation impossible.\n\n(2) Lack of co-operation from Reserves: All Indian Schools are very much affected by conditions on the Reserves from which the children are recruited. I think Elkhorn suffers much more from this than most schools because distances from schools to Reserves are great. Distance just adds that little bit of nervousness in the minds of parents who cannot see their children from one year's end to another. Reserves all over the country are all so infested with this Nationalist propaganda which tends to make the Indian disidentified with anything that is done with him. From the tenor of telephone calls from as far away as Griswold and the Pas, I gathered that parents all over were in a ferment over the welfare of their children. As far as I could find Indian Agents did nothing to alleviate, but rather lent their voices with that of the Indians to criticise and knock everything that was done in the school. Since it is the Department's responsibility to educate these Indian children, and they have made no provision for carrying this out other than by Elkhorn, I would consider it the duty of all Agents to assist the school in every possible way. That they do not do and in consequence parents put their children up to running away from school upon the slightest provocation. This is the secret of Elkhorn's truancy problem.\n\n(3) Unsound general policy: I am of the opinion that our Church made a mistake when it attempted to handle The Pas situation with that of Elkhorn. I think it would have been wiser to have left the Indians up North until a new school was built and made Elkhorn\u2014as it was intended to be the school for Southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Hindsight is better than foresight. As things stand today you have a sharp division in this school. There is the Northern group\u2014Bushmen, Fishers and Trappers who are entirely out of their element in Southern surroundings, and there is the Southern group, mostly agriculturists who are at home there. These do not entirely fuse in the school and there is consequently an undercurrent of divisions. From an administrative point of view this is an impossible situation.\n\nThere are now 61 children who come from Reserves North of The Pas. The nearest one is 680 miles from Elkhorn, and farthest from 900 to 1000 miles. No wonder these children are discontented, and the parents worried.\n\nMy suggestion would be that you face the Government with this situation and urge them to make provision for a school in that Northern area and leave Elkhorn for the South. There are hundreds of Indians in both areas belonging to our church who can have no possibility of educating their children under our present system.\nI believe there is some doubt about the Elkhorn building being capable of sufficient replenishment to make a good school. After very careful inspection I have come to the conclusion that the building can be put into excellent shape with some repairs which are enumerated below.\n\n**Floors** - The floors in all five dormitories are worn through. These would need new flooring.\n\n**Hallways** - These are in similar condition and also need flooring.\n\n**Stairs** - There are seven flights of stairs from the dormitories to play rooms, all of these are worn out and in places are quite dangerous. They should be rebuilt.\n\n**Doors** - Two doors need replacing, and 13 others need repainting or rehanging. Outside doors will have to be changed so they will swing outwards.\n\n**Ceilings** - One ceiling needs either replastering or fixing with plaster board, and a few little spots of plaster need repairing.\n\nI got a carpenter named Carl E. Dahl of Elkhorn, to go over these repairs with me and give an estimate of material and labour. You will see that he estimates the cost of material at $1,157.08, and labour $692.00, making a total of $1,849.08. His estimate is attached.\n\nIf this repair work was done I would suggest covering the hallway and passageway with battleship linoleum (Brown). This would preserve the floors which are already good and tend to brighten up the appearance of the school. It would require 120 yards of material two yards wide to effect this.\n\nI would also suggest enough paint to brighten up all floors and trimmings inside the building. For this purpose we would need:\n\n- White enamel.................. 3 gals.\n- Inside white, Flat........... 3 \"\n- Inside green, Flat............ 3 \"\n- Rosewood varnish stain for school desks... 2 \"\n- Light Oak floor paint........ 20 \"\n- Cream Inside Flat............ 5 \"\n- French Grey................... 5 \"\n- Outside Green................ 3 \"\n- Linseed oil................... 3 \"\n- Turpentine.................... 5 \"\n- Brushes 4\" long hair......... 3 \"\n- Brushes 2\" \".................. 2 \"\n- Brushes 1\" \".................. 1 \"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBathroom Facilities:\n\nThere ought to be at least two more toilets, two baths, and four wash basins installed on each side. I cannot tell the cost of this, but no doubt the Department would send its engineer to estimate this for us. In urgency I would say this matter should have priority over all else.\n\nFire Escape Doors:\n\nIn two dormitories fire exit is made through a window. For safety sake doors should be installed here. I understood this was reported to Mr. Hamilton and he promised to do something about it. So far nothing has been done. It might be advisable to jog his memory.\n\nRoof:\n\nThe roof leaks in several places. This also was brought to the attention of the Inspector, but nothing has been done. I personally inspected both the school roof and the classroom roof and found them in perfect shape except for some small cracks in the roofing material. I secured the carpenter Mr. Dahl and instructed him to procure roofing cement and stop the cracks. This, I expect, is already done.\n\nPorch for Junior Classroom:\n\nWhen little children go from the main school to classroom in bad weather they have to take their coats. There is no place for them to hang these inside. I think this matter also was discussed with Mr. Hamilton, but nothing was done. As this is an emergency I have instructed Mr. Dahl to put an 8' x 8' porch at the classroom door with pegs for hanging clothes. It will cost approximately $30.00. I hope the Department can be prevailed upon to pay this bill.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThere are some minor repairs which can be effected by the school staff. These I have not bothered to enumerate because they are already being done.\n\nSeptic Tank:\n\nI almost forgot this item. The rotary pump for emptying septic tanks needs repair. This also Mr. Hamilton promised to do but nothing has been done.\n\nI should say that the main building at Elkhorn is in very good condition barring the things needing repairs as stated above. It was well built and is quite substantial. I would consider the cost of putting it in first-class condition well worth while. A matter of three or four thousand dollars is nothing compared with the cost of new school buildings which would become inevitable if this one were to go out of business. I would strongly urge you to take this matter up with a view to securing the Department's co-operation immediately.\nOne hundred and thirty children are in residence and their health and comfort make it imperative that something be done right away.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(SIGNED) JOHN W.

Hoey\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI think it well to pass on to you immediately the enclosed report which has come to hand from Mr. House. It is a careful review of the situation by one who is well experienced in school work and who came to Elkhorn with his mind open to receive impressions. I am interested to find that Mr. House is led to stress some of the points I tried to make in writing to you about possible developments north of The Pas.\n\nI feel that the report is scarcely fair to Inspector Hamilton in some of its references, as the writer was not aware of all the facts. My conclusion for some time has been that the Inspector had decided that the school ought to be closed and therefore was not spending money on the building as he felt it would be wasted. He told me some time ago that he was prepared to recommend that considerable repairs should be put in hand but was holding back his requisition until assured that a competent Principal would be appointed. I did not feel that this was altogether unfair, and yet felt that the Inspector scarcely gave us enough credit for our real concern and our repeated efforts to secure the right kind of appointment.\n\nMr. House advises me that he is returning to Elkhorn in a few days and will remain there until after November first, by which time we trust that Mr. Hiltz will have been able to arrive and take charge. I understand that his appointment as Acting Principal has been recommended to you by our Head Office and I trust soon to receive the approval of the Department. It will be most valuable if he can commence his duties under the direction of Mr. House.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 5)\nOttawa, November 2, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 24 and also copy of a report on conditions at the Elkhorn School, received by you from Mr. House.\n\nIn this connection you will be interested to learn that it is my intention to discuss conditions at Elkhorn and a number of other residential schools with Canon Dixon during the week ending November 18. In the meantime, I am passing on a copy of Mr. House's report to the Director, for transmission to the Deputy Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. A.

In this connection I am sending forward copy of a report received by Dr. Alderwood from the Reverend John W. House, Principal of the Old Sun (C.E.) Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nIt would appear that the Anglican Church authorities, having failed until now to secure a principal, asked Mr. House to visit the Elkhorn School and to report on conditions as he might find them at the institution. Although a new principal has now been appointed, Dr. Alderwood informed me that Mr. House will continue to visit Elkhorn at stated intervals, until conditions are measurably satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEnclosure.\nNovember 1, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nAttention:- Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of October 27th with reference to Elkhorn is very disquieting. I have read carefully through the copy of the report from Dr. Simes with reference to his visit to the school on April 4th last. If, as you say, a copy of the report was being sent forward to the Minister, I trust that in all fairness you sent with it copies of the reports by Colonel Mermagen, Mr. Hodkinson and Mr. House, as sent to you by Dr. Alderwood under date of his letters of October 5th, October 24th and November 10th. These documents set out the extenuating circumstances which Dr. Simes appears to have overlooked, and also report the remedies and improvements which have been effected since his visit six months ago.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 5)\nOttawa, November 3, 1944.\n\nRe: Conditions Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 1, in which you express the hope that I have sent forward to the Minister, for his information, copies of reports on conditions at Elkhorn, received from time to time from Dr. Alderwood and Mr. House.\n\nMr. House's report seems to be rather complete and is dated Old Sun School, Gleichen, Alberta, October 20, 1944. It has already been submitted to the Minister and the subject matter of this report has also been discussed with the Deputy Minister and with the Chief Executive Assistant. In fact, I have done everything humanly possible to present all the facts relating to conditions at this particular school before the Minister and his Deputy. My personal opinion is that conditions at the school are perhaps not quite as bad as Dr. Simes in his report would suggest and not quite as good as one would gather from reading Mr. House's report. I am particularly interested, of course, in the diet provided for the children and this, in my judgment, should be corrected at once.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Canon L. A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nNovember 4, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter of November 3rd regarding the conditions at Elkhorn. I am grateful for the additional information which you have given. I shall look forward to discussing the matter in detail when we meet on November 17th.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.A. Dixon\n\nLAD K.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRe Elkhorn-Indian Residential School\n\nI have read Doctor Simes' report dated October 19th of the inspection made by him, in company with Inspector Hamilton, of the conditions existing at the above school, complaints about which had been previously received by the Department.\n\nIt is very disturbing to know that such conditions as reported by Doctor Simes should be allowed to exist in any of our residential schools. While Doctor Simes made his inspection early in April, his report is dated October 19th. It is to be regretted that he should have taken this long to have made his report. It is inferred from your memorandum that Inspector Hamilton did not make a separate report and, as a result, the first time the matter was brought to your attention was after you had received Doctor Simes' report. Consequently, no steps were taken to remedy the situation before the end of the school year.\n\nIt is difficult to understand how the conditions at this school should have been allowed to get into such a state without them having been brought to your notice, either by Inspector Hamilton or by the School Inspector. Have you asked Inspector Hamilton for an explanation of this?\n\nThe report which you received from Doctor Alderwood, enclosed with your memorandum of November 2nd, would appear to indicate that there has been a substantial improvement. However, the report indicates that there are some very major repairs to be made in the school before all of the conditions complained of by Doctor Simes can be remedied. It is assumed that after Mr. Moey has discussed the matter with the Anglican Mission Board he will make some definite recommendations.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI have your memorandum of November 6, in connection with Doctor Simas' report regarding his inspection of the Elkhorn Residential School. I have reviewed our file and I enclose, for your information, a copy of a report submitted by Inspector Hamilton on May 28, 1943. I may say that at that time the expenditure requested for repairs was authorized.\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey has an opportunity he intends to discuss the situation at Elkhorn further with the officers of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n### ELKHORN SCHOOL\n\n**March 31, 1939**\n\n#### STAFF MENU\n\n| BREAKFAST | DINNER | SUPPER |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Mon.

HOEY\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter 196-0-1 forwarding copy of report on conditions at Elkhorn School by Dr. A. B. Simes. The entire statement is certainly a dreadful one and makes very painful reading, but I am compelled to ask why seven months should be allowed to elapse after such conditions were reported. If things were really as bad as claimed they should surely have been dealt with immediately, and the pupils not left to suffer for so many months more. If you will kindly refer to my letter of April 10th, it will, I believe, serve to explain many of the statements made in this report. We have ourselves been deeply concerned with conditions in this particular school and regret that an inspection should have to be made when matters in general were probably at their lowest point. I have already pleaded that the personal difficulties of the Principal are responsible for much of this decline at Elkhorn. In the spring of the year he was passing through the painful experience of undertaking divorce proceedings against his wife. We did not realize until later what an effect this was having on all his work. He apparently lost his grip of the situation and the staff became discouraged and depressed, so that the school was at its very worst when the spotlight was turned upon it.\n\nI cannot therefore agree that the poor conditions found at the beginning of April have existed for a long time. Until June 1943, the Head Matron of this school was Nurse R. M. Long, a thoroughly qualified and experienced lady who kept standards of nutrition and health up to a high point. She was most systematic and thorough in caring for the children's well-being. All were regularly weighed and those below par received extra food and care. Her menu was carefully prepared on scientific lines and was accepted by the Commission as a model and commended to all of the schools. A copy of this menu is attached and I may say that it is still the basis of the meals at Elkhorn, though of necessity many items of food are harder to obtain under war conditions. The underweight reported may largely be due to the fact that a very severe epidemic of \"flu\" had been experienced during the winter, which affected the majority of pupils and staff. The Principal wrote us as late as March 22nd expressing satisfaction that the weighing on that date showed that only three children had failed to show a gain since the previous test.\n\nThe report of Dr. Simes contains no recognition of the fact\nthat we have been at war for over five years and that many difficulties have increased with the passing of time. I have repeatedly been forced to address lately that our work in these schools seems to be slipping to lower standards. Costs are continually rising; many items of food and equipment can not be obtained; workers are harder to secure; changes are too frequent and we have to accept less competent persons than we desire. Since Nurse Long left to assume charge of a T. B. Preventorium we have had three matrons and have failed up to now in our efforts to secure a graduate nurse. The matron in charge at the time of the inspection was a teacher who was acting in a temporary way. The absence of the young people of the nation on active service has crippled us greatly in the matter of athletic and recreational activities. The young men and women who formerly guided the boys and girls in their sports are scarcely to be obtained today. I have been painfully conscious that there is unrest among our pupils because we seem to have lost the ability to give them the interesting Scout and Guide and other programs and to direct them in their play for lack of younger members of our staff.\n\nThere is further the labour situation which offers good wages to many Indians so that we can not get their help. Older boys and girls are also being kept at home to earn money and our schools are short of this type of assistance. The milkman of our large herd at Elkhorn has become a serious problem recently on this account. At the present time one man has been trying to keep this large building warm and in good repair and we have only retained his services with difficulty for he has twice been called for military service. The farm instructor has been desperate for lack of help and we have tried in vain to secure this, for we are unable to pay the wages being offered elsewhere.\n\nThis leads me to the real cause of many of the things which are undoubtedly wrong or inadequate in this school. In speaking critically of food, clothing and supervision, the critic should surely refer to the question of income. If the Government is responsible for maintaining these schools and for giving the churches which administer them sufficient grants for the purpose then some criticism might well be turned in that direction. For years the churches have pleaded for more help and have demonstrated their inability to maintain adequate standards in the face of steadily rising costs. Even with the $15.00 special grant promised for this year the allowance for each pupil at Elkhorn is only 50\u00a2 per day. Necessary operating costs, even with low salaries and inadequate staff, take three-fourths of this income. Thus out of the Government grant only 12\u00bd\u00a2 per day is left to feed the children and nothing at all for clothing. If Missionary funds and the efforts of devoted church workers did not supplement the Government grants the system would long since have broken down. When Dr. Simes speaks strongly over the lack of butter, eggs and roast meat, who is he blaming? The lack of potatoes was due to culpable neglect and is not likely to occur again. Usually this school produces an excellent crop of vegetables but in 1942 the results were very poor owing to lack of moisture. An ample supply was on order at the time and received soon after. I may say that Elkhorn has continued to receive the same quantities of food as in other schools and that there has been no reduction in spite of rising costs.\n\nIt is a little discouraging that the investigator should not find anything favourable in the administration except the cleanliness of the pig pens. If he had looked a little more deeply I think he might have found some things that were satisfactory. For example,\nthe school ought at least to be tested in some measure by its educational results. My impression is that the reports of the Provincial School Inspector will show that we have been able to maintain three efficient teachers whose work was warmly commended. My personal observations have suggested that splendid work has been done in teaching the children to sing, and I have nowhere seen happier faces or heard better singing than in this school. I further believe that if Dr. Simes had visited such a building as that at Brandon before or after being at Elkhorn he would have had more sympathy with our staff in their infinitely more difficult task.\n\nDr. Simes asks if the necessary expenditures for satisfactory occupancy of the building can be justified. My personal conclusion, which has been recently supported by Principal House, is that it can. I am confident that conditions at this moment are infinitely better than they were seven months ago. We have a new Principal eagerly taking hold of the situation, a new Farm Instructor, and a competent staff of fifteen which will stand comparison. The three new class-rooms which have taken so much of the time and strength of the staff in the past two years are now in use, and two play rooms have at last been made available in the building. I understand that new plumbing equipment has been installed and that repairs are being undertaken through the interest of Inspector Hamilton. In spite of the amount of unfavourable criticism there was no difficulty in securing a full quota of pupils this fall, and I was specially surprised to note an even larger number than usual coming from the Pas area.\n\nI am sorry to have had to write at such length but need scarcely say that we have been deeply disturbed not only at this report but at the continued attitude of defeatism towards this particular school. I cannot help feeling that Dr. Simes went to the school with the conviction in his mind that it ought to be closed. He looked for reasons to support this conviction and had no difficulty in finding them. If it can be decided by all concerned that Elkhorn is necessary and is definitely going to continue, so that effective measures may be taken to bring the building up to a worthy standard, I believe there is every hope of a real advance from this point. We have confidence in our present staff, six having come to us since the spring, and shall do our utmost to support them.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A.

I can assure you that the officials of this Branch appreciate very fully the difficulties confronting the principals of residential schools in the operation of these institutions in recent years and particularly during the war period. In this connection, however, may I remind you of a conversation I had with you about two years ago, a conversation, a broad outline of which was later embodied in a personal letter to you. In that conversation and in that letter I expressed the opinion that our residential schools throughout the Dominion were being subjected to a great deal of unfair criticism and that a great many citizens appeared to be losing their faith in the usefulness of these Indian schools. I suggested to you then that men like Canon Middleton, yourself and others that might be selected should be encouraged to appear before the public - Rotary Clubs, Church Societies, regular Church Congregations, and tell the simple story of what men and women in charge of our schools were attempting to do. I would not be frank with you if I did not state that I have been somewhat disappointed at the apparent unwillingness of the Churches - and in this I include all the churches - to defend publicly our residential schools against a great deal of meaningless criticism.\n\nRev.

Mr. R.E. Hiltz had just arrived the previous afternoon and Mr. House, the Acting Principal, was preparing to return to his school in Alberta.\n\nMr. House had only been at the school a few weeks; but he is an experienced principal and even in a short time made many improvements. The building throughout was much cleaner. The toilets were all working. The staff appeared more co-operative and the children were more content and happier. The question of discipline appears no problem and I am inclined to think Mr. Hiltz will handle the situation quite well.\n\nMr. House had a carpenter building a porch at the entrance to one of the classrooms. This porch protected the door and made accommodation for the children's clothing. I understand the total expense for material and labor will not exceed $100.00.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, who I feel was a disturbing element on the staff, has resigned and a Mr. Dahl has taken over the position. Mr. Dahl is an experienced farmer and also a first-class carpenter. He is expected to keep the barns and out-buildings in good repair.\n\nMr. House found the school without vegetables. He immediately purchased a large quantity of potatoes, cabbage, turnips, beets, onions and carrots. All these vegetables are of excellent quality and should last throughout most of the winter; especially the potatoes.\n\nMr. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Bureau, purchased the tar necessary to repair the roof of the school and the classroom. I took the material up by car and the repair work was to be done by the engineer and Mr. Dahl.\n\nThe fire escape doors had just arrived and Mr. Hiltz writes that they have already been installed.\n\nThe children appeared clean, but were none too well clothed. Mr. Hiltz noticed this himself and assures me that this will be corrected as soon as possible.\n\nThe meals served were well cooked and there appeared ample for all. Breakfast consisted of porridge with milk, bread with jam, peanut butter or lard; cocoa or milk to drink. Dinner was potatoes, one other vegetable, meat, gravy, bread, milk pudding, and water to drink except for the small ones and they receive milk. Supper consisted of soup, bread with lard, dried fruit or jam, cocoa or milk to drink.\n\nThe milk supply at present is eight gallons at night and about the same in the morning. The cook stated that any shortage was supplemented by dry milk.\nNow in reference to the plumbing referred to in your letter 106-0-1, dated October 21st, 1944. I found one toilet bowl broken. This, of course, must be renewed. The additional four bowls and four baths are no doubt needed. Mr. Yates from Brantford had men working at Virden and I was able to get his views concerning the proposed installations. He visited both the boys' and girls' side of the building and agreed that the present arrangements were inadequate. He pointed out the work involved in taking up the cement and renewing old pipe which is practically worn our or clogged. He explained that on work of this nature it was difficult to give a definite price; because almost always unforeseen difficulties would arise. He intimated the complete job would cost in the neighborhood of $500.00. The material would be five toilet bowls complete, four bath tubs, 10 pair taps (washbasin), necessary pipes and valve fixtures.\n\nI have already recommended the purchase of a new pump for the septic tank. This is urgently needed because the one in use is practically finished. If it fails to operate the sewerage will back up into the school and make operating impossible. Please advise if the pump has been ordered.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted at once for the following repairs:\n\n1. The re-treading of four stairways. This entails a lot of work because the underpart of the stairway is plastered and this must all be removed.\n\n2. The renewing of worn treads in two other stairways.\n\n3. Reflooring two hallways first floor in hall at top of stairway.\n\n4. Renewing half the ceiling in boys' playroom by use of plaster board.\n\n5. One door to make and hang.\n\n6. Patch plaster in hall and girls' dormitory.\n\nCost of material above six items - approx. $226.85\n\" \" labour \" \" \" \" $178.00\nTotal $404.85\n\nThis quotation was submitted by Mr. H.

Mr. Hilts writes, \"Will be glad to get the paint. Just can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get to work.\" In the face of such willingness to do the work I trust the paint will be ordered immediately. There is a long winter ahead and a lot of inside painting can be done. I trust the quantity requested will be granted. The list is as follows,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils placed thus will serve the food after the children are seated. In order to accommodate the waiters he recommends twenty-four strong unpainted chairs. I urge that these be granted. Furthermore I recommend two strong, well-built kitchen tables for use in the kitchen. The two now in use are past repairing. These tables could perhaps be built and shipped from Winnipeg. The size of top required is\n\n1. 30\" x 60\"\n2. 24\" x 36\"\n\nThese tables require to be strongly made and should be supplied with a thick, heavy top of 1\u00bd\" lumber.\n\nThe floors in the main halls and in all dormitories are badly worn. In some places it is worn through, especially in the dormitories. I think we should start and renew the hall floors and if funds are available the dormitories should also be done. It would perhaps be easier to get the required help earlier than in the spring; therefore I urge that the matter be favorably considered. I at least urge that we go as far as we can with this work during the present fiscal year, because it must be done and the labor situation may be much worse.\n\nThis, as you know, is an old building and other repairs on equipment will arise. However, if the improvements outlined above are authorized the building will be much improved and the labour of cleaning made much easier.\n\nMr. Yates just notified me that both the hot and cold pressure tanks have sprung leaks. He has sent up plugs and we are hopeful of getting by for the winter months. If we are fortunate to do this these tanks will need replacing next summer.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copies of Inspector Hamilton's reports on the Elkhorn and Brandon Residential Schools. These reached us this morning and I thought that you might like to have them when you are discussing these institutions with the Church officials.\n\nOur financial statement was also received today and it shows the appropriation in a very healthy condition. I am writing to Mr. Hamilton authorizing repairs to the plumbing and installing of extra tubs and toilet bowls at a cost of $550, repairs to stairs at a cost of $401.85 and purchase of the kitchen chairs and heavy work tables for the kitchen.\n\nPurchase requisitions are being sent to the Purchasing Agent for the 56 mattresses and the paint.\n\nWith reference to the report on Brandon, I would direct your attention to the sixth paragraph. Possibly you could have Doctor Dorsey write a letter to Mr. Strapp, as suggested by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.A.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hey:-\n\nRe Elkhorn School\n\nI have to thank you for your letter #106-0-1 of Nov. 13th. As I am looking forward to being in Ottawa on the 23rd and 24th I shall look forward to the chance of discussing a number of matters with you.\n\nMay I just say now that I have had many opportunities in the past year of commending the work of our Residential Schools to Church congregations and Societies. I also circularized a number of our Principals and know that many of them have been using whatever opportunities they could. I have also the promise of our Missionary Society to take one Principal each year for a period and allow him to travel around as a missionary deputation. The difficulty about this to date has been that with reduced staffs it has seemed impossible to release any Principal at such a time. The Woman's Auxiliary of our Church has also agreed to use some of our workers in this way but again they desire that they be released in the winter season when it is so hard for us to release any members of the staff.\n\nFor my part I have been taking Kodachrome pictures and am now seeking opportunities to show these in various quarters.\n\nI just mention these facts to indicate that I am alive to the need you mention and may say that we are deeply conscious that our work is at present under fire from many quarters and not least from critics within the Church. I shall certainly welcome a thorough going survey of the whole problem of Indian education and believe that this would be most valuable for the sake of all parties concerned.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nDICATED BUT NOT PERSONALLY SIGNED\nBECAUSE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE\nOttawa,\nNovember 28, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nEarly this month Indian Agent Waite submitted an application for the admission of Priscilla Beardy to the Elkhorn Residential School and her admission to that school was approved by official letter of the 8th instant. Today I am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of Elkhorn which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Re: Priscilla Beardy, Lake St. Martin Reserve. Department Authority 106-0-10, November 8, 1944.\n\n\"Cannot take any more new children. School is already overcrowded. We have 130 children and not a spare inch of space.\"\n\nFor some years past the authorized pupilage at the Elkhorn School has been 135, although a review of the returns received from that school within the last year and a half indicates that they have never had that number of pupils. For the June quarter, 1943, there was an average of 134, for the September quarter, 1943, there was an average of 132; for the December quarter, 1943, there was an average of 146 and for the March quarter, 1944, there was an average of 136.\n\nIt is quite possible that in view of conditions existing at the school 130 to 135 is sufficient. However, You will note from the Principal's letter that he considers that not more than 130 children\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\ncan be taken. I have no desire to overcrowd this building, or to insist on 155, but I wish you would let me have your comments on the matter, as, if the 155 pupils are not required, it would mean that we could possibly provide per capita allowance for 25 pupils at some other school where additional per capita grant is required without increasing the total appropriation.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Authorized Pupilage - Elkhorn\nFile 106-0-1, November 28th.\n\nYou of course know that Dr. Simes made a careful inspection of conditions at Elkhorn and reported that \"his chart shows a definite overcrowding exists\", and at that time there were 143 pupils in residence.\n\nIn view of Dr. Simes' report and the statement made by Mr. Hiltz, I think the only thing to do is to reduce the number authorized to 120 and use the per capita grant thus saved at some Church of England School where additional housing space is available.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOBY\n\nPlease note my letter of November 28 to Inspector Hamilton, also his reply of December 11.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we are providing per capita allowance at the Elkhorn School for a pupilage of 155 at $170 each. It is evident from Mr. Hamilton's letter that we will not be required to pay grant at this school for a pupilage of over 130. Consequently, if you thought it necessary, the pupilage at some other Church of England school could be increased by 25. I am bringing this matter to your attention due to the fact that when Reverend Mr. Ellis was here recently he stated that it was his intention to communicate with the Branch requesting an increase in pupilage at the St. Alban's Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey  \nActing Director, Indian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:-\n\nI think it well at this time to advise you of the progress being made at the above school. Our new Principal, Mr. R.E. Hiltz, has been into the city once or twice to discuss matters with us and we have also had the opportunity of discussing matters with Inspector Hamilton.\n\nWe have been delighted with the manner in which Mr. Hiltz has tackled the problem. He came to the school with the experience of Lytton and the example of Rev. C.F. Hives to guide him. Very many of the difficulties pointed out by Dr. Simes were quickly remedied. Mr. Hiltz has engaged extra local help to carry out repair work and to assist in the cleansing and furnishing of the building in certain directions where the work had been too much for the ordinary staff. He seems to have been able to create a new spirit of loyalty and enthusiasm among the staff, and we are confident that the spirit of the school has been changed.\n\nSeveral staff changes have taken place and we are confident that the new workers secured will do much to raise the tone of the school. The new Farm Instructor has already made changes which have greatly increased the supply of milk and we have confidence that in the coming year he will be able to develop the garden along new lines.\n\nIn the matter of food, Mr. Hiltz has declared that in the main supplies were adequate but he has made a number of changes making for greater variety and attractiveness. We have approved of his suggestion that bread should be secured from a bakery at Virden and are well satisfied that this is of high quality. As a result the bakery worker is now acting as an assistant to the Kitchen Matron and fuller supervision can be given to the preparation of the meals. The children are receiving less bread, more milk, more fruit and in general we feel confident that little fault could now be found with the food. The Principal has also introduced a better system in the serving of the meals so that the food is warm and appetizing when received.\n\nIn the matter of clothing Mr. Hiltz found that a number\nof items were short and this again was a result of bad management, as the Woman's Auxiliary of our Missionary Society freely supplies adequate clothing when it is ordered by the school. Our records show that about $4,200.00 was spent in 1943 and there ought to have been adequate supplies. In the matter of bedding there was a real shortage in some lines and Mr. Hiltz has sent in very heavy requisitions which are now being filled. I understand that the Department has been securing new mattresses and we have on order a large quantity of blankets from the Army surplus supplies.\n\nAs for the building, I am delighted to know that various repairs are being undertaken now by the Department. New stairs were being built and I understand that considerable painting will be done in the near future. The Principal has had all the lockers removed from the dormitories and these are being placed in the playrooms. This will serve to increase the air space and we have instructed the Principal to keep his attendance down to 130 so that there may be no complaint of overcrowding.\n\nThe Principal has thrown himself enthusiastically into the task of reviving organizations that had been allowed to lapse. Both the Scout troop and Guide Company are now functioning and a choir is being trained to give a candlelight service at Christmas time in the village Church. We have gladly authorized the necessary expenditure to have the children join for choir work, and believe this will help to lift the spirit of the institution. Mr. Hiltz is already working along various lines to have a real graduation at the close of the school year, including a program of sports, drills and other entertainment. It is his desire to have the school in such condition at that time that he may invite Dr. Simes and other representatives of the Department and community, that all may be satisfied that real progress has been attained.\n\nI need scarcely say that it gives me great pleasure to note this change for the better and to assure you that we shall support our staff to the utmost in what they are doing.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

While at the School I ate the same food as the children, which is un nourishing for any child.\n\nThey get no butter at all, and only get milk in the mornings.\n\nThose two things they get plenty at home. At the time I was leaving Muriel was sick, otherwise I would of brought them back with me. Under such terrible conditions I am asking the Indian Dept. to get the little girls home.\n\nIf you want any more information I will be glad to explain myself.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Mrs. W.

I think and feel that it is an outrage against justice to the school. If this is allowed to go on (and you know how tales like this spread), it will spell defeat for any good which might be done here. Without this it is hard enough.\n\nWould you kindly confirm the same or deny it as you see fit from your visit, and forward to the Commission, unless you feel that I am the type that simply staged a show for your visit.\n\nSincerely,\n\nREHM\nANGLICAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nELKHORN MANITOBA.\n\nJanuary 10, 1945.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

I would appreciate it if you would let me have a copy of your letter to the Commission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. G.

Clarke,\nIndian Agent,\nHODGSON, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Complaint of Mrs. Sinclair.\n\nI was at Elkhorn School on January 9th and again on January 11th.\n\nThe School is now in charge of Mr. Hiltz and gradually he is getting a better staff of workers. The building is being repaired and paint is on hand for painting.\n\nI found the children well clothed and clean. The meals were as follows:\n\n**Breakfast**\n- Porridge with milk,\n- Bread with jam or peanut butter or lard,\n- Cocoa.\n\n**Dinner**\n- Potatoes, one other vegetable,\n- Meat Stew with brown gravy,\n- Rice pudding with raisins,\n- Bread.\n\n**Supper**\n- Soup - vegetables and meat cooked in soup,\n- Bread - 1 slice with peanut butter,\n- 1 slice with lard mixed with butter,\n- Stewed prunes,\n- Milk for small children,\n- Tea for older ones.\n\nI talked to both the Sinclair girls. The one was still in the infirmary but quite better and was up playing around with the other pupils; in fact, none were really sick. The other girl was attending school and apparently quite well. She appeared happy.\n\nMr. Hiltz has not been at the school long; but he is greatly interested in his work, and I think he is liked by the children. Certainly he is interested in their welfare. I will be at Elkhorn again in February or March and will write you again about the two girls and conditions. I think Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair should await my further report before insisting that the children be returned.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nSorry you were absent when I arrived back Thursday. Your letter to Mr. Young caused my return.\n\nNow this is what I learned. The Cook arrived in the kitchen about 5:10 p.m. and left at 6 p.m., perhaps to get her own dinner. The supper was soup, 2 slices of bread\u2014spread\u2014prunes, milk and tea. The soup ran short before the last table was served and consequently they had to go back and rob some of the other bowls. The quantity required was from 1 to 1\u00bd gals. short. The bread was cut about \u00be\" thick and each got 2 slices. I understood you would not allow any extra should a child ask. No child should leave the table hungry, and I know you do not intend they should. Would you see in the future that extra bread is available for any child desiring more.\n\nThe soup served was good and contained meat and vegetables; however, could the suppers not be varied by serving pork and beans, or macaroni and tomatoes, or scalloped potatoes and cold meat, or salmon loaf? Eggs scrambled or as an omelette might also be used. I know this means work for your kitchen matron but after all she wants the position and should be willing to do the work. The staff is there for the benefit of the children and this fact should be recognized.\n\nNow one other matter. I feel cold water at noon is a poor drink, especially in winter. How about cocoa or tea? I believe it would be greatly appreciated and would add greatly to the menu. If your milk is short dry milk is available and there is no waste.\n\nI hope with some new staff the strain will get lighter and I would be glad of your comments on the above proposals.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nMr. R.E. Hiltz,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nELKHORN, Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Elkhorn School - File 106-0-1,\ndated January 16th, 1945 -\nComplaint of Mrs. Sinclair.\n\nMr. Hiltz wrote a similar letter to Mr. Young, the Indian Agent, Griswold, and this arrived in the mail before I left the Agency. I immediately decided to again visit the school. Unfortunately Mr. Hiltz had left for Winnipeg to discuss the complaint with the Commission. As the result of this visit I was not entirely convinced that the food supplied, especially for supper, was adequate and I wrote Mr. Hiltz and now enclose a copy of that letter for your information.\n\nOn my return to Winnipeg a letter awaited me from Mrs. Sinclair forwarded by Mr. Clarke. I enclose a copy of my reply. Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair are grandparents to the two girls. They are very fine people and keep one of the cleanest homes on the Agency. Mr. Sinclair is an excellent provider for his table. I think the girls are none too rugged and thus the grandparents are greatly concerned. No doubt Mrs. Sinclair will visit the school again and unless conditions measure up to her expectations I am confident she will insist on taking the girls home.\n\nI discussed the incident with Dr. Alderwood and am sending him a copy of my letter to Mr. Hiltz.\n\nI firmly believe Mr. Hiltz is trying hard to improve conditions at Elkhorn. However, he needs the co-operation of a first-class staff, along with sympathetic understanding both from his Commission and the Department, and without this I doubt if Mr. Hiltz or anyone else can bring the Elkhorn School up to the standard desired.\n\nA.G.

The food problem will easily be cured when I have the competent help I desire. February 1st should look after that. As for the bread: two slices on the table was my order. After they had eaten their dinner, vegetables and all, they could have more, not before. Otherwise, they leave their meal in preference for the bread. Co-operation in this field has been lacking.\n\nI made out a menu for suppers, of which I enclose a copy; but at present to get it done, I have to do everything but cook it. This will come around with a little patience and time.

Unfortunately however he has resigned.\n\nOn the nomination of our Commission in Winnipeg, therefore, I am writing to ask that the Rev. B.O.G.

Since then he has been in charge of the Indian Mission of Moosehide in the Yukon. His wife is a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan and of the School of Social Studies in Toronto.\n\nFrom all that we know of him we have reason to hope that Mr. Dixon would be a desirable man as Principal at Elkhorn and I should be grateful if he might be so appointed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLAD K.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There was a record attendance at \"Concertina,\" Friday night.\n\nTo Principal Hults and his efficient staff we extend our thanks for all the success of the event, the outstanding features of which were\u2014\"Sanctus,\" wonderfully handled by the school's chapel choir; and \"The Golden Ballet,\" a mythical tableau of musical rhythm well staged by six of the students, featuring the Misses Smith in the dance roles.\n\nIndividual items of outstanding merit were the Highland Flute and the Solo Horns, both given under the instruction of Miss H. Corder of the school's teaching staff, who took charge of the numbers. Bert Ferrey did a hang-up job as a sailor too.\n\nThere was excellence in all the vocal offerings, and the orchestra gave good voice as usual. There was a certain richness too in the solo offering of Miss Hiven, the Matron, in the duo, sung with her assistant Mrs. Powell. Two well enjoyed numbers.\n\nStaging and lighting were just splendid.\n\nA little buck dancing and two comedy hits rounded out the program.\n\nIt is anticipated that another performance will be given in the Stadium, Friday, May 5th. Several have already given their intention to return the offering. Those who haven't yet seen it will be well rewarded by taking it in.\n\nthough regrets were voiced because of the coming departure of the guest of honor, from the members of the Board of Trade toward Mrs. Lee was found in a tangible gift of friendship.\n\nAs a member of the family, even before the family was, Miss Waddington has long been acquainted throughout the town with her work. As owner of the Servus Store which sold out last July, she helped to give this community very efficient service and more recently became so sorry that, due to failing health, it became necessary to sever her business connections here. A goodly number of friends soon gathered together on Wednesday afternoon, April 25th, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Shipley to honor Miss Waddington in a remembrance handkerchief shower, amid expressions of friendship over the years.\n\nElkhorn Board of Trade also took opportunity on this occasion of making Miss Waddington's departure by having its president to present to her, on behalf of the members, an express order which will without doubt bring for the happiness of the recipient in her new surroundings.\n\nThis respected family man, Dr. Virgil last Thursday, and will, of course, continue to commute between here and his business headquarters in his capacity as mortician.\nACT I\n\nThis is a fictional legend of the Pagan days of the Indians of North America, when the early missionaries were trying, sometimes against great odds, to gain a foothold and to bring the tribes out of their ancient superstition and fears of old taboos. The great Goddess of the tribe of Dackou was the Goddess of the Moon, to whom was offered human sacrifices, which constituted the greatest feast of the year.\n\nNo, a young brave, who as a youth had been lost from the village, was found by some missionaries, who took him in. In the subsequent years he became wise in the teachings of the great Christian God, Gitchimanitou. When he was a child, he had a friend, Little One, whom he grew to love very much. Now Little One was a Pagan and a great leader under her father the Chief.\n\nOne day as the feast was on and the Priestess to the Moon Goddess was in attendance, White Cloud, now a handsome Christian brave, returned to this Pagan scene to claim his love. The tribe are all stunned by his appearance as he stands gazing at Little One. Even the Medicine Man, dancing wildly, is a little afraid.\n\nThe Princess Little One recognizes him and runs with outstretched arms to embrace her love. He is indignant and thrusts her from him. She falls to the ground. Rising, she pleads with him. He tells her of Gitchimanitou who can truly make them happy. She is reluctant to forsake her Pagan ways. He leaves her. As he leaves, the Priestess casts an evil spell over him and then turns and goes to the Princess, persuading her to continue with the sacrifice.\nACT II\n\nThe Moon Goddess sees from her abode in the starry heights, that Little One has great love for White Club and knows that she would be doomed to destruction should the Princess accept White Cloud's offer of a new life.\n\nThen follows the Dance of the Totems representing the Pagan worship of the tribe, and the Dance of the Little White Spirits, which shows the influx of the new belief into the life of the tribe.\n\nThen appear the attendants of the Moon Goddess, and finally the Moon Goddess herself, in all her splendor, amid the showering of star dust. The Moon Goddess offers the Princess worldly wealth, and failing thus to hold her, tries to force her into submission by threatening that evil powers would descend on her. The Princess collapses sobbing to the ground. The Moon Goddess departs and the White spirits comfort her in her distress. The soft rays of the full moon bathe the scene in a strange tranquility, disturbed only by the glow of a distant campfire.\nACT III\n\nWhite Cloud is seated by a fire. Little One is standing by the totems. It is twilight. The attendants and the Priestess to the Moon Goddess appear and as they dance, the Moon Goddess enters and condemns White Cloud as evil and taboo. White Cloud is stabbed by a frenzied brave and falls to the ground. Little One runs to him and as she kneels there, the White Spirits enter holding a cross. If the cross touches the spirit of evil, it dies. Knowing this the Moon Goddess tries to escape, but is surrounded. Forced to touch the cross, she dies by the lake. White Cloud revives and all kneel as a light appears reflecting the glory of Gitchimanitou. White Cloud rises and walks off slowly into the light leading Little One by the hand.\n\nTHE END\nSANCTUS\n\nA striking scene of light and music featuring the singing of Gounod's \"Ave Maria\" by Miss Margaret Gibney accompanied by the Chapel Choir, followed by an unaccompanied arrangement of Malotte's \"The Lord's Prayer.\"\n\nAppealing to the eye and ear, it is a solemn moment which speaks of peace to come.\n\nTHE HIGHLAND FLING\n\nNancy May Sinclair Jeanette Stranger\nMiss Hilda Corder\n\nDirection: Miss Corder\n\nLight and Properties Mr. Bert Hartley\nCostumes Miss Corder, Miss Hives,\nMrs. Oakey, Miss Woodburn\nMusic Choir under direction of Miss Gibney\n\nSelected Recordings\nSouvenir Programme\n\nST.

They are capable and should have the chance to develop latent talents which are surely here presented.\n\nIn one short month this show has been organized, trained, and staged with ordinary children all under the age of sixteen. If this can be accomplished in so short a time, it is proof enough that a show on a Dominion basis, picking talent from all the Indian Schools and bringing them together in one school for six months, training them, then begin a Canadian tour from Coast to Coast. During this time they should also receive schooling in classroom work.\n\nWe are sure this would put the Indian in and before the public in a much better standing than many receive them now, and that when possibilities are known and promoted, would raise considerably their own morale to make them better citizens and good Canadians.\n\nWe would appreciate any remarks on this subject and suggestions for its continuance to a successful conclusion.\n\nSincerely,\n\nR. E. Hiltz,\nDirector,\nBox 170, Elkhorn, Manitoba.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI am taking the liberty of forwarding to you my remarks as a spectator at a presentation staged by the children of St. Mark's Indian School and attaching a copy of the program.\n\nYou will note that these children had only one month training. Their performance was to me a revelation of what Indian children can be taught, not only within a month but even if given unlimited time. I could not have believed without seeing it, that such a standard of dramatic effect could be produced with Indians. While I am not acquainted with Mr. Hiltz, it is obvious he possesses a high degree of directing ability. I am also informed that he has spent a great deal of his personal funds for costumes, etc. for this production.\n\nThe performance of the choir in Ave Maria and the Lord's Prayer was of equally high order but due to their immaturity expression and feeling were somewhat lacking.\n\nI invite your attention to the inside of the back cover where the suggestion is made that the most promising children be selected from all Indian Schools and brought together for six months' training for a play. From the result I saw of one month of training, it is certain the result would be greatly to the credit of the Indian people and the Department. If such a play toured Canada, the white population would be very greatly impressed and surprised at the ability of the Indians. Education of the white people is as important factor as education of the Indians, in the problem of Indian progress.\n\n(P.T.O.)\nI trust this suggestion may receive your earnest consideration as this play has been a sensation wherever shown in this locality.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[W. Barr Murray], Lt.-Col.,\nCommanding Officer,\nBrandon Military Hospital &\nIndian Agent,\nStony Indian Reserve.\nOttawa, June 26, 1945.\n\nDear Colonel Murray:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the recent presentation staged by the children of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to know that the pupils performed in such a satisfactory manner and we were glad to hear from you to that effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nLt.-Col. W. Barr Murray,\nCommanding Officer,\nBrandon Military Hospital,\nBrandon, Man.\nQu'Appelle Indian Hospital,\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.,\nOctober 19th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention: Dr. Harold W. McGill\n\nRe: Conditions at Elkhorn Indian Residential School\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of March 7th, 1944, I have the honor to submit the following report:\n\nI sincerely regret that this report has not been completed at an earlier date, but it has been rather difficult to accurately describe the findings.\n\nOn my return from the East, arrangements were made with Inspector A. G. Hamilton, while passing through Winnipeg, to meet him at Elkhorn at 9 a.m., Tuesday, April 4th, 1944. These arrangements were carried out.\n\nThe entire day was spent at the school. Rev. C.N. Middleton, former principal, Mr. B. Hodkinson, acting principal and Miss H.K. Davies, Matron, accompanied us through the school. As wished to be present for the serving of a breakfast, dinner and supper, and to recheck some of my findings, I remained in the district over night and revisited the school on April 5th, 1944.\n\nI regret to have to report that I never anticipated finding conditions in any school, as existed in the Elkhorn Residential School. Mr. Cornelius Bigwell's statement, made to Mr. D. J. Allan, sums up the situation perfectly when he says:\n\n\"While it was admitted that living conditions in an Indian village were not of a very high standard, they were much less crude, much less insanitary and much more convenient than their children enjoyed in the Elkhorn School.\"\n\nThe Indians have every justification to complain. They are to be congratulated on the gentlemanly manner of action taken to have matters remedied. This lack of supervision and interest in the school and pupils, as well as mismanagement, is not of recent origin. It has been going on for an indefinite period. A climax has been reached, which calls for drastic action, if this school is going to properly serve its pupils and obtain the results which are expected by the Indian Department, in return for their Per Capita Grant.\n\nWhen the findings are considered from every angle, nothing favorable can be said for the present administration of this institution. To permit present conditions to continue will eventually not only bring severe public criticism on the Indian Affairs Branch, but serve no useful purpose in uplifting or helping the Indians.\n\nA satisfactory school staff no doubt can be obtained.\n\np.t.o.\nOn approaching the school one received the impression that there was lack of organization, supervision and interest. The grounds were very untidy; articles of clothing and other wearing apparel were scattered over the yard, school entrances and steps. Many window panes were broken. The unbroken panes had the appearance of having been treated for a BLACKOUT, they were so dirty. Inside the building these impressions were confirmed by findings wherever you went.\n\nAt the time of my inspection, April 4th and 5th, 1946, this school was in charge of Mr. B. Hodgkinson, who had just been appointed acting principal.\n\n148 pupils were registered, 86 of these were girls. Four pupils, two boys and one girl, were taking grade 8 and one girl was taking grade 10 in the local High School. Four patients, three girls and one boy, were confined to bed in the school infirmary.\n\nI. DORMITORIES\n\n(A) Air Space\n\nThe attached chart shows the available air space per pupil in each dormitory.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Government Public Health Regulations require 300 cu. ft. of air for each hospital patient and at least 400 cu. ft. for each person in any public hotel. In view of these regulations it should not be unreasonable to ask that 600 cu. ft. be provided for each occupant in any room used as a dormitory, for ten months of the year.\n\nIf such is the case, this chart shows a definite over crowding exists.\n\n(B) Ventilation\n\nSmall slides at the bottom of some windows were the only source of ventilation. Broken window panes indirectly supplemented this means of ventilation. It certainly was not adequate or satisfactory. A draft passed over the occupants of the beds opposite the open windows.\n\nProvision could be made for all windows in dormitories to open at least six inches from the top.\n\n(C) Beds & Bedding\n\nAll that can be said in favor of the beds is that they are of pre-war manufacture. As such they are sturdier built than it is possible to purchase at the present time. Their appearance would be improved by a coat of enamel. The springs are held together by every conceivable means, wire, cord, etc. It should be possible to secure wire links and coils to repair these springs. The springs on every bed will require extensive repairs.\n\n\"Filthy\" is the only word and even that does not adequately describe the condition of mattresses, pillows,\nand bedding. The majority of the mattresses have long since served their usefulness.\n\nOnly the pillows in the junior girls' dormitory were noticed to have pillow slips. In all other dormitories they were conspicuous by their absence.\n\n2. PLUMBING\n\n(A) Toilets\n\nThe attached chart also shows toilet facilities and condition of same in each dormitory.\n\nThree toilet bowls were situated at the south end of the girls' wash room. Two of these were in proper working order. One did contain fecal matter. Another had a bad leak from an over half flushing tank, which flooded the floor surrounding the toilets. This leak could not be of recent origin, as there was a piece of wooden duck walk in front of the bowl, to keep the user's feet out of the water. The door at the entrance of one toilet was off its hinges.\n\nThe toilet paper containers were located outside of the toilet on the wall between the doors.\n\nIn the boys wash and play room on the south side of the building, there was plumbing for three toilet bowls but only two were installed. There were no urinals.\n\nNot a single toilet bowl in the whole school had a seat. The majority of the bowls were badly stained, and had an uncared for appearance.\n\nI have no recollection of seeing any outside toilets.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Provincial Health Regulations require one toilet seat to every 18 pupils.\n\n(B) Wash Basins\n\nThe girls' washroom, which is 27' by 14' is located on the ground floor in the west half of northern portion of the building. This room is cold and uninviting, possibly due to its cement floor and poor lighting.\n\nTen wash basins provided with two taps each, are situated on the west wall of this room. Examination revealed that neither tap on one basin, and only one on three others were in working order. Some of the basins contained dirty water. On investigation it was found that the stoppers were made of toilet paper.\n\nTwo roller towels were hanging in this room.\n\nThe boys' washroom, which is 26' by 14' is located in the southern portion on the ground floor. It also was cold and uninviting, similar to the girls for the same reason.\n\nTwelve basins provided with two taps each, are situated on the west wall. Neither taps on one, and only one on two other basins were working.\n\nTwo roller towels were hanging in this room.\nNot a single stopper was found in either wash room. All basins had an uncared for appearance.\n\n(C) Bathing Accommodation\n\nTwo tubs for use of the girls were partitioned off in the northern end of their play room. The floor is of cement. It was moist at the time of our visit. There was a wooden duck talk beside each tub. Both of these were in broken condition. There was a shower fixture over one tub, which was leaking. The handle for its control valve was missing. As the tub had a rusted spot, where the shower dripped, one would conclude the leak was not of recent origin.\n\nOn the boys' side a small room 9' by 14' adjacent to their play rooms, contained two tubs as well as a shower. The waste water from the baths and shower flows out over the floor to an open drain in the boys play and wash room.\n\n3. HEATING FACILITIES\n\nEven if the building had been kept in first class repair, difficulty in maintaining a satisfactory temperature would be experienced on account of its age. With the neglect, which is evident in toilets, wash basins and bathrooms, is equally evident in not maintaining the building in good repair. Poorly fitted storm windows, absence of storm doors, and innumerable broken panes of glass, increase the heating difficulties.\n\nThe heating plant is a Gurney Hot Water Furnace, equipped with an automatic stoker. One section of the furnace was reported cut off when the stoker was installed a few years ago. The engineer admitted difficulty in maintaining a comfortable temperature in many of the rooms during the cold weather, especially if it was windy. From personal experience, this furnace does not appear to be any more than large enough to satisfactorily heat this building, if all its sections were in perfect working order.\n\nIf the welfare of the children had been considered, steps would have been taken to have the defective section repaired and put in order. The inability to maintain the building at a comfortable temperature did not originate during the winter months of 1943-44.\n\n4. FIRE HAZARDS\n\nThe fire escapes in the dormitories lead through a window using only the lower half. The steps up to these windows were not solid; with the confusion during a fire, they are apt to cause the pupils to fall. Serious consequences could easily result. In the laundry there is an old kitchen range used to heat the sad irons. While it was located adjacent to the chimney it had to be continually operated with all drafts wide open. Clothes on lines and on clothes horses were near this stove. This did constitute a serious fire menace as it was on the basement floor in the center of the building.\n\nThroughout the building were fire extinguishers.\n\n5. CLOTHING & GENERAL\n5. CLOTHING & GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE CHILDREN\n\nNo matter where the children were contacted, in the class rooms, in the dining room, about the school, or out of doors on the playground, they were dirty and their clothes were disgraceful. The clothing was not only dirty but torn and ragged. Their stockings were full of holes. Not a single child was observed to be wearing a good pair of boots. No difference was noticed in the clothing worn at meals, in the class room or outside. Several of the boys took off overalls when they came into the wash room from outside.\n\nMany of the children playing out doors had a half frozen appearance.\n\nThere is no doubt about these children being very poorly clad. They certainly were not provided with sufficient clothing to keep warm during the cold winter months, if they did not have on more appropriate clothing than worn the day of this inspection.\n\nThere was no evidence of extra clothing having been issued, except what seen in the laundry and sewing room. The quantity observed in these two places did not impress one as being sufficient for a complete change for all pupils.\n\nThe provision made, for the care of clothing in use, was not such to induce or teach any child to care for their wearing apparel. For example, in the girls' washroom, along the wall 27' in length was supposed to be sufficient hooks for 88 girls to hang their coats and hats up. Along this same wall was a row of seats which had open pigeon holes underneath. These were crammed with old boots, rubbers, dirty clothing and everything else. In the boys' washroom exactly the same unsatisfactory and untidy condition existed. Here there was a wall 26' long to provide space for 55 boys to hang outside wearing apparel.\n\nNo provision has been made for the children to keep any personal belongings they have or receive. Apparently a few did try to keep them underneath the mattresses. There are good lockers in the small boys', intermediate and junior girls' dormitories, but not a single one was in use.\n\nWhen a good wind breaker was found in the manure at the cow barn, Rev. C.H. Middleton, stated, although every boy had been issued with a new wind breaker last fall, at Christmas time only five could be accounted for.\n\nAs regards dental hygiene, a tooth brush rack containing two brushes was noticed above the basins in the girls' wash room. On the boys' side the tooth brush rack was noticed in the linen room. On enquiring why it was located there, the Boys' Supervisor replied that brushes were given out to be used immediately before going to class. From what was seen, one would conclude that dental hygiene was given very little consideration.\n\nWhile visiting the laundry, it was observed that the children were getting their clothing and shoes soaking wet, during the process of removing the contents of the washing machine into a tub for rinsing. This work seemed very\nunnecessary, as the rinsing could have been done in the washing machine. Miss Allison, the Laundry Matron, was asked why this extra work. She replied her instructions were to get two washings from one lot of suds.\n\n6. FOOD\n\nA copy of the menu SUPPOSED to be in use is attached hereto, also a list of weights of all pupils taken on the day of inspection.\n\nIt is to be expected that a large percentage of pupils on returning to school, following their summer vacation, will be under weight. Such a condition should not exist a month or so before they are leaving for their summer vacation, if they have been receiving sufficient and proper diet. At the time of inspection 28% of the girls and 69.3% of the boys are underweight in this school.\n\nThe dining room was visited for the mid day and evening meals on April 4th, breakfast and mid day meal on April 5th, while these meals were being served and eaten. From observation during these four meals, it was apparent there were more OMISSIONS than SUBSTITUTIONS in the menu.\n\nThe meals were not appetizing. Each child received an enamel plate, enamel cup and a spoon. Not a single knife or fork was noticed in the dining room at any of the meals. Bean and bread appeared to constitute the main item of food, the former being the principal and only vegetable observed. The latter was the most abundant item of food on the tables. The bread was baked in the school and was of very good quality.\n\nAll food except the bread was placed on the enamel plates. The bread previously to being brought to the table was smeared on one side with warm grease. Bread was served with each meal but only at two meals was it served with lard. Approximately three slices, more properly described as hunks, were placed directly on the table beside each pupil's plate.\n\nAt no time did the children receive butter.\n\nAt the mid day meal the younger children were given milk; the older ones received water. For breakfast and the evening meal all were SUPPOSED to have cocoa made from milk and sweetened with sugar.\n\n7. FOODS AVAILABLE\n\nMrs. D. A. Oakley, Kitchen Matron, informed me they had just been out of potatoes for four or five days. Rev. C. N. Middleton, former principal, also informed me that it would be necessary to buy potatoes and other vegetables from now until the new crop was available.\n\nVegetables were supposed to be on order.\n\nIn the vegetable bins below the kitchen were a few small heads of cabbage and a small number of turnips. Neither here nor in the root cellar beneath the new class\nrooms, where the vegetables were supposed to have been stored, could a sufficient quantity of one or any combination of vegetables be found, for one meal for this school.\n\nThe meat is bought at the local butcher store. Apparently they do not buy any particular cuts of meat. On checking the counter slips for meat purchased during the month of February, they bought 40 to 60 lbs. of meat per day. The Matron and Lady in charge of the kitchen explained that the butcher delivered hamburger very frequently. At no time did the children ever get roast meat.\n\nDuring my conversation with the Matron, mention was made about securing eggs for Easter. I availed myself of the opportunity to enquire from her how frequently the children were given an egg for breakfast or any other meal. She replied that since she had been the Matron not on a single occasion had the children been provided with such a luxury.\n\nBread pudding constitutes an important item in their noon day meal. On enquiring about the source of the bread used for this purpose, I learned that it was left over bread gathered up after each meal.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING OUTSIDE BUILDINGS WERE INSPECTED\n\n1. PUMPING PLANT - from the septic tank which was in working order.\n\n2. NEW CLASS ROOMS - in what was formerly the old gymnasium building. They were nearing completion. I understand that this will make available for play rooms the two rooms now being used as class rooms in the main building.\n\n3. HORSE BARN - showed the usual evidence of lack of care. Windows were broken or absent. Doors off hinges. There was an accumulation of manure. Parts of harness were lying about the barn in the manure.\n\n4. PIG PEN - This really was the only building which showed evidence of receiving any attention. The most galling part here was when I enquired if it was the intention to butcher the three pigs which appeared ready for market, I was told they were not for the school use, but were to be sold to the local butcher.\n\n5. COW BARN - Two or three of the younger boys were attempting to clean this building. All the cattle were out. The barn had not been cleaned for one week if not longer. It certainly did not have a sanitary appearance to insure a satisfactory milk supply. There was an excellent silo, which was liable to be blown down and destroyed at any time, due to carelessness in not keeping the guy wires in position and tight.\n\n6. POULTRY HOUSE - There was a flock of poultry. The replies to my enquiries led me to believe that they received sufficient eggs to supply the school requirements. Later I learned that it supplied only the requirements of the staff.\n\n7. VEGETABLE STORAGE & FACILITIES - Provision was made for the storage of vegetables adjacent to the furnace room under the new class rooms. The provision made was much too small.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSouvenir Programme\nST.

This placed a lot of extra work of the staff. Mr. Webb, the Principal of the School, has made many changes in the system of operating the school, and they have all been beneficial to the pupils, and also to the Women's Missionary Society, who operate the school. His farming methods have been very good and the farm has paid well during his management. I am sure he deserves credit for the work he has done at the school. The Indians however all desire day schools on the Reserves.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nI was at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School on September 26th, 1945.\n\nThe School is now in charge of Rev. Mr. Dixon. He has only been there about three months but already appears to have a fair grasp of the situation. He has a new Matron, Miss Beanland, who has been loaned from a school in Alberta. She is a graduate nurse and appears very capable.\n\nThe School has been greatly improved as the result of the work done by Mr. Hiltz. The halls and many of the rooms have been painted, and all the halls are covered with linoleum.\n\nThe children are well dressed and neat in appearance.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and the beds neatly made.\n\nThe nurse has prepared a menu which appears carefully planned. I believe the children now are well fed.\n\nThe farm crop is light. They have no garden and so it will be necessary to purchase all the vegetables. Already the new Principal is ploughing garden land for next year and he plans on producing plenty for the School. The garden at this School has been neglected for years; but I believe from now on this work will receive special attention.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, Mr. Dahl, certainly has not measured up to his responsibility and is being relieved of his duties. I hope the School will be more successful in their next selection.\"\nMr. R. A.

While at Elkhorn he organized special graduation exercises and the performance of \"The Moon Goddess\" which was presented in the City of Brandon by a total Indian cast.

E. Hiltz, a former Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, addressed to Mr. J. E. Matthews, M.P., requesting assistance to obtain a grant for furthering instruction in dramatic art at our Indian Residential Schools.\n\nMr. Hiltz recently discussed this matter with me, suggesting that instruction in this connection be started at St. George's Indian Residential school where a production similar to that presented in the City of Brandon could be prepared. I advised Mr. Hiltz that although I was in sympathy with any move that would bring Indian talent more prominently before our people, I felt that the Department would wish consideration of the matter held over until after a School Inspector for British Columbia had been appointed and that I understood a move was already underway to fill the existing vacancy.\n\nNeedless to say I gave no assurance whatever regarding arrangements as suggested in the fifth paragraph of Mr. Hiltz' letter as this would, of course, be a responsibility for the Principal to undertake.\n\nShould the Department approve of organizing this form of education in British Columbia Indian schools, it might be in order to use funds of the B.C. Special Vote to assist in meeting the costs involved.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, inspected May 3rd, 1946.\n\nThere are 108 children in residence and they are accommodated in three classrooms. The work seen was good and I consider that they are making fair progress.\n\nThe dormitories were well aired and tidy. The beds were neatly made and the bedding clean. All plumbing was in good working order.\n\nThe toilets and washrooms are well kept, tidy and clean. Towels are provided for each child and these are numbered, and hung on hooks. The walls are painted a light colour and I found the place well aired. There is a marked improvement in the care and appearance of these rooms.\n\nThe food is well cooked and the children have ample at each meal. Mr. Dixon, the Principal, provides the same food for staff and children and he and the staff eat in the same room as the children, in fact there is one staff member at the head of each table. I believe this change is good because the children are well supervised during meal time. The staff member knows that each child gets plenty of food and also can give some instruction in table manners.\n\nThere was no sickness and the children appeared contented and happy.\n\nThe roof of the school building still leaks in places. The roof is covered with a metal material and the nails work loose allowing driving rain to leak through. A heavy covering of tar and sand might eliminate the trouble. The outside walls of the top storey of the school are metal like the roof. This at one time was painted red. The paint has gradually disappeared and the metal is badly rusting. I would strongly recommend that it receive a coat of red paint. The school is very high and this work would need to be done by experienced painters.\n\nRepair work is required on the horse barn, granary and cow barn. The foundations need re-enforcing and considerable new lumber will be required to do the repair work. I suggested to Mr. Dixon that he get someone to give an estimate on the work and material, and forward it to his...\nCommission. This quotation will then go forward for the Department's approval.\n\nThe new septic tank pump has given excellent service and is in good condition. The new farming instructor, Mr. Thomas, is doing good work. He has the garden ground in excellent condition for seeding and is determined there will be no shortage of potatoes or vegetables. He has also rebuilt a considerable length of fence, and has greatly improved generally the outside appearance of the yards. I am convinced that this man will do good work.\n\nI would also recommend that a quantity of paint be provided for the barns. After the buildings are repaired paint will be required. It will take about two five gallon tins of red barn paint and four gallons of outside white. If green is available two gallons (outside green) should also be provided.\n\nMr. Dixon, the Principal, appears greatly interested in his work. He apparently is well liked by the children and discipline appears now to be no great problem. I am confident one can look forward to a marked improvement at Elkhorn School under the new management.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Rikhorn Indian Residential School. I note, from the last paragraph of your letter, that there has been a marked improvement in the management and I trust that this condition continues.\n\nI have noted the repairs that you consider are required and these will receive careful consideration when more specific information is supplied.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nD.E.& Theft of Money, Section 485(a) C.C., from Miss Judith HAUGEN, Ind.Res.School, Birtle, Man.\n\n1. With reference to the above, and further to the marginally-noted I have to report that the suspect, James KERWATINGAPPO, was arrested on 6-9-46 by the N.C.O. 1/c Rosebud detachment on a charge of Taking Auto Without Consent, Sec.485(3) C.C. Subject had been working for Gordon WORRMAN, Selagirth Manitoba, and had taken WORRMAN's car the previous night. As Cpl.MURRAY knew that this Indian was suspected in regard to the theft of money from Miss HAUGEN, he immediately telephoned the writer.\n\n2. Accompanied by S/Cst.S.B.FEACH, the writer immediately proceeded to Rosebud by F.C.#353L, and James KERWATINGAPPO was thoroughly interrogated. He was able to give a fairly good account of his movements however, and he absolutely denied being in or near Birtle on the night of August 24/25th, when this offence occurred.\n\n3. The following day, 7-9-46, patrol was made to the Selagirth district, where Gordon WORRMAN was interviewed in the matter. Mr.WORRMAN corroborated KERWATINGAPPO's story as to his movements on the week-end in question, and it is fairly certain that he was not in or near the town of Birtle.\n\n4. Since this time, several more patrols have been made and inquiries have been continued with all diligence in the hope of learning of some other likely Indian having been at Birtle about August 24th. To date these inquiries have been without result.\n\nS. U. I.\n\nD.D.: 31-10-46.\n\nThe O.C.6D Div., RCMP, WINNIPEG,Man.\n\nFORWARDED 25-9-46, and further to my minute herein of 4-9-46.

Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 29, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that there has been some discrepancy between the date of discharge of day and residential school pupils in northern Manitoba. Teachers of Indian day schools have complained that residential school pupils were sent home in the middle of June. As a result Indian parents complain because of the fact that day school pupils are still in attendance. They do not understand why pupils in one school have more teaching days than in the other.\n\nThe Indian school calendar for the 1947-48 academic year was published in the June issue of the Bulletin. It is meant to be adhered to by all Indian schools. If variations are made from the program laid down therein, it must be with the approval of the Department.\n\nYou will realize the necessity for this coordination in our educational program and the necessity for synchronization between residential and day schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Principal,\nElkhorn Indian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\nAnglican Indian Residential School\nElkhorn, Manitoba\n25 Jan. 2nd 1948\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRegarding your letter of the 29 ultimo, concerning vacations in this School, may I state that I was unaware of the regulations on this count, applying to residential schools, and have been doing the same as was done last year, i.e., having only the minimum of holidays observed throughout the term.\n\nThe reasons for this policy are manifold. First of all we have not adequate playroom space, no gymnasium, not even a reading room, hence no indoor sports equipment to speak of. This of course works a hardship on the Staff, which are, at this season of the year, and as it is the case this year short handed, over worked to say the least. Leaving scarcely any option in the matter, unless one wishes to be left with an even shorter Staff due to illness. (I have one such case on my hands now and consider I am more or less fortunate at that.) And as it is so hard to obtain people to work in these schools, I can see no other way to deal with the situation, than to have them in the Classrooms as much as possible.\n\nAs for outdoor sports we have an open air rink, which as a rule takes more time to keep the snow off than the Children get to skate on it. And as I understand neither the Church nor your Dept. make any allowance for the equipment for this form of sport, or as far as I know any outdoor winter sport.\n\nWe have a 16mm. sound projection machine but other than the National Film Board and Dept. of Education we cannot afford films and these are not exactly entertaining.\n\nThen again the classrooms are so difficult to heat if there is a wind that often one or another of the classes return to the Children's dinning room, which interferes with their schooling actually. The Engineer is working on a forced circulation idea that we hope will alleviate the situation to some extent and perhaps carry us over till Spring without a general exodus of the teaching Staff.\nThis, Col. Neary, exemplifies what I understand you are quite aware of; that this place has been neglected for so many years, as regards improvements that it is almost imperative that something be done this year to improve matters in general, if it is to carry on in its present capacity, for the well being of both Children and Staff.\n\nI hope I have given you ample justification for what I have done in this matter I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. B.A.B. Stoddart,\nActing Principal.\nJanuary 8, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Stoddart:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 2 and realize only too well the difficulties which you are experiencing in conducting classes in a school building as old as that at Elkhorn. We had an opportunity of discussing your situation at Elkhorn yesterday with Archdeacon Cook, who is temporarily acting as Superintendent of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. Could you please advise me as to the date upon which it will be necessary for you to consider sending the children from Elkhorn home in June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.A.B. Stoddart,\nActing Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWelfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome of the parents of The Pas Band, who have children attending the Elkhorn Residential School visited their children during the Xmas holidays at Elkhorn. Many complaints were brought back by them and reported to me and the Chief and Councillors of The Pas Band. These complaints were recorded and I immediately got in touch with Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg, and gave him all the details I had. The Chief and one Indian that had four children attending this school made a trip to Elkhorn to verify conditions. They reported similar complaints which I forwarded to Mr. Hamilton.\n\nMr. Hamilton has made an inspection of the conditions at this school and will be submitting a report to you. Although it is not as bad as reported, conditions are far from satisfactory, and many of the parents of The Pas Band intend to bring their children home unless some improvement is made.\n\nI have now informed the Chief that a report has been submitted to Ottawa, and he may rest assured that the children will be given better food, clothing, and a general clean-up of conditions is anticipated. Mr. Hamilton's report will give in detail, I am sure, the complaints submitted, and suggestions for improvements.\n\nChief Bignell has stated that the children will remain there at present to see if the changes asked for are made. Only four children have returned to The Pas, those of Charlie Constant, and they are now attending the Pas Day School. I am submitting this to let you know that I am doing all I can to encourage the parents to leave their children at Elkhorn, as conditions will be improved.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI write to recommend two new principals for the schools at Elkhorn and Peigan respectively.\n\n1. With the transfer of the Rev. B.O.G. Dixon from Elkhorn to Alert Bay approval is asked for the appointment of the Rev. W. W. J. Woods to succeed Mr. Dixon at Elkhorn. Mr. Woods is a man of fifty years of age, who has spent his ministry on the Prairies and in British Columbia. He was for some years the missionary on the Gordon's Reserve, at which time he acted as Chaplain in the Gordon's School. He is married and has one daughter twelve years of age. From all enquiries made regarding him he would seem to be a promising man for the Elkhorn School.\n\n2. To fill the vacancy in the Peigan School caused by the passing of the late Canon J. W. House, I wish to recommend the Rev. John Dalton, at present in Vancouver. Mr. Dalton was born in Prince Albert thirty-two years ago. He served for a time as a teacher in the school at Carcross and later in Moose Factory as Assistant Principal. We have made careful investigation regarding his previous record and feel satisfied in recommending him for appointment as Principal at Peigan.\n\nI should be grateful if these two appointments might be approved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nOttawa, April 6, 1948.\n\nDear Canon Dixon:\n\nOwing to illness, Mr. Hoey is not at the office today and consequently your letter of April 2nd has been referred to me.

He was for some years a missionary on the Gordons Reserve at which time he acted as chaplain of the Gordons Residential School. He is married and has one daughter, twelve years of age.\n\nThe General Secretary of the M.S.C.C., states that in his opinion Mr. Woods is a promising man for the Elkhorn School.\n\nPlease give him every possible assistance.\n\nBernard F.

Waite, Field Agent, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nMay 21, 1948.\n\nElkhorn Indian Residential School.\nLac la Bonge Indian Residential School.\nPrince Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nAt a meeting held this morning with Education Division officials and Canon Cook of the M.M.C.C., the future role of the above three Residential Schools was thoroughly discussed.\n\nIt was decided to advance the following proposals for consideration by the Regional Supervisors of Manitoba and of Saskatchewan. Therefore, this letter is addressed jointly to these officials and the Department is anxious to have your frank expression of opinion concerning these suggestions:\n\n(a) That the pupilage of the Elkhorn Residential School be reduced to 60 pupils.\n\nMr. Denney has just returned from a thorough inspection visit to this school and he is convinced that the present classroom block is entirely unsuitable for future use as classrooms. He feels that with a reduced pupilage, the present dormitory or sewing room or pump-house building can be used to provide a second classroom without using the old classroom block. This would mean that only two classrooms would function at this school.\n\nIt is then proposed to have the other 60 children from this school sent to the new Lac la Bonge Residential School.\nSchool at present situated in the army camp at Prince Albert. It will be necessary to make a careful check of the home reserves of the children involved but it is felt that in some instances it will actually be cheaper to send these children to Prince Albert rather than to Elkhorn. It is also understood that rail facilities are better to Prince Albert from certain points (for example, the sea).\n\n(b) That the authorized pupilage at the Lac la Ronge School (presently situated in the army camp at Prince Albert) be raised from 120 to 160 pupils.\n\nIt will of course be necessary to provide additional beds, etc., for the accommodation of these extra children.\n\n(c) That the lease on the St. Albert's School be renewed and that its pupilage be kept at the present rate of 100.\n\nThe future of this school can be decided when definite agreement has been reached with the Province of Saskatchewan with regard to the operation of a hostel at Lac la Ronge.\n\nTo summarize the situation -\n\n|        | Present | New |\n|--------|---------|-----|\n| Elkhorn| 130     | 60  |\n| Lac la Ronge | 120 | 160 |\n\nThe above proposals are advanced in view of the age and general deterioration of the Elkhorn School plus the fact that we have available in the Prince Albert Army Camp a school which can accommodate a considerably larger number of pupils than that for which we originally provided equipment and materials.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 27, 1948.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI have read with considerable interest your letter of May 21st to Agents Gretzinger and Waite and must say that you have summarized the situation clearly. I might point out, however, that in (a) of page 2 the \"present pupilage\" totals 250 while \"Proposed New Pupilage\" totals 240, a matter of ten less. It might be found that children are available to help the total to 250 under the new scheme.\n\nIn connection with the above, I would like to confirm the information of my conversation over the phone of 26/5/48 in that Bishop Martin has verbally agreed to such a plan provided that, if St. Alban's pupilage is set at 100 and the Indian Affairs Branch wishes to renew the lease, necessary adjustment be made in the annual rental fee in consideration of the rising cost of repair materials.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 21st, 106-0-1, regarding reducing the pupilage at Elkhorn School from 120 to 60 pupils.\n\nI inspected this school on Monday and found the plaster falling, floors in poor shape, hot water tank and heater needing replacements, and heating generally - with exception of the furnace - in poor condition. I would recommend that this school be closed, as the building is very old and more or less of a fire trap.\n\nMost of these pupils are closer to Prince Albert than Elkhorn, as follows:\n\n34 from The Pas Reserve\n12 from Gillam - which goes through The Pas\n9 from Split Lake\n4 from York Factory\n1 from Cumberland House\n5 from Shoal Lake - Shoal Lake is 200 miles from Prince Albert. These pupils take the railroad at Mafeking, which is less than 200 miles from Prince Albert on a direct line.\n2 from Moose Lake\n2 from Pikwitonei - mile 214 on the Hudson Bay Railroad. These pupils also go to The Pas.\n4 from Cedar Lake\n1 from Churchill\n2 from Little Red River Reserve - which is only about 35 miles north of Prince Albert.\n1 from Fort La Corne\n1 from Baffin Island - This pupil has been badly burned, and is an orphan. She is able to go to school, but needs medical attention, and would be far better off in Prince Albert.\n\nThis makes a grand total of 78 children, who are closer on a direct route, to Prince Albert than to Elkhorn. The balance of 43 pupils are:\n\n10 from Fisher River Agency\n26 from Griswold\n3 from Selkirk\n4 from Portage la Prairie Agency.\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-1, part 5)\nI am of the opinion that the pupilage in Prince Albert should be raised to accommodate these children, and the balance be placed in various Church of England Schools closer to Winnipeg. If this school was reduced to 60 pupils as suggested, the overhead would be very near the same, as the building would have to be heated. The grant would not carry the school, which would mean that they would be cutting down on the children's food and care.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nThis letter is written with the idea of re-directing all the pupils care.\nRegina, June 29th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of Department Army Signal of the 26th instant reading as follows:\n\n\"RELET JUNE 21st PRINCE ALBERT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STOP\nWE HAVE NO INFORMATION HERE REGARDING ELKHORN SCHOOL\nBEING CLOSED ENTIRELY STOP\"\n\nI have not been officially informed that the Elkhorn School is being closed entirely but the matter was introduced at the meeting which we held at Prince Albert when Major Clarke, Superintendent E.S. Jones, General Turner, and Reverend C.W. Fisher were present. I believe that Mr. Fisher mentioned that he had received a letter from Canon Cooke to that effect and asking Mr. Fisher to be prepared to accept all of the Elkhorn children as a result of the necessity to close the school entirely.\n\nI would suggest that Canon Cooke be interviewed in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJuly 14, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nElkhorn Residential School\n\nReference your 209-11 ACE of June 5.\n\nA meeting of officials of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. and our Education Division was recently held here to discuss the future policy with regard to the Elkhorn Residential School, the Prince Albert Residential School and the Lac la Ronge Residential School (at present being conducted in the Army Camp at Prince Albert).\n\nSerious consideration was given to your recommendation that the Elkhorn Residential School be closed. After some discussion it was decided that such action would have to be delayed until we at least could begin our new residential school programme. We realize only too well the condition of the school plant at Elkhorn but we simply cannot provide adequate educational facilities elsewhere in time for school opening.\n\nThe worst building at Elkhorn is the classroom block. It has been decided to reduce the pupilage at Elkhorn to 75 which will eliminate the necessity of using this classroom block. The Principal and yourself can then consider the best way of re-arranging the present rooms. Mr. Doucet felt that one of the present dormitories or the sewing room or even the pump-house building could be used as classrooms. This would mean that only two classrooms would be operated.\nWe have just spent $5,000.00 in providing a new boiler and in carrying out other repairs to the heating system. Mr. Hargreaves of the Lands and Development Services Branch will be inspecting this work in late August and will be visiting you with regard to other heating repairs required.\n\nWould you also discuss with the Reverend Principal the details of arranging for the pupils from Northern Manitoba to be transferred to the Lac la Ronge Residential School (now being conducted in the Prince Albert Army Camp).\n\nBernard P.

Some improvements are still to be made in the boys' washroom and the laundry but no substantial outlay of money seems necessary or is recommended.\n\nThe pupilage has not yet been filled and seems unlikely to be unless we take the view that the efficiency of certain day schools would be improved by reducing the enrolment thereat. This step might be combined with a tightening of the restrictions governing absence of day school pupils.\n\nNow that the school has been operating for three months it might be well to suggest to the school authorities that they estimate what the cost for the whole year is going to be and whether it might be advantageous to combine this school with another at the earliest opportunity. Such a fusion might solve some staff problems as well as monetary deficits.\n\nC.A.F.

It will be observed on close examination that all parts of the Range are fully protected from the wasting process of extreme heat, and wherever wear is the greater additional strength has been added. The thick lining of specially-manufactured firebrick cannot be equaled for service, apart from the important consideration of easy and economical replacement. The three thicknesses, viz., asbestos, steel, shown clearly on the oven doors, typical of how thoroughly the Chef is made to note the heavy grates, the roomy space under for accommodating the ashes, and the protection top of oven where heat is intense when passing off. The flue construction is shown, from which it will seen that the heat passes freely around the oven thus heating all sides evenly.\n\nFig. No. 1\nInterior Construction of Chef Range\n\nFig. No. 2\nShowing Simple Method of Attaching Extra Ovens to Range\n\nHere we have the three Ovens separated to demonstrate how the Range can be readily equipped with any number of Ovens. The entire right side of the Range can be instantly removed, and connection with the Ovens made with a strip of metal running down front and back of the Range. With the removal of the end of the Range the flues are left free for the pass along the top and around the additional Ovens with ease. Fig. shows the construction of the flues.\n\nKE 4\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nCHEF HOTEL RANGE\n\nFor use in Hotels, Restaurants, Clubs, Private and Public Institutions\n\nBURNS HARD COAL AND WOOD\nSpecially Adapted for Burning Any Grade of Canadian Soft Coal\n\nCONSTRUCTION:\n\nBody: The Body is of 10-Gauge Highest-grade Steel, 1/8\" thick, riveted, bolted and lined with pure firebrick. Ends and back of Range braced with heavy angle iron.\n\nTop: The Top is of heavy cast-iron, burnished to a smooth finish by a special process. Outside frame 3/4\" thick, with flanges to support French plates, which are 1 3/4\" thick.\n\nWalls: Walls of Heavy Steel Plate, with sides and top of each piece\u2014steel-plate bottom strengthened with cast-iron stiffeners. Top is covered with asbestos and protected by heavy cast-iron grating. Outside and top edges protected by cast-iron shields.\n\nOven Door: Doors of Heavy Gauge Steel Plate, with 1 1/2x3/4\" wrought-iron frames with reinforced corners. Door panels made of 3/4\" wrought-iron bars.\n\nCatch, permitting door to be slightly open if desired.\n\nFirebox Linings: Of Firebrick\u2014manufactured for this purpose by special process.\n\nFirebox lined in front with 6\" firebrick; other three sides with 1\" firebrick.\n\nBottom with 1\" firebrick.\n\nBottom of Ovens with 1\" firebrick.\n\nBack of Oven, 6\" solid firebrick.\n\nBrick over top of Oven Door, 3\" brick.\n\nAll bricks are standard size and replaced by any bricks available locally.\n\nGrate: Heavy, Semicircular, Cast-iron Grate.\n\nConnection: Of Cast-iron with hinged cleaning door at underside.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nThe \"CHEF\" Hotel Range is constructed to give unlimited cooking and baking results to satisfy requirements of the most exacting nature. Built of the finest materials available, it undergoes rigid tests before use. Only the most skilled craftsmen are permitted to assist in the building up of the entire fabric of the \"Chef\" Range enabling it to withstand the heaviest strain to which it may be subjected.\n\nThe Burnished Top: Clean and sanitary\u2014Toasting, Frying and Broiling can readily be done on its smooth surface.\n\nThe Cooking Surface: A clear cooking surface without impediments to hinder operations.\n\nSectional Ring Cover over Fire: Permits pots of any size to come into direct contact with the heat.\n\nSmoke Pipe: May be attached to top or at the back\u2014under certain conditions down draft flues may be arranged for.\n\nGrates: Heavy semicircular grates readily cut out clinkers and ashes by gently rocking shaker to and fro. Entire contents of firebox may be dumped into ash-pan by turning Grate completely over.\n\nThe Grate is easily removed by loosening four nuts on the outside, the grate-plate falling away, permitting grates to be taken out without further trouble.\n\nOvens: Have holes near top of back for ventilating purposes; these are protected by a shield.\n\nControl and Heating handled from the front of the Range by dampers for each oven and direct damper when lighting fire.\n\nWith the sheet-flue construction each Oven can be handled and heated separately so that the temperature of each Oven can be regulated independently.\n\nHOT BLAST FOR SOFT COAL\n\nThe requirements for burning soft coal are adequately met by the air passing up to the top of the fire from the lower side at the back of the firebox. During its passage through the space at the back of the firebox, the cold air comes in contact with the hot surface and becomes intensely heated. This gives a supply of fresh, superheated air to the top of the fire providing complete combustion and carrying the flame and the heat the full length of the three ovens.

March 12th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYou will, no doubt, recall your visit to this School prior to the re-opening, when you so kindly went into the furnishing and equipping of the same.\n\nYou will remember also that the big Kitchen Range was repaired and fixed up. This however is on its last legs and we have for some time had considerable trouble as it is an old type of range and everything seems to be burnt out, breaking and going wrong.\n\nI feel the most economical way to deal with this proposition would be to replace these two old ranges by a new one containing four ovens and two fire boxes. The combined cooking surface of the present range is 14\" by 31\".\n\nI am enclosing two pages from The McClary Company's catalogue illustrating a range, which appears to me to be servicable for a School such as this. However, of course, this is merely a suggestion and I am quite satisfied in leaving this matter in your hands.\n\nWill you please forgive me also for stating the fact that during the summer months we have experienced a good deal of discomfort from the heat thrown off the ranges in the Kitchen. Also during the winter months the unpleasant smell of cooking penetrates the building, especially to the Staff rooms in the front of the building. Could this be overcome by installing a hanging canopy over the range with a vent with damper leading through the wall at the back of range into the open air?\n\nThanking you for the kindness and interest you have shown in the past and trusting you will give this matter your kind and sympathetic consideration.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.

F. Eley, Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, in which he makes a request that the boilers and engines at his institution should receive an overhauling by a competent mechanic. I do not know that we would be wise in appointing a man to go and do the overhauling, but it would be well to have an expert look over these engines and see what is required and give us an estimate of the cost of putting them in repair. It is dangerous to send a man to the school and tell him to do what overhauling is necessary, because my experience has been that in such cases they are very liable to do a lot of unnecessary work and run the expense up very high. I am awaiting your instructions in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 209-11A C.E. of the 23rd instant, with reference to overhauling the boilers and engines at the Elkhorn Indian residential School. Please let the Department know where you can get a competent mechanic for this work, and estimate what it would cost to engage his services. I may state that the Department has lately purchased one jacket heater for this school, as the old one had cracked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the telegram signed by Dr. Westgate, of March 25th, I have the honor to report as follows.\n\nFor some time past we have experienced difficulty with the Jacket Heater, which supplies hot water for bathing, laundry and general purposes. While away with Mr. Inspector Christianson on a trip to the Reserves North of Fairford last January one section of the heater cracked right above the fire-bed. A new section was ordered by Dr. Westgate of Winnipeg from the Crane people and upon my arrival at the School this had been installed by the Engineer.\n\nLast Saturday the next section cracked in the same place. I at once telephoned to Crane Ltd., of Winnipeg, also notified The Rev.T.B.R.Westgate,D.D. The Crane Ltd. informed me that they had not a spare section in stock and were doubtful whether they could procure one. If so it would have to come from Buffalo, U.S.A. Their expert suggested that we try to seal the crack and set down, by Express, on the evening train two cans of Se-Lent-Ol. The directions were carefully carried out under my personal supervision and we tried everything possible up to twelve o'clock midnight. Sunday morning the section was leaking just as bad as ever.\n\nOn Monday morning we telephoned Crane Ltd. again and after a long consultation with their expert he suggested we try another form of cement, X Liquid. We received two cans of X Liquid on the evening train and again the instructions were\ncarefully carried out under my supervision. We even tried to seal up the crack in the section that was taken out last January and after working till past twelve o'clock midnight everything proved unsuccessful.\n\nTuesday morning the section in the Jacket Heater was still leaking. Upon examining the interior of the sections we found them to be coated with an eighth to a quarter of an inch of lime deposit, undoubtedly due to the hardness of the water.\n\nYesterday I was in Winnipeg and spent the whole morning in consultation with Mr. Inspector T.H. Dunn, who at once agreed that the trouble was due to the hard water existing in Elkhorn. He at once advised that we send a wire to the Department stating our trouble and recommending that the most economical way would be to purchase a new Jacket Heater as soon as possible. The danger existing under present circumstances being due to the fact that we have on various occasions been troubled with steam in the Hot Water line leading from the Jacket Heater. Should the lime deposit at any time block the circulation of the water we would be subject to an explosion.\n\nIn the afternoon of Friday I interviewed Dr. Nestgate with regard to this matter and the telegram was sent.\n\nSo far we have not experienced any trouble with the Hot Water Furnace, which heats the building, no doubt due to the fact that the water in this system is in circulation and used over and over again. Therefore there cannot be anything like so much lime deposit in the sections but from time to time water has to be run into the expansion tank to keep up the water level in the radiators and sections of the Boiler. However, should anything like this happen to the Hot Water Boiler during the winter months, it would be impossible to secure sections within two or three weeks, which would mean considerable damage to the building even though the water be drained off.\n\nIn order to overcome the purchasing or replacing of Jacket Heaters and to eliminate any sections of the Hot Water Section Furnace from future trouble it might be advisable to have the water analyzed to ascertain the real nature of the water and if advisable install a soft water plant.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(REv.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, reporting on the difficulty experienced with the jacket heater which supplies the hot water for laundry and general purposes at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. In this connection I may say that Mr. Inspector Bum has been instructed to arrange for the purchase and early installation of a jacket heater.\n\nYou may arrange to have the water analyzed in order to ascertain its suitability for use in the hot water heating system at the school. The provincial government have, no doubt, an analyst in Winnipeg who would perform this service, and you should communicate with him and ascertain full particulars as to the bottling and any other details in connection with the preparation of the sample of water required. When you have received the analyst's report, I shall be pleased if you will forward a copy of same to the Department. We would pay any cost involved in having this water analyzed upon receipt of vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified by you in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Fred Eley,\nPrincipal,\nAnglican Indian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to report as follows on sample of water received from you on April 11th - Lab. No. M 1964.\n\nResults stated in Parts per Million\n\n| Substance     | Parts per Million |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Calcium       | 68                |\n| Magnesium     | 21                |\n| Sodium        | Absent            |\n| Carbonates    | 125               |\n| Chlorine      | 10                |\n| Sulphates     | 35                |\n| Alkalinity    | 281               |\n| Total Hardness| 296               |\n| Permanent Hardness | 55              |\n\nThe analysis shows the water to be quite high in temporary hardness. The effect of a high temporary hardness in water is that when the water is heated it will deposit a scale of Calcium and Magnesium Carbonate on the heated surface. This will in time give rise to the burning out of the metal which probably explains your trouble.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE NATIONAL TESTING LABORATORIES LTD.\n\n(sgd) Arch.

These are easily and economically operated, and the cost of the apparatus would depend on the quantity of water used daily.

It was therefore necessary to purchase 36 feet of 12 inch galvanized iron pipe with two elbows to connect the range. This I purchased locally after telephoning to Mr. Inspector Bunn and obtaining his permission.\n\nThe old range was connected up with a 10 inch smoke pipe and it is my intention, if we secure a canopy, to use the old 10 inch pipe for the purpose of connecting the canopy to the draft Flue, which runs parallel to the chimney.\n\nIn your letter of the 13th instant you asked me to furnish you with the cost of a canopy over the range for ventilation purposes. I herewith enclose rough sketch of proposed canopy made of galvanized iron and have secured a price from the local tinsmith, J.W. Mallett, Esq., Elkhorn, who claims he can make the same, ready to hang for the sum of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) complete.

With reference to Exits and Fire Escapes:\n   The exits from all five dormitories are certainly unsatisfactory as these are just plain iron ladders, which cannot be used in ordinary fire drill without loss of life. They are reached by ordinary push up windows, too high for the average child to get out, covered by storm windows, without a red exit light over same.\n\n   I would suggest that an extra fire escape be placed in the center of the building, somewhere on the north side and that the fire escape from the hospital be a form of shoot.\n\n   The locks on the classification doors and dormitory doors are all in very poor condition and in case of emergency keys would be jammed in them, thus causing trouble.\n\n   We have fire drill at regular intervals and can clear the School in 2 minutes by using the ordinary stairways inside the building, but in the actual case of fire more lives would be lost by using the present fire escapes than by the fire itself.\n\nThis afternoon Mr. Indian Agent Launby visited the School with Mr. Inspector Hurison who was on his way to Birtle and I took the opportunity of discussing and pointing out the above to the Inspector. You think it wise when the Inspector returns from Birtle, I shall be grateful if he could stay at the School for a short time in order that I might obtain his advice and suggestions regarding the above matter.\n\nThanking you, Sir, for your kindness and interest.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nW.M.

Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, with reference to the fire fighting equipment at his institution, and making a request for additional fire protection.\n\nI think that half a dozen 2\u00bd gallon fire extinguishers might be furnished for this school. I doubt whether anything more can be done with regard to putting in an additional supply of water. The supply here is as great as it is at any of our other schools; the thing is to keep the engine going if a fire should occur. The additional hose should be supplied.\n\nYou will note what the Principal says regarding fire escapes; these do appear to be risky. Iron ladders leading from windows are not satisfactory, and I quite agree that these children could not come down these ladders in the event of a panic. I am not very much taken with even iron tread: fire escapes - the ordinary steps, but would be more in favour of a chute. I believe this is what we should have at all schools. I was at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School the other day and they were afraid to bring the children down the steps, but at the Convent close to our school they have an iron chute and the children come down this in a very short time. There is no reason why we should not have these. With reference to the Principal's remark regarding locks on inside doors being in poor condition, I think we might replace these locks.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1927.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to ship, as soon as possible, addressed to Rev. P. Eley, Principal, Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Man.,\n\n3 only 5 gal. Pump Tanks, complete with non-freeze charge.\n\nThese should be supplied at the lowest possible price, F.O.B. Elkhorn, Man., sales tax included.\n\nPlease forward your account to Rev. Mr. Eley, who is being informed that the order has been placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nPyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd.,\n1197-1207 King St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the first instant enclosing copy of letter from the Reverend Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School with reference to fire fighting equipment and escapes. A number of larger extinguishers will be ordered immediately by the Department. You may purchase what additional hose is required.\n\nI should be grateful if you would immediately inquire into the cost of the chute recommended for this school and compare its efficiency with the sliding pole type of fire escape. As soon as you are in position to make a recommendation with estimate of the cost, I should be grateful for a night letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a copy of your letter of even date to Mr. Commissioner Graham, I have to inform you that Mr. Graham's recommendation is now in hand and he is being authorized to supply what additional hose is necessary and to inquire into the type and cost of a suitable additional fire escape. The Department is today placing an order with the Pyrene Manufacturing Co., Toronto, for 3 - 5 gallon pump tanks. These should be placed at strategic points in the main building and some of the smaller extinguishers that you now have can be used for the outbuildings and other purposes mentioned in your report of the 29th ultimo.\n\nThe above mentioned firm is being requested to forward their account to you, in duplicate, covering the cost of the extinguishers and, when these are received, please certify same in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. Kley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nElkhorn, Man.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department number 106-0-5 dated the 3rd instant, I wrote you on the last instant with reference to the question of fire fighting equipment at the Elkhorn Residential School and made some recommendations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 26, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 206-11A P. of the 17th instant, with reference to fire escapes at the Portage Indian Residential School. The cost of the separate chute is so high, that I believe we should equip with the sliding pole type with suitable platforms at each floor level. I note that you consider these are the next best. You may make immediate arrangements for the installation of two of this type at the Portage School and two at Elkhorn. You should make the best possible arrangements and see that they are placed where they will be most efficient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Parsons looked over the situation and stated then that it was difficult to figure on such work until the tearing down had been completed in order that a very thorough examination might be made to ascertain just what would be required to make the building absolutely frost-proof. However, he gave an approximate cost of $400.00, but after the work had been started felt convinced that unless the walls were lined with lumber, then papered and lined again, also that unless the roof was lined and papered and a ceiling put in, it certainly could not be frost-proof.\n\nLast Fall we covered the old roof and ends of the root cellar with approximately 5' of manure and even then the frost went through leaving us, this Spring, with hundreds of bushels of frozen potatoes.\n\nI, therefore, pointed out very clearly to Mr. Parsons that unless he could make the cellar frost-proof, he might just as well leave it alone and in order to make this secure, more lumber and work was put on than he had figured in the first place.\n\nThe work is well done and I feel certain cannot be anything but frost-proof.\n\nTrusting the above will meet with your approval, and thanking you for your kindness in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

A. Parsons, who gave an estimate of approximately $400.00. While Mr. Parsons qualified this by stating that it was difficult to estimate on such a job, I was not prepared to ultimately receive vouchers so considerably in excess of this sum.

It will be noted under Item No. 4 that the laundry engine referred to is one of an old type, and it might be more satisfactory to replace it by another 6 H.P. engine similar to the one recently purchased for the new St. Phillips School in the Pelly Agency, which cost approximately $200.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 6th instant, with reference to repairs required to the mechanical plant at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. You may authorize the Rev. Principal to incur an expenditure of $51.75 in connection with repairs mentioned on the first page of the list he forwarded, i.e., on the engine used with the lighting plant, on the engine for pumping the septic tank and on the farm engine. You may purchase one 6 H.P. engine, at an approximate cost of $200, to replace the worn out one in the laundry. You may expend $34.50 in the repairs to the sectional boiler.\n\nRelative to the other requests, I should like to have a report regarding the necessity of supplying such expensive faucets as mentioned in the second page of the list and such expensive belts as mentioned in the last page. In any case, I believe these should be charged against the per capita or other earnings of the school and the Rev. Principal should arrange purchase. I am returning the list for your guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

The second item in the account was shown as $42.80. It would appear, however, that the number of feet of lumber mentioned should have been 383 1/3 instead of 951 feet. The error resulted in your receiving an overpayment of $25.55. Kindly look into the matter and make refund of $25.55 without delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nR. A.

In this instance the Casualty Insurance amounts to $5.65 or $6.00 per 100 on the labor and is included in the amount of $2.04. If however, the Department refuses to allow general Overhead Expense charges we suggest that the amount of $46.39 be deducted leaving the insurance charge to stand.\" As this is the first account I have received at any time including Overhead Expenses, I have allowed them to stand in the voucher for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

February 6th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to report that our batteries in connection with the School lighting plant are absolutely dead. When the engine is shut down in the evening around ten o'clock, there is hardly enough light for one to see to get into bed. The exit lights, naturally, are practically useless. Last year I reported this state of affairs to the Globeelite Battery Company, Limited, of Winnipeg, who shortly afterwards sent out their representative to inspect the batteries. At that time, he told us that the batteries were practically dead, and would cease to give light at almost any time. However, with careful handling, we have been able to carry on up to the present time.\n\nAs I arrived back last night with forty-four children from the Gordon's School, (according to instructions received from the Indian Commissioner) we have now a total of one hundred and sixty-four children in residence in this School, and I feel it my duty to report this matter of the batteries and to suggest that a new set be installed, in order that we may run no risks from lack of light.\n\nI might also mention that the Reverend Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., visited us last week, saw the condition of the batteries, and instructed me to write you on the subject.\n\nThe present batteries were installed in 1925.\n\nThere is some talk of the town of Elkhorn being supplied with electric light by the Manitoba Power Commission, who would run a pole line from the town of Virden, situated some twenty-two miles east of Elkhorn. When talking to the Mayor of Elkhorn the other day...\nabout this matter, he told me that nothing definite had been arranged, and he could not say when a decision would be made. If they do finally arrange to secure this light, the very earliest that this could be supplied would be some time next Fall. However, in the meantime we are sadly in need of light.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your kind consideration,\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Rev. Fred Eley)\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nAttention Mr. E. Orr.\nA letter has been received from the Reverend Principal of the Elkhorn School, advising that the storage batteries used in connection with their electric lighting plant are unfit for further use. The batteries were installed in 1925.\n\nFor the last few days the Elkhorn School have had 44 children from the Gordon's School which was destroyed by fire. As the batteries are dead they are without lights except when the generating plant is in operation. I would recommend that new batteries be provided immediately and that Mr. Graham be authorized to purchase same. The cost of the new batteries will be approximately Nine Hundred Dollars ($900.00).\n\nARCHITECT.\nOTTAWA,\nFeb. 18, 1929.\n\nRev.

In reply I beg to state that there are no funds available for this purpose, and, in any case, the Department doubts the advisability of increasing the accommodation at Elkhorn. I should be pleased to have an estimate of the cost of fitting up one of the present buildings for manual training purposes. The Department can give favourable consideration to this improvement and to the supplying of tools for manual training work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMr McLean\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nRecommendations re Vocational work for the Anglican Indian Residential School, Elkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nAfter having the privilege of looking over this splendidly conducted institution by Rev. Mr. Eley, I spent considerable time in looking into the possibilities of providing a greater measure of vocational training.\n\n1. In order that the boy who will return to the reserve may be a greater asset to his people in that he will be able to plan and build houses, stables, poultry and such other buildings as are needed and to repair those already built.\n\n2. For the increasing number of boys, who, because they have considerable mechanical aptitude are anxious to find a place in the industrial world, as workers in country garages, operators of farm tractors and possibly have their own repair shop for the automobile is finding its way even to the Reserves.\n\nIn looking over the plant I noticed one two story frame building about 33' x 60' which has been sturdily built and is in pretty fair shape and well suited to the purpose for which it was probably built. It might be possible to fix the lower story of this building for a woodworking shop but it is just a question whether it would warrant the expenditure that would be needed to put it into shape for use during the winter months which in a school like this is the logical time, since there is so much work to be done on the farm and in the garden during the summer months.\n\nI would think that the minimum amount of work that would be required to put it in shape would be about as follows:\n\n1. The old floor would have to be taken out and a new cement floor put in its place. The old floor having sunk in several places and is unfit for use.\n\n2. One side of the lower story would have to be re-modelled in order to get the necessary light.\n\n3. Some system of heating would have to be installed and this would be somewhat difficult as the building does not appear to have been built with that end in view.\n\n4. The walls would need to be plaster in order to retain the heat.\n\n5. A new ceiling would be needed.\n\nThis building is well built and if wide doors were placed at intervals along the sides it would make a very fine implement shed and storage warehouse. It is the right distance away from the other buildings for this purpose.\nSince additional class room accommodation and dormitory space is badly needed, it would appear to me that if some additional funds were provided to add to what it would take to put this building in shape a separate building to house all the educational departments of the institution would be a good investment. The class rooms vacated could be converted into dormitories and an assembly room could be provided and would help to correct the natural stolid characteristic of the Indian boys and girls. Such a building could be very compactly built.\n\nOwing to the high water table in this district it would not be necessary to have a basement. In fact basement rooms are not desirable in a building where shops are provided for vocational work because of the difficulty of bringing in machines, etc., for repairs or for demonstration purposes.\n\nThe attached plan will give a fair general idea of the accommodation which such a building would provide.\n\n1. On the ground floor would be a vocational woodworking shop 35' x 50'\n   A metal working, auto mechanics shop 36' x 50'\n   One class room for related instruction 34' x 35'\n   One class room for general work 34' x 35'\n\n2. On the second floor would be a Senior Classroom 35' x 44'\n   A Junior Classroom 34' x 35'\n   Teachers room 10' x 14'\n   Auditorium 35' x 90'\n\nI have not shown the elevation and the windows, doors, stairs, etc., are only approximately located. If the height of the first story is 14 feet it will make provision for a mezzanine floor at the end of both shops which will be found very convenient for storage and as a location for dismantled engines, etc.\n\nI would not recommend the establishment of Manual Training in this institution but is near relative vocational training which means that the objective would be training for making a living whereas Manual Training work supplements the other school subjects and its aim is cultural rather than vocational.\n\nIn choosing a teacher for building construction a good all round mechanic with a good general education will be the safest yet for in addition to teaching how to build houses, etc., he should teach the boys how to lath and plaster, how to do cement work, how to build a chimney, how to shingle, how to glaze windows and how to paint.\n\nThe benches should be similar to those used by carpenters and can be built by the pupils. If the lumber used is sent dressed it will not be necessary to provide any woodworking machines.\nAs the tools will receive bad usage it will be cheaper in the end to purchase tools of good quality.\n\nTo begin with,-\n\n1 only #6 Jointer\n12 \" #6 Bailey Jack Planes\n3 \" #3 Stanley Smooth Planes\n1 \" Ratchet Brace, 8\" swing, Millers Falls\n2 \" Ordinary \" 10\" \"\n2 sets auger bits\n3 only Rip saws, 22\", 7 teeth.\n3 Cross cut saws, 22\", 10 teeth.\n1 doz.

The Institution already has several makes of motors, engines, etc. The farm will provide a tractor for winter study and used automobiles can be purchased at a very small price. Soldering, babbiting and vulcanizing equipments are not expensive.\n\nFor the first year the Engineer could probably handle this work and later on as the number of older boys increase a second instructor could be provided.\n\nThe Institution itself will provide a wide variety of work and in one end of the woodworking room a wide door is shown so that such structures as garages, chicken houses, granaries, etc., could be built on order and would find ready sale for the value of the material used in its construction.\n\nPerhaps for a start the first story only might be built and when it is time to finish it possibly the older pupils would have gained sufficient experience to do a considerable part of the woodwork.\n\nThe walls should be either brick or re-inforced concrete.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe:- Vocational training etc., at Elkhorn School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of Dec. 11th last, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and his reply on Dec. 19th, re the development of vocational training in our Society's Indian Residential Schools, and more particularly with regard to the development of that branch of education in our Elkhorn School, I beg to state that our Commission were fortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. S. T. Newton, Director of Technical Education in the Province of Manitoba, to visit the Elkhorn School and to submit a report and recommendations in this connection. Mr. Newton's recommendations have been carefully considered by our Commission and approved, and I was instructed to forward to you a copy of the same with a request that the building and equipment be provided at your earliest convenience. As the sum of $15,000.00 was included in our list of requirements at this School this year to provide a new class-room, etc., it is hoped that this building may be provided during the coming summer. Additional class-room space, as you are no doubt aware, is very urgently required at this institution, and our Commission feel that the building recommended by the Director of Technical Education in the enclosed statement would meet this need, in addition to providing space for the vocational training, and an assembly room which might be used as a chapel as well. I am enclosing blue print plans of the proposed building as submitted by Mr. Newton along with his recommendations, and trust that this important matter may receive your prompt and sympathetic consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, Man. April 11, 1929\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of December 11 last, and your reply to the same on December 19, relative to the development of manual training in the Indian Schools administered by our Society, and more particularly with regard to the development of this branch of education at our Elkhorn School, you will have before you the recommendations prepared in this connection by the Director of Technical Education in the Province of Manitoba, and submitted to your Department in my letter of the 16th ultimo.\n\nThe Acting Assistant Deputy & Secretary when acknowledging the receipt of these recommendations in his letter of March 22, #105-0-11, stated that no funds were available to provide a building at the Elkhorn School for educational training and classroom purposes, but requested an estimate of the cost of fitting up one of the present buildings for manual training purposes.\n\nImmediately after receiving this request, I applied to the Principal of the Elkhorn School for an estimate of the cost of fitting up the building which was used, I believe, as a gymnasium by the School Management, before this institution passed under our Society's control. In his reply, dated the 9th inst., he states, in part, as follows:\n\n\"This building is a very old one, and originally was the Main Hall and Boys' Dormitory of the old School, when situated in the town of Elkhorn, some three quarters of a mile from the present site. It was then moved from the town, and placed where it now stands. Without hesitation, I firmly state that it would be an absolute waste of money to fix up this building for either class rooms or manual training purposes. The foundation...\"\n\"has completely gone, the flooring is badly sunk in the middle, and the building is practically held together by rods running down from the ventilators. It would have to be removed from the present foundations, and absolutely reconditioned to give the lighting necessary for the work to be carried on there. Furthermore, the building is so old that the lumber in it is of the old style, and would not fit in with lumber used at the present time, such as \"tongue and groove\", the nails are also of the older style, which would greatly increase the difficulty in reconstructing the place.\"\n\nThe information contained in the above statement, appears to me to fully support the suggestion made by the Director of Technical Education in his recommendations that this building might be made to serve as an implement shed and storage warehouse, and that it would be, as the Principal states, a waste of money to attempt to fix it up for either classroom or manual training purposes. Even to fix it up as an implement shed, etc., would it seems to me, cost more than it would be worth. The Principal himself hesitates to name any amount which will be required for this purpose, but states that he does not believe that the work could be done for an expenditure of less than $576 or $6,000.00.\n\nAs our Commission and the School Management have felt keenly for some years, the need of additional classroom space at this School, and have included in their list of requirements submitted to your Department for the last three years, the sum of $15,000.00 each year for this purpose, it seems to me and to our Commission, who sat very carefully into this matter at their last meeting, that the only satisfactory way to provide the additional classroom space required, would be to erect a new building in close proximity to the main school building. As the School has no assembly room, and no chapel large enough to accommodate the staff and pupils, our Commission felt that the additional classroom space could be provided in such a way that it would serve as an assembly room and chapel as well. They also felt that when providing this classroom space, provision might be included in the plan for the development of vocational training. This would mean a two storied building, and they still consider that the classroom and vocational training facilities which this School requires cannot be supplied in any cheaper or more satisfactory way. They are of the opinion, and they instructed me to lay this recommendation before you, that if funds are not available this year to erect the two storied building, that a one storied building be erected at once and fitted up temporarily and used as classrooms until a further appropriation has been secured next year to complete the second storey.\nAs the main school building is only provided with two classrooms at present, and these are by no means sufficient for 120 pupils, you will understand how difficult it is for the School Management to carry on the classroom work with an enrolment of 164 pupils, such as they have at present.\n\nOur Commission greatly hope that you may be able to give this matter your own personal attention and take steps immediately to provide the additional classroom space which is so urgently required.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nApril 17, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nThere has been correspondence with Dr. Westgate regarding additional classroom facilities for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. It has been represented that a two-storey building is really required for the school. Church officers have forwarded a rough sketch of a very large building, on the ground floor of which would be three large rooms for a carpenter shop and machine shop and two classrooms, and on the second floor more classrooms and an auditorium, which might be used as a chapel as well. The Department replied some time ago that there were no funds for this purpose, but as there are now 164 pupils enrolled and as we are extremely desirous of commencing a course in manual training at this school, I am writing to you, asking for your recommendation concerning the added accommodation that is required. The classroom facilities are not adequate for a pupilage of 120, and there should be a carpenter shop and machine shop at this school. There is an old building on the school property, which, at one time, the Department thought might be used for manual training; but the Reverend Principal and others have stated that it would not be suitable for this purpose and that it was really hardly worth repairing for the purposes of an implement shed.\n\nI should be glad to have your recommendation at an early date. There are no funds specifically provided for building activity at this school this year; but, in view of the urgency of the matter, it might be possible to make some temporary arrangements, which could later be improved and taken into the general scheme for the school buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\nApril 17, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to classroom facilities and carpenter and blacksmith shops at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. There are no funds provided for building purposes at this school for the current year; but as some additional accommodation is urgently required, I have written to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham for a report and recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. O.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant No. 106-0-5, informing me that there has been correspondence with Dr. Westgate regarding additional classroom facilities at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, and that it has been represented that a two-storey building is required. In reply I beg to say that it is a surprise to me to learn that additional classroom facilities are required, as I have always considered that the school was amply equipped, and this is borne out by the fact that I have never had a request from the Inspectors or other officers to have additional space provided. In view of this I am strongly opposed to incurring a large expenditure for this accommodation. I note it is stated that there are 160 pupils enrolled at the school at the present time. This, of course, is only a temporary arrangement, and if we rebuild the Gordon School the enrolment will go back to 120, or probably less, as we have always had great difficulty in keeping the enrolment up to 120 in the past. The fact that they have 160 pupils enrolled there at the present time is not sufficient reason for asking that additional classroom space be provided.\n\nAs regards the old building which is on the ground, I cannot agree that this could not be fixed up to accommodate the manual training class, as I am quite sure it could. All the manual training they can give at the school is work on the machinery, and carpenter work. A combined wood work and iron work shop would be the proper thing, and for a small outlay of money the old building in question could be made to answer this purpose quite well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.G. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 30, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 11th instant, concerning classroom facilities and carpenter and blacksmith shops at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, I have now to inform you that a report has been received from Mr. Commissioner Graham. The Department desires to postpone making a decision regarding classroom facilities until after the Gordon Residential School pupils have returned. In the meantime, temporary arrangements should be made for the extra classroom space required. As you were informed in official letter of the 17th instant, there are no funds available for a new building at this school, and Mr. Graham is of the opinion that the old building, to which you refer, could very well be used, temporarily, as a carpenter and blacksmith shop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.G.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the fact that an amount of $1500.00 was placed in the Estimates to provide for certain painting and repairs at the Elkhorn School. I should be glad to know as soon as possible if this has been allowed. I was at the school a few days ago and the Principal and staff were doing the usual spring cleaning. A great deal of painting and small repairs are necessary and I should be glad to have authority to have this work gone on with.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th ultimo, 106-0-5, and my reply of the 24th April, I beg to inform you that I visited the Elkhorn School a couple of days ago and went thoroughly into the question of additional classroom space at that institution, and I am quite convinced that the present accommodation is quite adequate for the school requirements, and that the Department should not be called on to provide additional space.\n\nWith regard to the chapel, this is not needed. The chapel adjoins the dining room and the two rooms can be thrown into one, which answers the purpose quite well.\n\nI note in your letter you state that the Department is anxious to commence a course in manual training at this school, and in this connection I may say that I have not found the manual training taught at our schools in the past to be of very great benefit to the pupils, and I am of the opinion that we would get much better results if this money were spent in giving them a proper equipment to farm with and teaching them how to handle it at the schools. In the past we have equipped hundreds of Indians with outfits of tools and fitted them up as carpenters and not one per cent of them are working at their trade on the reserve, and I do not know that the boy who has had manual training is any better fitted to go out on the farm and make a living than the fellow who has not.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\nThe general training that a boy receives at the school fits him for handling machinery and doing any repair work that might have to be done around the farm, and I think our efforts should be along the lines of agriculture, and agriculture only. We found this out long ago. At one time at the Qu'Appelle School we had a carpenter shop, tin shop, shoe shop, and so on, and the boys received a thorough training in these lines of work, but this has all been done away with and I do not think we should start it up again. I am stressing this point, because I would hate to see any expenditure on this particular line of work, as I know we have not obtained results from it in the past.\n\nThe old building referred to in your letter of the 17th April can be put in shape and should be used as a manual training room and gymnasium. The upstairs could be used as a storeroom for the paints, tools, etc., that are necessary around an institution of this kind. It would take $1200.00 to put the building in shape and I am of the opinion that this should be done at once. It would be of great assistance to the Principal to have a place that the boys could use as a recreation room, and also a place to keep tools and do repair work in. The building is an old one, but with an expenditure of $1200.00 it could be made as good as new.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 1, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 15th ultimo, and, in reply, I have to authorize an expenditure of approximately $1,000 for painting and repairs at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. There was an item of $1,500 in this connection; but, as new batteries and certain other improvements have been authorized, I have to request you to keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nI have also your 209-11A C.E. of the same date, concerning classroom space at this institution. I note it is adequate. Your remarks concerning manual training are receiving careful attention. I regret that there are no funds to put the old building referred to in good condition for a manual training room and gymnasium. This will have to stand until an appropriation can be secured for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith certified accounts of the Taylor Lumber Co., Ltd., of Elkhorn, Man., for lumber, nails, etc., used in the screening of the Farm Instructor's verandah last Summer, the work being done by authority of Mr. Russell Ferrier, on the occasion of his visit to the School in the Summer of 1928.\n\nAs the Taylor Lumber Co., Ltd., were anxious to receive their money, I paid the account by cheque on March 31st, intending to send the account in at once. However, the account was unfortunately mislaid among some other papers in my office, and I only discovered yesterday that it had not been forwarded to you.\n\nKindly accept my apologies for the delay in sending in the account. I trust that it will not too greatly inconvenience you.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev. Fred Eley)\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nFE/ACM.\n\nEnc.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that while at the Elkhorn School recently I arranged for the necessary painting and repairs at that institution, and I should be glad to have an accountable cheque for about $300.00 to cover the cost of labour. The Principal is having his staff and the older boys do most of the work, but it will be necessary to hire one or two competent men to do the painting on the roofs, etc., as I do not consider it would be safe to have the boys working on the roofs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nReferring again to my letter of the 15th ultimo, and Department reply No. 106-0-5, dated the 1st instant, I would be glad if the Department would reconsider the question of providing $1,200.00 to put in shape the old building referred to in your letter of the 17th April to be used as a manual training room and gymnasium. The repainting of the school and out-buildings is under way now. This school is close to the main highway entering the Province of Saskatchewan, on which of course there is constant traffic and the appearance of this old building is a disfigurement. The remodeling and painting of it will give the premises needed uniformity.\n\nThere was an item of $4,000.00 which is being saved by omitting an expenditure of $4,000.00 provided for at the Portage la Prairie School, $2,000.00 of which has now been allocated to build a new day school at the Key Reserve. If $1,200.00 out of what remains can be used at Elk Horn, I shall be very glad and would like to have your authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 4, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 29th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. It is difficult for the Department to decide what should be done with the old building referred to in your letter. The Rev. Principal, on April 9th, last, wrote in part as follows: \"This building is a very old one and originally was the main hall and boys' dormitory . . . in the town. It was moved from the town and placed where it now stands. Without hesitation, I firmly state that it would be an absolute waste of money to fix up this building for either classrooms or manual training purposes. The foundation has completely gone. The floor is badly sunk in the middle and the building is practically held together by rods running down from the ventilators. It would have to be removed from the present foundation and absolutely remodelled to give the lighting necessary. Furthermore, the building is so old, that the lumber in it is of the old style and would not fit in with lumber used at the present time.\" I may say that Dr. Westgate, also, has written it would be a waste of money to fix it up for manual training purposes or even an implement shed.\n\nI should like to ask if you have personally examined this building lately, as the report of the Rev. Principal is such that the Department hesitates to spend money on it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

I note you state that it is difficult for the Department to decide what should be done with the old building referred to in my letter of the 29th ultimo, and you quote the Rev. Principal as having said that it was very old and unfit for use. I presume this is your grounds for hesitating. It may be a surprise to you to know that when I went over this building with the Rev. Principal a few weeks ago he was very much in favour of having it remodelled, and thought it would meet the requirements quite well. Once more I would point out to the Department that the Principals of these schools, including Mr. Eley, who is a very excellent man, have not had the practical knowledge to enable them to judge and give advice in matters of this kind. I may say that Mr. Inspector Murison is of the same opinion as myself, namely, that for a small expenditure of money we could put this building in splendid shape. No private individual would think of discarding such a building as we have there and erecting another at a cost of probably $4000.00, and I trust the Department will grant the necessary authority to have the present building put in shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

If these additional expenses are charged, as they should be, to current costs, the figures (total Cost) $929.56 would be considerably increased.

Is it to the village of Elkhorn or to the Hydro Commission? If to the village, you might be good enough to prepare a formal offer to this Department, indicating who is to meet the cost of installation and stating definitely the fees to be charged. Cannot fees be charged on a monthly basis? In the enclosure, you state that power will be available at 8\u00a2 per kilowatt hour, subject to discount or reduction.

McLean, Esq.,\nDeptmt. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Elkhorn Indian School and Hydro -\n\nHon. D.G. McKenzie has forwarded me a copy of a letter from Hon. T.A. Crerar to whom he had written in connection with the above, and from whose letter it would appear that your Department has been waiting for further information from the Village of Elkhorn.\n\nI regret that your letter of October 28th, last has remained unanswered but our Council were hoping to receive advice from Dr. Scott that the rates for current as quoted in our letter of Oct. 21st, were satisfactory.\n\nAs there appears to be some misunderstanding in connection with this service may I explain that the line from the Provincial Hydro station at Virden was built at the cost of the ratepayers of the Village of Elkhorn. That some half mile or more of line was extended through the School grounds to the buildings and all that is now necessary is for the school to hook on. There should be no costs as regards installation, the school being already wired. The current would be metered through Elkhorn Municipal meter and the amount used by the school read from their meters and charged to them monthly in like manner as other users of current at Elkhorn.\n\nOur rates, as approved by the Commission, are - Light 20\u00a2 per K.W. and Power 8\u00a2 per K.W. The rates to the school, hereby submitted for your approval are:\n\nFirst 3000 K.W. consumed, 20\u00a2 per K.W., next 2000 K.W. consumed 16\u00a2 per K.W., all in excess of 5000 K.W. 12\u00a2 for Light.\n\nFor Power 8\u00a2 per K.W. No discounts.\n\nTrusting that this is the information that you require,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nClerk.\nOttawa, April 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the question of having the Indian residential school at Elkhorn tied into your provincial hydro system, and stating the rates that would be charged for lighting and power.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that we are taking this matter up with the Reverend Principal of the school. As soon as a report is received from him, you will be advised as to whether this service will be utilized in the school or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. W. Crosby, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nVillage of Elkhorn,\nElkhorn, Man.\nOttawa, April 24, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department would be glad to learn when you plan to install Hydro electricity at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. I am informed that the line is extended to the school buildings, that all that is necessary is to connect up and that there will be practically no costs in connection with the installation. I should be grateful for an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F.

We are of the opinion that we shall now be able to take advantage of your Provincial Hydro System, and have this day written fully to the Department at Ottawa, with reference to this matter. Upon hearing from the Department I will communicate with you again.\n\nThanking you for your kindness, and interest in this matter,\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Rev.

Crosby, Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nELKHORN, Manitoba, May 1st, 1930\n\nRev. F. Eley,\nElkhorn, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Eley,\n\nRe Indian School and Hydro.\n\nThe Council have been trying to secure, through the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa and the Department of Natural Resources, Winnipeg advice in submitting to you rates which would enable you to take advantage of our Provincial Hydro System and if possible without increasing the cost of your present system of lighting and power.\n\nAt a special meeting of Council held on April 25th, the following rates approved by the Hon. O. McKenzie were endorsed by resolution, viz - That the following rates for electric current be submitted to the Rev. Principal of the School -\n\nLIGHT -\n16\u00a2 per K.W.H. for the first 300 K.W.H. per month\n12\u00a2 per K.W.H. for the balance\n\nPower -\n7\u00bd\u00a2 per K.W.H.\n\nYour consideration of, and approval if possible, of these rates would greatly assist in making Hydro a success at Elkhorn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. C.W. Crosby,\nClerk.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 24th, 1930, No. 106-0-5, with reference to connecting this School with the Provincial Hydro System.\n\nI beg to report that the line was extended to the School buildings, but with reference to cost in connection with the installation, I beg to state first of all, there would be cost of the transformers, secondly, that of running extra wires for the purpose of using power, and thirdly, the advisability of having a thorough inspection of our outside wiring system.\n\nI also have the honour to report, that when the Hydro was turned on, the Village of Elkhorn, the rate given by the Village of Elkhorn was somewhat excessive, and from a financial point of view it was impossible to take advantage of the light and power. However, I am in receipt of a letter dated May 1st, 1930, from the Village Council, and enclose copy herewith for your information. You will see by this that we have been offered a special rate, and I am now of the opinion, that we should take advantage of this, providing the Department would be willing to provide us with Motors to take the place of the various gas engines we now have in use. This would lessen the danger of fire, and the cost of many repairs for the various engines. We would approximately require the following:\n\n1. Four or five H.P. Motor for Septic Tank Pump.\n2. Six H.P. Motor for pumping water and laundry.\n3. Two and half H.P. Motor for Bread Mixer.\n4. Movable ten H.P. Motor for driving Farm Chopper, Ensilage Cutter, and Circular Saw.\n\nI also wish to report the necessity of having continuous service, especially with reference to light in a School where there are so many children. It appears that the majority of light consumers in the Village of Elkhorn, are somewhat dissatisfied with the service as given by the Hydro, as many times the power has been turned off.\nwhen most required. This of course would be most unsatisfactory and dangerous in a building such as this with so many children. Therefore, we shall be pleased if the Department would look into this matter before we link up with the Hydro, so that there may be a guarantee of continuous service.\n\nThanking you Sir, for your kindness, and interest in our welfare, and waiting instructions,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, with further reference to the connecting up of the Elkhorn School with the Provincial Hydro system, I would ask you to please make arrangements to have the necessary connections made between the school and the Hydro line. It might be advisable to have these connections made in such a way that in the event of the Hydro system failing you could switch over to the existing electric lighting plant.\n\nWith reference to your request for motors it is not considered advisable to provide a portable 10 H.P. motor for driving the farm chopper, etc., as it would be much more convenient and safe to use a gas engine. I would ask you, however, to obtain and submit a price for the installation of the other three motors mentioned in your letter. When this is received further instructions will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Mr. Eley, Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, that the Department has been corresponding with him regarding the connecting up of the school with the Provincial Hydro Electric system.\n\nThis power line has been in the Elkhorn district for two years now, and I have for some time been considering the advisability of having the school connected up, and am now of the opinion that it should be.\n\nThis letter is written to remind the Department that we have an up-to-date lighting plant at this school which could be used at some other institution, even at one of the new schools we are building, if the Department decide to use the Hydro power at Elkhorn.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 15, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the connecting up of the Elkhorn School with the hydro electric power system, I have instructed the Rev. Mr. Riley to connect up the school lighting system with the hydro electric. There seems at the present time to be some doubt as to whether the hydro are giving continuous service, and as it is necessary that the school be supplied with light at all times I have instructed the Principal to have the wiring so arranged that in case the power from the hydro line fails, he can switch over to his own electric lighting plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:-\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from the Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., with reference to \"Fire gas\" and that we should through the local Indian Agent requisition for a supply of these.\n\nSeeing that we are not on a Reserve and deal direct with Ottawa. Will you kindly give me instructions in this matter. On account of having so many building outside of the main School, I am of the opinion that we should have 18 of the \"FIREGAS\" extinguishers for this plant.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Rev.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the supplying of 18 Firegas fire extinguishers for the use of the school and outbuildings in connection with the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the department has in the past supplied a number of fire extinguishers and fire equipment for your school. I would request that you inform the department of the number, size and type of fire extinguishers at present at the school and where they are distributed. The number of these extinguishers in the main school building and also in the outbuildings should be stated. You should also state how you would propose distributing the 18 extinguishers which you now ask for. When we have this information, consideration will be given to placing an order here for any further quantity of extinguishers that may be considered necessary. Please furnish your report as asked for above at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. Eley,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. Schools,\nElkhorn, Man.\nMay 26, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to a portable electric motor for the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, I have to report that department officials consider it would be a source of danger to the children that are running around the buildings at all hours of the day. A trailing power wire, no matter how carefully insulated and guarded is, if nothing more, a source of worry where children are playing. It is believed that a gas engine can be operated as economically for such purposes as sawing wood, chopping feed and ensilage. I may say that three electric motors have been authorized - one for the septic tank pump, another for pumping water and running laundry machinery and a third for operating the bread mixer.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant regarding the connecting up of the Elkhorn School with the hydro electric power system. This power is likely to be brought over from the main system in Winnipeg in a very short time, and when this is done there is no reason whatever, in my opinion, why we should not use the engine and dynamo that are on hand at this institution elsewhere. There will be no necessity for having this plant kept at the school, any more than a town that is connected with the hydro power should have a standby plant. It would never be used.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 27th 1938\n\nRev. F.

Fred Eley,\nAnglican Indian School,\nElkhorn, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. Anglican Indian School, Elkhorn.\n\nAt your request we investigated the wiring of the above buildings with a view to installing new services in order that the lighting system of the school and outbuildings can be connected to the Manitoba Hydro Commission's lines; also the wiring and connecting up of three motors, and repairing existing wiring to meet with the requirements of Mr. Wilkes, the Hydro Commission's Inspector, a copy of whose report is herewith enclosed.\n\nThe price for repairing and putting into good condition the present wiring is itemized in accordance with the Inspector's report.\n\nItem 1 - Principal's Residence - Sixty-nine Dollars, ($69.00).\n\nItem 2 - Farmers' Residence - Forty-three Dollars, ($43.00).\n\nItem 3 - Power House - Five Dollars, ($5.00).\n\nItem 4 - Garage & Gym. - Twenty-four Dollars, ($24.00).\n\nItem 5 - Granary - Sixteen Dollars and Fifty Cents ($16.50).\n\nItem 6 - Piggery - Fifteen Dollars, ($15.00).\n\nItem 7 - Horse Barn - Seventeen Dollars and Sixty Cents, ($17.60).\n\nItem 8 - Lower Barn & Root House - Seventy-six Dollars, ($76.00).\n\nItem 9 - Cow Barn - Thirty-one Dollars and Sixty Cents, ($31.60).\n\nItem 10 - Main Building - Fifty-six Dollars, ($56.00).\n\nItem 11 - Pole Line - Four hundred and Thirty-seven Dollars, ($437.00).\nCaptain The Rev. Fred Eley-2. June 25, 1930.\n\nIt will be necessary in this last item to install six new poles complete with necessary anchors and guy wires. There will be approximately one thousand feet of #8 wire used in order to change the present system to a 3-wire system, and 260 feet of No. 1/0 wire to feed the main building.\n\nThe following is for new work that will be necessary to make the change for the new services:\n\nThe service as we understand it will enter the power house and from there will be connected through a double throw switch so that the present plant can be operated in case of emergency. In the power house will be the necessary fuses and distribution to take care of the other buildings.\n\nThe service will consist of a 200 ampere 3 pole service switch, service and feeder wires to be 3 - 3/0 wires in 2\" conduit, this to be fed from the double throw switch which will be mounted behind present switchboard, and terminate on the outside of the wall nearest the school building. This will cost Three hundred and Sixty-one Dollars, ($361.00).\n\nIn addition to this it will be necessary to change the present feeder in the school building from a 2-wire to 3-wire system, and to change the present service switch from a 2-wire to a 3-wire. This will cost One Hundred and Seventy Dollars, ($170.00).\n\nFor wiring and connecting up one 5 HP septic tank motor; 1 - 7\u00bd HP pump motor in the laundry; and one 2 HP motor in the bakery from the service point to the motor terminal, building concrete base for motors, erecting the necessary counter shafting, pulleys and bolts, all complete and in complete operation - Four Hundred and Eighty Dollars, ($480.00).\n\nWe will also supply 1 - 2 HP motor complete for $69.85, 1 - 5 HP motor $92.50, 1 - 7\u00bd HP motor - $123.00. These motors are for 220 volts, 3 phase, 1800 r.p.m. and complete with pulley and base.\n\nIt may be necessary in order to meet with the requirements of the Power Commission to use magnetic switches. These will cost for the 2 and 5 HP motors $25.00 each, and for the 7\u00bd HP motor $31.00.\n\n\"DO IT ELECTRICALLY\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt is quite possible that meters of this size will not be required, and that they can be somewhat smaller, but this can only be arrived at by connecting up one of the motors and testing out the HP when it is in operation.\n\nWe will also instal service for stove and water heater for the Principal's residence for the sum of Fifty-eight Dollars and Forty-five Cents, ($58.45).\n\nWe will instal this work complete to meet with the requirements of the Hydro Power Commission within as short a time as possible.

Reid & Son., Selkirk, Man., for carriage & express charges to Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. A. G. HAMILTON, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES, DATED DECEMBER 18TH, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ELKHORN INDIAN RES. SCHOOL.\n\nIn all the dormitories the electric light switch is inside the dormitory and locked with a key. In cases of fire, this would be a poor arrangement as it takes too long to get the lights on. This switch should be in the hall on the opposite side of the wall, then it would not need to be locked and could be easily reached as the hall light is kept burning. The change should not incur any great expense.\n\nFire drill is observed and was carried out during my inspection. The drill was given after all the children had retired, and without any excitement they were able to get out in seven minutes.\n\nThe fire escape on the west wing of the building is only a ladder hanging against the wall and very unsuitable for children. The infirmary, as well as a small dormitory, is at this end of the building and a proper fire escape should be provided. The present ladder is not used for drill and the children are obliged to go the length of the building and into another dormitory in order to reach the fire escapes. Fire extinguishers are placed throughout the building in convenient places and all the fire hose appeared to be in good condition.\n\nA small dressing room adjoining the infirmary should be provided with a radiator. Last year, the radiator froze and broke and, at present, the only heat obtainable is from the hall. This room is provided with running water and wash basin and, unless a radiator is provided, further trouble is likely to arise from freezing.\n\nThe stairs to the boys' washroom are badly worn and the treads should be renewed. The floors in the classrooms and staff rooms are badly in need of paint, as are also the front stairs and the wood work in the bathrooms. In many places, the paint is entirely gone, while in other places, small patches remain. The floors are scrubbed each week and were clean throughout the building.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INDIAN COMMISSIONER GRAHAM, DATED JANUARY 6th, 1931, ENCLOSING ABOVE REPORT.\n\nThe Inspector comments on the fire escape on the west wing of the building, which is only a ladder hanging against the wall. This matter has been brought to your attention before. I do not think it is a satisfactory escape.\n\nMr. Hamilton mentions the need for a small radiator in the dressing room adjoining the infirmary. I think this will have to rest in abeyance for the present year. Some slight repairs to the flooring are required. I think this work should be done and it can be gone on with at any time provided the necessary authority is given. I am not in favor of painting the Principal's residence this year, owing to the financial conditions existing.\nOttawa, January 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nRelative to his recommendation that the electric light switches in the dormitories be changed from their present position on the wall inside the dormitories where they could be easily reached, I have to say that the suggestion of the Inspector should be carried out. You may, therefore, arrange to have the switches changed to the outside wall of the dormitories, where they could be easily reached by a member of the staff. If this were done, it is considered that it would not be necessary to keep the switches locked.\n\nRelative to the providing of a fire escape of a satisfactory type on the outside west wall of the building, to replace the present hanging ladder, I shall be pleased if you will furnish your recommendation as to the type of escape you would recommend and the approximate cost of supplying and installing same.\n\nRegarding the installing of a radiator in the dressing room adjoining the infirmary, and the renewing of the treads of the stairs to the boys' washroom, and the painting of the floors in the classrooms and staff rooms, also front stairs and woodwork in the bathrooms, I have to say that this work will have to stand over until a later date, as we have no funds at the present time to provide the expenditure required for the purpose.\n\nIt is noted that you are not in favour of painting the Principal's residence this year, and this work will also have to stand over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 6)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 106-0-5 of the 17th instant, and in reply would recommend a third escape for the Elkhorn Church of England School, similar to the two installed in 1928. The cost will probably be between six and seven hundred dollars. The present escapes were manufactured and installed by the Manitoba Bridge & Iron Works of Winnipeg.\n\nThe Department's remarks, with reference to the light switches and the other work recommended by the Inspector, are noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your No. 206-11A C. R. of the 21st instant regarding the installing of a third fire escape on the outside west wall of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the installation of the additional fire escape, to be of the same type as the present escapes.\n\nAs our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned, it is hoped that you will be able to defer payment of the account covering the cost until our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Fire Escape at Elkhorn.\n\nHaving had one of our men visit the Indian School at Elkhorn to take measurements for the new fire escape we are making for you on the above contract, we take pleasure in quoting you as follows -\n\n1. Fire escape, similar in design to those supplied by us in 1928, but of the size necessary for the position indicated to us by your Principal, Rev. F. Eley.\n\nPrice - Nine Hundred and Sixty Seven Dollars ($967.00) erected in place, including Federal Government Sales Tax at 1%.\n\nThis fire escape will have two balconies more than those referred to above which we supplied you sometime ago, and slightly greater length of stair. We have allowed in this price for the taking down of the existing ladder and balconies, but not for any structural alterations to the building, or for patching plaster where bolts go through the walls.\n\nOwing to the location of an existing wooden porch under the proposed position of the new balconies it is not possible to have doors in place of the windows.\n\n- over -\n\nIndian Affairs.

We do not, of course, include for this work in our price but would, if you wish, arrange to have this done at the time our erection men are on the job, charging you at the rate of cost plus 10%.\n\nThanking you for placing this work with us, and assuring you of our careful attention to all your requirements, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE MANITOBA BRIDGE & IRON WORKS LIMITED.\n\nSALES MANAGER.\n\nRTL: GM.\nOttawa, February 17th, 1931.\n\nW.

Mr. Eley, as you know, very seldom calls upon the Department for assistance, and I would be inclined to recommend that his requests be granted, as follows:-\n\n1 laundry stove, for heating irons\n2 doz. spring taps for wash basins\n\nHe also asks that he be allowed to employ a carpenter for a week, fixing up things about the place, such as repairing the wooden stair treads, and the drain to the sewage disposal. I believe the necessary material for these repairs would cost about $30.00, and the labour about $30.00.\n\nI think everything the Principal asks for could be covered by $100.00 and I would ask you to let me have the necessary authority for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11 A O.E. of the 27th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School to be supplied with a laundry stove for heating irons and two dozen spring taps for wash basins, and that he be allowed to employ a carpenter for one week in carrying out repairs.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of a laundry stove of a type that will be satisfactory for heating irons, also two dozen spring taps for the wash basins. The Principal may also employ a carpenter, for approximately one week, and purchase the necessary material for the repairs. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

The Fairbanks-Morse people are of the opinion that this engine should be worth at least $500.00.\n\nShould the Department sell this engine, would it be possible for us to be supplied with an ironing machine for our laundry.

There are thirty-eight children on the roll and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 3     | 7      |\n| 4     | 20     |\n| 5     | 6      |\n| 6     | 4      |\n| 7     | 1      |\n\nThe register was marked to date and the attendance regular. The children were well dressed, neat, and clean. The class room was well aired and tidy.\n\nThe children speak out clearly and are well mannered. They read with understanding and I found their book work well done and neatly set down. I would judge Mr. Bradley is rendering good service as a teacher.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss Field. The roll calls for forty-five and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 29     |\n| 2     | 10     |\n| 3     | 6      |\n\nThese children make excellent response to Miss Field, and speak out well. They are well mannered, bright, and -\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nbright, and attentive.\n\nThe room was tidy. The children well clothed and clean.\n\nThe dormitories were clean, and well aired. The beds were all neatly made, and the bedding clean. The girls are provided with night gowns and the boys' pyjamas.\n\nMiss Shaw is in charge of the laundry. This department is well equipped with machinery, and the work is well done. Miss Shaw, aside from the use of the power machinery, instructs the girls in the use of small washing machines and teaches them how to do properly a family size washing. When not in the laundry, Miss Shaw instructs the girls in the mending of their clothes and this requires the balance of her time. No sewing teacher is provided; consequently the children do not receive instruction in the making of new garments, at least not to any extent. This, I feel, is a great mistake, as every girl on leaving school should know how to make her own clothes and do the necessary sewing for children.\n\nMiss Palmer is in charge of the bakery and dairy and renders good service. In this department more of the senior girls should be given a chance to become bread makers. A baking of the proper size for a family could perhaps be made each day by some girl. At present the work is carried on by one or two girls and very little of the individual instruction has been given.\n\nMiss Howe is kitchen matron and I found the food well prepared and wholesome. The kitchen is large, bright and well equipped.\n\nMiss Lindsay, the matron, appears to keep close supervision over the school, and the halls, dining room, and staff-rooms were all tidy and showed care and good housekeeping.\nkeeping.\n\nThe fire equipment is in splendid condition and the fire escape added last year has made a wonderful improvement. Fire drill was observed and the children were able to get out in less than three minutes. I might say the children had all retired and in some cases were asleep when the fire alarm was sounded. No member of the staff was aware that fire drill was to be observed. The doors leading from the dormitories to the fire escapes are all pad-locked. The engineer, who is a graduate of Toronto University in electrical engineering, offered to connect these doors with the fire alarm so that if opened the alarm would be sounded. This would do away with the locks and would entail very little expense.\n\nThe dormitory lights can only be put on from a switch in the dormitory and this switch is operated by a key. This is an awkward arrangement and the switches would be much handier if placed outside the dormitory door and the ordinary switch used. Again this work could be properly carried out by the engineer if proper switches and a small amount of wire were provided.\n\nThe food served on the day of my visit was as follows:\n\nBreakfast: porridge, bread, lard and tea\nDinner: meat, dumplings, potatoes, gravy, bread, tea, and pudding\nSupper: bread spread with peanut butter and tea.\n\nAt all meals the children appeared to receive plenty, but no waste is allowed.\n\n- The yards -\nThe yards about the school were clean, and, I believe, are well looked after.\n\nThe garden yielded a fair return and the potato crop was excellent.\n\nPoultry is kept, but this year, due to disease, the flock went back and the Principal informed me that he intended killing off the present birds. The premises will then be thoroughly cleaned and made ready for next year.\n\nAt present sixteen cows are being milked, but a number of the cows will soon be dry. Hay is scarce and they have no feed grain for the stock. The grain crop was cut for green feed, but yielded very light.\n\nThe horse barn was clean and all tools and harness neatly put away. Six horses are kept, and they were in fair condition.\n\nI noticed one side of the barn roof is only partly stained. A few gallons of stain would complete the work and greatly add to the appearance of the buildings.\n\nThe children in this school receive a good training. They are obedient and respectful and progress is being made in the various departments. The Reverend Mr. Eley keeps in close touch with the work and is respected by the staff and pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nREGINA, SASK., December 1st, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Hamilton's report on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, which he inspected during the month of November.\n\nYou will note that conditions at this school are good. The children are well fed, the classroom work is good, and everything about the institution is as it should be. The stock is well cared for, and the boys receive a good training in farm work. The girls at this school milk cows during certain periods of the year - chickens are also kept. In fact, the Department hear very little from this school, simply because we have a competent Principal in charge. All schools could be managed in the same way if we had the right type of man in charge.\n\nThere is one matter, however, which required attention. The Inspector found the doors leading from the dormitories to the fire escapes padlocked. This is absolutely wrong. If there were a fire and a panic occurred, there would probably be a great loss of life. I have instructed the Principal by telephone to have the locks removed at once.\n\nWith regard to the light switches, the change suggested should certainly be made. They should not be operated by a key. I have been talking to the Principal over the telephone, and he informs me that the switches have now been changed, at a cost of $12.00. He stated that he hopes the Department will re-imburse him for this.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nfor this. I trust you will attend to this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11 of the 1st instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on his recent inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the Department is pleased to note the general conditions at this school are satisfactory; that the children are well fed and that progress is being made in the classroom work; also that the boys are receiving good training in farm work.\n\nIt is noted that you have instructed the Principal to have the locks removed from the doors in the dormitories which lead to the fire escape.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $12 in having the change made in the lighting switches, as suggested by the Inspector, and you may forward a certified account in the usual manner covering this expenditure.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of the Inspector that a few gallons of stain be supplied to complete the side of the barn roof, which, at present, is only partly stained, I have to say that, if you consider this work should be carried out at the present time, you may arrange for the Principal to obtain the stain required and have the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This list has just come to hand from the Principal, who states that he delayed sending it until he had had an opportunity of discussing the needs with your Mr. Sutherland. Mr. Sutherland will know how very necessary all the items mentioned are. In the list I sent you with my letter of Oct. 11th, you may cancel general repairs ($600.00), but the new building for classroom instruction and vocational training should remain, and the following items be added to it:\n\n1. New low pressure boiler for the heating system.\n   Estimated cost $?\n\n2. Electric refrigerator for the dairy.\n   Estimated cost $795.00.\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Co. of Winnipeg, have given the following quotation in this connection:-\n\n\"We propose to build a Walk-in cooler, the dimensions of which would be 6 ft. x 6 ft. high. The walls of this to be constructed of fir, insulated with 4\" of Armstrong's compressed corkboard and lined inside with special odorless Spruce \"V\" joint. The equipment necessary to maintain this box at an average temperature of 38\u00b0 would be one only model AB375 Frigidaire compressor and a model DXL666 cooling coil. The compressor would have a 3/4 horse motor therein.\n\nFor the complete installation of this equipment in Elkhorn we wish to quote a net price of Seven Hundred and Ninety-Five Dollars ($795.00).\n\"The above equipment is fully guaranteed by the manufacturer and should have ample capacity to take care of the requirements for your institution in the best possible manner.\"\n\n3. Two wagons for the Farm.\n   Estimated cost $250.00\n\n4. Equipment for Manual Instruction, to be given in the gymnasium.\n   Estimated cost $500.00\n\n5. Bath for the Hospital.\n   Estimated cost $150.00\n\n6. Drainage for the Piggery.\n   Estimated cost $200.00\n\n7.

I regret we will have no funds this year to provide the cost of any of the items mentioned in your letter.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a new low pressure boiler for the heating system, I would request that you furnish information as to the cost involved in the purchase and installation of the boiler.\n\nWhen Mr. Sutherland of this Department saw you in Winnipeg, he authorized the supplying of a cream separator, which has been delivered at the school. If you will forward a certified account, in triplicate, covering the cost, payment will be made. In forwarding the account, please state whether you wish the cheque sent to your Commission or to the firm who supplied the separator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Wickens, Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, stating that he was informed by Mr. Sutherland that $300.00 or money appropriated for the Elkhorn School was still available for this year - 1933. He was advised that this should be spent in the repairing of the plaster, paint, and for carpentering work where it is most needed. Canon Wickens is anxious to proceed with this work and writes asking that definite authority be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 4, 1933\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 27th ultimo, regarding the request of the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School for authority to incur an expenditure of $300 - which is available in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year - for the purpose of carrying out repairs to the school building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the Principal, under your oversight, incurring an expenditure before the end of the present fiscal year, for the purpose of repairing the plaster and paint and for general carpentry work, where most needed. In this connection, the amount of $300 is not to be exceeded. The Principal and yourself should arrange for the purchase of any materials required from firms on the approved list. It is presumed that the greater part of the work can be performed by the staff, without expense to the Department.\n\nI enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure of the above stated amount. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, for the cost of the material and for any outside labour which it is necessary to employ. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E.R. No. 1098, and it must be accounted for before the end of March, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nA. G.

Our staff is quite new and I have failed to find any drawings indicating the pipe and valve lines within and without the plant. Just now my engineer is concerned about the power house and a water cistern supposed to be beneath it. If you have such information and drawings I would greatly appreciate a copy of the information being sent to me at your earliest convenience.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.J. Wickens\n(Principal)\nNovember 17, 1933.\n\nReverend and Dear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th with reference to plans of the Elkhorn School, I beg to say that we have not in this office the plans of this school. The plans for this building were not prepared here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. S. J. Williams,\nThe Principal,\nElkhorn Anglican Indian Res. School,\nElkhorn, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have already received enquiries about the installation of the new boiler in this School and the visit of one expert prompts me to lay before you the opinion he expressed.\n\nThere are 97 radiators containing 6390 sq. feet of radiation. Mains and risers would add 20% to this making a heating load of 7668 sq. feet. Changing from water to steam would be reduction in number of these radiators and some change in those retained.\n\nThe expert in question, who by the way dubs the present boiler \"a freak,\" was the engineer who scrapped the mate to it from the old Brandon School. He believes that a hot water boiler might be installed to burn Souris Coal and so avoid the expense of alteration to the radiators.\n\nI do not know how far the Department has gone in the whole matter but the fact that Engineers are already asking for information suggests that we may in 1934 anticipate the much needed new heating system.\n\nThe above information and the fact that the boiler is a Gurney Offord Smoke Consuming No K 1867 W with a catalogue capacity of 12000 sq. feet, fire and water grates 15x14 may be of value to you.\n\nThanking you for your interest in our problems,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Principal)\nOttawa, December 13, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, with reference to the enquiries you have received regarding the installation of a new boiler in the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, to improve the present heating system.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., when forwarding the requirements for your school, requested that funds be provided in our Estimates for the next year to install a new low pressure boiler. He did not state the cost involved. This was necessary before it could be decided if it would be possible to include the amount in the Estimates for next year. Dr. Westgate was therefore requested to submit an estimate of the cost involved in the purchase and installation of the boiler.\n\nI am not in a position to state whether funds for the purpose will be available but consider it rather doubtful, as it was found necessary to curtail the Appropriation for Indian Education for the next fiscal year. However, the Department will be pleased to have an estimate of the cost in this connection, for future consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Canon S. J.

Wetmore\nGen.Mgr.\nSPECIFICATION FOR CHANGING\nBOILER AND CONNECTIONS FOR HOT WATER HEATING,\nAND FOR CHANGING SYSTEM TO\nLOW PRESSURE STEAM HEATING, AT ELKHORN, MAN.\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nTake out present Gurney Down Draft Hot Water Boiler, and supply and install a \"Gurney Bright Idea\" Hot Water Boiler, size W-40-12, of a Net Capacity of 7875 Square Feet, BOILER TO BE COVERED WITH Asbestos Blocks wired on and plastered \u00bd\" thick outside blocks with Asbestos Cement mixed with enough Portland Cement to make a hard smooth surface.\n\nSupply a new Smoke Breathing full size of Boiler Flue, and connect to chimney and to have a clean-out door near boiler.\n\nMake a new Header of Pipe and Fittings of full size of outlets from Boiler and connect all the present Flow and Return lines into the new headers, using flange unions wherever necessary.\n\nFOR CHANGES TO STEAM.\n\nTake out Present Gurney Down Draft Hot Water Boiler, and supply and install one \"Gurney Bright Idea\" Steam Boiler complete with all fittings to comply with Regulations for Steam Boilers, for the Province of Manitoba, including Steam Gauge, Water Column, Gauge Cocks, Regulator and Safety Valve, Firing Tools and Tube Cleaner. Boiler to be covered with Asbestos Blocks wired on and plastered \u00bd\" thick with Asbestos cement and enough Portland Cement to make a hard smooth surface. Size of Boiler to be S-40-14 of a Net Capacity of 7500 Square Feet.\n\nSupply a new Smoke breaching of full size of Boiler Flue, and connect to Chimney and have a cleanout door near boiler.\n\nMake Connections between the present Heating Mains and new Boiler Steam supply and return, and change all connections to present Radiators, using Nickle Plated Steam Valves on both supply and return connections, also a N.P. Automatic Air Vent on each radiator, radiators to be drilled and tapped to take new air valves.\n\nOR, FOR A OPEN RETURN\nSYSTEM OF LOW PRESSURE STEAM HEATING WITH PUMP AND RECEIVER.\n\nALL changes as above for \"Changes to Steam, except that instead of connecting the returns direct into boiler, that the Returns run to an open Receiver and all condensation be returned to boiler by an electrically driven pump, and that each radiator have a \"Webster\" or \"Dunham\" trap at return end of radiator instead of steam valve.\n\nThis system of Steam Heating is more economical to operate, although slightly more expensive to install in the first place.\nGurney New Bright Idea,\nSectional, Cast Iron\nHeating Boiler\n\nFor Steam and Water\n\nFor apartment houses and other large installations no other boiler will give such care free satisfaction as this New Bright Idea Boiler. It has all the well known advantages of cast iron construction plus rapid heating and the utmost fuel economy. It is built in seven sizes for either steam or hot water.\nILLUSTRATING REGULAR INTERMEDIATE SECTION\n\nNote in this illustration the slender horizontal water heating surfaces and the generous vertical tubes for quick water circulation.\n\nILLUSTRATING OUTSIDE OF BACK SECTION\n\nThe large smoke hood and twin balanced check dampers are clearly shown. Also note the cleanout door for the secondary combustion chamber.\n\nILLUSTRATING A SECTIONAL VIEW OF THE NEW BRIGHT IDEA BOILER\n\nNote the intense fire in the secondary combustion chamber and the double gallery flue design which provides three crown heating surfaces.\n\nheating and any of the smaller sizes can be converted into larger boilers\u2014this is interesting in case future additions to the building are contemplated.\n\nWater Tube Design\n\nIn the sectional view it will be noted that the slim water tubes present a large heating surface in comparison to the amount of water they contain. This design means quick response and economy in operation.\n\nThree Crown Heating Surfaces\n\nA distinctive feature of this boiler is that the double gallery flue design provides three separate and distinct crown heating surfaces\u2014this is the most effective heating surface in any boiler. The fire travel is from the front to the back of the firebox, then to the front through the first flue level and to the back of the boiler through the upper gallery. The fire travel is the same in all sizes of this boiler.\nAuxiliary Air\nAt a suitable point at the rear of the firebox auxiliary air is introduced ensuring complete combustion of any gases that pass out of the firebox, making the operation of the boiler practically smokeless. The amount of air is readily controlled by the ratchet doors at the side of the boiler.\n\nSecondary Combustion Chamber\nIn the six larger sizes a bridgewall section is placed at the back of the firebox forming a secondary combustion chamber where the gases burn when mixed with the auxiliary air. (See table of arrangement of sections on the back cover of this catalogue.)\n\nLarge Cleanout Doors\nLarge cleanout doors at the front of the boiler make it simple to clean all the flues. In addition there is a cleanout door at the back of the base through which the secondary combustion chamber may be cleaned.\n\nThe Grates\nThe grate bars are so designed that even small sizes of coal may be used. They are easy to operate for either shaking or dumping. The entire grate assembly can be removed from the front of the boiler by first removing the front base panel.\n\nOil Burning\nDue to the all cast iron construction and the long fire travel it is an excellent boiler for use with any oil burning equipment.\n\nEasy to Erect\nIt will be found that this New Bright Idea Boiler is easy to erect due to accurate machining and a simplified method of pulling up the sections. And when installed its clean pleasing lines and generous proportions give this boiler a smart appearance. It looks, and is capable of doing a first class heating job.\n\nRATINGS AND DIMENSIONS\n\n| No. | Steam Rating Gross | Water Rating Gross | Size of Fire Door\u201424\" x 13\" | Size of Smoke

It is built up in a compact unit of all-steel construction electrically welded. Some of the outstanding features that have been built into this boiler are: Unrestricted circulation of water; Low water line; Large amount of direct heating surface; Long three pass fire travel and a combustion chamber large enough to burn our low grade Western coals.\n\nVulca Boilers have a manhole on the top of the boiler for sizes VS and over and a hand-hole in the front head for smaller sizes. The boiler is equipped with sufficient watertight plugs to properly inspect and clean the boiler. Soot doors are also placed where required so that the boiler may be given a thorough cleaning whenever it may be found necessary.\n\nVulca Boilers are built to comply with the Canadian Inter-Provincial Regulations for the construction and inspection of boilers. Although they are Government registered for 15 lbs. per square inch working pressure, they are designed for 30 lbs. per square inch working pressure and are tested in our shops to a pressure of 60 lbs. per square inch. Such rigid tests insure the customer against faulty construction.\n\nVulca Boilers are constructed of Flange Quality Plate 55,000-65,000 lbs. per square inch tensile strength. All castings, including grates, are of good quality grey iron and are of rugged construction.\n\nVulca Boilers are furnished with the following: Base, Grates, Safety Valve, Water Column piped to Boiler, Pressure Gauge, Gauge Cocks, Balanced Damper in Ash Pit Door with automatic regulator, Damper in rear Smoke Outlet, Firing Tools and Bridge Wall Fire Bricks.\n\nNo Fittings are supplied with Hot Water Boilers.\n| Size No. | Heating Surface Sq.

ratings in above table are based on the recognized standard that one square foot of heating surface is equal to 14 square feet of radiation at the steam outlet of the boiler.\n\nThe net rating is obtained by deducting 20% from the gross rating to take account losses due to mains, risers and returns.\n\nFor Hot Water Heating add 60% of Radiation.

From the information received from you, we estimate that there is 6150 square feet of hot water radiation at present, and from the note at top of the list of radiators that it is the intention to change the heating system from Hot Water to Steam.\n\nThis would mean that each radiator would deliver more heat per unit area. We are therefore quoting on a boiler having capacity to take care of the same number of square feet of steam radiation as you now have hot water radiation. This boiler should therefore have ample capacity to heat the buildings and furnish heat for the hot water requirements as well.\n\nAs requested, the price is on the boiler installed in the building. In addition there would be cost of changing the piping to the radiators, as larger delivery pipes is required for steam. The cost of making this change is difficult to estimate without seeing the building, in any case it would be necessary for you to have a Plumbing and Heating Contractor quote on this work for you.\nRev.

Dr. Thomas, Lord Bishop of Brandon, within whose Diocese the Elkhorn School is situated:\n\nBrandon, May 12th, 1933.\n\n\"My dear Dr. Westgate:-\n\nI do not know a better man in my Diocese to succeed the Rev. F. Eley in the Principalship of the Elkhorn Residential School than the Rev. Canon S. J. Wickens, B.A., B.D., Rector of St. George's, Brandon, and I therefore recommend that he be considered by the Commission for the position.\n\nHe is well known to most, if not all, of its members, and on that account it is not necessary for me to enlarge on his qualifications. He is a devout and sincere Priest of the Church, and has made a success of every task entrusted to his care. From a practical and business point of view he has had\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs-2  \nJune 6, 1933.\n\na much wider experience than many other ordained men. For some years past he has acted as Secretary of our Synod, and has given very valuable service. He has an aptitude for work amongst young people, and almost received appointment to the position of Western Field Secretary of The G.B.R.E., when that office was vacant two years ago. He was on active service during the war, and was awarded the Military Medal.\n\nI am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(signed) Wilfred Brandon\n\nTrusting this appointment may receive the approval of your Department, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.

A. Stewart,\nChief Boiler Inspector,\nBureau of Labor,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of January 30th, I have made an inspection of the boilers at the Elkhorn Indian School. Reports for same are attached.\n\nThe school is heated by a hot water system. The boiler is a Gurney cast section size 5 x 11 x 10 sections with top and lower fire grates. I was informed by the Superintendent of the School that they have been having a little trouble in heating the building. On several occasions during the winter the water pipes have been frozen. The present system is not very satisfactory and far from being economical. With the top and lower grates there is no room for burning all the gases before going up the chimney. I believe that if there was a good fire box type boiler installed say about 54 inches in diameter and 12 feet long with plenty fire box height that it would pay for itself in fuel in two years, and they would have no trouble in heating the school. On checking up the radiators I find there are ninety-seven and I believe there is some 6390 square feet of radiation. The present system has no circulating pumps and I believe that if there was two three inch circulating pumps installed it would make a considerable difference in heating the building with the system that they now have.\n\nPersonally I would strongly recommend that some change be made in the heating system before next winter comes around.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) E. Moodie\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated January 26th, No. 106-0-5, I now attach copy of a report of the Boiler Inspector, Mr. E. Moodie, in connection with the boiler at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Moodie has suggested that circulating pumps be installed, and states that he feels this would make a considerable difference in heating the building. He does not altogether condemn the present boiler and heating system, but points out that it is not satisfactory nor economical. I visited this school during the past year and received no serious complaints in connection with the boiler. The Department letter is the first information I received that a new boiler was being asked for. If it is the Department's intention to make any change, the work should be done during the summer and not left until the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

He gives an estimated cost the sum of $165.00.\n\nI have no doubt some repair work is needed, but this work is usually done in the spring, rather than in the fall. We will not likely receive much rain from now on and if the repair work is carried out at the present time, some additional work will no doubt be needed again in the spring.

It is noted that you give an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that certain funds were provided in the Estimates for the current fiscal year for absolutely necessary repairs at this school. For your information, I may say that the amount provided for carrying out these general repairs was $500.00, but, except in case of absolute necessity, it is not intended that expenditure to that amount be incurred. If you consider that the eave troughing should be repaired, you may arrange to have the work carried out, and the cost should not exceed the estimate as mentioned by the Principal. You should see that the work is satisfactorily completed, by a firm on the approved list. You might inform the Department if the work is being proceeded with, in order that the necessary encumbrance, authorizing the expenditure, may be obtained.\n\nIf any other minor repairs are required to the buildings before the extreme cold weather sets in, you should give full details, with an estimate of the cost, and, if they are not in excess of the appropriation provided, favourable consideration will be given to authorising the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have, of course, no means of determining who is on the approved list.\n\nI would be glad, however, if the length and type of material for the job could be quoted by the tinsmith mentioned, who is located in Brandon, for I am anxious that the work should be done while the roads are still fit to travel.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) S.

At the same time I pointed out that the quotation must be secured from someone on the approved list and according to my list there was no tinsmith closer than Brandon. Attached is a copy of the letter received in reply. As the local tinsmith is not on the approved list in this office, I would like to be advised if his name has been omitted from my list or if there are any other tinsmiths closer than Brandon from whom I should secure quotations.\n\nCanon Wickers is anxious to have this work done at once, and I would appreciate having an immediate reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

In this connection I have to say that it is not understood why a member of the staff should not be able to carry out the repairs required to place the bell in a good, serviceable condition. We are not aware if the bell is operated by batteries or connected with the lighting system.\n\nIf you consider it to be absolutely necessary to have an electrician effect the repairs, you may arrange for such service. However, the expense should be kept as low as possible. This bell should be placed in good condition at the earliest possible date. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

(RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWINNIPEG, MAN. November 29th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report in connection with the Elkhorn Indian Residential School which I inspected between November 13th and 16th, 1934.\n\nThe senior classroom is in charge of Mr. Crampton who, I understand, holds his Grade 12 certificate. He is greatly interested in the work and the children are making steady progress. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| IV    | 20     |\n| V     | 17     |\n| VI    | 14     |\n| VII   | 8      |\n\nI consider the pupils well along in their various grades. Their articulation is much improved and they read with understanding. They write well and are fairly accurate in arithmetic and spelling. The work in English and composition is much improved.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss Fryer who holds her Manitoba certificate. There are 88 on the roll, arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 48     |\n| II    | 18     |\n| III   | 22     |\n\nMiss Fryer is quite young but a born teacher and is doing excellent work. The children are alert and, through good management, always kept busy. The lessons are made attractive and interesting.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe number enrolled will, of course, only permit of the half day system. The Reverend Principal would like most of the children in class all day as many are too young to work and there is really little for them to do. Now that the enrolment has reached almost 150, an outside classroom should be provided. I understand this has been asked for by the church authorities and, with the present large enrolment, is much needed.\n\nSince last spring a large amount of interior painting has been done, which work has improved the building and added greatly to its brightness. The girls' dormitory was being painted at the time of my visit. The work was being done by one of the staff and two boys.\n\nI visited the various departments and found a competent person in charge. The girls receive a good training in cooking, butter making, sewing, and general housekeeping. The boys are taught all general farm work and gardening.\n\nFire drill was held at 6 A.M. and the children and staff were out of the building in five minutes. The staff were not aware that the alarm would be given. I also tested the fire hose and checked the various fire extinguishers. All were filled and in good condition. Under separate cover, I reported that one fire alarm bell did not ring and asked for authority to have same repaired.\n\nThis school is of frame construction and every precaution should be taken against fire. The water pressure could be improved by changing the system and pumping direct\npumping direct to the main water pipe which feeds the fire hose. This would give a better flow of water and would not be effected should a break occur in the plumbing throughout the building. To change this would entail a small expense of perhaps thirty to forty dollars as several feet of 1\u00bd\" pipe and two valves would be required. The engineer claims he can do the necessary work.\n\nIn view of the enrolment and the frame construction of the building, I feel a night watchman should be provided and a punch clock installed with at least eight stations. No doubt a reliable man could be obtained from the town of Elkhorn for $25. or $30. per month. His services would perhaps not be needed for more than six months and would be the best protection we could give against fire hazard. The Rev. Canon Wickens would appreciate this added safeguard, but pointed out that the school was not in a financial position to pay the extra salary. I would be glad if the Department could see fit to incur the added expense.\n\nThe farm crop was practically nil and already feed is being purchased for the stock. The garden was also a failure, as well as the potato crop. These extra demands on the grant have been a heavy drain and made financing very difficult.\n\nThe cows are in fair condition, but at present most of them are dry. There are twenty-five head, some of which will soon freshen.\n\nThe horses are thin, but receiving good care.\n\nThe school\nThe school is badly in need of two wagons. There is at present one wagon belonging to the school and that is only in fair condition. It is necessary to continually borrow, which is unsatisfactory at an institution of this kind. A lot of teaming is done in connection with the hauling of coal and feed and extra equipment should be provided.\n\nThe children appear well fed and attached is the menu followed during the week of my visit. The menu is quite varied and I believe carefully followed. The children, I understand, receive all the bread they desire and the supervisor in charge of the bakery stated she baked an average of 150 loaves per day. The Matron, Nurse Morrice, prepares the menu and sees that same is followed.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and well aired. The toilets were all in good repair, the bedding clean, and the beds neatly made. One dormitory could be greatly improved by cutting two or three more windows on the one side. This would allow for more light and better ventilation. The dormitory is on the third floor and the wall is frame, sheeted outside with tin.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Wickens was new to the Indian work when he took charge of the Elkhorn School. He is greatly interested and desirous of making his school rank among the best.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, December 5, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your 209-11 of the 29th ultimo, reporting on your recent visit to the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the pipe and valves required to improve the water pressure. It is noted that the expenditure in this regard will not exceed $40.\n\nYou may authorize the Principal to engage a night watchman for the period December 15, 1934, to April 15, 1935. Payment will be allowed at the rate of $30 a month. Vouchers should be issued from time to time and they should be prepared in the manner shown on the enclosed form.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection I would like to be advised if it is not possible to install a night watchman's punch clock. In most cases where night watchmen are employed, without some means of checking them up, I find that they spend most of their time in the furnace room where it is warm and where they can quite comfortably sleep away the hours of the night. This was my feeling in relation to the night watchman at the McKay Indian Residential School and I think I pointed this out in my last report on the school dated March 22nd, 1933.\n\nI am very much concerned in connection with the fire hazard at the Elkhorn School and would appreciate knowing if the Department are in position to install the suggested clock.

This voucher is in payment for work done in connection with the fire alarm bell at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School and was authorized by Department Letter 106-0-5 dated December 1st, 1934.\n\nAlthough Mr. Forster is a first-class electrician, he has not been able to get the fire alarm bells operating properly. It was discovered that the alarm bell on the first floor would ring if the one in the bakery in the basement was disconnected. I have therefore instructed Canon Wickers to disconnect the one in the bakery, in view of the fact that the bakery is in the basement and the exit is easily made, either by door or window. Canon Wickers states that he has been informed that the hall bell in question never did ring and it is possible that the wiring in connection with these bells should be renewed. The electrician also suggests that a new transformer might step the current up sufficient to ring all the bells.\n\nEither of these undertakings would cost considerable money and before entailing any further expense, I thought it best to place the matter before the Department and will await instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

The hall bell does not ring and the experiment of deadening the bakery bell to release power for the hall bell did not prove to be satisfactory.\n\nI believe that we should change the present transformer to the 100 watt size and get the Virden expert to make the necessary resistor.\n\nIt looks as if the total price should not be more than $15.00 and if our own engineer can install there should be no other costs. Our engineer, I might say is a very capable man, and I have confidence in his ability to handle the job.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) S. J. Wickens\n(Principal)\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of January 25th, 1935, and now enclose copy of one received from Canon Wickens, Principal of the Anglican Indian Residential School at Elkhorn. I am afraid Canon Wickens' estimate of $15,000 is low and I doubt if it will cover the cost of the work necessary.\n\nThe bells should be made to operate and I would ask for authority to incur the necessary expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School respecting the fire alarm bells at the school.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange with the Principal to have these bells placed in a satisfactory condition. It is noted that the Principal suggests a change in the present transformer. Any supplies required should be purchased, and the school engineer should carry out the work of installing the equipment. All cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nAccounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 26, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 18th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Principal of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, in which he requests that two wagons and a binder be purchased, for use on the school farm.\n\nIn this connection might I state that the following amounts are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year:\n\nElectric refrigerator for the dairy - $600.\nPainting and general repairs - $500.\n\nNo funds were provided to purchase farm equipment. If, after you discuss the matter with the Principal, it is considered that the two farm wagons are more urgent than expending the funds provided for painting and repairs, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of two wagons, from a firm on the approved list. If the purchase is made, you should obtain an account, in duplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the providing of cold storage equipment and any minor repairs and painting, I would request that you inform the Department of the approximate cost of the cold storage equipment where same could be installed and also that you will state in detail the minor repairs and painting that could be carried out for the balance of the appropriation after the purchase of the wagon.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of a binder, the Department is prepared to authorize the expenditure required, as it is considered that the school authorities should be able to purchase this equipment, especially if the crop turns out as well as anticipated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This leaves a balance of $240.30.\n\nThe jacket heater has been leaking badly for some weeks and the fire pot should be renewed. Canon Wickens states the heater was purchased from the Peace Western Foundry, of Winnipeg, and that the cost of the necessary repair will be approximately $75.00. This further reduces our amount to approximately $165.30.\n\nThe machine shed doors should be re-hung, and the track and hangers necessary will cost approximately $65.00.\n\nThe balance of the $500 should be used in the purchase of paint, most of which will be used on the outside buildings. When the barns were painted some years ago, there was apparently a shortage of shingle stain and the roof of the main barn was never completed. A quantity of red paint is also needed for the walls.\n\nIf these expenditures meet with the Department's approval, I would like to have authority by wire in order that the work may be carried out at once, especially in connection with the jacket heater.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.G.

The Department notes, further, your recommendation that the balance - approximately $100.00 - be used in the purchase of paint for the outside buildings. It is thought that, possibly, this will not be sufficient to purchase the quantity of paint required, and, as advised in telegram above referred to, if necessary, you may incur a further expense of $100.00 in excess of the $500.00 which you were informed was available, in the purchase of paint.\n\nIt is understood that the staff of the school will perform the labour in connection with the painting, without expense to the Department.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, covering all expenditures, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nWhen you have full information regarding the cold storage equipment, the Department will be pleased to receive particulars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, November 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is informed that there is surplus to requirements in the powerhouse at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, a 25 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse \"Y\" horizontal engine. The Anglican School at Onion Lake, Sask., is in need of a new engine to operate the lighting plant, and it has occurred to the Department that the engine at Elkhorn would be satisfactory for the purpose. I would request that, at your early convenience, you will have the engine referred to, at the Elkhorn School, examined, and, if you consider it is in fair condition, you might have any necessary repairs made and arrange to ship the engine, addressed to Rev. Henry Ellis, Lloydminster, Sask.\n\nAny expense, in connection with overhauling and placing the engine in good condition, and also the transportation charges will be paid, upon receipt of vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, who visited the Onion Lake C.E. Residential School, has drawn the Department's attention to the need of a new engine, and he is being informed of the engine that is surplus to requirements at Elkhorn. I would request that, after examination of the engine at Elkhorn, if you consider it satisfactory, that you will inform Mr. Murison. The Department will leave the matter in your hands, in the hope that it will be possible to utilize the engine at Elkhorn at the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to Department Letter 106-0-5 dated November 5th, and to say that I visited the Elkhorn Indian Residential School in company with Mr. Moore from the Manitoba Power Commission Station at Virden. Mr. Moore checked over the engine and stated that it needed a thorough overhauling and new piston rings. He recommended that, if possible, I secure the services of Mr. Jim Read, of Virden. He stated Mr. Read thoroughly understood that particular type of engine and was a reliable man.\n\nI interviewed Mr. Read on my return to Virden and he agreed to do the work. Mr. Read requested 50\u00a2 per hour for his own time and 25\u00a2 per hour for his helper. The repair work will perhaps require two or three days and it will take about the same length of time to load the engine. This is a very heavy engine and a lot of work is required in removing it from its present location. The generator will need to be moved, as well as a large cement slab on which it rests. The door casings and also a portion of the wall will have to be taken out. It will be necessary to procure proper skids and securely fasten the engine to them.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Wickens will more or less supervise the work and I have the assurance of all that the expense will be kept as low as possible. I have already ordered the piston rings, which will be in Elkhorn today, and, if all goes well, the engine should be loaded by the end of the week.\n\nWhen the work is completed, the vouchers will be forwarded immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nIn view of the fact that the engine is being removed from the power house at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, I think the Department should consider the advisability of disposing of the generator and switchboard.\n\nThe generator is No. D9807A, Type FF. This is a very large generator and I imagine cost several hundred dollars. The switchboard is from Ferguson Paulin Limited, Equipment Specialists, Toronto. It is in good condition and is an expensive piece of equipment.\n\nIf these could be used at some other institution, even at a later date, I think it would be well to have them shipped as soon as possible. However, if they are of no further use in the Department, it might be well, if permission could be secured, to sell them. Rev. Canon Wickens is very anxious to make use of the power house building for a class room and this will be dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nA reply in connection with the disposition of the above equipment will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nSince the McKay Indian Residential School was burned down, the pupilage at the Elkhorn School has increased. The junior classroom is greatly overcrowded and Canon Wickens states it is practically impossible to carry on the work with the two classrooms now in use. He states in a letter that the Church of England Commission is ready to send a third teacher as soon as a classroom can be made ready.\n\nThe old power house is well located. It is of brick construction and Canon Wickens estimates that it will cost approximately $345.00 to equip and remodel the building to make a suitable classroom. Of the $345. estimated, $100. of this is for remodelling and decorating the room. The balance is to provide the necessary equipment, including desks.\n\nThis additional classroom is certainly needed and I know of no cheaper way of providing the necessary space. I would like to be advised if funds are available to carry out the suggested alterations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 7)\nOttawa, December 6, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 26th ultimo, relative to the fitting up of an additional classroom in the old power house at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds available during the present fiscal year to remodel and decorate the room and supply desks.\n\nI have also your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the advisability of disposing of the generator and switch board that was used in connection with the lighting system at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. At present, the Department is not aware of any other residential school requiring this equipment. The Principal should arrange to see that the switch board and generator are properly stored, as it may be possible, at a later date, to arrange for their transfer to some other residential school.\n\nIn disposing of surplus equipment, the property of the Government, it is necessary that the arrangements for the sale be made by the Chief Salvage Officer, Ottawa. Later, if we are unable to use this equipment, the matter could be referred to the Salvage Officer to arrange for either the disposal to some other government department or for the sale of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Canon Wicken's letter dated the 11th instant:\n\n\"This refrigerator has been working for about one week and we find that it is functioning satisfactorily. We were advised that it might be necessary to adjust the working of the machine so that it would step down to a lower temperature. These adjustments have been made and the response has been satisfactory. We shall find the equipment a valuable addition to our plant.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nFourth Floor, Commercial Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton:\n\nI have received your letter of the 10th instant and deeply regret that the Department has no funds available during the present fiscal year to provide the extra class-room at our Alkorn School.\n\nIn view of the urgency of this need, which is, I believe, very well known to you, I have been authorized to say that our Commission will advance the money required to fix up the power house for class-room purposes, from January 1st next, if the Department will undertake to refund the amount thus spent, as soon as their appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-37 is available. It is estimated by the Principal that the amount required will be approximately $345.00.\n\nI commend this offer to the favourable consideration of your Department, and remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to Department Letter No. 106-0-5 dated December 5th, and now enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Dr. Westgate.\n\nThere is no doubt that the classroom work at the Elkhorn School is made very difficult, due to overcrowding. The Church authorities are apparently willing to finance the necessary improvements, providing they have definite assurance that they will be re-imburied during the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe estimate of $345.00, as submitted by the Rev. S. J. Wickens, is, I consider, low. I am quite sure the cost will be in the neighbourhood of at least $450.\n\nI do not know if the Department are prepared to assume this responsibility, but would like to be advised in order that I may reply to Dr. Westgate's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 17, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., requesting that an additional classroom be fitted up in the old powerhouse at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost of the repairs required and the furnishings.\n\nIn this connection I would say the Department finds that it will be possible to provide funds, to an amount not exceeding $460, in remodelling and equipping the building for classroom purposes. I have therefore to request that you will arrange for the purchase, from the proper source of supply, of any materials required and for any labour other than that which can be carried out by the staff of the school.\n\nYou should have the Principal prepare a list, stating the desks that will be required and the size and the number of each size. It would be advisable to arrange the desks in rows of the same size desk and request that a front and rear seat be supplied. Purchase of the equipment will be arranged from here. The length and width of the blackboard required and any classroom material should also be given.\n\nAfter the work in remodelling and placing the classroom in readiness for the furnishings is completed, you should forward itemized accounts in triplicate properly certified, covering the cost. These accounts should reach the Department not later than the end of March, next, in order that payment can be made from our Appropriation for the present fiscal year.\n\nIn fitting up this additional classroom, it is distinctly understood that the church authorities will arrange for a qualified teacher and for payment of salary. The entire expense in the fitting up and furnishing of the classroom is not to exceed the sum of $460.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

Canon Wickens, to have the necessary work done in connection with the classroom.\n\nThe material and work in connection with this we estimated would cost approximately $225., leaving $225. for the purchase of equipment.\n\nOn January 31st, I received a letter from Canon Wickens, enclosing a list of equipment required. He stated that, owing to the severe cold weather, they had not been able to do any work in connection with the classroom. It was necessary to remodel the door of this building and transfer the electrical fixtures to another building. This called for considerable outside work, which it was impossible to do when the thermometer registered from 20 to 40 below zero.\n\nIn his last letter, Canon Wickens was of the opinion that the expense could be kept within the amount suggested and requested that the list be forwarded. I have just had a phone call today from Canon Wickens, and as the weather has now become milder, he expected to have the work completed within the next eight or ten days.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAttached is the list of supplies requested and I trust these will be purchased and forwarded to the school as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

C.E., of the 2nd instant, submitting a list of desks, blackboard, etc., required to fit up an additional classroom in the old power house at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order for the desks will be placed here, and a requisition is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to supply the quantity of blackboard, with necessary moulding and chalk trough. These will be shipped to the Principal's address.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a stove - McLarty's \"Mascot\", at the price mentioned, viz.: $49.50. You should forward the account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Should any stove pipe be required, it should also be obtained.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal is taking steps to remodel and fit up the classroom and is removing the electrical fixtures to another building. I would request that you have all accounts covering the expense forwarded in time to reach the Department before the end of the present month, in order that payment can be made from the appropriation before our books close for the current fiscal year. I may add that the account covering the cost of the desks will be sent you. Please attach it to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Canon Wickens. The bill from the electricians was almost double that estimated. It was necessary to get a man from Brandon as the Virden electrician did not wish to undertake the work. Unexpected expenditures arose, due to new material being required. As the work was started, it was necessary to complete the job.\n\nThe following is a list of expenses incurred, with the exception of the blackboard, the bills for which did not pass through this office.\n\n| Vr. | Description                  | Amount   |\n|-----|------------------------------|----------|\n| 66  | Boyd Electric                | $49.00   |\n| 67  | Chas.

It is noted that the accounts for the work amount to the sum of $405.45, and they have been passed for payment.\n\nIt is also noted that the necessary brick work in connection with the door has not been completed and that it will not be possible to have this work done before the end of the present fiscal year.

Wickens (Principal)\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from the Rev. Canon Wickens, in which he states that the runway for the water of the septic tank at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School is badly perished and most of the liquid is deposited between the new classroom and the waste ground. He states he has had the trough patched at various times with some old eavetroughing, but the whole frame work should be re-built.\n\nI was at the school last week and agree with Canon Wickens that this work should be carried out and, indeed, as soon as possible. In his letter, he suggests using open galvanized troughing. However, in discussing this with Mr. Yates, of Brandon, he is of the opinion that the liquid may have some acid effect and the trough would probably rust through quickly. I would recommend that we continue to use the wood. The runway is 320 ft. in length and even the posts will need to be renewed. The cost for the material and labour will be approximately $125.\n\nI would appreciate having the necessary instructions in order that the work may be carried out at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11A C.E. of the 19th instant, regarding the repairs required to the runway for the water of the septic tank at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $125.00 for material and labour in repairing the runway, using a wood trough. You may arrange for the purchase of the material and labour and have the septic tank placed in a satisfactory condition. The Department agrees with you that galvanized troughing would rust through in a short time and that wood troughing would be more serviceable and lasting.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the material and for the labour that it is necessary to employ, over and above what the school staff can perform. The number of days or hours the labour is employed and the rate paid should be stated.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the sum of $400.00 is available in our Appropriation for carrying out miscellaneous repairs, etc., to this school. After deducting the cost of repairing the septic tank, there would remain approximately the sum of $275.00; and, if any other minor repairs are required to the school, I should be pleased if you would advise the Department, stating in detail what the Principal and yourself would recommend, the material and labour required and the approximate cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

We have already incurred the following expenses:--material and labor in repairing the runway from the septic tank, $125; in replacing the liquid receiver in the Kelvinator Condensing Unit damaged by frost, $44.32; a total of 169.32.\n\nI have just received a letter from the Rev.

He says that all the buildings are now painted except two cottages and these cottages are badly in need of paint, and I would recommend that the work be carried out.\n\nCanon Wickens is willing to do the work and the paint to do the cottages and finish the implement shed will cost approximately $120.

HAMILTON DATED DECEMBER 8, 1937, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ELKHORN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe fire escapes are all in good condition and extinguishers are placed in convenient places throughout the building. The doors leading to the escapes were locked and there was considerable delay in securing a key to fit. The Principal is much concerned and wishes this changed. He is willing to have the engineer install a bell system, but requests the Department to provide the material. I would recommend that this request be granted. The material will cost approximately $50.\n\nThe building throughout was clean, and I consider the school well managed. The staff sitting room should be refurnished. The rug is worn out and unfit for further use and the chairs will hardly hold together; in fact, the chair which looks most inviting should be discarded as the springs rest on the floor. A chesterfield, six chairs, and a rug are needed. The staff spend their spare time in the sitting room, which is as it should be. It creates a good spirit and tends to prevent the forming of groups. I would recommend that authority be granted to make the necessary purchases, at an approximate cost of $150.\nOttawa, December 23rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your report of the 8th instant regarding the Elkhorn Indian Residential School, you may have a bell system installed for the doors leading to the fire escapes. It is noted that the material will cost approximately $50.00 and that the work will be done by the school staff. The fire escape doors should be kept unlocked while the dormitories are occupied.\n\nIn connection with your recommendation for refurnishing the staff sitting room, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery, from a firm on the approved list, of the articles of furniture that you consider necessary, at a cost not exceeding $150.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir:\n\nI was in Elkhorn last week and, while there, examined the pump in connection with the Indian Residential School.\n\nThe pump was made by the Economy Pumping Machinery Co., Chicago, and is called \"Economy\". It is a triple plunger type and I am unable to get any information here with regard to repairs. The pump has been in use many years and the repairs required, I am told, will cost at least $100.00. The crank shaft should be removed and sent in to be machined and this will involve added expense. This pump weighs from 1,000 to 1,200 lbs. and undoubtedly is out of date, which fact makes it more expensive to keep in repair.\n\nFairbanks-Morse state a new pump will cost very little more and they quote on 1 - 2500 gal. per hour Fairbanks-Morse self-oiling Typhoon Pump with 16\" pulley for flat belt drive, suction tapped for 2\u00bd\" pipe - discharge for 2\" pipe; speed of pump 215 RPM - weight 306 lbs. Price F.O.B. Winnipeg $174.00 less 15% = $147.90.\n\nThe vertical shaft in the septic tank will break any day and should be renewed. This will cost approximately $15.00.\n\nAn immediate reply in connection with these matters will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 27, 1937.\n\nA. G.

I examined some of the pipe which was being dug up while I was at the school last week and it is rusted through in many places and will need to be renewed. The following is a list of pipe required and the price will be approximately $115.00:\n\n- 350 ft. Galv. Iron Pipe 2\"\n- 4 only \" Standard Unions (Female) 2\"\n- 4 \" \" Tees, 2\"\n- 4 \" \" Square Head Plugs, 2\"\n\nI would appreciate having authority to make the necessary purchase in order that the work may be completed at once. I might say that the pipe will be buried almost 2 ft. deeper, which will entail considerable work on the part of the staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[A. G.

One of the seams running lengthwise along the tank is also opened and there is evidence of considerable rusting. Although the second tank is now in use, it also shows signs of rusting and it is doubtful how long it will last. The tanks are approximately 4 ft. x 16 ft.\n\nIt is, of course, difficult to know how badly these tanks are pitted and I would suggest that Mr. Yates of Brandon be sent to investigate and submit a report. It may be possible to repair the tank but on the other hand, the only solution may be a new one. The situation should receive immediate attention and I think expert advice should be obtained.\n\nI would be glad to know the Department's wishes in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

If at all possible the tank at present out of order should be repaired as our funds at the present time are so limited that it is not possible to consider purchase of a new tank.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nActing on your letter of Feb 15/38, I proceeded to Elkhorn Residential School, to inspect the Pressure Tank, and beg to report as follows:\n\nThere are two 48\" x 16 foot Pressure Tanks installed with 5/16 shell, 3/8 heads, longitudinal seams double riveted, Heads single riveted with 72 rivets in each Head. No Manholes.\n\nJust when these Tanks were installed, I was not able to ascertain, but it can be assumed they were put in about 1915.\n\nThey have not been kept painted, because it would be impossible to get under them, due to the position in which they are placed, and Tanks used for this purpose usually sweat badly, but damage caused by rust, and age, do not show to any great extent on the outside.\n\nThe trouble here is a concave head, reversed to a convex, by excess pressure, and a leak along one longitudinal seam.\n\nThe Head was reversed about Feb 3rd, in the afternoon, while the Pump was running. When this happened it ruptured the caulking, and badly strained the rivets on that end, causing it to leak.\n\nI inspected the Safety Valve and found it stuck tight, and altogether too small for the size of the Pump, so even if it had been working it would not be large enough. In any case it is not the proper type for this kind of work.\n\nA new Pump was installed about Jan 1st this year, and is connected up properly as far as the piping is concerned.\n\nIt is a Fairbanks twin cylinder Pump of 2500 gall capacity per hour, 2\u00bd\" suction and 2\" discharge.\n\nThis Pump is provided only with a tight Pully, this means that the Pump is running any time the Laundry is\noperating unless the belt is off. Had this Pump been provided with a tight and loose Pully, it would not have to have the belt thrown off. This of course can be explained by the fact that it was originally run by a Gasoline Engine, which was discontinued in favor of Electric current supplied by the Manitoba Power Commission. The whole plant now being run by a 5 H.P Electric Motor.\n\nWhen the Pump only is operating, this Motor is large for the Pump, but provides the power necessary to produce excess pressure without warming up the Motor. Pressure has been noted up to 100 lbs, but must have been over that to reverse the Head.\n\nOnly one pressure Gauge is installed, and it has not been tested in three years. There really should be two Gauges where so much depends on it.\n\nYou could, perhaps, carry on here till Summer with one Tank, but the Fire protection is decreased just that much, and pumping has to be done twice as often.\n\nThey are operating now on a single Tank, but the Pump must be watched carefully. Had this Pump been supplied with a separate Motor and Automatic Control, the trouble would not have happened, even now you could carry on indefinitely with the one Tank if this new Pump had been supplied that way.\n\nThe Tank can be repaired by Electric Welding, the caulking, and also any rivets that may be sprung, also the side seam, at a cost of;-\n\nONE HUNDRED & FIFTEEN DOLLARS..........................$115.00\n\nIt would be necessary to send heavy welding equipment from Brandon. The Tank would have to be disconnected, raised, and moved ahead, over the Pump, in order to get room to work at it.\n\nThis could possibly be done for less if the roads were open so that a truck could be used.\n\nIf this Tank is repaired, pressure would have to be reduced to 75 lbs to conform to Provincial regulations respecting Air Tanks, but this pressure would be adequate for the Schools requirements.\n\nA new Tank installed with Manhole would cost;-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 8)\nFIVE HUNDRED & FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS & FIFTY CENTS....$548.50\n\nTo put in a new Head would cost approximately:\n\nONE HUNDRED & NINETY FIVE DOLLARS..................$195.00\n\nWould also recommend that a Mueller Diaphragm 2\" Relief Valve could be installed at a cost of;.................................$48.00\n\nOr an 1\u00bd\" Relief Valve for..............................$30.00\n\nAnd an extra Gauge (Pressure) be supplied at a cost of $8.00.\n\nAutomatic Pressure Control on the present Motor, Control (5. H.P.) could be installed for..........................$45.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\nYates, Neale & Co.\n\nper...\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 106-0-5 dated February 11th, and enclose herewith letter from Mr. Yates, dealing with the pressure tank at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will note that Mr. Yates states the trouble is 'there is a concave head reversed to convex, by excess pressure, and a leak along one longitudinal seam'. It is also pointed out that the safety valve was found to be stuck tight and altogether too small for the size of the pump.\n\nMr. Yates gives several options and, taking the lowest, it will cost approximately $200.00 to repair the pressure tank and fit it with a relief valve, pressure gauge and pressure control.\n\nI would appreciate your returning Mr. Yates' letter together with your instructions as I have forwarded the original, in order to avoid any delay.\n\nVoucher will be forwarded to the Department concerning expense and charges made by Mr. Yates in connection with this investigation.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised of the Department's wish in connection with the above tank.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

This school has been short of mattresses for some years and at times have been obliged to substitute straw filled ticks. There is also a shortage of beds, and if a child is sick, it is necessary to bring both the child and the bed to the infirmary. Mr. Minchin requests that he be supplied with a half dozen institutional beds, size 36 x 72.\n\nThese requests are all quite reasonable and supplies mentioned are badly needed.\n\nI would recommend, if funds are available, that the purchase be made.

It will be quite large and fairly deep at one end. In my opinion, the pool will be a constant source of worry and I am not prepared to recommend any expense. In fact, I do not think the pool should be completed, especially in its present location. The pupils are mostly away during the hot months of July and August, which makes the undertaking less necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

In this letter he gives the size of the pool and location, which you will note is ten feet from the side of the building.\n\nKindly advise if funds are available and if the construction of the pool is to be completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

G. Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of the 11th instant re suggestion of a swimming pool. We are planning for a pool 50 ft. long and 25 ft. wide. The depth to graduate from 5 ft. in the deep end to 2 ft. in the shallow. The location to be behind the south wing of the main building and parallel to the dining hall. It will thus be enclosed on these two sides, and leave a space of about 22 ft. between the south wing and the end of the pool and about ten ft. between the side of the pool and the building running east and west.\n\nMany of our children come from reserves situated on the banks of a river or the shores of a lake where they can swim during the summer months. Here there is no suitable swimming place within reach; and as so many of our children cannot get home for the holidays, I feel that they should have some safe place where they can swim.\n\nI do hope the Department will sanction this pool and that they will make us a grant towards the cost of material.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nArthur E. Minchin (signed)\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant enclosing copy of letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Elkhorn Indian residential school with reference to his idea of building a swimming pool.\n\nIt is considered that a pool of the kind suggested by the Principal would be a constant source of worry. In addition it is extremely doubtful if such a pool should be built owing to the probability that it would be difficult to prevent contamination. Besides, if the water were changed at frequent intervals a very large volume of water would be used. Taking everything into consideration the Department feels that it would be undesirable for the Principal of the Elkhorn school to construct a swimming pool.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Just what condition the rest of the other fourteen water grates were in was not ascertained, but they must be partly filled up and all should be replaced if this boiler is continued in use. We cannot conscientiously recommend the repairing for use of this boiler as it is entirely inadequate for this job and even if in good condition would not do the work required of it economically.\n\nA stoker of a size to suit the requirements of the building, not sized according to the size of the boiler, would add about 20% to the power of the boiler and during most of the year would enable the use of cheaper coal.\n\nIf it is your desire to repair this boiler and add a stoker, you could add about 20% to the efficiency of the boiler and would make a saving in fuel and make more heat for the building. We would strongly recommend installing a new steel locomotive return flue type of boiler with 600 square feet of heating surface. This installation would result in a saving of at least 50% in the cost of fuel used to heat the building. This boiler to be provided with special openings to take the present mains. The most of the heating surface in these boilers is above the fire and is contained in the flue surface. With this type of boiler there is 54 inches of combustion space above the grates. This provides space for complete combustion of the coal before leaving the fire box.\n\nThe locomotive return flue type we recommend as being a better boiler because where this boiler has 54 inches of space above the grates, the Simplex Type has but 34 inches and cast iron boilers built for Pennsylvania hard coal have but 24 to 28 inches.\n\nAny hot water system can be improved, both in efficiency of operation and consumption of coal by the addition of mechanical circulation, that is, installing in the return line an electrical driven propeller type of circulating pump. This applies both to the present boiler installation and also to any new boiler installation.\n\nWe have found that it is as important to keep the cold out as it is to supply heat to the building, and in our survey of this building we find that there is considerable heat loss due to the construction of the mansard roof - this should be insulated. We also noted that on the first two floors all ventilators are open from the ceiling only, this of course should be from the floor in order to reduce heat loss.\n\nWe estimate that the repairs required on the present boiler would cost - $350.00. Make up of $200.00 (Material) and $150.00 (Labour).\n\nA guaranteed stoker for this heating system to burn Lignite or any coal would cost - $1,300.00.\n\nTo install complete a 54\" x 11-7 Steel Locomotive Return Flue Hot Water Boiler fitted with special openings to suit present piping, the cost would be - $2,125.00. Built to steam specification, less trimmings.\n\nOn this particular system, two 3\" Circulating Pumps would be installed with By Passes and all Electric Wiring complete, for the sum of $450.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nYATES, NEALE & CO.,\nPer \"Jas. E. Yates\".\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, August 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School,\nElectoral District of Brandon.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 1st asking that an inspection be made of the heating system at the above mentioned school and a report submitted as to the condition of the same and giving an estimate of the cost of the work which should be done to overcome the present unsatisfactory heating situation.\n\nAs it was realized that only a specialist on heating could adequately outline the present heating situation at the school and advise as to what was necessary, we arranged with Mr. Yates of Yates, Neale and Company, Brandon, to accompany an engineer from this office on the inspection trip. The services of Mr. Yates were voluntary and gratis to the Government.\n\nI am enclosing a memorandum from Mr. Rose of this office, who accompanied Mr. Yates to the site, and I am also enclosing a report by Mr. Yates regarding the heating situation at the school. You will observe that Mr. Yates estimates that it will cost $350.00 to repair the present boiler. This repair job would enable the institution to carry on for a few years under the unsatisfactory heating that they have experienced.\n\nMr. Yates also estimates that a guaranteed stoker to be used in conjunction with the repaired boiler would add $1,300.00 to the cost of the work and would enable the school to utilize a much cheaper grade of coal, namely, Souris Lignite, and the result would be a considerable saving on the fuel bill.\n\nBoth Mr. Rose and Mr. Yates and the District Boiler Inspector consider that the present boiler should be replaced by a unit more suitable for the heating of this institution. The particular boiler recommended by Mr. Yates would cost $2,125.00 and he recommends that more satisfactory results could be obtained with this new unit if circulating pumps were installed at an additional cost of $450.00. Should it be considered advisable to proceed with the installation of the new boiler with circulating pumps, it would also be very advisable to install either a mechanical stoker or a blower system. If I can remember correctly, a stoker is not provided at the Brandon Indian School but a blower was installed at small cost and added greatly to the efficiency of the heating system at Brandon.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nYou say in your letter that expensive repairs are required to the heating system at the above school and that an amount of $1,500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation of the Indian Affairs Branch for that purpose. You will, of course, realize that the Indian Affairs Branch were fully aware of the condition at this institution and must have also realized that an amount of $1,500.00 would be entirely inadequate to place the heating system in a satisfactory condition. I think it would be advisable to refer the situation back to the Indian Affairs Branch to determine as to whether or not an additional advance could be obtained so as to provide this school with an adequate heating system. A new boiler with circulating pumps would cost in the vicinity of $2,500.00. Whether or not a mechanical stoker would be necessary, the writer is not prepared at present to say but if a stoker is not installed it would be necessary to have installed a blower so that low grades of Souris Lignite Coal could be utilized.\n\nIt is my intention to make inquiries with respect to the operation of the heating system at Brandon School and also to make inquiries of individuals familiar with heating equipment, and at a later date will advise as to the necessity of the installation of a mechanical stoker. I hope to have this additional information available in about a week's time, but in the meantime I would appreciate learning whether or not the Indian Affairs Branch can find the necessary funds to install a new heating unit.\n\nShould the Indian Affairs Branch not be able to raise the necessary additional funds, you have the recommendation of Messrs. Yates and Neale, that the present boiler be repaired and a mechanical stoker installed. This could probably be done at a cost somewhat higher than the money which is said to be available. It might be pointed out, however, that this outlay would not provide an adequate heating system for this school and would probably enable them to carry on for a few years under the present existing unsatisfactory heating situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) D.B. Gow\n\nD.B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. GOW:\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School - Heating System.\n\nOn August 9th the writer, accompanied by Mr. J.E. Yates, Heating Specialist of the firm of Yates, Neale & Company of Brandon, visited the Elkhorn Indian Residential School for the purpose of obtaining information for a report on the heating system.\n\nThe school is a three-storey T-shaped structure with the facade or top of T facing southeast. The basement has masonry walls and its floor is only about two feet below ground level. Most of the three-storey superstructure is faced with a veneer of brick except for the third storey. On the sides of the main section of the mansard roofed third storey, the exterior is shingled. The plan shows the area to be 7,027 square feet. The walls show no sign of cracking and except for some looseness of mortar in the foundation, the walls are in good condition. However, the building is exposed to the sweep of winds of the prairie, only partly broken by low tree growths to the northwest. The heating plant is located in the southeast corner of the building.\n\nIt was found that radiation and piping of the hot water system was adequate for this type of heating but the present type of boiler was considered unsuitable and not adapted for economical burning of Western coals. The boiler was also in need of repair. The cold weather heating was reported by the Resident Engineer as very difficult in windy weather, when the boiler had to be forced and even then comfortable conditions could not be maintained in the most exposed sections of the building. The engineer reported as much as ten carloads or about $5,800.00 worth of Drumheller coal had been used in a season. Mr. Yates considered this most excessive.\n\nTwo main alternatives were considered. Firstly, the boiler could be repaired and a stoker installed to provide for use of cheaper coal and better combustion. Secondly, a new boiler of greater capacity and better efficiency was considered. In addition to these alternatives, Mr. Yates recommends adding circulatory pumps which would provide for better control of distribution of heat and secure better economy. Furthermore, insulation, particularly in the top storey and slight remodelling of the ventilation system, would greatly assist in securing economy.\n\nMr. Yates estimated the cost as follows:\n\n(1) Repair to present boiler ........... 350.00\nStoker Installation .................. 1300.00 $1,650.00\n\n(2) Install Steel Locomotive Boiler... $2,128.00\n\nD.B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water & Power Bureau,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n(1A) or (11A) Install two circulating pumps .......... $450.00.\n\nThe proposal to install circulatory pumps is in line with best practice and economy of operation of the hot water system. While this feature is not essential in this plant, it provides for better control of the hot water flow which is reported as needed in greater volume on the windward side of the building during stormy weather.\n\nThe district boiler inspector was consulted and from him it was learned that the present boiler installation was markedly inadequate and on account of its condition he would consider replacement advisable.\n\nThe estimate of such economy in fuel as expected should result in a saving in two or three years which would be equivalent to the cost of the new boiler and this is sufficient to warrant the recommendation for its installation. For this reason, besides the additional long life capacity for heating provided for, the installation of the new boiler is recommended by the writer.\n\n(sgd) J.T. Rose\n\nWater & Power Engineer, Grade II.\nAugust 10, 1939.\n\nMr. D.B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\n588 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir: Re: - Heating Elkhorn Indian Boarding School.\n\nWe have gone carefully over the heating of this school and beg to report the following.\n\nRadiation.\n\nThe Radiation consists of 4 column radiators with some box coils and ceiling radiation in basement of a pattern used generally about thirty years ago. This radiation is of sufficient amount and apparently in good condition. There is installed a total of ninety-seven (97) radiators containing 6,890 square feet of direct radiation.\n\nWe estimate that the mains would contain about 1,800 square feet of radiation which is partly covered - some of this covering may have to be removed to help heat the basement. We would estimate the complete heating load at 9,000 feet (Hot Water) or a steam load of 5,000.\n\nPiping.\n\nThe piping is a good job and shows no sign of deterioration.\n\nBoiler.\n\nThis boiler is a cast iron sectional, with headers on top and sides, connected with 2\" nipples to each section. All sections except front and back are split in the middle. Made by the Gurney Foundry Company of Toronto - No. 1287-W. Installed we think about twenty to twenty-two years ago and the manufacture of this type discontinued immediately after.\n\nThe rating of this boiler is catalogued at 12,000 feet, but in our opinion should not be rated at more than 6,000 feet, because the heating surface is not available. In proof of this, the Engineer informed us that he is unable to raise the temperature above 120 degrees, even when using Drumheller Coal. He also informed us that they use ten cars of this coal during the season, which means 350 tons of coal.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this boiler is not burning the coal but roasting it and sending the gasses to the chimney unburned.\n\nAnother factor is the condition of the boiler. The cast iron base is partly eaten through and weakened by the action of smoke condensation, due to the low operating temperature of the diving flues in the rear end of the boiler.\n\nSome of the water grates about five, were renewed last year and were found to be partly filled with an accumulation of scale and dirt, due to the very high temperature over\nAugust 22, 1939\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nAttached herewith, for your information, are copies of reports covering the present heating system at the Elkhorn Indian Residential School in the Brandon district.\n\nYou will note that while the existing boiler could be repaired to function, at an estimated cost of $350, our Chief Engineer does not consider its age and general condition warrants this expenditure.\n\nThe estimated cost of a new boiler is $2,128 and the cost of two circulating pumps, which would appear advisable, is estimated at $450.\n\nApparently the present heating system is very inefficient, as evidenced by the large amount of coal that is used.\n\nOur recommendation is that a new boiler be installed and if this is decided upon, we would be glad to draw up specifications for you in the expectation that a suitable boiler could be obtained at a lower price than the estimate given by the engineer.\n\nDirector.\nThis latter alternative would involve a much heavier expenditure than we anticipated and as our funds are limited I am recommending, as mentioned in the first part of this memorandum, an expenditure of $1650.00 only.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School,\nElectoral District of Brandon.\n\nIn my memorandum of July 24, 1939, I advised you that extensive repairs were required to the heating system at the above-mentioned school.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch arranged with Mr. Yates of Yates, Neale and Company to visit Elkhorn with a view to determining what action should be taken toward improving the heating system. A report has now been received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch in which it is stated that a considerable improvement would be effected in the heating system by taking the following action:\n\nRepair present boiler .......... $ 350.00\nInstall stoker .................. 1300.00\n\nTotal $1650.00\n\nFunds are available in the current year's appropriation for the expenditure just mentioned and I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Honourable the Minister to proceed with this work immediately.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch mentioned that the efficiency of the heating system could be still further increased by the installation of a new boiler. This would involve an expenditure of $3120.00 and it would be necessary to install two circulating pumps at a cost of $450.00. In addition it might be necessary to install either a blower or a stoker.\nThis latter alternative would involve a much heavier expenditure than we anticipated and as our funds are limited I am recommending, as mentioned in the first part of this memorandum, an expenditure of $1650.00 only.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Elkhorn Indian Residential School,\nElectoral District of Brandon.\n\nIn my memorandum of July 24, 1939, I advised you that extensive repairs were required to the heating system at the above-mentioned school.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch arranged with Mr. Yates of Yates, Neale and Company to visit Elkhorn with a view to determining what action should be taken toward improving the heating system.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just returned from the Elkhorn School and would like to say that the work on the furnace is well under way and will be completed in a few days. In view of the large amount of water to be heated and the distance this must be forced, Mr. Yates is still of the opinion that circulating pumps may be required.\n\nThe school has 157 pupils enrolled\u2014every bed is filled. There are no beds in the infirmary and if a child is sick it must be moved with its bed to the infirmary. Six complete hospital beds should be provided. The Department is aware that Dr. Johnson submits no bills for his work and therefore receives no pay. I would, however, point out he is most kind and considerate to the children. If necessary he takes them to the Virden hospital, operates and brings them back as soon as they can be moved. Some of the operations are for bone conditions\u2014yet no bill is submitted.

In view of the large amount of water to be heated and the distance this must be forced, Mr. Yates is still of the opinion that circulating pumps may be required.\n\nThe school has 157 pupils enrolled\u2014every bed is filled. There are no beds in the infirmary and if a child is sick it must be moved with its bed to the infirmary. Six complete hospital beds should be provided. The Department is aware that Dr. Johnson submits no bills for his work and therefore receives no pay. I would, however, point out he is most kind and considerate to the children. If necessary he takes them to the Virden hospital, operates and brings them back as soon as they can be moved. Some of the operations are for bone conditions\u2014yet no bill is submitted. I think we should at least equip the school infirmary with proper beds and tables.\n\nThe school is well operated. The sewing room work has greatly increased and the girls are receiving splendid training. One new sewing machine is needed. If funds are available I hope this will be purchased at once.\n\nThe children appeared in good health and were settling down to the regular school work.

It would take about $15.00 worth of this and the Boiler would have to be run as a steam job for at least 2 days.\n\nA total cost of approximately ...............$65.00\n\nAnd we cannot guarantee that it will be a 100% job.\n\nWe can, however, cut this half section out and plug the Headers, this we have been prepared to do ever since we knew that the Boiler was leaking.\n\nIt would lower the Heating Surface of the Boiler about 4 per cent, but the Boiler is still large enough to take care of the Building.\n\nA job of this kind could be done in a comparatively short time, most of the time being taken up in cutting the section loose of Boiler cement and replacing the covering, so as to allow for expansion when the section heats up, which it will do, due to not having water in it.\n\nThe total cost of this job would be approximately $75.00.\n\nWe might add that there are several of these Boilers in the Country with sections cut out. We carry special Plugs in stock for this purpose all the time.\n\nYours very truly,\nYates, Neale & Co.,\nper Jas.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6262, file 578-5, part 8)\nExtract from Inspector Hamilton's report dated Nov. 12, 1940, on the Elkhorn Indian Residential School:\n\nThe tables in the children's dining room need recovering with battleship linoleum. Rev. Minchin had the tables rebuilt and rebolted this summer, and they are now in good condition. I would recommend the purchase of new battleship linoleum (medium quality). Rev. Minchin will arrange for putting it on. Angle metal should also be supplied. There are ten tables, each 3 feet x 12 feet. The total amount of linoleum required is 120 feet in length, 3 feet wide.\n\nThe girls were busy in the laundry, and the work in this department is heavy. The ironing of sheets, pillow cases, towels and other flat pieces is a big task, and many of the children are small. I would recommend the purchase of an electric mangle. The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company can supply one which should be suitable for approximately $75.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nThe water pipes are filling up, especially the small ones, and giving a lot of trouble. The engineer believes this is due to the accumulation of sand in the pressure tanks. There are no manholes in these tanks. Yates, Neale & Company, of Brandon, have offered to install two manholes for $98.00. I am advised that in Winnipeg the usual charge is $50.00 for each manhole. If funds are available this work should be done before some serious damage occurs.\nOttawa,\nNovember 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent report regarding your inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School you may incur an expenditure of $98.00 for manholes in the pressure tanks provided you consider these are necessary.\n\nYou might let me know at what cost you can obtain the linoleum.\n\nMore definite information should be supplied in connection with the mangle. Please quote the catalogue number of this machine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G.

I got in touch with Yates Neale & Co. of Brandon who had installed the stoker and they sent down an Electrician with another Motor to take its place. The Electrician found that coal dust must have in some way been drawn in to the motor. The bearing at one end was cut away through an accumulation of coal dust. This was the pulley end. The bearing at the other end was in good condition and well supplied with oil. The electrician took the damaged motor away and I have a report from Yates Neale & Co. saying that the cost of reconditioning the motor would be almost as great as the purchase of a new one. They sent down a new one which our engineer installed, and we have returned to them the supply motor brought down on November 9th.\n\nI reported my action to Inspector Hamilton on Monday Nov. 11 explaining the urgency of the matter as the heating of the building depends upon the stoker and the furnace cannot be run without it. Inspector Hamilton advised that I should give you all the above particulars when forwarding the vouchers. As you can understand we had to act immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nI attach account covering the cost of a new motor for use at the Elkhorn Residential School. I am advised by the Principal that the motor used to run the furnace stoker broke down and could not be economically repaired. In order to heat the building the installation of a new motor was immediately necessary and the Principal arranged for the purchase of the motor shown on the attached account.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that this account may be paid.

If an ironer were being supplied we would probably have to purchase what is known as a semi-commercial type of ironer the cost of which would be approximately $250.00. It is doubtful if funds to this amount can be made available during the present fiscal year but at any rate I should appreciate having a letter from you stating if you consider it advisable to supply such expensive machinery at the Elkhorn School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

An expenditure of $150.00 was authorized in official letter of the 18th ultimo leaving a balance of $250.00 available.\n\nThe cost of beds and mattresses has increased owing to present conditions and as a result a bed and mattress costs between $18.00 and $20.00. Under these circumstances we can only supply 15 beds and mattresses for this school. I am, therefore, requesting the Purchasing Branch to secure 5 beds, 36\" x 72\", with mattresses, and 7 beds, 30\" x 72\", with mattresses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nRe Grant of $650.00 for Repairs\n\nAfter making a careful survey of our buildings and equipment, I have come to the conclusion that this money could best be used by spending it on the remodelling and repairing of the building formerly used as a gymnasium. I understand that the building has not been used for some years, with the result that it is falling into a state of disrepair.\n\nMy proposal is to have a basement put under the building, and remodel the building itself to make three class-rooms 36' x 18'. The benefits that the School would derive from this plan are numerous.\n\n1. Our present root-cellar is not satisfactory, and a new one will have to be built. Part of the proposed basement could be made into a root-cellar, thus eliminating the expense of building a new one.\n\n2. We have no recreation room apart from the staff sitting room. The children have to spend their free time either in the class rooms or the dormitories and on the stair-ways. One of our most urgent needs is the provision of recreation rooms for the children. This need would be met quite adequately if the old gymnasium were remodelled to make class-rooms, as the two class-rooms in the main building could then be used as recreation rooms.\n\n3. The building now used as the intermediate class-room could be put to good use as a warehouse.\n\n4. The old gymnasium has been a first class building, but if it is not repaired and put to some use it will soon become worthless.\nInspector Hamilton.\n\nUnfortunately our grant will be insufficient to meet the cost of the proposed alterations; however our need of a new root-dellar and recreation rooms is urgent, and I am hoping that the Department will consider the plan sufficiently worth-while to warrant an increased grant.\n\nI am enclosing herewith an estimate of the cost of the proposed alterations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. N. Middleton\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from the Reverend Mr. Middleton, Principal of the Elkhorn School.\n\nThe building referred to as the gymnasium is too good a building to leave neglected. A similar building could not be erected for less than $3,000.00. Remodelled as suggested, it would serve a worth-while purpose.\n\nA root cellar is needed and this could be provided for in part of the basement.\n\nThe children at this school have no place to play except as suggested by the Principal, or in a dark and ill-smelling basement.\n\nIf this work can be done at the figure given I would urge that the extra $458.00 be provided and that Mr. Middleton be allowed to proceed at once with the work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

I am disposed to agree with the Principal, however, that the gymnasium building should be rebuilt. In undertaking this construction, the Principal should keep in mind the fact that provision should be made for vocational instruction for boys and perhaps for girls. Our residential schools are constantly under criticism for their failure to provide practical courses for the pupils, and in view of the acute shortage of skilled labour in the Dominion at the present time, this condition should be remedied at every opportunity. It is our intention, therefore, to have Mr. Doucet make a survey of the residential schools in Manitoba toward the end of this calendar year or the beginning of the next.\n\nI am sending forward to the Purchasing Division a list of the supplies requested by the Principal. I have been wondering if you would suggest to him that the item of $150.00 for labour be, if at all possible, borne either by the school or by the Anglican Commission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to the grant of $650.00 available for repairs, improvements etc., this year at our Elkhorn School, as set forth in your letter of June 30th last, #160-2, I beg to state that I have received a copy of the letter forwarded by the Principal of this School to your Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg, and in which he offers suggestions as to how this money may be expended to the best advantage.\n\nYou will know from previous correspondence that our Commission have keenly desired for some time to have detached class-rooms supplied at this school as well as at some of our other schools, especially those at Onion Lake and Lac la Ronge. Principal Middleton's suggestion that the building originally used as a gymnasium be fitted up and used as class-rooms, with a full-sized basement, part of which could be used as a root cellar, has our Commission's approval as a temporary measure. They have found that, as a general rule, buildings erected for one specific purpose cannot be satisfactorily reconditioned for other purposes, and while in this case the gymnasium building might be made to serve temporarily in the way suggested it could not be considered as a permanently satisfactory arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW:A.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nRe: Repairs, Elkhorn Residential School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant and note with interest your comments on the reconstruction of the gymnasium building at the above-noted school.\n\nI have already written to Inspector Hamilton and intimated to him that we are prepared to proceed with the reconstruction of the building, on the understanding that provision will be made for vocational instruction in either the basement or one of the classrooms of the reconstructed building. This decision is in harmony with the policy of the present Minister, who is seeking earnestly to make the courses at our Indian residential schools increasingly more vocational and practical in character.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hamilton,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have begun work on re-modelling the gymnasium and are at present digging out the basement. I have just learned that the carpenter who made the estimate did not include cement and timbers for the basement. The following will be required:\n\n- Cement, 125 sacks $125.00\n- Lumber - 14' 8\" x 6\" x 7' $35.00\n- Lumber - 3' 8\" x 6\" x 18' $15.00\n\n$175.00\n\nIf it is impossible to procure 8\" timbers, 4 boards 2\" x 8\" might be substituted for each timber.\n\nI suppose it will be necessary to get approval for this expenditure from the Indian Department and to have the supplies ordered through the purchasing agent. However, it would be quicker and easier to obtain these supplies locally, if permission can be obtained to do so.\n\nThese materials are essential and we would like to have them as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"C.N. Middleton\"\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the present time Mr. Hamilton is out of town making an inspection trip covering the Lake Manitoba, Lake St. Martin, Fairford and Little Saskatchewan Reserves, and does not expect to return to Winnipeg until about the 25th instant.

There are three teachers and the pupils appear to be making fair progress in their respective grades. All were neatly dressed and clean in appearance.\n\nThe dining-room has been painted and now is much brighter. The floors are hardwood, but have no filler or finish. I would recommend that these floors be treated with two coats of Tremco penetrain. It will require about five gallons to do this; but the floors will have a good finish and be much easier to keep clean.\n\nThe dormitories were well aired and clean. Two have been painted and the walls and ceiling are now bright and clean.\n\nThe new class-rooms are not in use yet, but should be ready for the fall term in September. This change will provide a nice playroom and reading-room for both the girls and boys. In digging the basement under the proposed new classrooms provision has been made for a large root cellar. The Principal found to his disappointment that some water appeared so it will now be necessary to fill in the excavation at least one foot, after which a cement floor may be required. This cement floor will involve extra expense and he requested that the Department pay for the cement. In view of the circumstances I think this should be allowed.\n\nThe children appear well fed and attached is a copy of the menu followed. You will note the quantities used for one meal are inserted in red. The children receive all the bread...\nthey desire and I found the brown bread very wholesome. Miss Long is a graduate nurse and is the matron. She is greatly interested in the children and gives careful consideration to their food requirements.\n\nThe cattle number thirty head and a fair supply of milk is provided. The milk is served to the children to drink or on porridge or in milk puddings.\n\nThe sewing-room, laundry, kitchen and bakery are well supervised and the girls receive a good training in the work of these departments.\n\nThe Principal's house needs interior decoration badly. To my knowledge no cleaning or decoration has been done for years and the house is dark and dismal. The following is the approximate cost required to do the necessary work:\n\n- 3 gals Satin finish Ivory Enamel $16.50\n- 1 \" Gloss White Enamel 5.50\n- 2 gals Semi-gloss White Enamel 11.00\n- Sanding Floors 15.00\n- Floor Filler - 3 gallons 12.00\n- Wall Paper 45.00\n- Gold-dust for Putty Coat - 2 sacks 2.00\n- Cost of Paper Hanging and Pasteering 75.00\n\nTotal $182.00\n\nThe Rev. Middleton supplied the above figures which I understand he obtained locally. I would recommend that Mr. Middleton be authorized to proceed with the work.\n\nThe farm seeding was well along and they also expect to have a large garden in addition to several acres of potatoes.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Middleton has been at Elkhorn for less than one year. He appears greatly interested in his work and I find him willing and anxious to co-operate in every respect.\n\nI hope funds will be made available to carry out the enclosed recommendations.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, reporting on your recent inspection of the Elkhorn Indian Residential School. The Department approves having the floor in the dining room treated with two coats of Tremco penetrant. It is noted that 5 gallons will be required. It is understood that the work will be done by the school staff, without cost to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the new classrooms, please let me know the amount of cement required. In connection with these classrooms it is regretted that no mention was made in your report regarding manual training activities at this school. If you refer to my letter of September 14, 1942, you will note that an amount of $650.00 was provided in the appropriation for the last fiscal year for repairs and improvements at this school and the major portion of this amount was authorized for rebuilding the gymnasium building. In giving this authority it was distinctly provided that provision should be made for vocational instruction for boys and perhaps for girls. Under these circumstances you will realize our disappointment when you made no mention of any provision having been made as directed. For your information I may also say that on March 4 last we wrote a letter to the Principal of the Elkhorn School requesting a report regarding manual training work covered during the past year. As yet he has not replied to our letter.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Cement for Basement Floor -\nSilkhorn Residential School.\n\nI acknowledge Departmental letter 106-9-5, dated June 7th. The cement required is estimated at one hundred bags. Mr. Middleton states this can be purchased locally for $1.00 per bag.\n\nIn view of the fact that the classrooms had not been completed no manual training classroom was available and so no special course of work has been started. Mr. Middleton hopes to have the new classrooms ready by September 1st, at which time a building will be available for manual training. He has no qualified instructor; but will endeavour to get one. I understand he has written Ottawa direct concerning this matter. If a teacher can be secured some tools will be required.\n\nThe re-modelling of the gymnasium entailed much more work than was anticipated and so was not completed last fall. The boys have assisted in all the work and this has been excellent training and will prove helpful. It's a type of work they enjoy. They have also done most of the interior painting in the school - a further worthwhile training.\n\nI find Mr. Middleton most anxious to co-operate and if he can secure a suitable staff I am sure he will carry out a worthwhile program of work.\n\nA.G.
