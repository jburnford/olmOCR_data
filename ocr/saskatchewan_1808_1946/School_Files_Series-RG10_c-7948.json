Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 3rd, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated January 3rd, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, this JAN 6, 1942.\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Ind. Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at:\n\nAPR 8, 1942\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Ind. Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: C. Perreault\n\nDated: April 5, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 11, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout, Ontario\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 11, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSioux Lookout\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReo.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institution Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 8, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at JAN. 9, 1943\n\nthis...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\n[Handwritten note: VERY POOR COPY]\n| REGISTER Number | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 57              | Robert Lands   | 14  |     |     | Shoal Lake      |                  |                        | March 2, 1930            | 91         | 50                                                                                           |\n| 83              | John Fisher    | 15  |     |     | Salmon River    |                  |                        | Sept 20, 1930            | 91         | 50                                                                                           |\n| 85              | Louis Agopinien| 15  |     |     | G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, October 7, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Michitons Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: OCT 7, 1943\n\nthis Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Ind. Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated October 5, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at OCT 7, 1943\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institutional Ind. Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 6, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

(RG 10, Volume 6210, file 472-2, part 1)**\n\n**Public Archives Canada**\n\n**VERY POOR COPY**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 6, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [McLouth Ind. Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 6, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: Jan 8, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institutionalized Residential School name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at this:\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School name] for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 4th, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: Sioux Lookout\n\nJUL 6 1944\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MacIntosh Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Macleod's Ford Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 5, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: OCT 13, 1944\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: E. Perreault\n\nDated: October 5, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at OCT 18 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3rd, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JAN 5 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Red Butte Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Land Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this APR 5 19...\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 2nd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, this APR 5, 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 1st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JUL 3, 1945\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Michifotok Ind. Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 1st, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, July 3rd, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MacIntosh Band Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 3rd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 3rd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout\n\nJAN 3 1946\n\nthis\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McLeod Lake Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 2nd, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JAN. 8, 19...\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet; paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Moosonee School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal G.M.I.\n\nDated Oct. 7th 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Moiatoeh School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal G.M.T.\n\nDated Oct. 7th 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSIoux Lookout\n\nDated at OCT 14 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REPORT OF THE | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE | DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|---------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 0324          | Mary Linklater | 8   |     | 1    | Deer Lake      | 20 23 25 12 9 1 2 2 | # 86                     | Sept. 4-51                | 107/88     | 1529                                            | 19                  |\n| 0326          | Harriet Asohini| 8   |     | 1    | Lac Seul       | 1                       | # 292                    | \" \" \" \"                   | 92         | Home                                            | 19                  |\n| 0327          | Cecilia M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntoosh School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIOUX LOOKOUT JUL 2 1952 this INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Mcintosh School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal J. W. Smith\n\nDated June 30th 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n**Sioux Lookout Agency**\n\n**McIntosh School**\n\n**McIntosh Reserve**\n\n**Quarter Ended June 30th, 1952**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils       | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0296            | Mary Achneepineskum   | 11  | 1   | 54   | Martin Falls    | 28 42 20 13 8 4 3 4 | 754 14          | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any claim be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MoIINXOUSH School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1954.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2nd, 1955\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: JAN 4 1955\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0154            | Adeline Iasens | 14  | 1        | Grassy N.      | 2                 | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on this Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 3rd, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at OCT 4

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MoIntoah School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at OCT 4 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 3rd, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at: OCT 4 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnis School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout OCT 4 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils named in the Return had a residence by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MeTOSHI School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JUL 4 1951 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. LA. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0244           | Harriet Cheesaqumy    | 16  | 85  | 27   | Fort Hope      | 35 10 15 11 7 4 5 1 | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... School for the Quarter ended... March 31st... 1951.\n\nPrincipal... O.M.I.\n\nDated...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ma'INTOSH School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31 1950.\n\nPrincipal: J. E. C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MeINXOSE School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MINTOUSH ONT.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MINTOSH, ONT., School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 22 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at NOV 22 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0245            | Elizabeth Moonias | 82  | 62  | 56   | Martin's F.     | 32 1610 12 7 6 3 | High School       | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils returned on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MINTOSH, ONT., School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout APR 12 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the MINTO School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1949 Principal\n\nDated JUN 30 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSioux Lookout\n\nDated at JUL 7 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**SIUX LOOKOUT Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Indian Residential School at No Intosh, Ont.**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended June 30th, 1949**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 217             | Edward Keesick   | 13  | 1   |      | Lac Seul       | 1                 | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. This Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MINTOSH ONT.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: JAN - 7 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated OCT 14 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McIntosh Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended JUN 30 1948 19 Principal E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the No Intosh Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 12, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this JAN 14 1948\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APR 9 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APR 9 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnis Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: C. B. Corrigan\n\nDated Jan 8th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: FEB 4 1947\n\nINLAND AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 7, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIOUX LOOKOUT this OCT 9 1946 INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Regn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnish Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 7 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nSIoux LOOKOUT\n\nthis OCT 9 1946\n\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grants will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the McInnis Ind Res School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Leo C. B. Conner\n\nDated Oct. 7 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SIoux Lookout this OCT 9 1946 INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout, July 5, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Saskatchewan Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nSIoux Lookout\nJUL 5 1946\nthis...\nINDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: SIOUX LOOKOUT\n\nthis JULY 5, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

$8241\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this July 5, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Sioux Lookout\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Institution Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nSioux Lookout\nDated at: APR 4, 1946\nthis: Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sioux Lookout Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Sioux Lookout this April 4, 19...\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

The Minister of Labour may at any time and from time to time determine for the purposes of this contract, what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages, and the current or fair and reasonable hours, and may from time to time rescind, revoke, amend or vary any such decision, provided that his determination and any amendment or variation shall not be operative prior to the period of three months immediately preceding the date thereof. Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may, in the manner and subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth, decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the contractor shall fail so to do, or to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour, wages according to the rates fixed therefor by the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the contractor, and the contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid. The powers of the Minister of Labour hereunder shall not be exercised as to any employee or employees where it is established to his satisfaction that an agreement in writing exists and is in effect between the contractor and the class of employees to which such employee or employees belong or the authorized representatives of such class of employees fixing rates of wages, overtime conditions and hours of labour.\nOttawa, May 28, 1924.\n\nRef.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn connection with the construction of a new school at McIntosh, Ont., Very Rev. Father Beys has requested me to bring before you the necessity of erecting without delay a dam and other machinery in view of generating power for the school.\n\nRev. Father Beys suggests that the work of erecting said dam and machinery be undertaken (if this is in order) by the engineers of the Power Branch of the Interior Department stationed at Winnipeg who have already visited the fall at McIntosh and have drawn a plan of the generating power of it. However, if a special contract would be necessary for this work Rev. Fr Beys would ask that the supervision of the work be done by said engineers.\n\nKindly communicate with Rev. Fr Beys at your earliest opportunity and arrange, if possible, for the erection of generating plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Bayne\n\n597 Modermot Avenue,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nMr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr Scott:\n\nOn July 3rd I sent you a letter requesting that proper authority be given Rev.

Fr Beys who is rather anxious on account of the advanced season and the late date set for the opening of the tenders.\n\nCould you kindly take up that question at your convenience and inform Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nNotwithstanding its ruggedness, HALICOMP FLOORING is nevertheless easy treading, comfortable and quiet. From a sanitary standpoint, HALICOMP leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nOur MASTICOMP, like HALICOMP, is laid monolithic, with base if necessary. It is installed over both concrete and wood sub-floors. Our MASTICOMP FLOORING is not only installed by cold method, such as these other floors, but is also made entirely by the cold method. Thus no solvent whatever is lost during manufacture. The colors are ground into the total mastic mass, making it far superior to mastics into which the color is simply admixed. MASTICOMP FLOORING remains permanently ductile, and bonds perfectly and permanently with the concrete. A mastic floor of the MASTICOMP type is a very tough floor; the dirt that accumulates on a mastic floor does not embed itself into the floor - but lays more or less on the surface as dust. Just recently upon visiting a Naval Hospital - where a great deal of linoleum flooring is to be replaced with mastic, was told that these floors are to be removed - as the linoleum loosens from the concrete, and curls at the edges, wears out locally, and cannot be patched satisfactorily, which makes it unsanitary.\n\nWe enclose herewith stamped addressed envelope for your response, and we will endeavor at that time, to go further into detail regarding our floors - if you so desire - sending you samples, etc.\n\nTrusting to hear from you by return mail,\n\nwe are\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHAGHEISTER-LIND CHEMICAL CO.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Manager.\n\nWCH: EVH.\nJuly 30th, 1924.\n\nHAGMEISTER-LIND CHEMICAL CO.\nSTUIC AND FLOORING DIVISION\nCANADIAN FACTORY AND OFFICE\nSARNIA, ONTARIO, CANADA\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs makers of HALICOMP COMPOSITION FLOORING and MASTICOMP GOLD MAINTIC FLOOR - we learn that you are receiving tenders for residential school at MacIntosh. If you could let me have the name of the probable contractor - we could then submit our proposal covering each of the above floors.\n\nSurely the construction of this school will be of a fireproof design - either of reinforced concrete or of steel construction with concrete floors. They would, of course, put in wood floors, making it unnecessarily a prey to fire. HALICOMP and MASTICOMP FLOORS make an ideal installation - when applied in a fireproof building with concrete floors. The above floors can also be applied over wood - making this type of floor also fireproof.\n\nIn our Pittsburgh plant, a disastrous fire broke out - and would have caused considerable damage - had not the HALICOMP FLOOR in the floor above the one in which the fire originated - stopped the advance of the flames. After the fire, upon investigation, we discovered that the slow burning wood floor beneath the HALICOMP FLOOR - had been completely burnt through. However, the HALICOMP installation was not harmed. This is just an example of the fire resisting qualities of our material.\n\nOur floors - while competing from a quality standpoint with floors that cost two or three times as much per square foot or per unit foot and many times possessing more qualities and combination than any of such floors, in cost does not favorably with maple flooring, particularly where a wood flooring of this kind is to be installed in reinforced concrete construction. Our competitive floors are tile, marble, cork and rubber - and their permanent life and low upkeep assure economy. The life of a HALICOMP FLOOR is unlimited, because it is an all mineral product applied in a plastic state over the sub-floor and sets up through chemical action into a seamless, elastic smooth surface. Although comparatively light in weight, a HALICOMP FLOOR possesses great compressive and tensile strength.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared for the proposed new Indian Residential School at McIntosh Ontario.\n\nAs the site for this building is situated on the Grand Trunk Pacific, 168 miles east of Winnipeg, I am of the opinion that it would be sufficient to invite tenders by advertising in the Winnipeg papers, as this is the nearest point for building supplies to the proposed school.\n\nPlease advise me the papers in which advertisements might be inserted.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, August 7, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Girdlestone:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo with reference to the electric lighting equipment required for the McIntosh school and the Dusk Lake school and in reply would say that when prices are being invited for this equipment, you will be given an opportunity to figure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

This school will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. There is no settlement in the vicinity. At the present time the Church is clearing a few acres of land and erecting some temporary buildings for the accommodation of the staff that is engaged in the work and will, after the completion of the school, be in charge of the different activities of the institution.\n\nThe building is of simple construction, but, nevertheless, it will be necessary to have the services of an inspector who will supervise the work and certify progress certificates on behalf of the contractor. Among those employed by the Church is a lay brother, Adolphe Gauthier, who is a very competent mechanic and whose services as inspector would be satisfactory to the Department and to those interested in the work and in having the building constructed strictly according to the plans and specifications. There is, of course, no other person in the vicinity, and it will be necessary to go to Winnipeg for an inspector. It is proposed to utilize his services only three days a week, for a period of approximately six months. It will thus be seen that the expenses and time involved in travelling to and from Winnipeg for this particular work would be out of proportion to the service to be rendered. I will therefore, ask for the approval of the Commission to engage Brother Gauthier for three days a week, as mentioned, during the course of construction.\n\nWm.

Bunn this local firm put in a bid, so I thought it advisable to proceed to McIntosh and see the site and what was being done.\n\nI was there last Monday last instant, and met Revd Father Boyer and Brother Bunn, S.M.I., on the spot, they had done a lot of clearing and raised erected office, cook house bunkhouse &c and showed me a plan from our Department in Ottawa showing the location of the property on which Contractors had tendered. I informed them that in my opinion McIntosh was not the most suitable place for the School, but that I had not gone into the matter having received no instructions, that no doubt the Department and the Church would decide was suitable and in any case I was glad a School was going up.\n\nWe examined the work done and the site on the property and located the best position for the actual building, which is situated very conveniently for post mail as there is a fall which will be very useful, also it will be difficult to get a summit road to a station but no doubt a platform can be arranged for on the Railway West of McIntosh Station, and a road can be made to the School which will be about 2 miles away.\n\nThere is very little land suitable for farming close to the School, but land can be cleared a short distance away that will take care of the needs of the School for vegetables &c.\n\nThe Fathers informed me that the contract had been let to Mr Joe Simmons at Winnipeg, and they wished to go ahead with the work at once, they then asked me to go to Winnipeg with them which I did, went to Inspector Bunn's office and he showed me all the instructions he had received, and he wired you to see if the Contractors could go ahead, as the weather was favourable, and it was advisable to go ahead as much as possible before the cold weather set in.\n\nFather Boyer informed me he expected Mr Orr down.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nfrom Ottawa, but as he had informed them he would be down last week and had not as yet arrived he would like authority to proceed.\n\nThis was the object of Mr Bunn's telegram to you.\n\nOwing to the difficulty of getting a road to the site, all material for the construction will have to be hauled from the Railway by water, and at the present time the only way to get to the property is from McIntosh station on Canyon Lake through a culvert under the railway track which is narrow and only has a few feet of water in it, this can be deepened, but when we went to the School, we touched bottom both going up and coming down, although we had no load in the boat.\n\nI shall be glad to receive any information, you think I should have in connection with this School, and also a copy of the plans and specifications for file in this Office, as I consider I should be as well posted on what our Department is doing in my Agency as outsiders who only get their information from the Press and local gossip.\n\nI do not know what arrangements are being made as to the general supervision of the carrying out of the contract but presume Inspector Bunn of Winnipeg, will be instructed to look over the work occasionally, or that I shall get some instructions or information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 120-20 of the 4th instant, with reference to the new Indian residential school at McIntosh.

November 1924.\n\nMr. R.G.Orr, Architect.\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe work of the construction of the McIntosh Residential school has progressed very satisfactorily during the past month. To date the building is closed, carpenters and other trade men can work inside at a certain advantage. The painting give a neat and very tasty appearance to the building.\n\nUp to the 14th, we had some difficulty in transporting the material, owing to the cold wheather. On the 15th the canyon froze just enough to prevent the transportation by water and by land. Yet a good amount of material was transported on the premises, and men were set to work a road to the station. Were transported this month by water and by land: Siding, cornice etc., window frames, hardware, paper, finish hardware, plaster and lime, cement, mill-work, trims and doors. The men lost no time on account of the lack of material.\n\nActually the shingling is finished throughout the whole building, sashes are nearly all glazed, and painted 3 coats, the outside of the bldg, is nearly all painted, two coats and at the rear three coats. The heating plant is well under way, and the plumbing nearly done, nothing but the floor work to be done: setting baths and sinks etc. the carpenters' work is nearly done until plastering goes on. The contractor waits for the heating of the building to rush the plastering. The Steam-fitter expects to be able to heat the house in about ten days.\n\nAll the material, except the metallic ceiling is at hand, and as soon as the plastering will be done - 15 or 20 days. parts of the house will be fit for occupation. In fact the kitchen and the dinning room for the men will be moved into the new building this week. In all expectations and safety the staff and the children will be able to occupy the building in February and partly in January.\n\nUnless exceptionally good wheather prevails the last coat of paint will be put on only next spring.\n\nThe contractor seems very well satisfied with the progress of the work. On my part I have only praises for him for the manner he fulfils his obligations. The Department is greatly responsible for the quick and efficient work done in this particular contract.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAdolphe Gauthier Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn connection with the new Indian Residential School at MacIntosh, it will be necessary to provide temporary water supply and lighting system until such time as the proposed permanent installation is complete. The earliest that this can be done will be next fall. In order to provide this temporary convenience it is proposed to install the following equipment:\n\n1 - 5HP gas engine,\n1 - 3K.W. generator,\n1 - small pump,\nand 450 feet of 2 inch pipe, (this pipe will be laid temporarily on the ground from the lake to the school.)\n\nIn order to maintain water pressure in the building it is proposed to use for this purpose the 800 gallon hot water storage tank which is already installed in the boiler room. All of the above mentioned machinery will be temporarily installed in the boiler room, and will cost approximately $700.00. Brother Gauthier is willing to look after the installation of same. I may say that all of the above mentioned equipment can be used when the permanent water supply and lighting system are installed next year, and therefore none of it will have to be discarded when the new plant is installed.\n\nAs it is very necessary that the water supply and lighting system be connected up as soon as possible in order that the electric wiring and plumbing may be properly tested, I beg to recommend for your consideration that this work be authorized.\n\nArchitect.\nSir:\n\nThe Department considers it advisable to immediately install a temporary water supply and electric lighting system at the new Indian Residential School at MacIntosh, Ont. This temporary plant will consist of a gasoline engine to be used to operate jointly an electric generator and a small water pump, all of which will be installed in the boiler room. The supply pipe will be of 2\" wrought iron connected to Canyon Lake and to the 800 gallon hot water storage tank already installed in the boiler room. This system will also provide means of testing the electric lighting and plumbing system now in course of completion. It is therefore desired that you obtain competitive prices and purchase the following machinery:\n\n1 - 5HP vertical gas engine, with pulley of the dimensions required to operate a typhon pump or equal, having a capacity of 2000 imperial gallons per hour, equipped with air compressor, etc.\n\n1 - 3K.W., 115 volt, D.C., generator, complete with the accessories required to satisfactorily operate the electric lighting system, to be installed in this building.\n\n450 feet of 2 inch in diameter wrought iron pipe with reasonable quantity of fittings for the installation of this pipe on the ground, including a brass strainer and three two inch valves.\n\nThese articles should be shipped to the school as early as possible, and it is understood that Brother Gauthier will undertake the installation of this machinery, which it is considered will be of use to the institution after the permanent water supply and lighting system are installed in the course of next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn R.

Orr Architect,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to certain circumstances and especially to very cold weather the work has not been proceeded with the same activity as during the previous months. However good progress was made enough to close the building and to start the heating on the 15th. All the outside work was completed, partitions finishing of three rooms, setting of hard-wood floor in drying room, setting of the sashes and window finishings etc., covers about the inside work. Plastering as the main work. The plumbers and steam-fitters have practically completed their more important work. After the setting of the radiators and the floor-work such as setting the baths and closets and the testing of both the boiler and the plumbing their work will be completed.\n\nTo date the second floor is all plastered and ready for the carpenters to go on with the finishing. The first coat is almost all finished except part of the ground floor and in all probabilities the two coats of plaster will be finished on or about the 15th. inst.\n\nThe tin-smiths will start the metal ceiling in a near future. The carpenters will resume work in a few days and in about 5 or 6 weeks they expect to complete the work. All the material is on the premises.\n\nThe heating system works very well. There are no radiators set in the basement, only the mains supplying the heat, and all the radiators are not connected in the other floors and yet we could keep the building at a very high temperature. This is a good indication that the building is well constructed and the heating-system good.\n\nThe plastering is well done. However I am in fear that some part will not prove as satisfactory as expected. It seems to me that the lathing was too dry when the plaster was put on. I will be able to judge better in a few days and I will report to you in due time for correction of the work if it is not well done.\n\nSo far I had nothing to complain about in both the manner and efficiency with which the work was done.\n\nThanking you for your past favours, I beg to present you my sincere wishes for a Happy New Year.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector for the\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The only means of communication with the station at the present time is by walking through the bush and in the summer time by boat.\n\nOwing to this isolated condition it would be of great assistance if a telephone line was installed connecting the school with the station. The cost of the installation of this proposed line will be approximately $250.00, and Brother Gauthier is willing to look after the installation of same. I may add that unless this telephone is provided the school will be completely isolated for a period of three weeks in the Spring when the ice starts to break up.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, for your consideration that the necessary materials be purchased and forwarded to the School.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, Jan. 7, 1925\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to the installation of a telephone for connecting the McIntosh School to the Station on the Grand Trunk Pacific, I beg to say that the Department approves of you purchasing the following materials which will be required for the installing of this telephone.\n\n2 - Wall telephone sets 1317 G, long distance bridge bell, telephone apparatus (2500 ohm ringer and 5 bar generator) with\n1 - 60 B protector,\n5 - dry battery cells,\n50 ft style C wire, 2 condr.\n100 ft \" B \"\n4 only 4\u00bd porcelain knobs,\n4 only screws for ditto,\n100 only #8, 5/4\" Blake staples,\n2 - 5/8 x 4 porcelain tubes,\n2 - Bryant connectors #307,\n1 - only Ground rod,\n20,000 ft #12 galv. iron tel. wire, approx 31 lbs per M',\n100 - #9 Pony glass insulators,\n100 - Oak brackets 1-3/4 x 2 in 12,\n1000 ft #9 galv. iron tel. wire, approx 58 lbs per M'.\n\nThis material together with the cost of installation of the line should not cost more than $250.00. Before purchasing the material please obtain competitive prices from both the General Electric Co. and the Northern Electric Co. in Winnipeg, and when submitting the vouchers for the expenditure attach the copies of the prices received.\n\nRev. Father Boyer,\nPrincipal, McIntosh School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR & SECRETARY\nJanuary 30, 1925\n\nMr. R. Ferrier  \nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe typewriter with which this letter is written just arrived yesterday in perfect order. Please accept my sincerest thanks for having sent same. It will be of great use to me. We poor heathens living back in the bush appreciate these commodities of life more than you, city people!\n\nThe carpenters, the plumbers and the painters are putting the last finish to the building. No doubt we will be able to occupy it at the latest, on March the first. In fact the brother and myself are already living in the building.\n\nI am going to Winnipeg on the 8th of February to meet Mr. J.R. Bunn, and between the 8th and the 15th we will buy the material he was requested to buy by Mr. Orr. Everything will be shipped before March the first.\n\nMost likely Fr. G. Brouillet will arrive here soon and start the recruiting of children on the reserves. This is no small task, and we want to register children at the school as soon as possible. The sisters will also arrive soon. So, you may see that we intend to have things going.\n\nI believe it would be advisable to ask Mr. Edwards of Kenora to visit the school. His cooperation in the work of this school would be highly appreciated and he should at the very start make himself familiar with the hardships of the beginning.\n\nThanking you again for all your favours,\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Orr, Architect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter the holidays all the men resumed work with a new activity during this month. The plumbers, painters, stone-fitter, carpenters and laborers returned at different dates. The timbers arrived on the 6th to set the metallic ceiling and the cement troughs. The electricians arrived on the 28th.\n\nTo date the second floor is completed but the setting of the locks on the doors and the sheathing of the pillars. On the first floor, the floors are to be sanded and finished, the wood-work varnished, and a few lockets will be set. On the ground floor, by the end of the week everything will be completed. The railing of the stairway are to be set, both in the central stairs and the north end. All the hard-sound floors are completed. In the basement, the cement floor is completed except four rooms. The plumbing is nearly done except minor details, closet covers, bath fittings, etc. The stone-fitter is putting a last finish to radiators, adjusting drain pipes, and testing connections. All the metallic ceilings are complete. In short, the work is very well finished. In all expectation the contractor expects to complete the wood-work on or about the 1st of March and the building ought to be thoroughly completed by the end of the month.\n\nThe finishing work is very well finished and the building has a very neat appearance. The electrical work will be tested this week and the fittings all set. The heating was very weak.\n\nHoping that the report of next month will tell you the whole history of the building.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAdolphe Gautier, Inspector.\nMcINTOSH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nMcINTOSH, ONT.\n\nFebruary 1925\n\nJANUARY MONTHLY REPORT...\n\nMr. R.

You will notice by the quotations for the material to be used that the prices are higher than those got in Ottawa. Owing to the very severe weather the work was more difficult and slower. Some days the men were working in the bush with a temperature of 30 degrees below zero. Yet as the work was started and as we were in bad need of communication with the railway station we thought it was better, even under the circumstances, to proceed with the work, and this rightly, because the first few days after the installation we used the telephone to a great advantage.\n\nHoping that everything will prove satisfactory, and thanking you for your past favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n130-7-5\n\nOttawa, February 24, 1925.\n\nMr. Sir,\n\nThe certificate we have in favour of Mr. Adolphe Gauthier as Inspector of Construction, McIntosh school, will expire on March 18.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am very pleased to let you know that the contractor has left McIntosh on February 20th. The building is completed. The plumber is here checking the water connections and testing the plumbing; the steam-fitter will come from Winnipeg in a near future to clean the boiler and then the building will be ready for acceptance. It would be advisable however to ask the contractor to come in the spring to complete the levelling and cleaning around the house. Last fall when they graded the premises the ground was rather frozen and the work was not well done. After the washing of the boiler and the testing of the heating-plant some details might have to be adjusted. Of course it is rather difficult to test the heating now, the building is hardly dry and up to yesterday the doors were practically opened all the time. We will be able to tell better in a few days how the heating system is working.\n\nRegarding the acceptation of the work and the releasing of the contractor, what is to be done? Please send me your instructions. I would be very pleased if you would come and accept the building yourself. But should you delay for some time I believe it not fair to hold back the contractor who has a certain amount tied up. We might accept the building conditionally, tant is subject to rectification, if not correct, and hold back a small amount to guarantee the completion or correction if there be any.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon, and thanking you for your past favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMiss O'Conahoe,\n\nI have received a telegram from Mr. Simmons, contractor for the McIntosh Indian Residential School, stating that he has completed his contract for the erection of this building.\n\nThe services of this Inspector will not, therefore, be required after March 18th.\n\nArchitect.\n| Item Description          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|---------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Pr. 16\u00bd Climbers          | 1        | $6.50      | $6.50       |\n| Set Straps                | 1        | $1.75      | $1.75       |\n| Only Safety Belt Body     | 1        | $6.11      | $6.11       |\n| Pr.

This for the central stairs. For the stairs leading outside, cast iron steps would be better. The cement will soon chip off and make the stairs dangerous. In the boiler room as some heavy traffic will be there, cast iron steps are preferable. Hence:\n\n108 Brass or Cast Iron Nosings 30\" long.\n20 Cast Iron Steps for outside doors' stairs. 45\"\n20 \" \" \" for Boiler Room stairs. 30\"\n\nGREASE TRAP:\nThe kitchen sink is fitted with a Grease Trap. But the Scullery Sink has none. As there is a good amount of greasy water going through that sink, it would be advisable to put a trap similar to Trap P.7094, as specified, page 55, Specifications for the McIntosh Indian Res. School.\n\nLINOLEUM:\nA good heavy Linoleum, a dark preferred should be put in the kitchen. The cement floor is dusty and hard; this would be very useful to keep the kitchen clean and for the comfort of the cooks. Also in the Staff Dinning Rooms, a Linoleum would be almost necessary to finish the room.\n\nKitchen: 22' x 16' Battleship Linoleum.\nDinning Room No.1: 14'-6\" x 15'.\nDinning Room No.2: 14'-6\" x 11'-4\".\nScullery: 14'-0\" x 8'-0\".\nPantry: 18'-0\" x 9'-0\".\n\nFor the Corridors, stairs, landings, etc., about 300' long by 30 inches wide.\n\nFor the covers of the tables in the children's Dinning Room, there are 8 tables 6'-0\" x 3'-0\".\n\n-- Brass Trimmings for the Tables. 18' for each.\n\nLAMPS:\nWe will have the Electric Light in a near future. But in case of emergency, it would be advisable to have a few Coal-Oil Lamps, about half-dozen.\n\nHOT WATER TANK:\nA Hot Water Tank should be connected with the kitchen stove. In summer it would save the trouble of heating the Water Jacket, and in winter save a great deal of fuel. The water for the kitchen use must be almost boiling, so it would require a big fire in the boiler, hence hampering the heating of the house. The hot water tank connected to the boiler can be used only for the hot water system in the house, baths and sinks. (100 Feb. - Taute)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nBEDDING. The Pillasses made of ticking for the children's beds are arrived. We have nothing here to fill them. Could some mattress filler of some kind be got? There are 50 casings. We would also appreciate very much a white bed spread for the children's beds (50) and four for the infirmary.\n\nSIDE-WALKS. When the snow will be gone the surroundings of the house will be rather muddy. The grading during the construction caused a lot mixing around the building and it will be very difficult to keep the house clean without protecting it with side-walks. We would need about 400 feet of lumber, board measure, to make a side-walk 3 feet wide. For the cross-pieces we could use small timber, 4000' 8\" or 10\" x2\" lumber, all lengths. We also need a bridge across the creek, but we can build it with timber.\n\nFARM Implements. - There is now enough land cleared for making at least a good garden. We would require: -\n1 Plough, 1 Disk Harrow, small. One Garden Cultivator, One Teeth-Harrow, One Brush Plow, One Seeder for Garden.

Yet, we have to take advantage of the \"pleasures\" of our Canadian winters! The road from the school to the station is yet in good shape but liable to break almost at any time. Last week we had two days of rather mild weather and the thawing made things pretty bad.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would order all the material you intend to order as soon as possible, to enable us to carry it with the team before the breaking of the road and the bad spring weather. Until the opening of the lake we will be rather handicapped for hauling from the station.\n\nI have the Bills of Lading for the Blankets, the Ranges and Sider, the Fire extinguishers, and the Pot Rack, but there seems to be an unusual delay in the shipment. The blankets were shipped from Lindsay Ont on the 19th of Feb., the Pot Rack and Cook's table on the 21st of Feb., and they are not yet arrived.\n\nUnder separate cover I am sending you requisitions for other material for your attention.\n\nI am also sending you the last Certificate of Mr. J.H. Simmons for the construction, with the monthly report, Service sheet, etc.\n\nThe dam is partly completed and certainly not fit as it is to hold the water this spring. I understand that the engineers from Winnipeg are coming to complete same before the spring floods, but they seem very quiet at Winnipeg. Mr. Attwood asked me to give him a sketch of the Hydro machinery wanted, etc. I refused to do so because I understand that it is to be settled between you and the engineers and it is not my duty to tell them what to do. Yet I expect to be in Ottawa at the end of April and I believe that a few suggestions to the parties interested would save time and money to the department.\n\nThe Cess-Pool and Septic Tank are not completed, Mr. Attwood intends to complete it, I heard, when the weather will get milder. In the meantime we have connected, under his instructions, the sewer to the laundry sewer and discharging the sewerage directly in the lake. For the winter it is quite all-right, but this matter should be attended to as soon as the ice thaws out.\n\nThe building is now partly furnished, and looks very well. We certainly owe you sincere thanks and to Mr. J.M. Bunn, of Winnipeg, for the assistance given us.\n\nThe visitors' room is ready! Your visit would be a great pleasure to us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe month of February was spent in finishing and checking the balance of the work at the construction. In the first part the plumber and steam-fitter completed and checked their work. They left for the 15th for Winnipeg.\n\nThe Electricians completed their work in putting the fixtures, panel doors, etc., they finished their work on the 5th, and returned to Winnipeg leaving a few little things to adjust, but that we will complete later on.\n\nThe painters and carpenters were hurrying to complete the building as soon as possible.\n\nOn the 21st the plumber came from Winnipeg to check his work. Since the 15th we have the water-works in the house, and it was found that four plumbing connections needed attention. The plumber also blew out the boiler, according to the specifications.\n\nAccording to your instructions in your letter to Father Boyer, dated Feb. 25th I am prepared to accept the building and issue the final certificate but subject to the written warranty of the contractor. In my opinion some work, although made according to the plans and specifications might prove in the future not efficient. For instance, the painting and varnishing, the cement floor in the basement, and the heating. There is also some grading to be done around the building. Last fall when the grading was made the ground was rather frozen and it has to be finished in the spring. In the present state the work is not so good.\n\nThe contractor pledges his word that he would put everything in good order. I believe that this work should be done before he is paid the balance of the money owed him.\n\nTaken as a whole the building is very nice, and well built, and is a great credit to the Department. Excepting a few details the contractor has done very good work and in good time.\n\nThanking you for your past favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School,\nMcIntosh Ontario.\n\n....

Gurney Orr,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter dated Feb 2, 1925 re-furnishing a Cordwood Saw I have asked prices of different firms and decided to buy one at T. Eaton Co., Winnipeg Man. Their price was lower than that of J.H. Ashdown H'ware Co and the saw is much better. For the price of the Fairbanks Morse Co it does not compare with the other two. The frame is wood and the shape of the outfit was not suitable.\n\nEnclosed please find the prices of the different firms and the receipted voucher from T. Eaton Co.\n\nThe Saw is already installed. We operate it from the shaft driven by the Gas Engine in the Laundry. We haul the logs from the bush, cut them and throw the wood in the Coal bin next to the boiler room.\n\nEnclosed find a rough sketch of the position of the machinery used in the temporary water system and lighting plant. The brother finished the installation on Mar. 14th, and everything works fine. We were delayed by the Canadian Westinghouse people. We received the generator only on Mar 13th, and the Switchboard on the 14th.\n\nMost of the furniture is here. With the Damada Furniture shipment expected this week nearly all the material will be at hand. A carpenter is setting the knock-down material, and by the end of the month we will be able to admit children, a few at least.\n\nIf you have anything to ship from the east I would appreciate it very much if you would do so in a near future.

The ice is rather soft and we expect to be able to go through next week.\n\nWe are now cleaning the surroundings of the house and preparing to seed a little garden. The land is good enough for quite a space. We would need a plough and an A.Tooth Harrow. I do not know whether we should have a requisition from the Dept. Some time ago I sent a list of farm implements to Mr. R.G. Orr, but have had no reply yet. If you see it fit to order a plough and a Harrow please send them at your earliest convenience.\n\nWhat we require is a:\n- 14 inch Walking Plow, rather heavy and strong.\n- 4 sections Drag Harrows, with single draw-bar.\n\nThe best places to buy these are:\n- The Cockshutt Plow Co.\n- The John Deere Co.\n- The International Harvester Co.\n\nI expect to be in Winnipeg next week.\n\nAu revoir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is suggested by them that they require 50 matresses, and if they were sent filled they would be able to take in pupils in the course of a few weeks time, and not wait until September as was originally intended. 25-5 feet matresses are required and 25-6 feet ones. The width to be 30 inches wide with a 4\u00bd inch band.\n\nAt present there are three Nuns, two Priests and two lay Brothers at the School, they would like to get two carpenters to help assemble the furniture and do other necessary work for two weeks. I shall be glad if authority will be granted to employ these carpenters working.\n\nThe electric light is connected but the batteries are not installed. There is good water pressure 60 lbs.\n\nWill you please send me a Transport Requisition for Indians so that I can sign it for the use of the Priest in recruiting the children. I would like to be informed as to whether the expenses incurred by the Priest in recruiting the children etc are to be paid by the Department or by the Church authorities.

Scott,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Oblate Fathers, when finding a location for the McIntosh Indian Residential School, and residing here, have received and helped the surveyors, bought and brought here the articles mentioned and certified by vouchers herein enclosed.\n\nAll these articles are in first-class repair, in fact much improved by the work and repairing made by the Oblate Bros.\n\nThe Department is aware that these articles are an absolute necessity for the maintenance of the school, and I am convinced that we could not have them replaced for a much higher amount or cost.\n\nI therefore ask the Department to purchase some of the Oblate Fathers for the McIntosh School. The Oblate Fathers are satisfied to leave some here for what they actually cost namely $1387.76, not taking account the labor for improvement of same.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your personal attention and that a favorable answer is expected in a near future;\n\nI remain, Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School has asked the Department to purchase from the Oblate Order (1) the boats and boat equipment, (2) the stock and farm equipment which were provided by them when they commenced work at the school last year. The Department is also requested to reimburse the management for the freight charges on this equipment, which was supplied when the church authorities first occupied the site. The Department has paid the wages of the men that were engaged in the work and for certain materials used for shelters. The stock, the boats and some of the equipment is required for the satisfactory conduct of the school and we are now asked to purchase.\n\nThe total amounts to $1387.76 and may be divided as follows:\n\n- Boats, Boat accessories, Repairs and freight $742.90\n- Stock $331.00\n- Farm equipment $170.98\n- Freight on car of effects $51.15\n- Miscellaneous $64.75\n\n$1387.76\n\nI wish to recommend that the Department reimburse the Oblate Order for the cost of\n\n- The boats, accessories and freight $624.47\n- The stock $331.00\n- The farm equipment $170.98\n- Freight $51.15\n\nTotal: .................. $1177.60\n\nReceipts have been presented and payment is now in order.\n\nRussell Heirier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS\n\nBill of Lading - Original\n\nWinnipeg, July 17, 1924.\n\nConsigned to McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\n1 Car Settler's Effects, including\n   2 horses and 1 cow\n\n24,000 lbs. $51.15\n\nStamped PAID\nJuly 17, 1924.\n\n(Sgd.)

Father Guy has asked me to correspond with you, relative to certain requests you have made in the interests of the McIntosh Indian Residential School. Under separate cover, there will be directed to you letters concerning furnishings and equipment for the building, store and athletic equipment. I should be pleased if you would estimate the cost of the materials needed for a root cellar at the school and intimate what portion of the labour could be done by the school management and the older boys. You might also prepare a list of materials required for an ice house and state if you could be responsible for its erection if the Department made the purchases.\n\nPlease arrange to keep the temporary wooden cover over the cesspool at the school, until such time as a proper septic tank has been provided. In connection with the hot water tank, you might indicate just what you would like to have supplied and estimate its cost. You should intimate if you are prepared to arrange for the installation if the Department supplies the equipment.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices if possible, 4000 ft. of lumber for the purpose of making a sidewalk from the building. When you are submitting to the office of Mr. Indian Agent Edwards a certificate account, in duplicate, in favour of the lumber concern given the business, you should support it with a statement showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. I note that you can use small timbers for the cross pieces in this connection. I am also pleased to note that you can build a bridge across the creek, without assistance from the Department.\n\nWith reference to fire escapes, I understand that you have been requested to submit an estimate of the cost of what is required and indicate what arrangements can be made for the labour.\n\nConcerning your request for agricultural implements, I have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, has been authorized to purchase one heavy 14' walking plough and four sections of drag harrows with single steel draw bar. This will be directed to the school in the near future. I am writing to Mr. Bunn again today, authorizing him to purchase for the school a garden cultivator, tooth harrow, a brush plough, a garden seeder complete with headers, 3 grub hooks, 3 spades, 6 hoes, 6 inch garden rakes, 3 picks and 5 shovels.\n\nWhen you are submitting estimates of the cost and proposals for improvement to the school buildings, grounds or equipment, you should direct your letter to Mr. Indian Agent Frank Edwards, of Kenora, who will attach his recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There is an entire absence of vibration so common in small planers of this class; hence, the work turned out is uniform and equal in quality to that of large, expensive machines. The workmanship and metal throughout are of the highest grade. It is adapted to the use of Saw Mills, lumber yards, sawmills, where a finished product is required for a large variety of work, such as planing and matching, beading, working flooring, ceiling siding, casing, wainscoting, and a large variety of moulding and trim.\n\nThe Table is cast in one piece and is deep and strong, being heavily ribbed and having arched braces under side. It is placed on top and has raised edges to prevent the material from bending against the side frames. The sides are long and placed far apart, being fitted to the outer edges of the main frame, to which they are gibbed, thus securing the greatest rigidity and least possible wear.\n\nThe Cylinders are made of forged steel and are accurately milled on four sides, with projecting lips to strengthen the cutting edge of the knives, two of the sides being elected to carry bending and moulding knives in addition to the regular planing knives, which do not have to be removed when bending and moulding is being worked.\n\nMatcher Spindles are unusually large and run in long babbitted boxes, ample provision being made for thorough lubrication.\nDirect Motor Driven Planers\n\nThe illustration above is of our Pony Planer, fully described on preceding page, and equipped with direct motor drive.\n\nThe Motor is mounted on a substantial base attached to the main frame of the machine and coupled to cutter head by means of a flexible coupling.\n\nJewel Planers, described on page 175, are also fitted with direct motor drive in a similar manner.\n\nMotors and starters are supplied to suit power currents in general use, and in applying for prices a description of the current should be given.\n\"Crown\" Shingle Machine\n\nNo. 4364\n\nOur Crown Machine cuts 16\" to 18\" shingles and carries a 36\" to 38\" saw. The Frame is composed entirely from any steel, the two upper rods forming the carrying ways.\n\nThe Arbor is 14\" in diameter, and runs in self-oiling, self-adjusting boxes. The Carriage is constructed of steel and wood, making very strong as well as light. It runs on polished steel guides, and is constantly lubricated by oil pockets cast in same. Cast steel dogs, backed up by hard wood strips, hold the shingle blanks and keep the stock to be worked up at least possible waste.\n\nThe Tilt Works are adjustable in each direction, securing thereby a fine adjustment for different thickness of shingles. This machine is furnished with balance wheel pulley.\n\nEach machine is set up and thoroughly tested before shipping, insuring proper adjustment of all parts.\n\nCapacity, 10,000 to 20,000 shingles per day. Weight, 600 lbs.\n\nFriction Log Hauls\n\nThese machines are strong, durable, easily managed, and save labor and hard lumber. We can furnish the iron parts only or complete machines as shown. Made in two sizes. Furnished complete, or iron parts only, as desired.\n\n| No. 4366-1 | No. 4365-2 |\n|------------|------------|\n| Frame      | 4'x2'x9\"   |\n| Dog Wheel  | 3'x2'x9\"   |\n| Friction   | 6\"x8\"      |\n| Drum       | 10\"x10\"    |\n| Pulley     | 10\"x10\"    |\n| Drive Pulley | 18\"x18\" |\n| Speed      | 250 R.P.M. |\n| Weight     | 1,000 lbs. |\n\nUp-to-date Power Feed Shingle Machine\n\nNo. 4363\n\nA reliable low priced machine, just right for small mills, farms, etc., and others having light power who want to make a few thousand shingles a day. Makes a perfect shingle any length from 16\" to 24\". Has knot saw and edger for Bolting or splitting pine shakes when made from round or split stock. Makes heading or crate slats. By removing the Tilt Frame at rear of carriage it can be used for Bolting and other kinds of sawing. Sold complete, 14\", Shingle Saw, 24\", Edger Saw, 8\". Weight, 625 lbs. Ask for large circular and prices.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nSaw Frames\n\nThese saw frames are made of hardwood, well braced and painted. As will be seen from the following specifications, they are high grade, durable machines suitable for use with Type \"Z\" oil or gasoline engines.\n\nThe mandrels are of 1\u00bd\" cold rolled steel, 53\" long, grooved at the bearings to prevent end play. The two bearing boxes are babbitted and are connected by a heavy iron bar, which keeps the mandrel in perfect alignment. These frames will accommodate saws from 20\" to 30\" in diameter with 1\u00bd\" arbor hole. The arbor flanges are 5\" in diameter. Left hand cut is regularly furnished, but right hand cut can be furnished on special order. The driving pulley on each is 5\" diameter with 6\" crown face. The balance wheel weighs 95 pounds. All saw frames are shipped \"knocked down\", with full instructions how to set up and operate. Saws are not regularly included with the frames.\n\nNo. 4368-21\u2014Sliding Table Saw Frame, wtg., 360 lbs.\nNo. 4368-23\u2014Tilting Table Saw Frame, wtg., 310 lbs.\n\nPole Saw Frame\n\nThis frame is built especially for sawing long poles or fence rails, although it saws cord wood equally as well. The balance wheel is hung under the frame out of the way of the operator. The poles are 1\u00bd inches in diameter, 53\" long, extending entirely across the machine. Will take saws 20\" to 30\" diameter; arbor 1\u00bd\"; 95 lb. balance wheel; three 5\" x 6\" pulleys. Left hand cut always furnished unless otherwise ordered.\n\nNo. 4370\u2014Weight, 400 lbs.\n\nSpecial\u2014Balance wheels, different from ones regularly furnished, can be furnished to order direct from factory: 60 lb., 75 lb., 95 lb. or 125 lb. balance wheels, instead of the above frames, or for saw mandrels shown on page 313.\n\nNo. 4370\u2014\"A\" Mandrel.\n\nNo. 4370\u2014\"B\" Mandrel.\n\nSaw Mandrels\n\nIn addition to the frames listed on the previous page, we furnish a saw mandrel, designed to be bolted on rear end of the frame mounted on trucks and used in connection with an engine. This outfit consists of main shaft 1\u00bd\" cold rolled steel 49\" long, fitted with 1\u00bd\" Arbor with 5\" flanges, the other end fitted with a pulley 5\" in diameter and 6\" crown face, and a 95-pound balance wheel. Babbitted boxes are furnished, suitable for bolting to trucks. Furnished in two styles, as shown in diagram. Both the same price. Always specify whether Style \"A\" or \"B\" is wanted.\nVariable Feed Portable Saw Mills\n\nThese mills are known and recognized throughout the United States, Canada and elsewhere as the standard for portable mills, and in many cases have the advantages of accuracy and convenience to be found in large, high-priced mills.\n\nThere being no complicated parts, a machinist or mechanic is not needed to set up and operate them, which makes them superior to all others for portable purposes.\n\nThe Variable Friction Feed used on our mills is the simplest, strongest and most durable feed made for small mills. Mills equipped with this feed are being operated by steam engines as small as six horse power and by eight and ten horse power gasoline engines. The Variable Friction Feed belt is also used on our portable mills using 15 h.p. and up preferred by many users on account of the very rapid gig back.\n\nThe combined ratchet set works and quick receler is the greatest improvement in portable saw mills in years. It is accurate and has advantages over any other on the market. Only one lever is used, the pull being always in one direction, whether setting or recelering. Two or three pulls run the knees back for setting, and one pull for recelering.\n\nOur \"Heacock\" Star Dog is the largest, strongest, simplest, and most satisfactory of any mill dog on the market. It is furnished with all mills except No. 4337-1, or the smallest. All mills are furnished with Track way timbers and belt tightener.\n\nNo. 4334-1 is furnished with variable friction feed only. No. 4334-2 and 4334-3 are furnished either with variable friction feed or Heacock Variable Belt Feed. No. 4334-4 is furnished with \"Heacock\" variable belt feed only.\n\nThe general specifications are the same except that the lengths of husks are slightly longer on \"Heacock\" feed mills. All mills have cable drive except No. 4334-1, which is equipped regularly with rack and pinion drive, but will be furnished with cable drive if so ordered, at small additional cost.\n\n\"Heacock\" Variable Belt Feed Saw Mills\n\nOur \"Heacock\" variable feed saw mills are strongly recommended for mills with 20 h.p. or more, and where a very rapid carriage action is desired. There are no frictions. Two belts running in opposite directions and the feed and gig-back are controlled by means of a double belt tightener. The tension on the feed belt regulates the speed of the feed. Feed belts are included in price of mill.\n\n| No. of Mill | 4334-1 | 4334-2 | 4334-3 | 4334-4 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Length of Husk | 8' 6\" | 8' 6\" | 8' 6\" | 8' 6\" |\n| Size of Truck | 11\" | 11\" | 11\" | 11\" |\n| Diameter of Pulley | 33 1/2\" | 33 1/2\" | 33 1/2\" | 33 1/2\" |\n| Length of Track | 40' | 40' | 40' | 40' |\n| Weight with Variable Friction Feed | 2800 lbs. | 3000 lbs. | 3500 lbs. | 4000 lbs. |\n| Horse Power Required | 10 to 20 | 15 to 30 | 20 to 40 |\nStandard Saw Mill\n\nNo. 436-719\n\nThis Mill is intended to meet the needs of those requiring a medium weight stationary mill. The Husk is usually fitted with our powerful \"Hercules\" type of feed, giving ample variation; but it can be used with Steam Feed of any type when so desired.\n\nMandrel is 3\u00bd\" and runs in chain oiling boxes. Carriage is 20' long, made of 5\u00bd\" x 7\u00bd\" timbers, and has three Steel Base Head Blocks opening 46\" with 5\" independent movement with accurate Double Acting Set Works and Power Rezeder. It has 6 trucks with 12\" wheels, 1\u00bd\" steel axles, 2\u00bd\" Set Shaft and 20 lb. T rail track 60' long. Head blocks can be fitted with Knight duplex dogs when preferred. Weight complete, 11,000 lbs.\n\nFriction Feed Drag Saw\n\nNo. 4597\n\nThe Friction Feed is very simple, yet positive and effective. It will start, stop or reverse instantly by very slight motion of the feed lever, without any effort on the part of the operator. It will not stick or get out of order and will last for years. This enables the operator to feed the logs ahead or back at will as much or little as desired, and stop at any point without running back or losing time. This feature alone puts the \"Champion\" ahead of any other drag saw in the market, yet it has every practical advantage that can be desired in a machine of its kind.\n\nUnless otherwise ordered each machine is furnished complete with 24\" by 6\" driving pulley, log truck power rolls, tumbling rod with two Universal Couplings 16' of track and one 5' 6\" saw.\n\nCapacity: 30 to 40 cords of wood per day, depending on kind of wood, power and speed.\n\nPower required: Two to four horse power will operate machine to good advantage; more power will give greater capacity.\n\nFull specifications on application\nMr. A.

Mills\nMachine & Tool Dept.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nI send you here enclosed prices and specifications for saw mill, furnished to me by A.R. Williams Machinery Co., and Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., both firms of Winnipeg. The machines which those firms quoted the price on would be suitable for our place, thought the A.R. Williams Machinery Co. would be better; they give the price of two size saw mill, the No. O would be too small and there would be very little difference on price with the No. 5\u00bd which is a very good one. They also give price on second hand planer that I did not see but it may be a good machine for this place.\n\nThe saw mill that the Canadian Fairbanks quoted me the price on would be too small and not handy enough when the man who is at the saw has to do the most of the work on the carriage, but a better carriage can be furnished by the same Company.\n\nYou will notice that I am asking for an iron turning lathe, the same will do well for wood work and we are so far for repairing and with all the machines that we will have here, we must have some way to do the repairings.\n\nWe expect that we will be favored with a saw mill, for we have we have so much to do yet in buildings. Here are some which we feel the necessity now: one duck at the Station; one temporary duck was built by the contractor for unloading the material of the house last summer but the timbers and planks were taken up. One bridge over the rapid and the pipe that will bring the water to turbine. We have land on the other side of the rapid and our land road to Station through the bush around the lake. One stable as we have only one little log building where we can put two horses in. One ice house; one pig house, one hen house, some side walks and fences. All this will require much dimension timbers, planks and lumbers, and all this would be found right here, provided we have a saw mill and permit to cut the logs for the wants of this School.\n\nI send you also a list for tools that will be required here, as you know we must also have a blacksmith shop for our repairing. I put in one machine drill that I can turn into a power drill by putting on one pully that I can make here.\n\nI made this list from the Catalogue of Wood, Wallance Ltd., Winnipeg and I have seen the manager and he told me the prices are correct.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gauthier our engineer is an old man and can not do much more to fulfill the work attributed to him. We can not count on the older boys as there are none. The material for the root cellar will consist of one door and about one hundred sacs of cement if our plan of having it dug between the boiler room and the main building is followed. We will be able to supply our team with the school hired men for all the work that could be done by them.\n\nAs for the ice house we have no plans in hand and I believe the Department will be in better position than us to furnish a first class plan and the estimate necessary material. I would only suggest that if the Department would deem more proper to give us a smaller building for a freezer and freezer shed with the machineries as we will have all the necessary power, it might be more economical.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 16, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to an ice house and root cellar. I note that the school employees and team would assist in this work. In reply I have to inform you that the Department has no funds for capital expenditure this year at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, other than for the dam and power plant, which, I am informed, will be a more costly undertaking than was estimated. You will understand, therefore, that it is extremely desirable that economies be effected if at all possible. The Department is desirous of arranging for a small ice house and a suitable root cellar; but, if they are provided this season, all that can be allowed will be the necessary materials and a small grant for labour. I regret that we cannot give favourable consideration now or at any time to the erection of a refrigerating plant. This type of ice house is not provided for Indian residential schools.\n\nThe Department will give favourable consideration to purchasing a door, 100 sacks of cement for the root house and the necessary lumber for a small ice house. Further, we will allow a small grant for labour if it is found advisable to engage outside help. If this is satisfactory to you, please let me know what lumber is necessary for an ice house and instructions will be directed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

In Ontario there are several government-owned Indian residential schools. These institutions are largely financed by this Department but are managed by different churches interested in the work, who are paid a per capita grant for each Indian child in residence. Practically all the current expenses at a school of this type are met from the per capita grant receipts, but such expenses are paid by school cheque. It should be understood, however, that these institutions are not necessarily maintained entirely by the Government. Should these State-owned schools pay the gasoline tax?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst.

I feel highly pleased to congratulate you for the plan of this institution and the choice of the equipment. Your work is certainly a credit to the Department and of course to yourself and I consider it my duty to mention this fact.\n\nI take the liberty of bringing to your attention the following which would help to complete the equipment already installed: FIRE ESCAPES, 2 FOLDING BEDS FOR VISITORS but above and before all the COMPLETION OF THE DAM AND THE CESSPOOL and the CONSTRUCTION OF THE POWER HOUSE. I have written about those last details to Mr Ch\u00e9n\u00e9 under whose jurisdiction those matters come I suppose. In my estimation the price paid to the engineers for the part of the dam already constructed is unreasonable and I would favor the completion of this work by Contractor Simmons who tendered the low figure of $4,500 for not only a part of the work but for the whole work.\n\nI hope that you will see your way together with Mr Ch\u00e9n\u00e9 for the rapid completion of the work intended for McIntosh School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister that gasoline purchased or delivered in Ontario for use in Ontario was not so purchased for use in supplying motive power for vehicular traffic on the highways of the Province, the Minister may upon the application of the purchaser of such gasoline remit the tax or any part of the tax paid by the purchaser under the said Act.\n\n2. Every person selling or delivering gasoline in Ontario to a purchaser shall be the agent of the Minister collect the tax imposed by the said Act.\n\n3. The Minister, through the Department of Public Highways, shall supply all dealers in gasoline with stamps of such denomination as may be necessary and convenient for the payment of the tax and between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. except on Saturdays when stamps need not be sold after 12 o'clock noon and except on legal holidays, shall sell such stamps as required.\n\n4.\u2014(a) The Minister may sell stamps to any person or persons in different localities in Ontario at a discount not exceeding ten per centum for the purpose of re-sale to persons requiring such stamps.\n\n(b) It shall be the duty of the person so purchasing stamps for re-sale to keep an account of the number, denomination and amount of the stamps sold by him and make a return of the same to the Department of Public Highways whenever required so to do.\n\n5. If for any reason stamps cannot be obtained the tax shall be collected in cash and the person collecting the same in cash shall remit the same forthwith to the Minister together with a sworn return in such form as the Minister may require showing the amount of gasoline sold and the amount of the tax collected.\n\n6. Every importer, manufacturer, producer, refiner and distributor of gasoline shall monthly, on or before the 10th day of each month, forward to the Minister a return in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration showing the number of gallons of gasoline sold in Ontario and the persons to whom the same were sold during the last preceding month.\n\n7. Every dealer in gasoline selling and delivering gasoline to a purchaser in Ontario shall keep a record of the number, denomination and amount of stamps sold, and monthly, on or before the 10th day of each month, make a return in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration giving full particulars of the stamps sold and showing the number of gallons of gasoline sold by him and the persons from whom the same were purchased or procured during the preceding month.\n\n8.\u2014(a) Every person selling or delivering gasoline in Ontario to a purchaser as defined in THE GASOLINE TAX ACT, 1925, shall inform such purchaser of the price of the gasoline by way-bill, bill of lading or sale note in writing showing the cost of the gasoline to the purchaser and separately stating the amount of the charge or tax imposed or collected from the purchaser under the said Act, and it shall be the duty of the purchaser to see that stamps sufficient for the amount of the tax are affixed to such way-bill, bill of lading or sale note and cancelled by the person so selling or delivering the gasoline.\n\n(b) Such way-bill, bill of lading or sale note shall be delivered to the purchaser and its production shall be necessary before the remission of the tax by the Minister under the first of these regulations.\n\n9. In lieu of the collection of the charge or tax in the manner hereinbefore provided, the Minister may arrange for the collection of the charge or tax through any persons as his agent in such manner not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act as may seem to him expedient, but nothing in this regulation shall relieve a dealer in gasoline from delivering to the purchaser a way-bill, bill of lading or sale note in writing as provided in regulation 8 when required by a purchaser so to do, notwithstanding that the Minister may have dispensed with the necessity of affixing stamps to such way-bill, bill of lading or sale note.\n\n10. Every importer, manufacturer, producer, refiner or distributor of gasoline in Ontario shall maintain an office in the Province at which at all times shall be kept books of account, with vouchers and records of business done by him in Ontario and such books of account and vouchers and the premises, warehouses and plant shall at all times be open to the inspection of the Minister or his duly accredited representative.\n\n11.

Aug. 7, 1925\n\nRear Sir,\n\nAbout the 15th of last June I wrote to you about a saw mill and sets of carpenter and blacksmith tools required for this school. I do not intend to be too much in a hurry as I know that you want time to have the approbation of the Department, but now is the time that I need these tools. There are many little works that need to be done. I could have done them if I had had tools required.\n\nWe also have to clear land for a little cultivation and some other work with the team of horses; all these require some blacksmithing and repairing, and I can imagine that we will want forge very often for the installation of the machines which we expect will soon be done here.\n\nHoping you will give us a favorable answer,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir, yours truly,\n\nA. Gauthier\nOttawa, August 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge Brother Gauthier's letter of the 7th instant, with reference to carpenter's and blacksmith's tools required at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I regret that the Department cannot favourably consider the supplying of all the tools which were listed under cover of his letter of June 21st. This list is being returned to you, with authority to expend not more than $150 in the purchase of the tools that are required at the school. Competitive prices should be secured before making the purchase, and, when submitting a certified account in duplicate in favour of the firm awarded the business, please attach thereto a memorandum showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nI should be grateful if you would have all official communications to the Department signed by yourself as Principal and addressed to the Secretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nMessrs. Wood, Vallance Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nReverend Sir:\n\nRev. Father Guy has left with me the enclosed papers, which relate to the erection of a root-house and fire escapes at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I regret that the Department has no funds available for such expensive construction. If you will refer to my letter of July 16th, you will note that it is extremely desirable that economies be effected. If a root cellar is to be provided this year, all that can be allowed is the necessary materials and a small grant for labour. The work would be done on a day labour basis, under your supervision. Please let me have a communication from you in this connection, indicating the estimated costs.\n\nWith reference to fire escapes, the Department considers that the pole type is quite suitable and much less expensive than the quotation of either the Vulcan Iron Works or the Manitoba Bridge Company. Early in the spring, the Rev. Father Boyer promised to submit a price for the installation of the less expensive fire escapes, but to date this has not been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of Sept.23, file 130-7-5. About the root cellar I would inform you that Mr. Simmon's contractor who is working here says that the necessary material would consist of about 100 sacks of cement, one door, sheets of wire to reinforce the concrete and the cost would not be less than $125.00. The school is ready to give its two hired men, the team, boat with barges to haul the gravel, lumber to build the forms and some other things that would be possible to give but it would be impossible for us to do more than this, having no money at all to pay for the labour. If the Department agrees to this, I would be very thankful, but if not, though sorry, I would have to wait another year.\n\nAs for the fire escapes, Brother Gauthier was ready to submit a price and it was for that reason that early this spring he asked the Department to send him tools; only few weeks ago he received a favourable answer for $150.00.\n\nTrusting this will meet yours and the Department's approval I remain your obedient,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also trust that the erection of the fire escapes can be undertaken on a day labour basis - the Department to pay for all materials and their transportation and the wages of one workman who would assist the lay brother at the school. Payment would be made upon receipt of properly certified accounts, in duplicate, and time sheets showing the time of the workman.\n\nI am enclosing an account for freight, from Stanley Breck Limited, Winnipeg.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nOn Wednesday, November 18th, I inspected the McIntosh Residential School. The contractors are at work on completion of the powerhouse, and also repairing a break in the dam. The work should be completed in about three weeks time. The Principal of the school discussed with me the deepening of the culvert under the railway track, which is very shallow and difficult for loaded boxes with material for the school to go through. He suggested that now was the time for the railway company to do the necessary deepening as the water is at its lowest in the Winter, and also it could be set on the ice. There are no loose boulders near the culvert and the rock bottom would have to be blasted out.\n\nThe Principal complained that the bread oven as supplied is a very poor cooker and he would like, if possible, that this be changed to a Doughty Cooker as supplied other schools in this agency and which he considered very much superior.\n\nHe would also like to get a set of scales for weighing children so as to know their progress. This is recommended by the Medical Officer, Dr. Ferguson.\n\nRe cement floor in play rooms, boys and girls. The finish of these floors is very rough and wears out the children's boots quickly and also causes the children to scratch themselves badly when they fall, in addition to carrying gravel all over the school. He would like to know if it would not be possible to get some covering for these two rooms.\n\nThe Principal and Dr. Ferguson request that two drinking fountains for the boys and girls be installed at the school so as to prevent infection. This would not be an expensive proposition.\n\nThe roofs covering the buildings at the back of the school are leaking and should be tarred and gravelled. The Principal asks that this might be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIncluded find account of expenses for material of fire escapes and daily wages of the men who by turns helped our Brother.\n\nAll this has been done according to instructions included in your letter of Oct. 15 1925 No. 130-7-5.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Perreault\nprincipal\nWinnipeg, 24th December, 1925.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. J.H. Simmons, the General Contractor who built the Indian Residential School building at McIntosh in North-western Ontario, has submitted me a copy of a letter addressed to him by Mr. R.G. Orr, the Departmental Architect, under date the 30th May, 1925.\n\nThis letter has reference to a barge that Mr. Simmons had constructed for his use when he was carrying out his contract at McIntosh; this barge was used for transporting materials from the railway to the site of the school building. The value placed on this barge is $355.00, the cost of same when new, this price is subject to a discount of 30%, making the cost $270.00. I have made inquiry about this barge, and I am informed that it is in good condition, and is considered to be good value at $270.00. The school has used it during the past summer for hauling hay, moving horses and equipment to where the hay was growing, and they have also used it for the transport of other supplies in connection with the water power construction. For the services of the school this barge will be very useful, and the price being reasonable, I beg to recommend that Mr. J.H. Simmons should be offered and paid say $270.00 (Two hundred and seventy dollars.) for this barge.\n\nMr. Simmons also submits a list of lumber, shingles, dimension siding and shiplap, value landed at the school site is given as $154.20; he offers these materials for this cost less 30% or a nett price of $107.94. These materials can be utilised by the school, the price given as the \"nett\" cost above as a fair and reasonable cost. I beg to recommend that the amount of $107.94 should be paid to Mr. J.H. Simmons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, February 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th of December, which has been inadvertently overlooked. I note your recommendation that a barge and some miscellaneous lumber, which was left at the McIntosh Indian Residential School by Mr. J. H. Simmons, the contractor, should be purchased for the use of the school. You may inform Mr. Simmons and the school management that Department funds are extremely limited at the present time. If the school is not in a position to make purchase from the per capita or other earnings, if they care to bring the matter to the attention of the Department during the next fiscal year consideration will be given. You might intimate to Mr. Simmons that, as this equipment and material is really needed at the school, it will probably be taken off his hands and that he need not take steps to ship it to a new job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Msc.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from Report Inspector Bennett on the\nCass Indian Residential School - dated March 27, 1926.\n\nThe following were brought to my attention:\n\n1. To the rear of the main building is the Annex containing\nBakery, Kitchen, furnace room, storerooms etc. The roof\nis almost flat and roofed with ordinary roofing. It has\nleaked all along both sides clear through the ceilings.\nThe papers was placed on in cold weather. It must be\nattended to. I am told that either of two things is\nnecessary:\n   1. A light gravel roof or 2. A layer of felt and\n   good roofing on top placed on in warm weather.\n\n2. The cement floor of the playground and the basement is so\nsoft that when the children are there, as they have to\nbe many occasions, their feet continually scrape off\nthe top. The result is that a fine dust is floating in\nthe air and the cement floor will finally turn to sand.\nIt has been patched already. It needs some kind of\nsoft asphalt top. This is also true of the corridor;\nlaundry and children's washroom, all in the basement.\nThe whole trouble is that the cement top of the floor was\nnot \"cement\" enough. It needs a top coating of some\nkind. I had a similar experience with a basement in\nSault Ste. Marie.\n\n3. There is urgent need of a root house for keeping\nvegetables and potatoes. At present the potatoes etc.\nhave had to be placed in the Men's dining room with\nwindows always open and steam turned off.\n\nInspector Bennett is very\nefficient & his remarks are worthy of\nconsideration.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 7, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is considering a wood floor for the recreation room in the basement of the McIntosh Indian Residential School. Please secure an estimate for edge grain fir flooring for this room and submit it to the Department for attention.\n\nI wish to refer to the last paragraph of official letter of December 9th, last. Please make arrangements as soon as possible to have the rear portion of the building covered with galvanized iron. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont. April 2nd 1926\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr\nArchitect for the Department\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a letter of March 22nd 1926 of Inspector Bunn, I am informed that the said Mr. Bunn reported on some material and especially a barge left over at the McIntosh School by the contractor J.H. Simmons and recommended that these be taken over and paid for the benefit of the School; but as the funds were not available at the time, the Department could not take it over then, and Inspector Bunn advise me to bring the matter to the attention of the Department. This material and especially the barge is certainly of a great use for the School. In fact the barge is absolutely necessary and if contractor Simmons will take away this one, we would have another one built, which certainly will cost more than the amount asked for this one by the contractor.\n\nSo I would beg to recommend that the same material and barge be bought.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 9, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Orr has handed me your letter of the 2nd instant, and I am pleased to state that the Department has asked Mr. Inspector Bunn to prepare a voucher in favour of J. H. Simmons for the barge and lumber which the contractor left at McIntosh.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 24th, last, in which you recommended that a barge and some lumber, left at the McIntosh Indian Residential School by the contractor, be purchased for the use of the school. You will please prepare a voucher, in duplicate, in favour of Mr. J. H. Simmons, for $277.94 - for the barge, $270; and lumber, $107.94. The face of the voucher should carry an explanation similar to that of your letter.\n\nThe voucher, in duplicate, should be certified by yourself and directed to the Rev. Principal of the School. Ask him to certify to it that the goods were received and the prices were fair and just, and to forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nApril 14 For 1 Barge, dimension 9' x 33'.\n\nThis barge was built by Contractor Simmons to be used in carrying the materials used in building McIntosh Indian Residential School, the value of which is estimated to be $265.00 on a gross basis. The school people have found that this barge is necessary for doing their work of making hay for the school, moving their haying equipment and the horses from the school to where the hay is growing, and carrying the hay when loaded back to the school. The barges are used also from time to time for carrying fuel from the school to the school. In fact a barge of this size is needed in many ways in handling the work. It is in good order.\n\nCost of barge as stated above, when new, $365.00\n\nLess\n\nFor Depreciation through use say 30% approx. $115.00\n\nNote:\n\npresent value on a fair basis.\n\nThese goods:\n\n1 lot of material left over by the Contractor Mr. J.H.

Father Perrault,\nIndian Training School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWe beg to quote you the sum of Two Hundred and Twenty Five Dollars ($225.00) for roofing as pointed out by Mr. E. Gauthier, and includes the following work:\n\n(1) Swab the entire surface of the present ready roofing with Asphalt and while hot imbed therein Asphalt Saturated Felt.\n\n(2) Swab over the Asphalt Saturated Felt surface with Asphalt and imbed therein a thick Asphalt Saturated Cap Sheet.\n\n(3) Swab over the entire surface with Asphalt so the surface of the cap sheet will be protected from the weather and will be a protection for walking on.\n\nThe Cap Sheet and felt would be brought down over the edge and securely fastened with special Kleets and would also be run under the metal flashing around chimney and pent-house so no water could get under.\n\nIn consideration of the price quoted it is understood this could only be done if the Asphalt Mastic Flooring were installed and this work done while the workmen were on the job.\n\nYours truly,\n\nVulcan Asphalt and Supply Co.

Sir:\n\nIndian Training School, McIntosh, Ont.\n\nWe beg to quote the sum of Eight Hundred and Sixty Dollars ($860.00) for installing TRINIDAD LAKE ASPHALT MASTIC flooring, an average of 1\" in thickness, in basement of above building, an approximate area of 3340 sq.ft. as pointed out by Mr. Gauthier, and included the following areas:\n\nBoys' Play Room including Lavatory. Basement.\nGirls' \" \" \" \" \"\nChildren's Dining Room. \"\nStaff Dining Room. \"\nLaundry. \"\nCorridors. \"\n\nIt is understood that in consideration of above price the Institute would supply free to us Sand, Cordwood, Meals for 3 men for 5 days including sleeping quarters in construction shack, Haulage of material and kettles from McIntosh station to the job, and of kettles and remaining materials back to station.\n\nIt is also understood you would remove free the top dressing of cement from floors to be done, and remove same from building ready for workmen to lay the floor.\n\nRegarding the laundry room, we would grade this to make a fall to the two drains.\n\nThe floor we would install would be hard enough to resist standing weights, and finished off in good, workmanlike manner.\nThis is in reply to your letter of Dec. 9th, 1925, 130-7-5, and of April 7th, 1926.\n\nI visited McIntosh School on Wednesday the 14th inst. and took up the subject matter of your letters.\n\nThe cost of covering the flat-roofed portion of the school with galvanized iron and seamless flashing would be about $550.00, and the cost of covering 3340 sq.ft. of concrete flooring with sleepers and 1\"x 3\" edge grain fir flooring would be about $870.00. This price includes oiling. While discussing this matter, the principal and Father Provincial Beys showed me the enclosed letters from the Vulcan Asphalt and Supply Co. which are self-explanatory.\n\nYou can see that it would cost $860.00 to lay Trinidad Lake Asphalt Mastic Flooring as compared with $870.00 for fir flooring, and the school would do a certain amount of the work. The same company, if this work were awarded to them, would be prepared to do similar work on the roof in question at a price of $225.00 in addition with $40.00 for the galvanized iron, which would be a good saving, besides which the Fathers have advice which says the joints in the iron roofing would eventually break at the solder from the temperature changes, and that water would back up from the fringe of ice on the cold cornice, making leaks on account of the very low pitch. Of the flooring they say that even edge grain fir will splinter, and that in every way asphalt is superior, being put in all their own new schools.\n\nYou will note that the Principal has obtained estimates for flooring boys' and girls' playrooms, dining rooms, lavatories, laundry and corridors. Your letter asks for prices on the recreation room only, but that statement is useless doing G.M.R. room since the concrete dust would be carried from other parts and erode the fir flooring.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nConcerning the deepening of the culvert, Mr. E.W. Robinson, Divisional Engineer of the Canadian National Railways wrote to the principal on Feb. 8th., and the principal replied on Feb. 15th. stating what was required, since which time nothing has been done in the matter. The principal asks that the work on this should be started as soon as possible, and that the engineer should see him before commencing.\n\nThe principal says that Mr. Orr promised the school a five horsepower electric motor for the laundry. The one at present doing this work is a gas engine needed and intended for wood-cutting outside. Please bring this to the attention of Mr. Orr.\n\nI should be pleased to know, as soon as you can decide, what is to be done in these several matters.\n\nThe fire-escapes at the school are now installed, and are quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nE/A\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 3, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI should be grateful for a recommendation from you as to the most necessary improvements at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. Approximately $2500 is available for the fiscal year, nearly $400 of which has been expended. The original intention was to erect a small barn, a hen-house and a hog-pen; but recent reports would indicate the advisability of an early covering over the flat roof and the reflooring of portions of the basement. The cost of the reflooring in Asphalt Mastic is $850 and the roofing, $225. Please indicate if these improvements should be effected before the outbuildings are proceeded with. In other words, what do you consider most important this year for the satisfactory conduct of the school?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Ferreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 108-20 of the 21st ultimo, with reference to flooring and roofing at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.

I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Rev. Father Perreault.\n\nConcerning an electric motor for the laundry, Mr. Orr states that 3 horse power is required and not 5. You may purchase a motor, after securing competitive prices if possible, and arrange for shipment to the school.\n\nI am pleased to note that the fire escapes have been satisfactorily installed.\n\nYou will receive a further communication concerning the deepening of the culvert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ice house of the cost of about $1500.00 and hen house or the cost of about $200.00. For the root cellar we were granted $200.00, but on recommendation of Mr. Attwood we came to the conclusion that we should enlarge the said root cellar to be able to have the water tank in it. For ice house we were granted the price of the material.\n\nFor the barn and hog pen we will be able to manage till next year.\n\n(P.S.) The root cellar and ice house had been granted last year.\n\nHoping that you will be able to grant us these necessary improvements, this year\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nMay 21, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThere is an item ($2500.00) in the Main Estimates, 1926-27, for the purpose of erecting outbuildings at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. An expenditure of $400 has been authorized, leaving a balance of $2100. The Rev. Principal and Mr. Indian Agent Edwards agree that two improvements to the main building are more urgent than the provision of outbuildings. It appears that the basement floor should be finished with Asphalt Mastic and that the flat roof portion of the building should be suitably covered. ($225). Mr. Orr and I recommend these improvements.\n\nSomething more than $1000 remains for outbuildings. I recommend that the Rev. Principal be so informed that he be asked to state which outbuildings are most urgently needed and that the Department grant $1100 for materials - the school to be responsible for the labour. From past correspondence, it appears that a root cellar, provision shed, ice-house and hen-house are most important, at an estimated inclusive cost of $2500. $1100 worth of materials will, without doubt, meet some of the need.

It is understood that the institution will supply sand, cordwood, board for the workmen, etc. The same company should do similar work on the flat portion of the roof for the sum of $225. Please make arrangements without delay. When the work is completed to your satisfaction, you may forward a certified voucher.\n\nApproximately $1,000 is available for outbuildings. I understand that a root-cellar, provision-shed, ice-house and hen-house are most important. The Rev. Principal should get out a list of material which can be purchased for this sum and submit it to you for the Department's consideration, indicating the buildings that will be erected, provided that the management will be responsible for all labour costs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Motor for the laundry, as when a 6 H.P. Motor is thrown in operation when the washing machine is going the speed drops considerably and makes quite a time to pick up again. This goes to prove that a 3 H.P. Motor is not sufficient for the same work and will be overloaded, with the possible consequence of burning itself. The same thing happened at Fort Frances School 2 years ago and I had to replace a motor too small for the work. This same motor had been rewound some time before. I have also installed a 5 H.P. Motor in the Kenora School, some years ago, for about the same size of machines and it is not too much.\"\n\nFrom the above you will see the School Authorities are insistant in getting a 6 H.P. instead of a 3 H.P.\n\nI shall be glad if you will place this letter before Mr Orr, and he can give me instructions as to what I should purchase, when he meets me at Sieux Lookout June 3rd, in connection with the new school there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont.

Scott\nSuperintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I am about to start on a mission errand amongst the Indians I greatly feel the necessity of a small water craft for the journey. You are aware of the fact that we have only one gasoline boat for the School and that same is needed every day. The water route is the only one between School and Station, and besides, this boat is too large for my purpose. I have to travel through shallow water and make portages. Therefore, I would appreciate very much the favor of a strong row boat about 15 feet in length with an overboard motor. Besides those monthly trips this small boat would be very handy when there is no freight to carry.\n\nI also hope that same would not be deducted from the amount allotted to this School.\n\nYours very Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 31, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the supplying of a strong 18 ft. row boat with outboard motor for the use of the school. I should be grateful if you would submit to Mr. Indian Agent Edwards, so that he can attach his recommendation, prices for the type of boat and engine that is required, indicating where purchase can be made.

This is a very fine sea worthy craft and we can thoroughly recommend it. The price F.O.B McIntosh, Ont., will be $170.00.\n\nThe Johnson 2\u00bd H.P. Light Twin Motor will drive this boat admirably and give perfect satisfaction, coupled with economy in usage. The price of 2\u00bd H.P.

School - dated October 9th, 1926.\n\nThis school needs a case for books and material made by the children. There isn't a single place to keep children's artistic efforts away from dust. I recommend a book case that can be purchased from Eatons for $16.75 - 5 ft. high - Catalogue No.28L-319-page 511. This is really necessary.\n\nThere is linoleum on all hall floors. The stairs are not so covered. Unless they are covered the step will be worn and in time become unsightly. Onroll 6 ft. wide and of 25 yds. will do the stairs. Color dark brown Battleship Linoleum. It will pay in the long run.\n\nI spent some time visiting all over the school plant. One thing is quite evident. It will never be a finished plant until the following are provided for:\n\n1. Root house and provision house (now kept in playroom)\n2. A Modern poultry house.\n3. An ice house for ice and storing meat and butter.\n4. A barn for 12 horses - 4 cows and hay and feed. (40'x25')\n5. More land will have to be cleared and broken.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nOttawa, October 25th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a recent report on the McIntosh Residential School, Inspector Bennett states that the school requires a case for books and children's work. He recommends a bookcase that can be secured from the T. Eaton Company for $16.75 - Catalogue No. 25L-319. If you consider that this is necessary, you may arrange for its purchase either from the T. Eaton Company or locally at approximately the same price.\n\nThe Inspector also suggests that some covering should be placed on the stairs.

Are new fire escapes required and, if so, of what type? You might let me have a full report in this connection. The reason for this letter is insufficient information on our files concerning this important matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G.

April 13th, 1927.\n\nCapt'n Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn order to keep the school in good condition it would be necessary to oil the floor and in some rooms give them a coat of varnish.\n\nYou must have notice also that some walls would need to be painted. For these purposes we would need:\n5 gallons boiled linseed oil\n5 \" floor varnish.\n10 \" white flat wall paint.\n1 \" white enamel\n2 \" turpentine.\n6 Paint brushes, assorted.\n\nBesides I would ask you to furnish the school with 1000 ft. of lumber in mixed widths. Up to this time we used the lumber left from construction. There are still cupboards, shelves etc. to do, and there is no more lumber left for the purpose.\n\nI would also thank the Dept. if games would be furnished for the children; foot balls and indoor balls.\n\nI intend to have the carpentry and painting done by the boys. The success they have had in this kind of work during the year proves to me that they would be able to do it.\n\nThere is another matter I wish to speak about. The plaster of the walls along the stairs on the boys' side is quite broken. Although we would have wished to mend the long since, I could not find anyone to do the work. Even Brother Gauthier says he is unable to do it, so if you could send a man with the necessary material, hardwall etc. to do the work I would be very grateful to you.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nC. Perreault, O.M.I.\n\nP.S. The total cost for material, paint lumber and games will be around $150.00. For the repairs of the walls I have no idea.\n\nC.P.\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter received from the principal of McIntosh Indian Residential School, making a request for paint, 1000 ft. of lumber, footballs etc. Providing it seems right that the Department should bear the expense, I would recommend his requests, which would cost about $150, as I agree with the principal that in addition to the necessity involved it would be a good thing for the boys.\n\nWith reference to the plaster, I think it should be attended to.

You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. The work in having the painting and carpentering done should be performed by the older boys and the staff without expense to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the plaster, you may arrange to have a competent man carry out these repairs. No unnecessary expense, however, should be incurred. You should also supply any material required for this work.

Bunn,\nInspector,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile making the repairs caused by the recent fire in the Drying Room at the McIntosh Res. School, we made a thorough investigation as to the origin of the fire. Everything indicates that the fire was caused by the stove which was used both for heating the flat-irons and drying the linen. At the time of the fire the stove was quite alive and most probably a spark blown from the kindling wood, or a back flue, into the linen or on the floor set the fire. With all the possible and careful attention this stove was always a source of danger.\n\nAs the same thing may happen again, I would suggest to discard this stove and replace the ordinary flat-irons by electric irons; the heat costing us very little, nay nothing, it would be a saving besides the security.\n\nRegarding the drying of the linen, having ample good supply of steam from the boiler in the laundry, I would suggest to install a Steam press, or a Tumbler preferred.\n\nIn my opinion these two improvements would minimize the causes of fire in the future.\n\nIn this fire we lost approximately $250.00 worth of linen and clothes. Do you believe that the Department would be satisfied to help us in repairing our loss?\n\nThanking you for your past favours and the keen interest you have always shown to our school,\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nMcIntosh Indian School\nMcIntosh Ont.\nWinnipeg, 26th July, 1927.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nI received the enclosed letter from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at McIntosh.\n\nIn this connection the Reverend Principal called at my office on the 18th instant, and he discussed the effects of the fire that recently occurred in the Laundry of the Shhoal at McIntosh. After a short talk, I suggested that he better write me a letter and therein set out clearly what caused the fire and the effects of same.\n\nThis is done in the enclosed letter. Apparently the stove in question is the cause and is a menace, even with most careful supervision.\n\nWith reference to a Steam Dryer or a Tumbler for drying the clothes etc handled in the Laundry, please note the remarks of the Reverend Principal. I think that a Tumbler would be preferable and for safety and efficient service in this work would be the best. I beg recommend this matter for consideration.\n\nThe Reverend Principal made reference to the loss of linen clothes, estimated by School to be about $250.00. They would be very grateful if this loss could be replaced, if not altogether assistance to replace would be appreciated, and I beg to submit this request with a recommendation for consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I note that the recent fire was evidently caused by the stove in the laundry which is used for heating irons. You may authorize the Reverend Principal to take steps to line the danger points with galvanized iron or asbestos. He should be informed that the Department does not supply electric irons at Indian residential schools. His request for a dry tumbler has been noted for future estimates.\n\nYou may inform him that the Department regrets there are no funds available for the purpose of reimbursing the school management for their clothing losses at the time of the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

R. Bunn,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to our letter 21st of July concerning the recent fire in the laundry of the Indian Boarding School at McIntosh, upon closer examination I have found that the laundry stove, as well as the pipes, which were through the fire, are unfit for further service in their former capacity. The stove is badly warped and the pipes twisted. It would certainly not be safe to make any further use of them.\n\nWith reference to the laundry, the school, to avoid any future danger and providing that the department would authorise the wiring for installation of electric ironing, are willing to furnish the irons for same. Estimate for said wiring, which has been taken, is between $25.00 and $30.00. We consider that this would be a very safe device and are most anxious to do whatever we can in order to avert a recurrence of the past misfortune.\n\nWe hope that the department will lend to this proposal, their favourable consideration and grant us as soon as possible their authorisation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nMcINTOSH, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He would like authority for the expenditure of Three Hundred ($300.00) Dollars for lumber and material for a new boat. The building and all labor cost would be borne by the school and it could be built this winter.\n\nI would therefore like to receive authority for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFE/MG.\nOttawa, October 18, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the present condition of the hull of the launch at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $300 in the purchase of lumber and material to build a new boat during the coming winter. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained and the material purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is to be understood that the building of the boat and all labour costs will be borne by the school authorities.\n\nAfter the material has been forwarded, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He states that the effluent from the septic tank is discharged directly into Canyon Lake, and that the drainage from the stable cannot help but drain into the water also.\n\nIt is the understanding of our District Officer that the design of this disposal system included the use of field tiles to treat the effluent from the septic tank, but that these tiles were never installed, and the effluent is run directly into the lake.\n\nThis information is for your attention, and I should be glad if you would advise what action you propose taking.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Health.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa - Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott\nSuperintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the Department's desire of receiving a full report on the fire escape facilities at this school, I beg to say that the McIntosh Ind. Res. School is equipped with two pole fire escapes erected toward each end at the rear of the building.\n\nAs I stated in a letter to Mr. J. D. McLean May 6th 1927 the only exits to the said fire escapes are ordinary slide panel windows. These render drilling tedious in Summer and practically impossible in Winter when the storm shades are on.\n\nI would therefore be most grateful if the Department would furnish French windows and storm shades opening outside for the exits of the dormitories and infirmary. Five permanent step-ladders are also necessary to reach the exits to the fire escapes.\n\nRe Fire extinguishers, all these on hand have been duly recharged but as their number is insufficient, I would beg the Dept. to supply nine Foamite fire extinguishers and six Fire-Cans. These would be most useful for cases of emergencies both at the School and at the Power House where there are no fire protections whatever.\n\nTwelve fire axes would moreover be needed.\n\nLightning arrestor at the Power House to protect the Dynamos would also be needed in cases of electrical storms.\n\nI only submit these suggestions to your kind attention and remain\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nC. Perreault\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 26, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease ship addressed to Rev. G. Perreault, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, McIntosh, Ont., the following fire equipment:\n\n- 3 Accurate 5 Gal. Pump Tanks, complete with non-freeze charges,\n- 2 - 1\u00bd Quart Pyrene Extinguishers, complete with charges.\n\nThese should be supplied at your lowest possible price.\n\nPlease forward your account, in duplicate, to Rev. Father Perreault, which should cover the cost of the extinguishers F.O.B. McIntosh, Ont. He is being informed that the order has been placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made. For your information I may say that McIntosh is on the C.N.R. about 160 miles east of Winnipeg.\n\nI would request that you make early shipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nPyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd.,\n1197-1207 King St. W.,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the fire equipment at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that we are today placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, to forward charges prepaid, addressed to you, McIntosh, Ont., the following:\n\n3 - 5 gal. Pump Tanks, complete with non-freeze charges,\n2 - 1/2 Qt. Pyrene Extinguishers, complete with charges.\n\nIt is considered that these extinguishers would be more satisfactory at this school. When they arrive, and with the Foamite extinguishers which have already been supplied, it is considered that there should be an ample supply of extinguishers on hand if they are properly distributed at strategic points throughout the school and at the power house. The 2 - 1/2 quart extinguishers are to be placed in the power house, as they are suitable where oil and electricity are used.\n\nThe above firm will send their account, in duplicate, to you, and upon receipt of the extinguishers, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the department in order that payment can be made.\n\nRelative to your request that 5 step ladders be supplied, in order to reach from the fire escape to the ground, I may say that this would give easy means of access to the dormitories. If these ladders were not needed, could it be arranged that access to the building could not be obtained? You might furnish an estimate of the cost of having French windows and storm shades opening outside from the exits of the dormitories and the infirmary, and you should also obtain prices for the supplying of 6 fire axes, and the cost of installing a lightning arrester at the power house to protect the dynamos in case of an electrical storm.\n\nWhen we have full information as to the cost involved in carrying out the above requirements, consideration will then be given to authorizing the same. Your early reply giving the information asked for is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nOffice of the Kanaza, Ont., Indian Agency,\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 4033, amounting to $509.05 in favour of Ray Father O. Paereault, Q.M.I., Indian Residential School, McIntosh, Ont., for Labour costs incurred in clearing land at school.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 130-7-5 dated July 18th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of November 10th with enclosures from the Department of Indian Affairs respecting the sewerage system of the Indian Residential School at McIntosh, Ontario. In a letter from Mr. J. D. McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs to Mr. W. J. Bell, Deputy Minister of Health, he states \"In reply I beg to say that the Dominion Water Power Branch is being requested to immediately furnish me with a report as to the reason why the effluent from the septic tank has been made to discharge directly into the lake\".\n\nThe present sewerage system of the McIntosh Indian School was constructed in the fall of 1924 following a report prepared by Mr. Craig which outlines the requirements considered necessary for the proper disposal of the school sewage. This report, dated October 25, 1924, recommended that the septic tank, together with the disposal bed, be installed. The disposal bed was included in the design of the system because Canyon lake was used as a summer resort and it was not considered advisable to discharge untreated sewage directly into the lake. In November instructions were received to install the system as designed with the exception of the disposal beds. At that time the school building was still under construction; it was late in the season, and the Department of Indian Affairs decided to leave the construction of the disposal beds over to the following year, or until such time as it was considered advisable to have the disposal beds installed.\n\nThe sewerage system and septic tank have now been in operation nearly three years and from reports and inspections are giving complete satisfaction. The effluent from the tank itself is practically free of solids and is quite clear, and although immediately at the sewer outlet the water of the lake is discolored and cloudy, this is caused by the waste from the laundry which, after being by-passed around the septic tank, joins the sewer outlet and discharges through the same pipe into the lake.\n\nThe discharge of the sewer from the school into the lake will no doubt cause a certain amount of contamination as the main function of the septic tank is to break up solids and it only reduces to a small extent the dangerous bacteria. Whether this contamination is at present dangerous or whether it is made harmless by dilution a short distance from the sewer outlet can only be determined by having water samples taken at various points and analyzed.\n\nThe Director,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDept. of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nThe school is situated on a bay about a mile south of the CNR crossing and there are no summer residents between the railway crossing and the school. It is highly improbable that any summer residents would build in this bay because of the poor passage under the railway tracks. In view of the fact that there are so few summer cottages on the lake, and also that the effluent from the septic tank must be largely diluted and eliminated before reaching the outer lake, it seems to me that if samples of the water were taken it could be shown there was no danger. I recommend that the matter might be taken up personally with the Ontario Department of Health and the matter of installing disposal beds held until cottages were built closer to the school.\n\nWith respect to the Doctor's comment on the stables, I can only say that conditions, in my opinion, are not different from those of settlers and farmers elsewhere in the Province of Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. K. MADDWOOD\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nAttention Departmental Engineer,\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to my letter of November 16th regarding the sewage disposal system for the McIntosh Indian School, I enclose here-with Mr. Attwood's report thereon, from which you will notice that Mr. Attwood recommends the analysis of samples of water to ascertain whether there is any contamination. Whether this should be done now or in the Spring when the ice has left the lake is not stated, and I have asked Mr. Attwood what he would recommend in regard to that.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to a drying tumbler for the laundry at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I trust that certain funds will be available for improvements at your school next year. Parliament is being asked for a small appropriation for the purpose. It was proposed to erect a small barn, to provide a boat house and to purchase a little live stock. You might let me know if the drying tumbler is of more importance than any of these items. If so, it may be possible to arrange purchase in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G.

Funn, dated August 6th, informed me that the said Tumbler had been noted by the Department for future estimates and that it would be provided in due course.\n\nI would be grateful if the Department would not too far delay in supplying the said Dryer as it would certainly be the best for safety.\n\nI have the honour to be, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School,\nDelivered to McIntosh, Ont.\n\nSOLD TO Dominion Government,\nDept.

As the cold weather set in at this time it was considered advisable to leave the painting of the balance until spring. This will necessitate the purchase of about 15 gallons more of enamel paint and 16 gallons more of creosote oil. The quantity purchased was considered sufficient as before deciding on the amount required the matter was taken up with the manager of the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company, who estimated the amount that would be required for this work. As it turned out, their estimate was quite far astray and it will therefore be necessary, as stated above, be necessary for the Department of Indian Affairs to authorize the supplying of more paint next spring when the painting of the balance of the penstock can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

C. Ferroglit, S.M.,\nMcIntosh School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Ashwood,\n\nRe McIntosh Indian School.\n\nOn December 22nd, 1927, the Department of Indian Affairs wrote with reference to the power development at the McIntosh Indian Residential School the following letter:\n\n\"The Department is advised that a considerable amount of water is leaking through the earth embankment near the dam of the Hydro-Electric Power Plant at the McIntosh School, near McIntosh, Ont. As it is feared that considerable damage might result owing to the increasing amount of water lost, I would like to know if one of your engineers at Winnipeg could be instructed to make an inspection of the existing condition at the first opportunity and furnish me with a report and estimate of the cost of the work required to put this dam in a state of repair.\"\n\nFollowing instructions to have an engineer visit the school and prepare a report on this matter, the undersigned visited McIntosh and inspected the works on the 4th and 5th of this month.\n\nWhile at the school, in addition to examining the conditions referred to in the Department of Indian Affairs letter, opportunity was taken to make an inspection of the hydro-electric plant, the water supply, and the sewage system and in the following memorandum a description is given of the present condition and the operation of the different systems.\n\nHYDRO-ELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT.\n\nOn taking up the question referred to in the Department of Indian Affairs letter with Father Perrault and Brother Adolph it was found the earth embankment referred to...\nIn the letter is the high water channel located about half a mile west of the school, which had already been inspected during the past year and reports and estimates of costs submitted with reference to closing up this channel. These reports comprise a memorandum dated July 5th and a memorandum dated September 16th, 1937.\n\nOn January 4th last Forest Lake was standing at an elevation of 110, or two feet below the spillway elevation. At this elevation there is no leakage through the high water channel at the present time, though Brother Adolph thinks there would be a certain amount of seepage during open water, and fears that the spring run-off may cause more erosion with consequent further loss of head and storage. It was suggested to them that it would be advisable to leave this matter until the spring run-off and by careful inspection note if there was any additional erosion which would warrant the immediate construction of a dam to stop all flow through this channel. To this the school authorities agreed and stated that their only idea in pressing the matter was that by delaying construction the expense might be increased owing to the further washing away of the channel necessitating the building of a more extensive dam. As the high water of last year only washed away the accumulation of silt and did not actually enlarge the channel itself, the danger of enlargement from the coming spring run-off is not considered very great. In view of this it is recommended that the damming of this channel be left until after break-up at which time if an inspection then shows that the erosion warrants it, the dam can be constructed during the coming summer.\n\nThe inspection of the concrete dam showed that the structure is in good condition, no leakage occurring throughout the entire length of the structure.\nThe 36-inch wood pipe penstock is also in good condition having had a coat of creosote oil on its entire length and 180 feet of it being painted with the special creosote black paint. The remaining 120 feet will be similarly treated during the coming summer.\n\nThe powerhouse and machinery are giving entire satisfaction. Brother Adolph, who has charge of this plant, states that no trouble of any kind has been experienced and, as he put it, \"Everything is more than satisfactory\".\n\nThe water turbine has been running continuously since the plant was first started and the school has had continuous electric service more than sufficient to meet all requirements.\n\nWATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\nThe ordinary water supply is obtained from a small Typhon plunger pump which is kept running at a slow speed continuously, any excess water beyond the requirements of the school being taken care of by a relief valve which, when necessary, discharges into and flushes the laundry drains in the basement of the school. Beyond the attention necessary for the clogging of the different machines both the electric and water systems are practically self-operating.\n\nFor fire protection or when any need arises for a large supply of water the centrifugal pump can be started up within one or two minutes. This pump has a capacity of 200 gallons per minute against a head of 50 pounds, and at the time of the fire last fall three powerful streams of water were available within four minutes after the fire was discovered. With this supply of water the fire was extinguished in fifteen minutes and both Father Perrault and Brother Adolph state that without this plentiful supply of water at a high pressure the fire could\nnot have been extinguished and that the entire school would have been destroyed.\n\nSEWAGE SYSTEM.\n\nOwing to the winter conditions it was not possible to inspect the sewage system, but it was stated that no trouble of any kind has occurred and that even during summer months there is no odor at the outlet of the sewer into the lake. It was suggested to the school authorities that as the septic tank had now been in operation nearly three years it would be advisable some time during the coming summer to inspect the tank and ascertain whether it was necessary to remove the accumulation of sludge from the bottom of the tank.\n\nJohn Craig,\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\nYour file number: 130-7-5a.\nAttention: Departmental Engineer.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of December 12 regarding the sewage disposal system for the McIntosh Indian School, with particular reference to the analysis of samples, the following letter has been received from our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg under date January 10 -\n\n\"At the time of Mr. Craig's visit to McIntosh on the 4th and 5th of this month four bottles were received by Father Perrault, Principal of the school, from the Ontario Department of Health for the taking of water samples in Canyon lake. As Father Perrault had received no word from the Department of Indian Affairs nor from the Ontario Board of Health it was explained to him that these samples were being taken as a result of the visit to the school of the Ontario Board of Health inspector last summer.\n\nA blue print showing Canyon lake in the vicinity of the school has been forwarded to Father Perrault with the different points at which it would be desirable to take samples shown in red. Two copies of this blue print are enclosed.\n\nCopy of the blue print referred to is attached. I am also enclosing a report from Mr. Craig to Mr. Attwood regarding an inspection which he has recently made of the school, with particular reference to the leakage through the earth embankment referred to in your letter of December 22.\n\nRegarding this latter matter it appears that there is no great danger of trouble at this point which is at the high water channel located about half a mile west of the school, regarding which a report was prepared under your instructions covered by memoranda dated July 5 and September 16 last.\n\nAs pointed out in Mr. Craig's report it will be advisable to delay the damming of this high water channel until after the spring run-off, when the\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nchannel can be inspected and the amount of erosion caused by this year's run-off determined. If the inspection then shows that there is danger of considerable erosion taking place a dam across this channel can be constructed during this coming summer.\n\nMr. Craig's report is to the effect that the hydroelectric development, the water supply system, and the sewage system are all functioning satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nfor M.F.C.\nJan. 25, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th of January, together with a copy of a report concerning the repairs required to the Hydro Electric Power plant at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, and I beg to advise you that the work recommended in the above mentioned report will be authorized as soon as weather conditions will permit, in accordance with your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You may also arrange with the Acme Sash & Door Co., St. Boniface, to supply the window sash and 3 step ladders at the price quoted by them, viz., $41.60, F.O.B. Winnipeg, Man. You may purchase the hardware required for the sash as mentioned in your letter. You may also arrange with Schumacher-MacKenzie-Kunnen, Ltd., Winnipeg, to install a lightning arrester on the line running from the generator to the out buildings. It is noted that their quotation for installing this arrester, complete, including transportation, is $70. I am returning herewith the quotations which you submitted.\n\nYou should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, from the above firms covering the cost of the materials supplied by each. These you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment, with the quotations enclosed attached.\n\nYou should arrange for the work in having the windows and storm sash on the exits from the dormitories and infirmary changed to open to the outside and for the delivery of the material required as soon as possible.

(RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont January 25th 1928\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter dated Jan. 17th, file 130-7-5 and signed A.F. MacKenzie, with reference to an alleged bad condition of the water supply at this School. As you will see by referring to it, this letter is very obscure and we are at a loss to see that the Department is not better informed on this subject.\n\nIn the first place, we have no reason to believe that the water is contaminated, and we have never made any complaint about it.\n\nSecondly, the intake of the water supply system is not in Canyon lake, but in the forest lake above the Dam, and consequently at least (15) fifteen feet above Canyon where is the Disposal field.\n\nThirdly, that there is no raw sewage from the School, going into Canyon lake. We have a good disposal field built according to plans approved and supplied by the Department and which is in excellent condition and in good working order.\n\nWe also have in hand a letter, dated Jan. 10th from the Dominion Water Power Branch at Winnipeg, with some instructions as how to take samples of the water to be sent to the Board of Health at Toronto.\n\nThese letters, as far as we can see, indicates that some complaints have been made to the Department by some outsiders that the water might be contaminated, although there has been no sickness or any diseases that could be attributed to, or indicate, polluted water. The first houses using Canyon lake water are at about (2) two miles distant from the School.\n\nIt does not seem just that the cause of pollution of the water of the said lake, if there is any, should be placed upon this School, for there are other sources of contamination existing, and have been existing for years before this school was erected, and yet, no body ever complaint about it. These are:\n\nFirst. Between the school and the railway line about, there is always some Indians living on the lake shore and at times in Summer, for a considerable length of time, they number between one and two hundreds and the lake is the recipient of all the filth.\n\nSecond. There is a burying place for the Indians, just across...\nthe railway Culvert, on the narrow passage of the water from the South part of Canyon to the larger part North, where there is some inhabitants. This burying place is a rock island about (100) one hundred feet in diameter and on which there is scarcely enough earth to cover the bodies with a few inches and in some cases the earth is gathered from around and banked over the bodies. If there any contamination in North part of Canyon, it seems that the points above mentioned should be considered.\n\nHowever, as the Department wishes to have water at the intake of the water supply for the School analysed we are willing to send a sample or same to the Department of Health at Toronto.\n\nOn the other hand, the request from the Dom. Water Power Branch at Winnipeg to take samples at 4 different places in Canyon below the Disposal Field indicates that we have to prove that the water is pure, and this means considerable expense considering that at this time of the year the ice is at least (3) three feet thick.\n\nIt seems only fair that this expense should be borne by those that have doubts about said water if they want to satisfy themselves as to its purity.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nST-BONIFACE, le 3 janvier, 1927.\n\nR\u00e9v.

In fact it would change the gloomy rooms of the basement into bright ones.\n\nI believe that painting, &c., could successfully be done by our older boys.\n\nThe paint, &c., needed is as follows:\n- 25 lbs white lead\n- 5 gallons floor varnish\n- 6 lbs green asphalt paint\n- 5 lbs bold linseed oil\n- 2 lbs turpentine.\n\nBesides, our boys and girls who are quite as fond of play as they are of work, would be most thankful if the Department would supply the following games:\n- 1 football\n- 2 playground balls\n- 2 catcher's mitts\n- 1 Single end striking ball, complete with swivels.\n- 1 Basket ball: Balls goals, extension brackets complete with bags\n\nHoping you will grant this request,\n\nI remain\n\nYours Sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa July 11, 1925.\n\nRev.

White Lead,\n- 5 Gals. Floor Varnish,\n- 6 Gals. Green Asphalt Paint,\n- 5 Gals. Boiled Linseed Oil,\n- 2 Gals.

After the paint, etc., has been furnished, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. It is noted that the staff and pupils will perform the labour in painting without any expense to the department.\n\nRelative to the playground equipment, I beg to say that we will place an order here to forward to you the following:\n\n- 1 Football,\n- 2 Indoor Baseball Bats,\n- 2 Baseballs,\n- 1 Basket Ball,\n- 1 Set Basket Ball Goals.\n\nThe Department does not supply the other playground equipment asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Deputy & Secretary\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of May 31, file 130-7-5 just received I am pleased to hear the barn and boat shed will be erected and that live stock will be purchased.\n\nIf the drying tumbler cannot be supplied along with these I suppose we will have to wait till the Department is prepared to purchase one which I hope will be in the near future.\n\nAs the plan for the barn may not yet be made I would ask the Department to build it large enough to contain stanchion stalls for ten milch cows, one box stall for bull, two extra box stalls for calves or other purposes, two double horse stalls, a room for harnesses and grain bins. Under these rooms a root cellar for beets & for the milch cows, would be very handy. I would also ask that the hay-loft may be spacious enough to hold at least twenty five tons of hay.\n\nAs the barn will have to be supplied with water, we would wish it built below the dam, so that the special water pipe placed in the dam to that effect may be used, 300 feet of one inch pipe would be needed for that purpose.\n\nElectric lights could also be placed in convenient places. May I also ask to have a cement floor covered with planks and also a cement trough for watering the cattles.\n\nWould not the Department also supply a manure & hay carriers.\n\nAs to how the work should be undertaken, I believe the best would be to give the contract to a man of your choice. This would give better and quicker work.\n\nI hope the Department will pardon my being so suggestive. Although I hope to meet with the Department approval I will readily comply to what may be decided.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The funds which we have available for this purpose would not be sufficient to erect a barn of the type and size requested by you. As you were informed in our letter of May 31st, funds are only available for the erection of a small barn.\n\nMr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, intends visiting your school on or about August first, next, and you might take this matter up with him. You should inform him which is the most urgent - the erection of a small barn, the building of a boat house, the purchase of live stock or the supplying of a drying tumbler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile on an inspection trip to the McIntosh school last month, the principal informed me they have four sewing machines and require another one, the same kind as previously supplied, costing about $40. He also requires about 15 rolls of barb-wire and 2 large and 2 small gates, at a total cost of about $100. (He has installed ventilators and a fan at the school at a cost of over $35., which the school has paid.)\n\nThe water has made a hole in the dam and he asks that Mr. Atwood's Department visit the school and have it repaired before the fall, otherwise considerable damage may be caused. He also wishes to know if the Department are going to build the barn for them this summer.\n\nThe principal has made a cemetery at the school and wishes to get fencing, bars and staples and also a gate. The materials will cost about $25. and the school authorities will erect this if the Department will furnish the same.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions about these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the request of the Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School to be supplied with another sewing machine and material for fencing.\n\nRelative to the sewing machine, the Department is not prepared at the present time to supply another machine for the use of this school. We note that the school has four machines on hand, and it is considered that this number should be sufficient for the number of pupils in attendance.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $125 in the purchase of barb wire, gates, staples, etc., and you may arrange for the purchase and forwarding of these materials. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained. The school authorities are to perform the labour required in erecting the fence. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, in the usual manner covering the cost of the various materials.\n\nYou will be informed in a separate communication regarding the repairs required to the dam.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Father Magrane, O.M.I., Provincial Superior of St. Boniface, who accompanied me from Winnipeg. The most urgent need is a barn, and they are willing to undertake the work if we will send them a plan as a guide and allow $3,000 for the purpose. This amount is specifically available in the Main Estimates and I wish to recommend that your authority for the activity be given. The boat house and other requirements that were named in our Estimates will have to stand until next year, as the cost of the barn is higher than originally estimated.\n\nNext year, the main building should be painted; a boat house, at a cost of $600, should be erected; a small electric mangle ($200) should be supplied and some clearing done. Later, a hen house will be needed. All these requirements have been noted for future Estimates.\n\nThe Rev. Principal is not satisfied with the Dominion Water Power Engineer's report concerning a dam to stop erosion, which might result in lowering the water behind the power plant. I intend to study this report carefully and may initiate correspondence relative to it.\n\nLater this year, it will be necessary to supply the school with a few more milch cows, and I will bring this matter to your attention when timely.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Magan, O.M.I., and he visited the McIntosh Indian Residential School this summer, I am pleased to state that authority to proceed with the erection of a barn has been secured. You, in conjunction with your Provincial Superior, should be responsible for the purchase, to the best advantage, of the materials and for the engagement of labour. The work is to be done under your supervision, on a day labour basis, and the Department agrees to meet the cost up to $5,000. Accounts for material, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded to the Department for payment. Labour costs should be met by yourself from the accountable scheme for $1,000, which is being directed to you under separate cover. You should keep labour returns, in duplicate, showing the receipt of the men employed. A supply of these forms is also going forward to you.\n\nI am enclosing plans for a barn, which may prove useful to you in the building activity. The plans call for a barn too large for the McIntosh Indian Residential School, and you will have to reduce the size to meet your requirements.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Very Rev.

The understanding is that the expenditure is not to exceed $5,000.\n\nThe best source of supply for this school is Winnipeg or St. Boniface, and I should be grateful if you would let me have the name or names of firms who should be given the order for lumber, cement and builder's hardware.\n\nJ.

Please accept our sincere thanks for this favour.\n\nI also take the opportunity to acquaint you of a few other facts: Viz.\n\nThe Taylor Singer Sewing Machine with S.A. 930 electric motor allowed for the McIntosh School such as mentioned in yours of the 15th Aug. has not yet reached destination.\n\nWith respect to the work of the telephone line I wish to recall that the Return of labour was sent on the 11th Sept. We have had the misfortune to break our large electric Motor. Will you allow us a machinist to have it repaired; It is very awkward, but still Mr Ferrier, it can't be helped and the Motor is indispensable.\n\nI have hitherto asked the quarterly School returns forms from the Agent, but most probably he has but a little supply himself for he sends just the necessary sheets for the going reports, if unwillingly I spoil one it is annoying. So will you kindly send me a supply of a few dozen forms.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for these favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 15, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to various improvements at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. By this time, you will have received a cheque for $117, which was for labour repairing the telephone line. Under separate cover, you will receive a communication regarding the sewing machine which was ordered on August 15th. Also under separate cover, there has been directed to you three dozen quarterly return forms.\n\nI note that the large electric motor needs repairing. You should secure the services of a competent mechanic and forward the account, properly certified, in duplicate, to the Department, with a full explanation of what was the cause of the damage. Consideration will then be given to paying the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G.

We were obliged to hire some men to carry off materials from there, so that it both delayed and occasioned more expenses.\n\nI dare hope the Department will allow the exceeding amount.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain, Yours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 23, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that the barn, which you were authorized to build at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, is nearing completion but that the cost will exceed the amount allowed by the sum of $200.

The estimated cost of this would be $45.00. The Brother will make the box for the sleigh at the school.\n\nThe principal also states that the furnace and the kitchen stove need repairs, the fire boxes being burned out and should be renewed. I recommend that these requests of the Principal be approved, although it appears to me that the fire-boxes should not have become burned out so soon unless there has been carelessness in leaving ashes under the grates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nE/W.\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 27, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the purchase of a set of light bob sleighs for use at the McIntosh Indian Residential School at an approximate cost of $45.

The item should be $54.20, not $59.20 as charged. Kindly make refund of $5.00, and forward it to the Department under cover of a letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

The error was a typographical one, and the total of the invoice is still correct with the exception of the third item which should read $14.50 and not $7.25. We are enclosing copies of our invoice number 28379 and would ask that favor us with remittance as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\nTHE J.H. ASHDOWN HARDWARE CO.\nLimited.\n\nPer:\n\nHMP.\nKenora, Ont.\nJanuary 10th\n\nAsst. Deputy & Sec'y,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nWhile on an inspection trip to the McIntosh Indian Residential school last week, the Principal informed me that they are having trouble with the water pipe between the school and the barn, as it was continually freezing. He informed me that if we would supply the material, lumber $35.00 and piping $25.00, that the school would be responsible for making the box and protecting same; and in the spring they would bury the pipes so as to experience no further trouble.\n\nTherefore I informed him that he could order this material, at a cost not exceeding $60.00, as I felt sure that you would authorize this most necessary expenditure. I would be glad to receive the necessary authority for my files.\n\nThe school authorities also asked for two knock-down cupboards for the playroom and the sewing rooms. I will obtain prices on these and submit same for your consideration.\n\nThe Principal showed me Dept. letter 130-7-9, of October 5th last, re. appropriation of $2000.00 for digging the culvert under the C.N.Ry. The Principal informs me that he gave the Father Provincial, in October or November, 1927, a copy of a contract which had been given him by Mr. Fred McIntosh, who was the Divisional Engineer on that section of the railroad, and in which it was stated that the Railway authorities would see to it that the water in the culvert would be at least 4 feet deep. I would suggest, therefore, that you ascertain if this work should not be done by the Railway, without any charge to our Department. It would be cheaper and better to have the work done before the ice goes out in March, instead of in June. There is only 12 inches of water in the culvert at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nOttawa, January 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department that you have authorized the Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School to incur an expenditure of approximately $50 in carrying out the work required to prevent freezing of the water pipe between the school and barn. The action taken by you in this matter is approved. When the work is completed, you should forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and piping required.\n\nWhen you have received prices on the two cupboards for the playroom and sewing room, you should submit same for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to the last paragraph of your letter with reference to deepening the culvert under the Canadian National Railway, I beg to say that you will be advised later regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He requires this to get wood for fuel, and to protect the school from fire. He would also like to know what amount the Department is prepared to spend on the school this year, and also if arrangements are being made for the addition as requested in the estimates.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nVoted $1424.0\n\nCulvert $2500.\nFencing $1200.\nSmall fence $200.\nPost hole $500.\nPlow handles $600.\nClearing $500.\nTotal $3550.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI visited the McIntosh Residential School last week. The Principal wishes to know if he can purchase anew dynamo, 10 H.P., for the power house as the small one now in use is too heavily loaded. The small one could be used for sawing wood, etc.\n\nHe also requests refills for five Foamide Fire Extinguishers.\n\nBookcase for the school room (cost about $25.00)\nFour (4) dear springs\nNew plow - cost about $20.00 and repairs to old one.\nBread slices and potato peeler\n3 gals. Turpentine\n15 \" White flat wall paint,\n10 \" boiled linseed oil,\n10 \" Floor Varnish,\n2 \" White Enamel,\n25 lbs. black lead.\nAlso burlap for the passages and smoke room, including glue and strips. The School authorities to be responsible for the work.\n\n1000 ft. lumber, planed two sides for partitions - cost about $45.\nAn amount for clearing and brushing land.\n\nThe Principal informs me that nothing has been done as regards deepening the culvert under the C.N. Railway. It will only be possible to get through with a small boat unless this is done and he has over 1000 logs he wishes to get through and has to use the large boat for bringing the supplies from the station to the school.\n\nThere is also a large hole in the concrete dam which should be attended to while the water is low. This has been reported before.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th instant, with reference to improvements at the Maltese Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that the O. R. has been requested to prepare a channel under the railway culvert, 4 ft. deep by 10 ft. wide. I expect this work will be attended to without delay. The request for a new system is being given consideration at the present time and you will be further advised. The refills for the fire extinguishers are being ordered by the Department and will be sent direct to the school.\n\nYou may expend $20 in the purchase of a new plough and you may supply for the use of the school the turpentine, paint, oil, varnish, enamel and black lead requested by the Rev. Principal. You might get an estimate of the cost of supplying burlap for the corridors. You may purchase 1,000 ft. of lumber, at an estimated cost of $45. The question of filling in the hole in the concrete dam is receiving the attention of the departmental engineer and you will be further advised. A separate communication will be addressed to you regarding extra land, which has been requested for the use of the school.\n\nWith reference to the Principal's request concerning the Department's proposals for improvements at the Maltese School this year, I have to say that there are no funds for the purpose of an addition. $500.00 is available for purchasing land and $400 for painting the main building. Funds were also provided for the channel under the culvert. There has been some correspondence regarding a frigidaire, a small mangle and a boat house; but these improvements will have to stand until the cost of the other work has been determined.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter, which you may forward to the Rev. Principal for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am enclosing herewith cheque No. 1009 for $500 to pay for the labour only, in carrying out the above work. For your information, I may say that a sum of $500 is available for clearing land and $500 for painting the main building. These amounts include the cost of labour and material and should not, if possible, be exceeded. You should arrange for the purchase of the paint and other material required, obtaining an account, in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department for payment. The enclosed cheque is to be spent in paying for labour only.\n\nTime sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. A supply of forms for this purpose is enclosed herewith. These returns should be prepared in duplicate at the end of each week and signed by the individual labourer in each case. These should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department in accounting for the expenditure of the enclosed cheque. Should there be any amount left over when the work is completed you should return such to the Department, or, if a further advance for labour is required, you should make a request for same, stating the amount. You should see that a good grade of paint is used and that the labour is satisfactorily performed.\n\nYou may also expend an amount of approximately $45 in the purchase of burlap, glue and strips for the passages and smoke room. Please obtain an itemised account, in duplicate, which you should certify and forward to the Department for payment. It is to be understood that the school authorities will be responsible for the work of installing the burlap.\n\nYou will be advised later regarding your request for a 10 H.P. dynamo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

We will need at least $500.00 more.\n\nBy your letter of May 30th, #130-7-5, the amount of $600.00 is supposed to cover the work and expenses made on the main building, but since that time Mr. Ferrier met in St.-Boniface Rev.

You should keep the cost as low as possible, having in view the performing of a satisfactory job and the using of a good grade of paint, oils, etc. In the carrying out of all this work you should be guided by the instructions contained in official letter of May 30th, last.\n\nThe Department does not consider it necessary to apply stain to the roofs of the buildings and is not prepared to incur any expenditure for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School  \nMcIntosh Ont. August 4th. 1929\n\nMr. Frank Edwards  \nIndian Agent  \nGenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter July 26 # 108-20, I beg to inform you that from the three items mentioned in your letter: frigidaire, boat house and mangle, two are absolutely necessary, frigidaire and boat house. The coat for the first one as you were informed by Brother Eugen will be around $1600.00; the boat house will cost about $800.00.\n\nI will be very disappointed if at least those two items are not granted this year. I am asking them since four years and they always replied that they have no funds for that. Besides that Mr. Ferrier told Rev. Father Magnan, our provincial at St.-Boniface that all my requests were granted.\n\nAs for the mangle, it will be very useful and helpful for the Sisters, but as there is no funds again I could wait till next year.\n\nAs for the Culvert nothing has been done yet and now it is quite nearly impossible to go to the Station even with a light boat on account of the low water which is decreased all the time.\n\nAs for painting, the work will be finish in two or three weeks, but the amount granted for that was quite half enough. To have the work done 1st class as the Department asked, we needed more than $600.00. I notified already the Dept. about that but did not receive any reply. I did not stop the work, thinking that the Dept. will agree to pay all these expenses.\n\nHoping that my request will be granted\n\nI remain, Sincerely Yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6219, file 472-5, part 2)\nAugust 15th, 1929\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a letter from the Principal of the McIntosh Residential School re Frigidaire, boat house and mangle, which I enclose herewith.\n\nI will be glad if you will advise me regarding same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 21, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your L06-20 of the 15th instant, with reference to a frigidaire, a boat house and a small mangle for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that funds can be found for the construction of a boat house, at an estimated cost of not more than $300. If this entire amount is not required for the purpose, you will please effect the resultant saving. The work should be done by day labour, under the supervision of the Rev. Principal. He should requisition to you for the materials required, if he is unable to purchase them to advantage locally.\n\nI regret there are no funds for a frigidaire for this school. There is some question concerning the amount of power that we are developing there, and it is possible that there may be some change made. The matter of a frigidaire will have to stand for the time being. If a small mangle is required in the laundry this year, the school authorities will have to purchase it themselves.\n\nI note by the Principal's letter that he is enquiring regarding the additional amount for painting. In this connection, I may say that he was written on August 8th, authorizing an additional $500.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSeptember 7, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn 160-5, Father Magan's letter of August 31st lists the requests in connection with Indian residential schools in his ecclesiastical province. Among the requests, there appears the following:\n\n(a) The construction of 2 wings to the McIntosh Indian Residential School, giving sufficient accommodation for 125 children.\n\n(b) An electric mangle and frigidaire.\n\nI had conversation with Father Plourde in this connection, and he believes that, if the Department could provide an appropriation of $25,000 to $35,000, the Oblate Order would look after the construction, on a day labour basis. They propose to have the wings placed on the rear of the main building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She would like a basin with hot and cold gooseneck taps. I should be glad if you would ascertain just what is required for this installation and let the Department have an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBanora, Ont.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter #130-7-5 of the 16th instant, I only received your letter this morning re provision for water connection in the Infirmary at the McIntosh School. Whilst at the school a few days ago the Sister pointed out the necessity of water connections there and as I considered it absolutely imperative, I authorized the installation as requested by her, the cost not to exceed $40.00 and the Principal being responsible for all labor.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the water connections required in the infirmary by the Sister Superior of the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you have authorized the installation as requested by the Reverend Sister at a cost not to exceed $40, the Principal being responsible for all labour. Your action in this matter is approved, and you should forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nJanuary 29th, 1930\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School wishes me to ask for a cheque for $500 so as to enable him to clear more land at the school and to give employment to Indians before the rat season opens. The Indians in that neighborhood are very badly off and there is practically no trapping, most of the fur having been trapped out. They also wish for an amount of $500 for a chicken house for about 200 fowl. He also states that a drying tumbler is needed in the worst way.\n\nI have informed him I would bring these matters to the attention of the Department but make no recommendation as I understand most of our school funds have been expended. I took upon myself the responsibility for authorizing an extra room being made in the school for one of the Sisters, the cost not to exceed $30. Also a door being made from the bedroom to the bathroom at a cost not to exceed $15, as these were very important for the convenience in taking care of sick. He also asks for an extra $50 for moving the bath and making a few extra changes in the bathroom for the convenience of sick patients. He wishes too, extrashfts, pulleys and belting for the laundry at a cost of $25.\n\nHe informs me the hole in the dam at the school which I understand was to be repaired by the Greater Winnipeg Water District last Fall has not yet been attended to. I shall be glad if you will take this matter up with them as the work should not be delayed too long owing to the high water in the Spring enlarging the hole.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to certain requests of the Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the providing of an amount of $500 for the erection of a chicken house, I have to say that funds for this purpose will be available in our appropriation for the next fiscal year. In the meantime, however, you should obtain from the Principal a report as to the size and kind of chicken house required and how he would propose to have it erected. The building be undertaken, carried out by the school authorities - including the purchase and supplying of the materials required?\n\nI request the request to be supplied with a statement to say that the department has no objection to this purpose.\n\nI also approve of the authority given to make for one of the Sisters a partition between the bedroom to the bathroom.\n\nI also approve of an expenditure of $25 for the purpose of moving the bath and fitting the bathroom for the convenience of the laundry. This should only be forwarded when funds become available.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 3)\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont May 13th. 1930\n\nMr. Russell T. Fennell\nSupt. of Ind. Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have made several attempts to obtain from the Department three items of which we are in great need. They were promised at a certain time but have been left aside since then.\n\nFor the welfare of the children we have asked a Tumbler for the laundry. As we have explained before the present drying room is treacherously dangerous for the children's health, on account of the excessive dampness which is in the apartment when drying the clothes. At all cost this mode of drying clothes should be changed and the only way favorable should be to install a Tumbler, this we could do our share by setting it place through Brother Gauthier's ability.\n\nNext we wanted an electric mangle. We were promised one sometimes ago but as the Department had no funds we were left waiting. I would be very grateful, if after waiting so patiently it was granted to me this time. After looking several types of mangle, I found the one enclosed, the 56 Institutional Type to answer to our needs, unless the Department knows of a better one than this. I leave this all to your care.\n\nThen comes the question of a \"Frigidaire\". It was proposed one of $800.00 but as I have explained to Mr. Edwards last fall that the one at Kenora's Catholic School is not satisfactory. We have examined that of the other School at Kenora and I think one of the same type would give complete satisfaction. As long as we are to have a frigidaire we wish for a good one.\n\nTrusting that our demands be favorably heard and granted through your kindness,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 20, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to a drying tumbler, an electric mangle and a frigidaire for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I regret that there are but limited funds for improvements of this kind at your school this year. On February 5th, I wrote Mr. Indian Agent Edwards with reference to a henhouse. Perhaps you would prefer to have a drying tumbler and an electric mangle and have the henhouse stand until another year. Please write to Mr. Edwards without delay in this connection, so that the most urgent improvement can be arranged.\n\nI regret that consideration to the supplying of a frigidaire cannot be given this year. Funds are not available for the purpose and, in the second place, we have not yet made the final arrangements in connection with the power that is to be developed at the McIntosh School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 3)\nI am preparing a detailed report on the work at Pine Creek School which will be mailed to you in the near future.\n\nPro. Eugene\nThe history of laundry methods is in a very real sense the history of the industry itself. For twenty years laundry owners have been concerned primarily with problems of production. Modern living conditions have encouraged a tremendous increase in the total volume of business, and new types of work have come to progressive plants as rapidly as equipment could be devised to handle them.\n\nIt is therefore natural that the attention of equipment manufacturers and laundry engineers has been concentrated upon the technical phases of the business. As a result of this extensive research, there have been great forward steps in every department of the laundry. The devices which served a useful purpose in the old-fashioned plant have become as obsolete as the words which described them. Even the word \"laundryman\" with reference to laundryowners, and the term \"mangler\" as a name for flat work ironers, have passed out of the industry's vocabulary.\n\nVorclone equipment has played an important part in this transition from the crude devices of early days to the smooth-running, efficient, scientific, mechanical operations of the present. From an engineering standpoint, Vorclone machines are the climax of an evolution which began years ago when laundry equipment was in its rudimentary state.\n\nIt is not so long ago the clothes were wrung out by hand or in power wringers and dried in the open air. Then came the early extractors, crude adaptations of the basket centrifugals first used for spinning molasses from sugar and the era of the dry room. Now 75 per cent extraction has reached a high point of efficiency with the use of high speed extractors. Drying tumblers, too, have progressed far beyond the high temperature methods of the past to the new standards set by tumblers operating at low temperatures.\n\nToday the industry is well on the road toward new and greater development\u2014the merchandising of its perfected service is being accomplished through widespread effort and publicity. Laundryowners realize that they\ncannot reap the benefit of their years of expensive technical improvement unless they tell their customers about it. And they are constantly alert to the new opportunities for educating the public to the value of what has already been accomplished. The next logical step in the growth of the industry is the constant effort to better the quality of work through adequate and efficient equipment. The most forceful advertisement of all is the satisfied customer, and only work of the highest quality can create this type of client.\n\nHere, at this point in the laundry business\u2014the getting of new customers and the retention of old friends\u2014Vorclone equipment plays a vital part. Just as quality work begins in the washing, so the Vorclone Washer has been developed to the highest point of efficiency. Thorough washing and perfect rinsing in the Vorclone Washers starts the bundle off right\u2014next the clothes are sent to the Ace Extractor, for speedy and more complete extraction than can be obtained in any other extractor of equal size available.\n\nHere the Vorclone Dry-by-Air Process plays an important part, not only because of an unmistakable difference in quality, but because the Dry-by-Air idea has an unfailing appeal to the imagination of the housewife. She can readily understand how drying with fresh air at 125 degrees accounts for the difference and adds months to the life of her clothes.\n\nThus, with a complete line-up of Vorclone equipment, from the washing to the drying operation, the highest quality work is possible. The housewife gets the fresh, clean \"Clothes Line Quality\" bundle that the widespread educational efforts of the laundry industry have taught her to expect, through the Vorclonized laundry in her town or city.\n\nVORCLONE CORPORATION\n\nGeneral Offices and Factory:\n56-64 South Bay Street\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nFactory Branches:\n\nNEW YORK, 11 East 44th Street\nDETROIT, 5833 Vernor Highway, W\nKANSAS CITY, 504 Westover Bldg.\n\nSEATTLE, 320 Occidental Avenue\nSAN FRANCISCO, 817 Mission Street\nCHICAGO, 147 W. Austin Avenue\nVorclone Low-temperature method\nPrinciples and Advantages of the\n\nWITH all its mechanical refinements the Vorclone is not merely an \"Improved\" tumbler. It goes right to the heart of the drying problem with a new basic principle\u2014the Vorclone Dry-by-Air method.\n\nThe Vorclone drying tumbler was designed for two definite purposes: To approximate as closely as possible the conditions and results of natural drying in the open air, and to set new standards of speed and economy in the drying operation. Both of these results have been accomplished, and today the Vorclone tumbler has revolutionized drying practice.\n\nNo other drying tumbler can equal Vorclone drying speed when operating at the same low temperature, because the Vorclone is the only tumbler operating on the Vacuum principle. This is best proven by the fact that even on most efficient types of \"Hot Blast\" tumblers the replacement of the fan with a Vorclone Patented Suction Device increases the drying speed from 25 to 40% and reduces the temperature to as low as 150 degrees Fahrenheit. This proves that the Vorclone Principle of absorbing moisture is more practical than the old fashioned evaporation process and high temperature.\n\nWhat Is the Vorclone Principle?\n\nIn the Vorclone Dry-by-Air Process, immense quantities of mild, warm air replace the confined, intensely heated air of high temperature drying methods. Because of this tremendous volume of fresh air, Vorclone dries rapidly and perfectly at a temperature of approximately 125 degrees.\n\nThis remarkable achievement is made possible by the Vorclone Suction Device, a patented feature which cannot be duplicated. This amazing invention, many times as powerful as an ordinary centrifugal fan of the same size, is built into the machine at the lower right or left end. When the fan motor is started, the action of the Suction Device immediately creates a \"Vorclone\" (miniature cyclone), with a whirling motion which draws all air from the drum and creates a powerful vacuum. The vacuum in the drum instantly sucks enormous volumes of pure, clean, fresh air (room temperature) through the inlets at the top of the machine. Here the air passes through a series of coils and is warmed to a temperature of 125 degrees. Perfectly dry, it enters the drum, and, completely permeating the clothes, it absorbs moisture to its full capacity. Laden with moisture and lint, it is then drawn in swirling currents in its downward course into the trough at the bottom of the machine and through the suction outlet from which it is discharged outside of the building.\nQuality, Odorless Drying\n\nThe Vorclone suction principle of drying at low temperature is a direct opposite of the evaporation process, which depends on blasts of hot air to vaporize the moisture content of its load. The downward course of air travel assists the drop of clothes which loosens the free moisture content, permitting the air to attain its fullest efficiency. The downward course is the natural gravitation of all articles heavier than air. Only extremely hot air and steam vapors rise, but hot air above a temperature of approximately 160 degrees decomposes animal fats, causing a bad odor. Animal fat is the base of laundry soap and almost impossible to eliminate entirely in the rinsing process.\n\nNo other method can even approximate the results obtained with the Vorclone, because rapid, perfect drying cannot be done at a low temperature without the immense volume of air drawn through the clothes by the Vorclone Suction Device, provided exclusively with the Vorclone tumbler.\n\nRapid Drying Plus Economy\n\nThe Vorclone drying tumbler produces a direct and immediate improvement in the operating cost of laundries. It saves time, labor and money. One important factor in these savings is the speed with which Vorclone dries clothes. The operating tests on page eight show the average results obtained. It is the universal experience of Vorclone users that Vorclone speeds up the drying operation and handles more pounds of clothes per day. There is a further increase in capacity, due to the fact that work of all kinds can be dried in the Vorclone at one time without the slightest sacrifice in quality. That means maximum output for every dollar invested in drying equipment. For example, a 5-pocket machine with a load of 30 lbs. in each pocket will dry in from 20 to 25 minutes, depending upon extraction.\n\nThe steam consumption of the Vorclone tumbler is surprisingly low. Some plants estimate that the Vorclone uses about one-third less steam than other types.\n\nNo Lint Accumulation\n\nAnother important saving results from the continuous discharge of lint outside of the building. There is no lint accumulation on the coils or about the machine, and there are no lint screens to clean. This one item alone represents hundreds of hours of labor in the course of a year.\n\nClothes dried in the Vorclone are just warm. There are no clouds of steam or lint blown out into the room when doors are opened. No time is lost in waiting for the clothes to cool, and no blast of cold air is necessary. The operator opens the cylinder immediately after drying is completed, and handles the clothes comfortably without gloves.\n\nThe machine itself is compact and carefully constructed for long, uninter-\nrupted service. In actual performance, Vorclone has a remarkable record for the elimination of repair charges and costly shutdowns.\n\nEvery analysis of actual drying costs shows that the Vorclone tumbler dries clothes at less than a quarter of a cent per pound.\n\n**Dries Light and Heavy Materials in One Load**\n\nBecause of its low operating temperature and steady flow of fresh air, the Vorclone tumbler handles all classes of work at the same time. The materials in one bundle may include everything from heavy woolens to filmy laces, with perfect assurance of quality results without danger of overdrying.\n\n**Better Working Conditions**\n\nThe Vorclone Dry-by-Air Process also has an important effect upon the efficiency of laundry workers. It is not only simple, understandable, and free from operating troubles, but it creates more pleasant working conditions.\n\nIt prevents the air in the room from becoming heavy, foul, and unhealthy due to lack of ventilation and the presence of lint, moisture, and foreign matter. The air is kept clean and pure at all times, with no overheating in summer.\n\n**No Unpleasant Odor**\n\nWith a maximum drying temperature of 125 degrees and the continuous discharge of lint, Vorclone air-dried clothes never have the stuffy, unpleasant odor which results from drying at high temperatures. The moment the housewife opens a bundle of laundry work, she notices the difference. The clothes have a freshness and fragrance heretofore obtainable only by drying outdoors in a stiff breeze.\n\n**Ideal for Blanket Drying**\n\nBecause of the small margin between the drying temperature of 125 degrees and a normal room temperature, woolens can be dried in the Vorclone along with other work without the slightest danger of shrinkage. Blankets come out fresh, fluffy, and with the nap raised.\n\n**No Scorching or Discoloration**\n\nScorching or discoloration is impossible when clothes are dried in the Vorclone at 125 degrees. Housewives appreciate having their linens come back from the laundry snowy white. No artificial method ever devised can duplicate the bleaching ability and purifying potency of the oxygen in the air.\n\nThe drying temperature not only determines the quality of every piece that is laundered and dried in a power laundry, but it has a far-reaching effect on the life of the clothes.\n\n**Easy on Clothes**\n\nAt the Vorclone temperature of 125 degrees, the finest fabrics can be handled without injury. 180 degrees is\nthe deterioration point. Above this point, the heat of the drying process bakes out the natural oils which give life to the fibres of cottons, woolens, and various other materials.\n\nThis accounts for the familiar saying of the housewife, \"The laundry wears out my clothes too soon.\" It is a well-known fact that clothes are not worn out by washing in a power laundry, because modern processes cause less wear and tear than rubbing clean on the old-fashioned wash-board. It is the excessive heat in drying that takes the life out of clothes.\n\nDrying at 240 degrees is dangerous. Subjecting a load of freshly washed garments to this temperature for a period of 25 to 40 minutes has a direct bearing on the general quality of the finished bundle. The clothes are harsh and stiff, yellowed from overheating, and sometimes scorched. A more disagreeable result is the foul odor due to scorching of the fine fuzzy fibres and baking them into the clothes. Worse still is the hidden damage which has destroyed the very life of the fibrous structure in every garment.\n\nA Drying Temperature Below the Danger Line\n\nSuch ruinous results are impossible with Vorclone Drying at 125 degrees. If the clothes should accidentally be tumbled all day, there would be no trace of deterioration.\n\nThis feature makes the Vorclone Dry-by-Air Process one of the most important accomplishments in years in the field of laundry engineering. With its remarkable combination of low temperature and fresh air, at an actual reduction in drying time and drying cost, it has removed one of the greatest obstacles in the path of future development in the industry and laid the foundation for a tremendous growth.\n\nHundreds of laundry owners have already seen its advantages from this standpoint. Some have not stopped with pocketing the savings which result from drying with Vorclone. They have begun to tell their customers about it, merchandising Vorclone air-dried clothes as an important part of their service.\n\nVorclone Builds Future Business\n\nBetween the laundry owner and a vast new field of potential business has stood the old-time prejudice of many housewives against power laundries. The big outstanding service of Vorclone to the laundry industry is its part of overcoming that prejudice and making power laundry work popular.\nAverage Operating Results\nWith the Vorclone Tumbler\n\nRECORD OF DRYING SPEED\n\nThese facts and figures are quoted from data furnished by a well-known laundry.\n\nThe following test was taken on a five-compartment 42 x 90-inch tumbler. The room temperature varied between 70 and 80 degrees. Steam pressure, 95 lbs. Extraction, 75%. Working under normal laundry conditions with a good extraction, the Vorclone tumbler will dry heavy damp wash lots at the rate of a pound of dry clothes per pocket per minute.\n\nRESULT OF TEST ON THREE RUNS OF FAMILY WASH\n\nFIRST TEST\u2014\nFive 30-lb. bundles (dry weight):\nWet  Dry\n39\u00bd lbs. 30 lbs.\n39 lbs. 30 lbs.\n40 lbs. 30 lbs.\n39 lbs. 30 lbs.\n39\u00bd lbs. 30 lbs.\n197 lbs. 150 lbs.\n47 lbs. water removed.\n\n10-minute run in 30-inch extractor at 1200 R.P.M.

Total time 33 minutes. (Note: Extension only 5 minutes.)\n\nThe length of time required to dry clothes depends upon the size of the load and the percentage of water left after extracting in the centrifugal extractor. The more water left in the clothes, the longer it will require to dry them in the tumbler.\nThe Vorclone Suction Device Explained\n\nThis patented fan is one of the outstanding Vorclone features of construction. The Vorclone Suction Device produces a suction so powerful that lint screens are entirely eliminated. It moves a much greater volume of air than any other type of fan and its efficiency is not impaired when discharging against a colder outside temperature.\n\nThe separate motor on the Suction Device is an important factor in the high efficiency of the Vorclone drying tumbler. It not only eliminates additional belt drives, with their attendant troubles, but it maintains the whirling action of the air at a constant speed.\n\nThe best of materials and workmanship are built into this vital part of the Vorclone tumbler. The fan blades, made of sheet steel, are sturdy and durable. Free, easy action at all times is assured by the self-aligning ball bearings.\n\nThe Suction Device stand is cast iron. Combined with the stand is the outlet, which is made of steel, accurately tested, specially shaped, and multiple riveted.\n\nAll lint, dirt, and moisture sucked down by the Vorclone Suction Device is discharged through this outlet and deposited outside of the building.\n\nAnalysis of the Vorclone Suction Device in actual operation shows four outstanding characteristics:\n\n1. Discharging against a colder outside temperature does not affect the volume of hot air displaced.\n2. There is positive suction through the entire length of its air force. The suction is just as powerful up in the drum as it is at the mouth of the Suction Device.\n3. Suspended in its whirling air currents, dirt, lint, and foreign matter are collected and held until discharged. This assures cleanliness in the machine. Definitely eliminates the possibility of unpleasant odors and unclean appearance. No clogging. No explosions due to lint accumulation.\n4. The Vorclone Suction Device is not limited to operate at a certain speed as is the case with centrifugal fans, which if speeded up above a predetermined speed lose their ability to displace an additional volume of air.\n\nIt would be possible to operate the Vorclone tumbler with a much smaller Vorclone Suction Device at a higher speed. However, a larger fan at lower speed is used because it radically reduces wear on bearings and other parts.\n\nActual tests prove that the Vorclone Suction Device will circulate or displace more cubic feet of air per minute than a number of ordinary fans of equal size.\nCylinder Construction\n\nThe cylinder can be divided into individual compartments, reached through sliding doors. Each cylinder is specially built and can be furnished with any number of pockets, as long as the minimum width of each pocket is 15 inches.\n\nThe 46 x 120 and 42 x 120 cylinders are available from one to eight pockets. The 42 x 90 cylinder can be divided into six pockets. The 42 x 60 cylinder can be supplied with as many as four pockets, and the 42 x 40 cylinder is available in one or two pockets. The Junior can be had in two pockets.\n\nCylinder partitions are made of high quality, three mesh to the inch, galvanized after woven wire screen, to permit the circulation of air currents throughout the tumbler. This gives a distinct advantage over solid partitions. The tumbling bars themselves are made of smooth, heavily galvanized iron, rigid in construction and incapable of damaging clothes or ripping off buttons, as is often the case with cast iron bars.\n\nSliding doors are built in sections\u2014easily operated and perfectly fitted. The improved sliding doors are developed to a considerable degree, lightweight sheet steel with perforated embossing, reinforced on top and bottom. The end runners are constructed of cold-rolled steel, case-hardened to provide long life. The door retainer strips are machine formed and welded into one piece. The slides are interchangeable and can be taken off by removing a few bolts.\n\nThe Vorclone drying tumbler is a dependable piece of equipment. It combines the distinctive features of the Dry-by-Air Process with a construction which is simple, understandable, and mechanically sound.\n\nCarefully selected materials are built into the machine with painstaking care. Motors, bearings and other accessories conform to high engineering standards. Every possible effort has been made to insure continuous, uninterrupted operation and maximum life for the tumbler.\n\nThe remarkable record of the Vorclone tumbler in actual laundry service is a logical result of this policy.\nSafety Drum Locking Device and Locater\n\nThis perfected safety device was developed by Vorclone engineers to guarantee absolute protection to the operator when loading or unloading the tumbler. It locks the drum securely in any position. It prevents the cylinder from starting and injuring the operator if the belt is thrown accidently onto the driving pulley.\n\nThe sliding door latch is an added provision for the convenience and safety of the operator. He is protected by a self-locking mechanism, which locks the compartments instantly and automatically when the drier is open or closed, and prevents the constant motion of the machine from opening them.\n\nDouble End Drive\n\nAll tumblers with a cylinder length more than 60 inches are double end driven. This eliminates any possibility of cylinder twisting out of shape, a common fault with older types of tumblers.\n\nSilent Chain Drive for Cylinder\n\nAll motor-driven machines are regularly equipped with a silent chain drive running in a bath of oil. The oil is retained in a leak-proof cast iron case. The chain, of standard make, is very durable and with ordinary attention will last throughout the life of the machine. This method eliminates grinding noises and the clattering of gears. The silent chain drive is standard on all machines having motor drives.\n\nPerfect Balance with Ball and Roller Bearings\n\nParticular consideration was necessary in the selection of the ball and roller bearings, to insure uninterrupted service of the driving mechanism.\n\nOversize, self-aligning ball bearings are installed on the main trunnion shaft, and roller bearings of standard make on all driving mechanism. This assures easy, frictionless action at all times. The maximum load on the bearings is never more than 30% of their rating. With ordinary care they will function perfectly during the entire life of the machine.\n\nThe bearing equipment of the Vorclone drying tumbler greatly reduces the consumption of power and maintains an accurate balance which aids in producing smooth, continuous operation.\n\nAspirator and Steam Pressure Control\n\nThe Aspirator performs a definite function. It draws off the condensate from each of the three coil sections and maintains an even steam pressure at all times. Unless the condensate is properly disposed of, it seriously hampers the efficiency of the tumbler.\nThe powerful action of the patented Vorclone suction device creates a vacuum in the cylinder. This Vacuum suction force draws air into the cylinder through openings above coil compartments located directly above cylinder. None of the air is ever recirculated; all of it, together with lint and foreign matter is discharged continuously to the outside. There are no lint screens or traps to clean, no lint accumulation in any part of machine. The high velocity of air travel always keeps machine free from lint and foreign matter, always in shape for maximum production.\nSPECIFICATIONS AND DIMENSIONS 46'' x 120''\n\nMAIN FRAME\u2014Semi-steel, cast in three sections.\n\nOUTER SHELL\u201414-gauge galvanized sheet steel.\n\nCYLINDER\u2014Inside measurement, 46'' diameter, 120'' long.

The cylinder motor on this size and type is a one-way motor; there are no switches other than safety overload and cut-out for power line. It is a self-contained unit with header and counter shaft mounted on machine. Separate push button control is provided for each motor. Safety shield on locking device prevents power application while machine is in locked position for unloading.\n\nDouble end driven cylinder is standard. Roller bearings are provided on intermediate shafts. All shafts are ground and polished.\nDirect connected reversing type motor and individual panel control is provided on this machine as special all motor driven unit. Reversing apparatus is controlled by automatic switches of standard make. Regular equipment consists of a two horse power low torque ball-bearing motor on cylinder drive, roller bearings on double end drive shafts, safety disconnecting and automatic overload switch.\n\nIt is surprisingly quiet in operation because power from motor is transmitted through chain drive operating in bath of oil.\n\nSeparate push button control is provided for each motor. Safety shield on locking device prevents power application while machine is in locked position for unloading.\nThis is a standard belt-driven type, quite popular where first cost is an important consideration. This type is several hundred dollars cheaper, due to absence of motors, switches and necessary electrical wiring. The Fan on this type is equipped with ball-bearing shaft as well as ball bearing loose pulley. Power consumption from shaft drive will average approximately $3\\frac{3}{4}$ H.P. for entire machine fully loaded. With the exception of motor equipment the balance of machine is of standard construction throughout. Double end driven cylinder is standard. Roller bearings are provided on intermediate shafts. All shafts are ground and polished. Fan is provided with ball bearing loose pulley.\nSPECIFICATIONS AND DIMENSIONS 42'' x 60''\n\nMAIN FRAME\u2014Semi-steel, cast in three sections.\n\nOUTER SHELL\u201414-gauge galvanized sheet steel.\n\nCYLINDER\u2014Inside measurement, 42'' diameter, 60'' long.

Can be placed on left end if desired. For convenient handling, machine can be knocked down in two or three sections; coil box is detachable, and upper half of outer shell can be lifted.\nThis type is especially suited for the plant where all belt driven equipment is operated. Cylinder and fan can be driven from main or counter shaft. No motors are furnished. When ordering this type of machine care must be taken to provide sufficient room for large enough pulley to drive fan at speed of 1800 R.P.M. This requires at times a pulley as large as 24-inch diameter on drive shaft. Care must be exercised to provide head room for that diameter pulley to avoid trouble upon installation.\n\nThis type is available in the 42 x 60, 42 x 40, and 32 x 40 Junior size. See specifications on respective size desired.\nThe above illustration shows a direct connected Motor Driven Fan and direct connected Reversing type motor driven cylinder. A complete unit, very compact and simple. All belts and pulleys are entirely eliminated. This unit embodies complete automatic reversing control with individual panel mounted on machine as standard equipment.\n\nAll wiring is in conduit according to approved code.\n\nPush button starting and stopping switch is mounted conveniently on front of machine. Power cut-out switch as well as automatic overload switch mounted on rear frame of machine are standard equipment. Power to cylinder is transmitted through silent chain drive operating in oil.\n\nThis type available in 42 x 60, 42 x 40 and 32 x 40 Junior size.\nThere are certain advantages in operating this type of tumbler. It is a self-contained unit having direct connected motor on fan and motor belted cylinder. The fan motor precludes any possibility of inefficiency due to belt slippage or high speed belting which requires attention. Constant speed on fan assures uniform production.\n\nThe direct connected motor on fan is one H.P. on Junior size and two H.P. on 40 and 60 inch size, ball-bearing type. It is 30% oversize. The power consumed to drive fan 1800 R.P.M. and loaded cylinder is slightly more than one and one quarter horse power. Cylinder is provided with separate one horse power motor.\n\nThis self-contained unit is available in 42 x 60, 42 x 40, and 32 x 40 Junior size. See respective specifications covering desired size. The illustration shown above is that of 32 x 40 Junior.\nHere again is a general type with direct connected motor driven fan and standard header for belt driven cylinder. This type is very popular because it eliminates any possibility of losing efficiency due to belt slippage on fan drive. The power factor is negligible because on the $42 \\times 40$ and $42 \\times 60$ sizes only a two horse power motor is required while the $32 \\times 40$ Junior requires only a one horse power on fan. In each case the motor is 30% oversize.\n\nThis type is available in all standard sizes, $32 \\times 40$, $42 \\times 40$, $42 \\times 60$. It is very often used in laundries for blanket drying as well as individual wet wash or rough dry service.\n\nSee standard specifications on respective size.\nCONFIRMATION\n\nCanadian National Telegraphs\n\nAugust 12, 1930.\n\nBeaver Laundry Machinery Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nRE VORCLONE JUNIOR ELECTRIC SUPPLY IS DIRECT CURRENT 120 VOLTS SUPPLY STARTER.\n\nC.

Roy Machinery, saying that they have been asked by the Dept. to quote on a drying timber same as the one installed in the new school at Kenora, and also on an electric flat work drier.\n\nWe are very sorry indeed that so poor a machine might be sent here, and I beg to ask you if you please write a word to the Dept. to the effect of the superiority of the machine sold by the Beaver Laundry Mach. over the other.\n\nAs you know, the principle of taking the air directly over the floor itself is an awful thing, for as Mrs. Byers said when she was there, it delivers the clothes in a condition almost as bad as before they were laundered.\n\nI would not mind if the flat work drier was bought from the Can. Roy, but it is not right. I think to pay for an inferior machine as their Dept.\n\nHoping that you will see the correctness of my opinion.\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this case we might mention that the Cecilia Jeffrey School machine is a 110 Volt A.C. Current one while the machine for McIntosh would have to be 120 Volt D.C. Current, as it is D.C.

I wish to make it perfectly clear that ordinary treatment by sedimentation in a septic tank only removes 25 to 75% of the bacteria present in the sewage. Where, however, the septic tank is combined with either broad irrigation filters or contact beds, the percentage removal of bacteria is increased 10 to 15%.\n\nMR.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the accounts which you forwarded in favour of Lord Lumber and Fuel, St. Norbert, Man., to the total amount of $603.71, covering lumber and freight charges on same, which was supplied for the erection of a hen house at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to official letter of January 24th, last, authorizing an expenditure of $600 in the purchase of this material, which is the full amount the Department can provide for the purpose. The account which you forwarded from the above Company to the amount of $655.96 will be paid, but I am returning herewith the account to the amount of $147.75, which you should arrange to settle from the per capita earnings or other receipts of the school. Our funds this year are extremely limited, and I regret that it will not be possible to pay any of the cost of the material required in the erection of the hen house other than that mentioned. A cheque covering payment to the amount of $555.96 will be forwarded to the above Company in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n[Stamp]\nActing Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If a concrete cover could be placed on the cess pool, it could be covered with a couple of feet of earth and the appearance of the front of the school improved immensely. The lay brother at the school would do the work if the material were supplied by the Department.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the cess pool. He states that this pool has a wooden cover, which is considered more or less dangerous, and the Principal has had a fence erected around the pool. The Inspector states that if a concrete cover were placed on this cess pool it could be covered with about 2' of earth and the appearance of the front of the school thereby improved. He states the lay brother at the school would do the work if the material required for the purpose is supplied by the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter, stating the material required to cover the cess pool and the approximate cost of same, also if you would recommend that the work be done at the present time or left over until next Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Intosh request authority to purchase a Fairbanks-Morse Duplex Ball Bearing centrifugal Pump, capacity at 30 foot head, 25 Gallons per minute. They would also require a Nozzle and 100 feet of 1\u00bd\" Hose, one length of 1\u00bd\" Galvanized Iron Piping, and one 1\u00bd\" Tee, Four Elbows and Hose Valve for fire prevention at the School.\n\nThe Pump is No. 525 in Fairbanks-Morse catalogue, and the total cost of the items mentioned, including freight, would not exceed $100.00. The School would make the necessary pulleys and install.\n\nThe old Pump which cost about $20.00 to repair last year, is now worn out, and if fire took place, they would not be adequately protected, and we would be glad if the Department can authorize this expenditure.\n\nWe understand that Brother Gothier has made plans, which have been forwarded to Ottawa, for an addition to this School. The Principal informs us that the Church would advance the money for the building provided the Department would guarantee repayment. He informed him that we did not think the Department would do this, but no doubt he would hear in due course. If the School was enlarged, we think pupils could be got to fill it.\n\nThe Principal also informs us he has not received Medical and School supplies requisitioned for, in December, and is getting very short of some of the articles asked for and wishes that the requisitions could be expedited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that the total cost of the items mentioned, including freight, will not exceed approximately $100, and that the school authorities would make the necessary pulleys and install the equipment.\n\nThe Department will approve of the Principal or yourself arranging for the purchase of the above pump from the Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd., 300 Princess St., Winnipeg, as well as the other equipment mentioned if they will supply same. If not, it should be purchased from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. After the purchase of this equipment has been made, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the medical and school supplies requisitioned for by the Principal in December, last, I have to say that these supplies will go forward in the course of the next few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 3)\nMarch 4th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder separate cover, I am mailing you a copy of the plans for the proposed addition to the McIntosh School. These plans call for two wings measuring each 30 X 60, of the same style of construction as the present building. We had in mind at first to propose that these two wings be made fireproof but we realize that the cost would be rather high and, in view of the fact that the present building is only of frame construction, we personally see no objection to adopting the same kind of construction for the two wings.\n\nThe matter of enlarging the McIntosh School was placed before you as late as 1929 by Archbishop Beliveau, of St. Boniface, and myself. If my memory serves me well, the Archbishop was very insistent at that time that the enlargement of the school be proceeded with immediately. While no definite promise to that effect was made by your Department, it was nevertheless felt by both Archbishop Beliveau and myself that the school would be enlarged as soon as conditions permitted it.\n\nThe school now accommodates 75 pupils but there are as many children in the territory served by the school who are not attending a school at all and who are, therefore, growing up in ignorance. It is with a view to bringing a remedy to this situation that we are now pressing for the needed enlargement of the school.\n\nIn view of the fact that your Department, owing to existing conditions, has deemed it necessary to considerably reduce its Estimates and also in view of the fact that the Church authorities are prepared to provide the necessary funds for the children who are not now attending school and who are, as mentioned above, in the territory served by the McIntosh School, we would be prepared to consider some form of cooperation with the Department whereby we could proceed immediately with the proposed additions to the school.\n\nFrom the information given to us by Bro. Gauthier, we estimate that the proposed wings would cost about $50,000, - $25,000 of which would be for materials and the balance for wages. If your Department were prepared to assume the payment for the materials, the Church authorities would finance the wages on condition that the amount so spent be refunded within, say, a period of four years, at the rate of 2\u00bd% in April, 1932, and the balance at the rate of 2\u00bd% per annum until fully paid, the full amount not to bear interest.\n\nIn view of the fact that we consider the enlargement of the McIntosh School urgent and also in view of the fact that the Church authorities are prepared to cooperate to the extent mentioned above, we hope that your Department will favourably consider our request.\n\nThanking you for the sympathetic consideration you will give this problem, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 3)\nMarch 11, 1932.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to enlarging the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I note that the Oblate Order would be willing to finance the labour costs for the time being, provided reimbursement was made by the Department during the next few years. I will bring your proposal to the attention of the Minister when the Supplementary Estimates are being considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. J. O.

Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt several occasions, we were promised a FRIGIDAIRE for our School, but for one reason or another, it is yet to come. It would not be a luxury to have one but a great necessity as the log house we were using to keep the ice in, is going into ruin even after the many and one reparations made to it.\n\nWith the heat we are having now constantly, there is no food that can be kept palatable without a cold room. It is a very hard and not a mere trifle besides a great expense to have meat or other food sent to us every week from Winnipeg. You may well think that during this hot weather meat does not keep more than a day or two ahead.\n\nFor this reason, I am pleading to the Department to provide us with a FRIGIDAIRE. Presently they are lower in cost as they were before and I can have it installed without expenses for labor. This summer, if a frigidaire is not granted an ice-house will be needed, but such house would cost more, counting lumber labor and installation of a cold-room.\n\nI also would require a potato peeler. Presently we are having the little ones peel the potatoes, but although they are doing their best, enough cannot be peeled for the two principal meals each day. We have plenty of good potatoes and would like to give some to the children, but we are having much difficulty in getting them ready. No matter we would have a machine, some would be peeled by hands every day to teach the girls how to do them.\n\nThanking you for the present and past favors and hoping my requests be granted.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 21, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, requesting a frigidaire for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. Certain funds are available for improvements at this school and the Department wishes to know what is the most urgent requirement. Should a frigidaire be considered before we do anything more with clearing land or any additional painting of the interior? An early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

We are writing the Department about these. You mention that the hearth of the bakery oven and drums are all broken and burned and that the furnace doors and frames are broken and cannot be repaired so require to be replaced, and that you would like to have two large doors instead of the three small ones, as it is dangerous for fire. It is too bad you did not include these items in your estimates, as we are afraid of fire, after so many of the Indian Schools have been burned down through neglect. That is why the Department have put on night watchmen at different schools.\n\nKindly let us know immediately, the size and make of the fire guns, and if they can be repaired, also estimated cost of the repairs and replacements for the bakery oven and the number and make of your boilers, and we will put the whole matter up to Ottawa, as it may not be too late to get them in the estimates.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont October 37th, 1933\n\nMr. Frank Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter re fire extinguishers I am glad to say that our five \"Foamite extinguishers were refilled August 16th, 1933 and are in good order, so are the 5 gal extinguishers, but nine out of ten of the fire-guns are out of order and are not working, some are leaking, others are clogged. The Brothers do not know how to repair them. The two Pyrene extinguishers supplied few years ago for the shop are also in good order.\n\nThe hearth of the bakery oven and drums are all broken and burnt. The brothers have been making temporary reparations with mud and iron, but it may give up at any minute, so the whole hearth and drums have to be renewed but the oven itself is in good shape.\n\nThirdly, the furnace doors and frame are broken and cannot be repaired so they need to be replaced. Now for this repairs, I would suggest to have two large doors made instead of the three small ones which are always in danger of being broken. If I remember well, the furnace of Sioux Lookout School was repaired this way and is much more preferable and costs less.\n\nAs it is now it is dangerous for fire as the doors are held closed by a bar or a piece of wood.\n\nI would be appreciating if you could take these items in consideration and at your earliest convenience.\n\nWith thanks in anticipation,\n\nI remain\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober, 30th. 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInclosed please find a letter we have received from the Principal of the Mc.

Perreault O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont. Nov. 2nd 1933\n\nMr. Frank Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing the size and number of the frame of our furnace. I understand it will be a rather expensive matter but I could not ask for this repair before it was needed and it was lately only that the frame was broken so bad that it cannot be repaired and need to be replaced. As for the doors they were broken since quite a time but have been repaired immediately by the brother but of course I do not know how long they will hold this way but anyhow as they are now if they don't meet another accident they might do for a while. If I did asked for two doors instead of three well I thought it wouldn't be so expensive to change the entire front instead of changing the frame now and the doors later on. We do not make much difference either two or three doors, it is the same for us. Nevertheless you may do whatever is the best for the moment as long as the frame is changed in the nearest future. You know very well that we are doing our utmost best to keep everything o.k. I do not think the Department may blame us for any neglect.\n\nAs for the bakery oven, if you remember well, the brother was just examining it when you came with Mr. Fotherland. The matter was brought to you than but of course we couldn't ask to have repaired until the brother could try what could be done. So he has tried to fix it with mud plaster but it is only a temporary repair. I am enclosing the number and make of the oven.\n\nAs the fire-guns, I am sorry to say whether they may be repaired or not and what will be the cost. The brother has no knowledge at all about these. I think the Department should know about these for it might not be the first complaint they have had about them and they must have correspondence made in the past with the manufacture of Foamite E.K.\n\nHoping these explanations be giving satisfaction and thanking you for taking our needs in consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 30th, 1933\n\nReverend Principal,\nIndian Residential School\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 27th inst. re Fire Guns. We are writing the Department about these. You mention that the hearth of the bakery oven and drums are all broken and burned and that the furnace doors and frame are broken and cannot be repaired so require to be replaced, and that you would like to have two large doors instead of the three small ones, as it is dangerous for fire. It is too bad you did not include these items in your estimates, as we are afraid of fire after so many of the Indian Schools have been burned down through neglect. That is why the Department have put on night watchmen at different schools.\n\nKindly let us know immediately the size and make of the fire guns and if they can be repaired, also estimated cost of the repairs and replacements for the bakery oven and the number and make of your boilers, and we will put the whole matter up to Ottawa, as it may not be too late to get them in the estimates.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nOn October the 19th we have received the circular addressed to all schools concerning the Fire Extinguishers, whether they were refilled and if they were in good order.\n\nI have replied immediately on Oct. 27th saying our Fire Extinguishers were refilled in August but the Fire-guns nine out of ten were not working, some are clogged and others were leaking, and the brother didn't know what is to be done with them; he has tried to repair one but has spoiled it.\n\nAt the same time, I have advised the Indian Agent that the hearth and smoke drums of the bakery ovens were ruined, if you remember, the brother was trying to make a repair to it when you came for a visit last September but it could be only a temporary repair. Secondly, I notified the Indian Agent that the furnace doors and frames were broken, could not be repaired therefore needed to be replaced.\n\nI am enclosing the Indian Agent's reply to my letter dated Oct. 27th, see copy A, then my reply, see copy B.\n\nA week or so after, I have received the letter from Dept., see copy C; four days after this one, another one from Indian Agent, copy D; then the last, three days ago, the one marked E.\n\nWhat correspondence! Eight letters just to have doors and frame of a furnace replaced, the hearth and drum of an oven replaced also and 5 fire guns to be repaired. It shows once more that when any items have to go through Mr. Edwards we must have plenty of time ahead of us and an enormous sum of patience.\n\nConsequently I repeat what I have said for better understanding and for your information.\n\nNine fire-guns are not working, brother has tried to repair them but without success. So we cannot tell whether they can be repaired or not as the brother don't know what is to be done with them. Lately again, after receiving Mr. Mackenzie's letter and to accede to Mr. Mackenzie's desire, brother has worked on two fire-guns but to his dismay he has ruined them.\nSecondly, the frame and doors of the furnace are broken and need to be replaced. The doors have been repaired a long time ago even without receiving notice from Mr. Mackenzie but the frame cannot be repaired. How can we tell what it will cost? The manufacture itself is more liable to tell this, we haven't got the price of the furnace or any of the pieces. It was purchased by the Department, and all invoices and bills were kept by the Dept. It is the same thing for the bakery oven. The hearth and drums are entirely burnt and have been repaired temporarily with pieces of iron and mud plaster but this cannot stand many more bakings. We cannot tell what it will cost to have new ones for the Dept., has purchased this oven and of course must have the invoices of each.\n\nWhat I am sure of is this, we need a new frame for the furnace as it is dangerous for fire, the doors are just held closed by an iron bar, as for the doors they may do like this for quite a while unless they meet with another accident; and we need also a new hearth and smoke drums for the bakery oven.\n\nWhen we have these new pieces, the brothers can attend to the work themselves without making extra expenses for outside labour.\n\nI understand well that times are hard and it is difficult to meet with extra expenses, but we cannot see ahead what accident we are liable to have or how long things may last without being worn out, but these three items need prompt attention and we cannot do otherwise as claiming them. We are doing our utmost best to keep all expenses to its lowest point, and I may say also that all the repairs that we can do we are doing them in time enough so as to save money and time.\n\nI regret to have been obliged to take up this matter so obliquely, but we get tired of repeating things over and over again.\n\nHoping to receive attention at your nearest future and thanking you in advance\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nFront door frame of Keewaunee Portable Firebox Boiler Dominion Radiator Co Ltd 1922 Winnipeg Manitoba.\n\nFRAME.

The Principal had been unable to get prices on these repairs. The Furnace is a Kewanee Portable Fire Box Boiler and the frame of the door has broken as per the inclosed sketch. The Bake Oven is an Oxford Portable, made by the Gurney Foundry Co and is No.72C. This needs a new fire box and drums.\n\nI was in Winnipeg on Tuesday the 12th and found out that the furnace is American made, but that it might be possible to get the door frame in Toronto. Got in touch with the Peace Western Foundry Co. in Winnipeg and they are endeavouring to find out where the frame can be obtained and will send me a quotation which I will pass on as soon as I receive it. This firm will also quote on the repairs to the bake oven.\n\nIn connection with the fire extinguishers which are Foamite Childs fire guns. These are broken through trying to refill them, and there is only one working. The Principal would like to get Nine Pyrene 1\u00bd Qt. size to replace. The fire gun might be repaired if sent to the Manufacturers in Toronto.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive your instructions as to the above.

We inclose a letter received from the Pease Western Foundry Ltd. which was forwarded to Mr. McIntosh and sent on to us January 4th. You will note they say it is impossible to supply a frame with two doors for the Kewanee Boiler to replace the one broken, but a frame with the single door will cost $15.50 f.o.b. Winnipeg.

Sutherland\nActing Supt. of Indian Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe sewing machine which you had the kindness to grant us has arrived last night but not in a fair condition. It must have been damaged before leaving and was done long ago. At one end of the machine, the veneer is striped off, the varnish all gone and underneath this the body is all black. The heavy paper covering it shows that the machine was for a time under a leaking roof or under some drippings of some kind and covered with dust. This shows to have been damaged long ago.\n\nSo before we know what is to be done, we will leave it unpacked and wait for a reply from you. Please advise the Company, the shipping bills are from Winnipeg. Singer Sewing Machines, 306 Main St., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 13th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 9th instant, in reference to sewing machine shipped to you from Winnipeg has been referred to me.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that our Order called for a new machine, and I regret that the Sewing Machine Company has shipped to you one that was not in good condition. I have today taken the matter up with the Local Office of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, and instructions are going out to ship you a machine in perfect condition. When this has been received, you will be good enough to ship the damaged machine back to the Company at Winnipeg, all charges collect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.G. Parker\nActing Purchasing Agent.\n\nRev.

Sutherland  \nActing Supt.of Indian Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. John Kelly, Engineer Inspector, has sent us his report after having made his inspection this last month. He advises new tubes in the heating boiler as the ones at present show pitting bad. So he suggest new tubes to be supplied in case of need.\n\nThe sizes are as follows:\n- 36 tubes of 5 feet 2 inches\n- 36 \" \" 9 \" 6 \"\n\nThese tubes are 3/8 in. in diameter.\n\nWe hope these tubes be replaced as soon as possible in case these should be any one bursting, and we would like to replace before starting the winter heating.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, Sept. 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, requesting that new tubes for the heating boiler at the McIntosh Indian Residential School be supplied, to replace the present ones, which have become badly pitted.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Edwards, of Kenora. He is being requested to furnish a report regarding the cost, etc. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether the tubes can be supplied at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a request from the Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, to be supplied with new tubes for the boiler to replace the ones at present in use, which are badly pitted. The Principal suggests that the new tubes to be supplied, in case of need, are as follows:-\n\n38 tubes 5' 2\" and 35 tubes 9' 6\" - the tubes to be 3\" in diameter.\n\nThe Principal states he would like to replace the tubes before the cold weather sets in.\n\nI would request that you advise the Department whether you consider that new tubes, as requested, should be supplied. Please state if you are aware of a firm on the approved list, from whom you could obtain the tubes and the approximate cost. Our funds are so limited, that unless absolutely necessary, we would not be prepared to consider authorising the expenditure necessary.\n\nPlease give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The order may be placed with the firm who supplied or manufactured the boiler, or purchase may be made from any other available source. I am of the opinion that the boiler was manufactured by the Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg; but, no doubt, the Principal will know the manufacturer's name, and he can probably arrange to place the order for the new tubes. The installing of the tubes should be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department.\n\nAn account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the tubes, delivered at McIntosh station, should be forwarded to you, to be attached to proper voucher forms, certified and forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The amount available for this purpose is limited, and, as a number of Indian residential schools, which formerly did not receive any grant, are now requesting similar consideration, the Department finds it necessary to only allow grant towards the night watchman's services for a period of seven months.\n\nConsequently, in the case of the night watchman at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, the allowance will only be made until April 30, 1935. Payment of the grant for the night watchman will be resumed on October 1, 1935, and will continue until April 30, 1936. The same amount as formerly, viz., $40 a month will be allowed.

I also had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the Honourable the Superintendent General yesterday. While I outlined our plan quite completely in these interviews, I believe that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to place the matter before you in a formal manner.\n\nThe necessity of a new chapel for the McIntosh Indian Residential School has long been felt but, owing to economic conditions, the Principal has not previously urged the Department to appropriate funds for this purpose. A former missionary of the Lake of the Woods district, who passed away recently, has left a bequest for Indian work to the Oblate Order and we are prepared to devote this money to the erection of a new chapel.\n\nIf you permit us to proceed with this work, it will be on the distinct understanding that the new wing in which the chapel will be situated will conform in every respect to the architecture of the school.\n\nThe Oblate Order further undertakes not to urge upon the Department any claim for compensation for the cost of this chapel.\n\nAs we desire to proceed with this work immediately, we would appreciate receiving a favourable reply to our request at the earliest possible date.\n\nOn behalf of the Reverend Oblate Fathers,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nApril 5th, 1935.\n\nDear Father Plourde,-\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the necessity for a new chapel at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. I note that the Oblate Order is prepared to erect this chapel at their own expense and that it will conform in every respect to the architecture of the present school.\n\nIt has been decided to favourably consider the proposal made in your letter of the 2nd instant and the Oblate Order may proceed with the erection of the chapel.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I inspected the new addition to the school made at the expense of the Church. They have erected an addition on the north side which is 30' X 60' at a cost to them of about $7500:00.\n\nThe cost is very small considering the structure and the Principal asks if the Department will supply the following:\n(1) 24 Return Line Valves for Radiators (Dunham Steam Traps) to enable the heat to circulate better. This would cost in the neighbourhood of $300:00 or $400:00.\n(2) Paint for the amount of about $200:00\n(3) Toilets etc. $200:00\n(4) Repairs to plaster which is given way in the old building 400 yards at $1:00 $400:00\n(5) Switch Board Ammeter $10:00 on account of new generator changed from 30 amp. to 150 amp. to take care of the extra lighting.\n(6) Repairs to Main Sewer $75:00, old sewer getting blocked up and cement floor would have to be broken to repair.\n(7) Refills for 5 2\u00bd gal. Pomite Fire Extinguishers\n(8) 1 \u00bd gal. Sandan Fire Extinguishers\n(9) 3 1\u00bd\" Hose complete with Valves and Nozzles\n\nThe new addition contains accommodation for 52 beds and the Principal has furnished a pump for the furnace to assist in heating the building.\n\nI informed the Principal I would pass on his requests and would await your instructions,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The writer assumed that these prices covered cost of transportation to points of delivery.

In fact we had several fires and the last time it started we had a great deal of trouble to extinguish it. We would like to build a chimney this summer as this will be an only mean to prevent a disaster. A good chimney would not cost more than $100.00. I beg of you authorization to have this chimney made and ask the Department to be kind enough as to furnish us the means to do it.\n\nHoping my request receive consideration\n\nI remain, Yours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 14, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, requesting authority to incur an expenditure of $100 in the building of a chimney on the power house at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that the only amount provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year for your school is $450, to build a barge for freighting purposes. It was necessary, when preparing our Estimates, to curtail all expenditure as far as possible; and we were only able to obtain the amount mentioned above to build a barge.\n\nI should be pleased to have particulars from you, regarding how you would propose having the work in building the barge carried out. It would, no doubt, be necessary to have it built near the lake. If you could inform the Department concerning the quantity of lumber and other material that would be required, with the approximate cost, and also what labour would be necessary, in addition to that done by the staff of the school, you would then be advised where the material should be purchased. Please state, also, what power will be used in operating the barge. Will it be towed by boat or will it be necessary to install an engine in the barge?\n\nWhen the Department receives full particulars as to the cost involved in constructing the barge, consideration can be given as to whether any funds would be available in erecting a chimney for the power house. A reply, giving the information requested, will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C.

June 13th 1936\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHave received your letter of May 14th, but for urgent reasons could not answer any sooner; please excuse me for the delay.\n\nRe the building of a barge for freighting purposes we had made the demand of authorization to build same for three consecutive years but never had a word about it. Last Spring as our barge had become so rotten it came apart and we could not use it any more, so having had no word from the Department, we made a new one in June 1935 as we could not be without one at all.\n\nIf the appropriation for the current fiscal year for our School is $450.00, I would suggest it be taken to pay the expenses of the barge built last June and for which I am enclosing the accounts in triplicate. The Brother Eugene Gauthier who had just went unto an operation could not build it himself but he was the one who has overseen the construction. We engaged two competent laborers for the work.\n\nAs labor and material amounts to only $389.70 will the Department take into consideration our great need of erecting a chimney at the power house for the remaining funds?\n\nHoping the Department grant our request and for which we are thanking you in advance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, June 19, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the building of a barge, for freighting purposes, at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. It is noted that you have already arranged for the construction of the barge and enclose certified accounts, covering the cost of the materials and the labour, to the amount of $389.70. A cheque to this amount will be sent you in due course.\n\nRegarding your request that the balance of the appropriation available for your school for the current fiscal year - approximately $70.00 - be utilized in the erection of a chimney for the power house, I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure to that amount in the erection of the chimney. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, for any materials required, and proper time sheets, in triplicate, for any labour that may be necessary to engage in the erection of the chimney. These accounts should be certified by you, in the usual manner, and forwarded to the Department, when payment will be made covering the balance of the appropriation available, approximately $70.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Whenever it is possible to do so the large School Boat is used, but when there are portages a much smaller craft is used.\n\nFather Perreault recently received for this special work the gift of a small freight canoe but he has no engine suitable for it. Would it be in order to ask the Department to supply a small 1 1-2 H.P. Johnson Out-Motor? The cost of these engines is about $75.00.

It is extra work which amounts to very little as we have made this list since three consecutive years without obtaining anything hardly. Here they are in order of rank:\n\n1er. Root cellar estimated at ............ $500.00\nAs we are enlarging our garden a little more every year we have no place to keep the vegetables palatable, which is absolutely necessary for the welfare of our children.\n\n2er. Hayloft and Implement shed, estimated $500.00\nOur present hayloft is so small that we can only put one car load of hay while the other four cars which is the quantity required for the winter have to remain outdoors at all the inclemency of the seasons. A shed could be made for our hay and aside of it a shelter for the implements and wagons.\n\n3er. The enlargement of our Stable, est. $1200.00\nIt is much too small for the number of cows we have. There is danger for them to become T.B. as they are overcrowded. We could possibly get a few more milch cows if we had the locality for them. The children do need more milk.\n\n4er.

If, however, the Principal considers that other work is more necessary than the providing of a new root cellar, the Department has no objection to deferring the construction of the latter building.\n\nPlease consult the Principal and advise the Department in what manner you consider the amount provided in this year's appropriation for the McIntosh School should be expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School\nMcIntosh Ont. June 8th, 1937\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe number of pupils having increased these last years we have not sufficient desks in the Senior Class for them.\n\nConfidently I come to you to ask for help again. Would it be possible for you to obtain eighteen single desks size 2 for us. Those we have are Globe manufacture, if Moyer have that mark I would recommend them.\n\nHoping to be favored by you\n\nI remain, Yours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Father Perreault,-\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting eighteen (18) single desks No. 2 for the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year, there was provided an amount of $500 for the construction of a root cellar at the McIntosh Residential School. Recently, Mr. Edwards wrote asking what amount we had provided for your school this year and he was informed that the amount mentioned in the previous sentence would be available. He was further instructed to consult you and advise whether or not the root cellar was to be constructed or if you preferred the money expended in some other manner. He has not yet replied.\n\nThe point to be kept in mind is that we can only provide $500 for repairs and replacements at the McIntosh School this year. If desks were supplied now, it would reduce the amount considerably.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate your advising if you really require the desks because, you will understand, the cost of them will have to be taken from the amount provided for the McIntosh School for the current year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. C. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJuly 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 16th regarding the condition of the dam at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, the matter was referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch and they estimate that an amount of approximately $1,000.00 will be required to place this dam in good condition.\n\nAs it is important that these repairs be made at once, this Branch is authorizing the Surveys and Engineering Branch to proceed with the necessary work at the earliest possible date. As you have previously been informed, only $500.00 was provided in our current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the McIntosh School. The remaining $500.00 required for repairs to the dam is being taken from a small unlisted amount in our appropriation. Under these circumstances, no funds for other repairs and improvements can be allowed the McIntosh School during the current fiscal year. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of June 1st, 1937. The amount mentioned in that letter is now required for repairs to the dam.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is expected to amount to approximately $3,000.00 and the work is in charge of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nA further item of $500.00 was provided for miscellaneous repairs and equipment. Three sewing machines are being supplied and this will reduce the amount available to approximately $375.00. We have no objection to expending the amount just stated for paint. Please let me have complete details of the paint required stating colours and quantity of each colour in order that arrangements may be made with the Purchasing Agent to secure it.

Gauthier, generally residing at the School, can make all these repairs when given the necessary tools. He could have done a great deal more of the machinery repair work if he had had an electric welder. There is one for sale at the present time at 20% reduction by Leeder's Limited of Winnipeg. I am enclosing a description of the machine.\n\nIf you can see your way to purchasing it for the McIntosh school I think the Department will have made a good investment and one which will pay for itself within a very short time. The price shown on the invoice is net; the 20% having been deducted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was told that paint had been ordered and that the matter of artificial brick or asbestos siding was under consideration. The building should either be painted or have the siding put on. If not done soon, paint now on will be entirely wasted.\n\nThe fire appliances were carefully inspected and found to be in order - with the exception of three old type hand pump tanks which should be replaced with pyrene tank type extinguishers. The fire hose within the building is apparently in good condition but I recommended to the Principal that the hose be tested outside the building first opportunity in order to test for rot. It has been my experience that the rubber in the hose perishes after a number of years whether in use or not.\n\nThe girls dormitory on the top floor, East Wing, is somewhat crowded. The main exit in case of fire is down a wooden stairway at the outside end of the building. While the stairway is large enough to accommodate all the pupils under normal conditions I would like to see an additional\nFire escape installed in this wing to take care of a situation in the event of fire cutting off the escape by means of the stairway.\n\nI was impressed with the apparent health and cleanliness of the pupils. They are all robust and happy. The physique and carriage of these children is remarkable. The manual training for both boys and girls is progressing very well.\n\nThere are several acres of new farm land cleared and some ready for cultivation this year. The stock is well kept and the stables will compare with any on modern farms.\n\nNo doubt the craftsmanship and ability of the Brothers Gauthier has been pointed out many times before. These men are apparently able to turn their hand to anything and the saving effected by their efforts over a period of years would be difficult to estimate.\n\nOn the whole I was very favourably impressed with the work being done by this institution.\n\nIn the late afternoon I had an hours meeting with the Councillors and several members of the Grassi Narrows Band. They had several complaints and requests, all of which will be attended to in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGifford Hartman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1939.\n\nEXD\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant reporting on your recent inspection of the McIntosh Indian residential school.\n\nFor your information I may say that provided the expenditure is absolutely necessary the Department is prepared to consider expending an amount not exceeding $1400.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nWe have no record of having received any order for paint for this school.\n\nYou should let me have detailed information regarding the repairs, improvements etc. which you consider should be made giving an estimate of the cost and sufficient information regarding any material needed to permit our Purchasing Agent to secure it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Please advise what action may be taken regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS/R\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR\n\nAugust 29th,\n1939.\n\nMr. Gifford Swartman, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSIOUX LOOKOUT, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are enclosing, herewith, in quadruplicate, our account amounting to $41.00, covering inspections at Sioux Lookout and McIntosh Residential Schools. Kindly have cheque made out, as per letterhead of account, and forward to Toronto. Certificates will be issued in due course.\n\nLast year, we wrote Capt. Frank Edwards regarding the vertical boiler used for laundry purposes at the McIntosh School. This boiler was really much too small for the work when it was first installed, and seeing that much more work is being applied right along, I would strongly advise that a larger boiler be installed replacing the present one.\n\nThe whole trouble with the boiler is in the height. The water gauge glass is only 3\" long and, consequently, the boiler is either full of water or water very low, so, therefore, I would again advise that a boiler be installed, with increased capacity. I may suggest it would be quite an easy matter to increase the height of the present boiler to give it the required capacity, by adding another course which would mean longer tubes being fitted and would cost much less than a new boiler.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn M.

I am anxious to know if it will be possible for you to secure information with respect to the extension of the present boiler and the approximate cost of this extension. Just as soon as this information is received by the Department the matter will be very carefully considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. Swartman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the McIntosh Indian Res. School, Rev. Father C. Perreault, O.M.I., who informs me that although the sum of $1400.00 was appropriated for an addition to the school stable, no materials have yet been received for this purpose.\n\nOnce more I wish to call your attention to a situation which is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with on the part of the Principals. The months of July and August, when the children are away on their holidays, are certainly the best months of the year to proceed with repairs, alterations and additions to the schools and outside buildings. If materials for repairs and additions are supplied late in September the work involved is not only more difficult but it is a great deal more expensive.\n\nThe Principal has asked me to report this case to the Minister, but I prefer to take it up with you personally as the Minister surely has much more weighty problems to look after.\n\nHoping that you will give Father Perreault's request your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 5)\nOttawa, September 18, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend Father Plourde. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThe records here indicate that a requisition for the supplies referred to in Father Plourde's communication was sent forward to the Purchasing Division on July 26.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 5)\nOttawa, September 21st, 1939.\n\nDear Father Flourde,\n\nMr. Hoey has shown to me your letter of the 16th instant in reference to certain materials that are required for the McIntosh Indian Residential School about which considerable delay has occurred in their purchase. When Mr. Hoey brought the matter to my attention I immediately took it up with the Purchasing Agent and found that for some reason or other the purchasing requisition had been overlooked and not dealt with in the way it should have been. I certainly regret that this delay has occurred but I have given instructions that the material should be bought at once.\n\nI remember your discussion with me when you pointed out the advisability of dealing with these purchases as quickly as possible and I have impressed the importance of this upon the Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.W.

Upon\nmy return I find that the factory had not shipped your\nswitch for the reason that they made an error in the catalogue\nin the listing of the switch you wanted.\n\nThey now state that it will not be satisfactory\nto use the switch which I quoted you upon for a motor of 5\nhorse power D.C. The switch that you suit your purposes\nis our #7120 EME and would cost you $79.72 instead of the\n$66.83 which I quoted you.\n\nThey have held this up till my return and until I\nhave had a chance to write you. Please advise if it will be\nin order to ship you the #7120 EME switch. Thanking you, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.R.KELLY (signed)\n\n---------------------------------\n\nA.O.Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDom.Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter from the agent\nfrom whom the magnetic switch was ordered nearly a month\nago, and not yet delivered for the reason that there is an\nerror in their catalogue. It is indeed very regrettable\nthat such a thing should happen. This delay might have\nserious consequences for us. The operator of this motor is\nso afraid of the starter now in use that once it is started\nhe let the motor run continuously the whole day. When\nseasons change the starter must be used to allow the motor\nto cool off. The starter we have now is not well suited\nfor this motor. It has always given trouble. I do not\nknow of any other switch than the one order to control this\nmotor properly. We have three other switches of this type\ngiving entire satisfaction.\n\nI hope that you will be kind enough to\ncommunicate with Mr. Kelly and have the switch forwarded\nas soon as possible and oblige yours truly,\n\nRec.

Mr. John M. Kelly, Provincial Boiler Inspector, informed me last year that in his opinion would only be good for one more year.\n\nIt was suggested in Mr. Kelly's report of August 29, 1939 - copy of which was forwarded you with our letter of September 6th, file 144:7-M - that the boiler be re-built but owing to the gauge of the metal it is now considered that this would not be satisfactory since it is no doubt badly rusted and pitted inside and in a few years would require a complete replacement.\n\nThe Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company has quoted on a boiler suitable for the School's requirements as follows:\n\n1 -- PASCOL 13 H.P. Vertical Boiler, 32\" dia. x 86\" high, 100# working pressure; furnace 27\" dia. x 27\" high.

Possibly an extra man or two could be engaged for a few days at haying time which would eliminate the necessity for the purchase this year.

Port Arthur, Ont., including 8\u00bd sales tax.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent used the information contained in your letter and requested several firms to quote and a quotation of $285.00, f.o.b.

It is possible, of course, that they are quoting on a different boiler. I should appreciate your forwarding to me at once the written quotation which either you or the Principal received from the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company.

Kelly, Boiler inspector, to submit a proposition for a new laundry boiler for your school. In connection with this, might say that on November 13th, 1939, we quoted on a 6 H.P. Vertical Boiler, being 24\" dia. x 6' 8\" high, to Mr. Gifford Swartman, Indian Agent, with the understanding that this boiler was for your school. We now notice in your inquiry that you would require as large a boiler as you could get through a 55\" wide door, and you suggested the boiler be 52\" diameter. We are, therefore, pleased to quote as follows:\n\n1 - Pascal 13 H.P. Vertical Boiler, 32\" dia. x 86\" high, 100# working pressure; furnace 27\" dia. x 27\" high.

I was informed, when I was in Ottawa last, that if this list was forwarded immediately, you would place the order without any delay.\n\nRev. Father Perreault, the Principal, informs me that the last lot of paint which was supplied came from Kenora and he was far from satisfied with its quality. It is also probable that the price was higher than what it would have been if the order had been placed with a wholesale house in Winnipeg. Your Purchasing Agent in Ottawa should be advised, I believe, that much better prices can be secured from wholesale firms than from local retail stores such as exist in Kenora.\n\nA great deal of this paint work can be done now by the school staff without any extra cost in wages. But if your Purchasing Agent takes as long to fill this order as he does to fill most orders that are placed with him, the paint will be delivered to the school at a time when the men have to do all the Spring work, and consequently other employees will have to be secured, meaning extra expense for the school.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is always full of water to the top - consequently, there is no water available to the building when the turbine is shut off - even for a few minutes, which is a great inconvenience.\n\nAs the tank is placed on cement saddles, tight against the walls in a corner and within 6\" from the ceiling it is impossible to locate the leaks and repair them. The only remedy is to replace it.\n\nThe present tank, 48\" x 16' has been placed where it is at the time of the construction of the power plant, in 1925 and the cement walls for the root cellar, built after its erection. So, it is impossible to remove it unless the roof is taken off.\n\nAs mentioned to you, the new tank needs not be as large as this because the water pump is in constant operation.\n\nWe would suggest a size 30\" in dia. by 96\" long would be quite large enough and can be taken in through the present doors. Same tank to be installed on the side because the head room under roof being only 6'6\", is limited by windows in adjoining room in basement and heating plant room.\n\nThe tank should\nThe tank should be provided with 4 openings under side as follows: One 3\" opening for connection to supply pipe from the pump, two (2) 2\" openings, one for connection for delivery pipe to building and one to waste, also one 1\" opening for water column.\n\nOn the top there should be one 1\" opening to correspond with the 1\" below for water column and pressure gauge, and one \u00be\" opening for air line from compressor. There should be one manhole on the end near water column.\n\nYou have noticed the amount of water on the floor caused by the leaks which, owing to moisture, is very bad for preserving our vegetables.\n\nWill you please be kind enough to interest the Department in this matter and have the small tank purchased as soon as possible.\n\nWith anticipated thanks\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1941.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the pressure tank at the McIntosh Residential School. The total amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school has now been expended and under the circumstances it is not possible to incur further expenditure. Minor repairs might be made to the present tank in order to have it last throughout the current winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\nJanuary 5th, 1942\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRes. National Indian Residential Schools,\n\nIn reference to our memorandum of the 10th ultimo regarding the estimated cost of certain repairs and fire protection at the schools, Mr. Dew has supplied information as follows:\n\n1. Replacement of roof over kitchen, pantry, heating plant, etc.\n\n   Japly built-up Asphalt Roof - Material $236.02\n\n2. Replacement of roof over pressure tank and root house.\n\n   Japly built-up Asphalt Roof - Material $254.64\n   Lumber $25.00\n   Hardware $7.80\n   Total $337.44\n\n3. Pressure Tank 10'x10'x10'\n\n   Shell of 1/4\" steel plate, ends of 5/16\" steel plate (black) $135.00\n\n4. Fire Protection -\n\n   Pipe and fittings $18.80\n   Equipment $126.65\n   Freight charges $1.65\n   Total $246.01\n\nNo labour costs have been included in the above estimates. The present school staff is capable of installing Items 3 and 4 without outside assistance and it is believed that they could carry out Items 1 and 2 if they were supplied with the necessary rope and a kettle for heating the asphalt. However, the question of supplying labour should be discussed with the school authorities before taking any further action.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed with the abovementioned work, Mr. Dew is prepared to supply details of the materials required for each of the four items mentioned.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The Purchase Order, being for the current fiscal year, was therefore cancelled immediately as the 45\u00b0 inches of 1-7/8\" Bekore shafting was purchased, and Mr. Gow now requests authority to re-order this material from the same firm.

It was assumed that your branch had some arrangement with the School authorities under which this work would be done.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Roofing, McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Surveys & Engineering Branch, in which he states:\n\n\"Brother Eugene Gauthier of the McIntosh Indian Residential School was in Mr. Cow's office this morning and brought up the question of who was to carry out the work of repairing the roof at the school, now that the material has been purchased for the job and has been delivered. It was explained to Brother Gauthier that this office had nothing to do with the purchase of materials and it has received no word as to who is supposed to carry out the placing of the new roofing. Brother Gauthier stated that insofar as the Principal of the school was concerned they had not agreed to do any work in connection with the replacement of the roof and that they were unable to carry out any part of this work. The school authorities are anxious that this roof repair work be carried out at the earliest possible date.\"\n\nIn the estimates of this year the sum of $700.00 was provided for supplies and repairs at the McIntosh School. At this date the sum of $750.00 has already been spent. In view of this fact it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for the Department to provide the amount of money necessary to defray the cost of the labour necessary to the roof of the building. It so happens that this year we have exceeded most of our appropriations with the result that there are no funds available for this or any other purpose. Would it be possible for you to secure from the Principal of this school an estimate of the\n\nMr. G. Swartman,\nIndian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 6)\ncost involved and the extent to which the school is prepared to assist in this matter? If the school finds itself unable or unwilling to bear part of the cost it is just possible that these repairs may have to be postponed until the next fiscal year.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference is made to our Estimates for 1943-44 which were recently submitted to the Department. You will note at that time we did not outline details for repairs to Works and Buildings required for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. We are enclosing herewith detailed list of requirements. Unfortunately the Reverend Principal did not furnish us with estimated costs and it would require approximately two weeks for us to obtain the necessary figures, consequently we are forwarding the list as received.\n\nIt is noted that a new wooden flume is required for the power plant. The Reverend Principal states that the one now in use might be patched in order to make it last throughout the winter, providing he could obtain rubber patching material.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

In some manner the account has been mislaid and consequently payment has not been made. It would be appreciated if you would forward two copies of your account to the Principal, Rev. C. Perreault, O.M.I., McIntosh, Ont. He will certify the account and forward it to this office for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSioux Lookout, Ont.,\nNovember 4th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to Mr. Hoey's letter of October 2nd, File 130-7-5, with respect to repairs required for the roof of the laundry and boiler room at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, I have to advise that the necessary repairs have been attended to by the School Staff. They also had assistance from two Brothers who were sent down to help with the job. The roof is now in first class shape, although it may require an additional four barrels of coal tar next summer to mix in with the gravel. It will depend on how the gravel now on the roof mixes with the tar already applied, but the results of this will not become apparent until after we have some real warm weather next summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 6)\nDuring a recent visit to the McIntosh Indian Residential School the condition of the bake oven was brought to my attention. This piece of equipment is in very bad shape and I recommend that steps be taken to replace same as soon as one may be procured. The oven in present use is an Oxford Portable No. 72 C manufactured by the Gurney Company, Limited, size $3\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet and built in three sections. The top and lower sections are now useless and the middle one is the only part serviceable.\n\nI understand that it is necessary to bake three days each week and two bags of flour are used for each batch of bread. With only the one section of the oven, many hours and much labour are required for each day's baking. It is also quite probable that the centre section of the oven will not last much longer. A larger oven should be obtained if possible, as the bake room would accommodate one from 8 to 10 feet long.\n\nWhile on the subject of the McIntosh school, I wish to report that the new penstock is now completed and in use. The workmen made a first class job. All that remains to be done now is to place a roof over the entire length of the penstock in order to protect it from the weather. It is estimated that this structure will last for another forty years.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nGS:K\n\nIndian Affairs.

This clothing was forwarded to your school by the R.C.A.F. Station at Toronto on the request of this Branch. As you understand, clothing for pupils attending Indian residential schools is provided by the school management from per capita grant, or other receipts, and as a consequence when the Department arranges for supplying any Indian residential school with discarded military clothing it is felt that, as this is supplied free of charge, the school concerned should pay the carrying charges. This means that the school secures the clothing at a very reasonable cost. In view of what has just been said I feel certain that you will forward a cheque for $16.85 to the Canadian National Railways, Toronto, Ontario. This is the same procedure as is adopted in the case of discarded military clothing forwarded to other Indian residential schools throughout Canada.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Limited, a communication reading as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the last three items of your order No. 21135 calling for round cast iron split bushings, we have received a letter from the manufacturers wanting to know the exact style of pulleys for which these bushings are required.\n\n\"On receipt of this information we will endeavour to make shipment as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe purchase order embodied all details regarding the bushings included in your requisition (file 130-7-5). Evidently the vendor wants to know the name of the manufacturers of the pulley, and the serial number or catalogue number of same. Please request the McIntosh school management to supply the above and any other information regarding the pulleys that will assist the vendor to procure the right kind of bushings.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 26, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 20, forwarding list of fittings required to install the shaft in the laundry at the McIntosh School, I enclose a copy of a memorandum just received from the Purchasing Branch.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible the exact style of pulleys for which these bushings are required, also any other information regarding the pulleys that will assist us in securing the proper kind.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 150-7-5\n\nDecember 3, 1948\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-415\n\nSHIP TO: Rev. O. Perreault, Principal, Indian Residential School, McIntosh, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\nNote: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nConsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1 Bake oven with capacity of 200 - 1\u00bd lb. leaves at each baking (the new Hubbard Modal F. bake oven, or equal, would be suitable for this work) |\n\nNote: In presenting the request for this equipment the Indian Agent advises that the top and lower sections of the oven now at the school, which was supplied during the fiscal year 1936-37, are useless and the middle section is the only part serviceable. With only one section of the oven available much extra fuel is used in baking. He further advises that it is quite probable that the centre section of the oven will not last much longer. In addition the oven now at the school was supplied when the enrolment was considerably smaller than it is at present and consequently an oven of the size requested on this requisition is needed.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moreover, a chimney of this description would not be effective in winter or damp weather in Summer, especially when used only every other day.

Our scow that was built 20 years ago is absolutely gone; the wood is all rotten and cannot be repaired. A new one is urgent for next spring. The cost for material will be around $350.00.\n\n2. The main drive belt for the turbine is in use since 20 years, was repaired several times and we are afraid it brakes soon causing lots of damages. A new one is also urgent. The cost will be around $100.00.\n\n3. 20 M shingles to cover the water pipe that was built last year. Cost around $200.00.\n\n4. 105 bags of cement to make new saddles under the water pipe. Cost about $100.00.\n\n5. Paint, varnish etc., for many repairs to school and other buildings. Cost about $150.00.\n\nIf possible we would like to have materials for scow this winter, so we will have time to make it for the spring.\n\nAs for the belt, it would be preferable to have it now in case we have to replace the old one.\nOttawa, September 13, 1944.\n\nDear Father Perrault:\n\nThe Reverend Father Plourde has left with me a summarized statement of certain repairs and equipment which appear to be more or less urgently required at the McIntosh Residential School.\n\nIn the estimates recently approved by Parliament, the sum of $500.00 was included for repairs at McIntosh. Of this amount, however, $158.01 has already been spent for the purchase of paint. In view of all the circumstances and our earnest desire to keep our residential schools in a reasonably good state of repair, I would be prepared to recommend an additional expenditure of $800.00 at your school during the present fiscal year. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would summarize your most urgent needs, the cost of which should not exceed this amount, and send them forward to us, together with any recommendations you may care to make, at an early date. It has occurred to me that these repairs should be undertaken at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend G.

(RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 6)\nDuring my recent visit to the McIntosh Indian Residential School, the installation of the new bake-oven was brought to my attention. This oven is installed in a new addition to the basement 28' from the main chimney. The oven manufacturers advise that the length of pipe from the chimney should not be over 10'. In this case it is impossible to have a shorter length than 28' due to the location or the chimney and oven. They also recommend a 10' pipe whereas the new pipe was 7', and entered the same flue in the main stack or chimney as the steam boiler and laundry. The former arrangement was very unsatisfactory, as the flue was not large enough to take care of all (boiler, laundry and oven) at the same time.\n\nThe alternatives to put the oven in working condition are:\n\n1. Build a chimney which would be high enough to clear the main building and large enough to withstand wind pressure. This would mean a chimney 55 - 60' high, and would require guy wires. The estimated cost for such a chimney would be from $300. to $350.\n\n2. To have an iron stack, specially made, of proper size and height to clear the buildings. The main objections to a steel smoke stack are that unless it is properly insulated there is a great deal of condensation. In this case, where the oven is only used every second day, the condensation would be even greater than if the stack was in use continually. We are unable to submit an estimate of the cost to manufacture a stack of this description.\n\n3. The third alternative would be to install a special induced draft system. This would mean a short piece of iron smoke pipe extending 6' above the roof with an induction draft fan. The Alpha Manufacturing Company of Winnipeg quote a price of $285.00 to supply all necessary equipment for this installation.\n\nIt is recommended that this equipment be provided, as we believe it would prove highly satisfactory as well as less costly, and would also eliminate an additional chimney or smoke stack on the West side of the School which would detract from the appearance of the building.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, January 10, 1945.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent, Sioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the oven installed at the McIntosh School. It is regretted that the necessity for extra installation was not considered by the Principal before he erected the addition in which the oven is placed.\n\nI note your third alternative and that you estimate the cost at $235.00. Some months ago we received a statement from the Principal, outlining the necessity for this equipment, and at that time he stated the cost would be $169.00 and that the school would supply the motor. I would appreciate your comments regarding this difference. In any case, we will have to have more complete information regarding the special induced draught system, as the order will have to be placed through the office of the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey\n\nWith reference to your requisition of the 6th instant, file 130-7-5 for dimension lumber and hardware for building a barge for the McIntosh Indian Residential School, as stated in telephone conversation or even date with your office, there is a note on the tender submitted by the Cusson Lumber Company, St.Boniface, as follows:\n\n\"Avant de placer la commande voir \u00e0 corriger cette liste selon la liste en fiche ici au Bureau du R.P.Principal.

These are described as follows:\n\n1. The main belt from the turbine to the drive-shaft pulley; 52' long by 8\" wide, double heavy-duty, of the best quality, is required. This delivers from 30 to 40 Horse Power. This belt operates continuously under moist conditions and is used in every part of the Plant. The present belt is badly worn toward the edges, which means about 50% or less of the belt surface is operating the pulley. It slips, under a heavy load and will not drive the generator to full capacity at present. There is also the danger of the belt slipping off the pulley, and if this happened during the night when the light was extinguished, considerable damage would be occasioned in a few seconds, as the belt runs alongside a very intricate and expensive machine. It would also mean that the Power Plant would be out of operation, and the School would be without lights and water except that which could be delivered by the auxiliary gasoline motor.\n\nThe present belt has been in operation continuously for nineteen years.\n\n2. Generator belt; A 28' by 6\" double leather heavy-duty belt is required for the generator. The belt in present use has been in operation for ten years. It is badly cracked and in one place broken where something on the way across, beyond repair. If this belt is supplied, it is requested that it be joined or glued at the School. The belt is used on the 15 Kilowatt generator. It is important that a replacement for this belt should be supplied at a very early date.\n\nIndian Affairs.

January 17th, 1945\n\nMr. Gifford Swartman,\nIndian Agent\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReply to your letter of Jan. 13th. File 144-7M\n\nAs requested, here is the explanation of the difference in price given by the Alpha Manufacturing Co.\n\nThe former plan furnished by one of the Company who was not an engineer and it comprised only one fan which had to be placed in the course of the pipe near the oven and through which the hot smoke or gas were to pass. This plan was not recommended by their engineer for the reason that such hot smoke would have burned the fan in a short time, and consequent heat transmitted to the pulley would have been very injurious to the belt. Same estimate comprised only the fan; piping was to be made here, whereas the last estimate included another type of fan outside of the smoke pipe, all the piping and the bracket to support motor and fan.\n\nIt is our wish that this Company should be favored with this order because, by their experience, they have really solved our problem in a way much cheaper than a brick chimney or steel stack.\n\nIf you think a copy of the Alpha quotation here included, will satisfy the Department. We would like to keep the original in the case the Department would refuse to supply it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nJanuary 27th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phelan's letter of January 10th, File 130-7-5, referring to the installation of induced draft fan in connection with the new bake oven at the McIntosh Indian Residential School.\n\nWe took up the matter of a difference in the estimated cost with the Principal, and he has explained the subject in the enclosed letter. I was not aware that there had been an estimate of $169.00 already submitted but apparently the equipment to be supplied at this figure would have been inadequate. The last quotation does not include electric motor, as the School authorities will attend to that themselves.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter from the Alpha Manufacturing Company specifying the induced draft fan etc., also sketch showing sectional view of the layout.\n\nAs indicated in previous correspondence, this appears to be the only logical installation for the oven, and I doubt if it would be more expensive than constructing a huge brick chimney or having a special steel stack constructed.\n\nG.

For your information I enclose quotation dated September 2, 1944, for the material requested. This quotation includes sales tax but does not include the cost of freight from Winnipeg to McIntosh.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: New Bakery, McIntosh School.\n\nThe department has supplied a new bake oven for the McIntosh School and to install this oven it was necessary to enlarge the room used as a bakery. This addition measures 14'x14' and is 12' high. It is built entirely of cement and will later inside be lathed and plastered.\n\nThe chimney used before is now too far away and cannot be used. A new chimney would need to be 50' high and as only a 10\" flue is required such a chimney standing by itself could not withstand the wind. The original chimney, which is used for the furnace, is 4\" square at the base and over 50' high. A suitable brick chimney would involve a heavy expense. The alternative proposal is to build a low chimney and use the inductive draft method. The draft of the chimney is increased by use of a fan operated by a motor. The complete unit is manufactured by the Alpha Manufacturing Company, of Winnipeg, and Brother Gauthier states the price to be $325.00.\n\nThe installation of the oven is about completed and I recommend that the principal be authorized to purchase the inductive draft unit outlined above. I doubt if the cost would exceed the price of a large brick chimney, and Brother Gauthier states he is confident the system will give better results.\n\nThis matter should be authorized at once so the equipment can be obtained and the bills submitted prior to the first of March.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Belting Required at McIntosh School.\n\nI understand this matter has already been submitted for approval. Two belts are needed.\n\n1. The belt now in use on the second dynamo is no longer safe. It is badly checked with several cracks through the leather and part way across the belt. The belt required is a \"Neptune\" - 6\" wide and 21' long, heavy duty, endless and is manufactured by Canadian Graton and Knight Ltd., 84 St. Antoine Street, Montreal.\n\n2. The other belt is the main driving belt from the turbine to the line shaft. It is 8\" wide and 40' long (one long piece the two ends of which can be laced on arrival). If rubber belting is supplied it should be not less than 10 ply - if leather, the same quality as that outlined above. The present belt is 20 years old and has had continuous service except for slight wear. The edge (both sides) is worn thin back 1/2\" and so the driving power is reduced by 2\u00bd inches. The belt locking surface power is inclined to slip; then when it takes hold of the load it tends to run off the pulley. If this belt should run off (and it is doing 24-hour duty) a serious breakage to the turbine might occur and the school would be left without light or water and it would necessitate closing down. I recommend that these belts be purchased at once, and thus eliminate the possibility of breakage.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Affairs for Manitoba.\nOttawa, February 17, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a recommendation from Inspector Hamilton that the following belting be supplied at the McIntosh School:\n\n1. Belt for second dynamo - belt 6\" wide and 21' long.\n2. Main driving belt from the turbine to the line shaft - belt 8\" wide and 40' long.\n\nIn a communication received from Father Plourde at the end of January, he requested for your school a belt 40 ft. long by 8\" wide. Detailed information regarding this belt was contained in your letter to Father Plourde of January 24, 1945. We have submitted this request to the Purchasing Branch, and it would appear that this is the same belt as mentioned above in Mr. Hamilton's letter.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the only additional belt we are ordering now is the one for the second dynamo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe empty paint cans from orders of October 1943 and June 1944, we haven't returned them as it did not occur to us to do so. We usually keep them for other useful purposes but if you prefer having them we shall return same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSchools:\n\nDuring the quarter visits were made to both the McIntosh and Sioux Lookout Indian Residential Schools. At McIntosh an attempt was made to have the children familiarize themselves with the outside pole-type fire escapes. The boys were very proficient but the girls, especially the younger ones, were unable to use the escape with any degree of confidence. However, the Reverend Principal assured me he would see to it that they had plenty of practice in future. I might add that under certain conditions in the winter months, the iron pole fire escapes are dangerous for the inexperienced.\n\nAt the Sioux Lookout School the poles are inside the building. This arrangement permits the pupils to have more practice, although the efficiency of the arrangement is open to question. At the Sioux Lookout School twenty-two of the older pupils are enrolled in the Air Cadets. They are being trained by Miss Richardson, a staff member who was previously in the Women's Division of the R.C.A.F. These boys are all greatly interested in this movement and look very smart in their uniforms.\n\nAt both Residential Schools in this Agency lack of recreational and athletic opportunities is very noticeable. I believe that much more thought should be given to this phase of school life, as the Indian children seem to enjoy sports and games even more than our own children do. Under proper supervision this would go a long way toward developing character and physique.\n\nG.

You know that recruiting for this school is done mostly over the waters. For instance, in our travel back and forth from McIntosh to Grassy Narrows, a distance of over 40 miles, the only known road is the water one. This applies to other parts of their territory. Consequently, an outboard motor is of vital necessity for recruiting and I hope that if one of these motors can be had at the present time, that you will willingly supply it. I understand that a smaller motor than the one asked for would hardly be advisable as the distances are long, the lakes are rough and consequently they have to use larger boats than they might otherwise.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your sympathetic consideration, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 5th November, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure an outboard motor for the McIntosh Indian Residential School. It is possible that the delivery of this will be delayed for several months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.C.

Jackson,\n\nThe attached requisition from the Indian Affairs Branch requests the purchase of a 5 H.P. outboard motor for the Indian Residential School at McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nThis motor is to be used in connection with recruiting for the school, one Reserve being approximately 40 miles from the school and the only method of transportation is by water. The Evinrude 5\u00bd H.P. motor costs $160.20, and the 5 H.P. Johnson motor $155.00, f.o.b. McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nPlease advise me what action you wish taken in connection with this request.\n\nH. J. Davidson,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, November 16, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum from Mr. Davidson to Mr. Jackson, I may say that a request similar to that of the McIntosh School has been received in the past from two or three of the Indian residential schools which are located beside a lake.\n\nThe school management is responsible for bringing children to the school and returning them home for holidays; consequently, when the Indians concerned reside along a waterway which is the only method of transportation during the summer months, it is essential that the school have a boat. The McIntosh School has not sent us any large accounts for transportation of children to and from the school. Under the circumstances, I believe that this outboard motor should be supplied.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\n5th November 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nMcIntosh R.C.

The firm was instructed to forward the account to you so that you could certify it, but this account has not yet reached the Department. If the recharges have been received, you should certify the account and forward same for payment. The firm was notified to attach to the account a receipt for the item of $1.75 for transportation.

Perreault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ont.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nDecember 31st, 1945.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31ST 1945.\n\nWelfare and Training.\n\nBoth the McIntosh and Sioux Lookout Residential Schools are practically filled to capacity. McIntosh has an enrollment of 131 and Sioux Lookout 150. The new road to the Sioux Lookout School was completed in early December, to the stage where it is passable. Owing to the lack of proper equipment to keep the road open it has not been of much value in recent weeks. Considerable graveling and widening will have to be done in the summer before it may be considered as an all-weather road. Some of the work could be done by the school staff if they had a dump-truck, and it is urged that one be provided. It could also be used to haul wood and would lessen the work of the pupils.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that the children in our Residential Schools do not have sufficient recreation and opportunity to engage in sports and games. Actually they have not much time for such, owing to the endless chores and outside work. At the Pelican School, fuelwood in the winter months is one of the big problems\u2014cutting it in the woods, hauling it to the School, sawing it and firing the boilers. It has been suggested to the Principal that he investigate the cost of coal as compared with wood. It certainly would be a tremendous saving in man or boy hours.\n\nI am also of the opinion that the more labour saving devices that could be installed in our Schools, the better, as it would certainly allow the children much more time for other worthwhile activities. (It might be pointed out again that there is an extension of the hydro system to within two miles of the Sioux Lookout School.) However, like any other institution or business, the success of a School depends largely on management and supervision.\n\nG.

Hoey.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from the Plaunt Hardware Company, Ottawa, from which you will note that two motors were shipped to Father G. Perrault, O.M.I., McIntosh, Ontario, while our Purchase Order 6885 called for one motor.\n\nPlease advise me if two motors were received, and, if so, is it the intention to leave the extra motor at McIntosh, have it returned to Ottawa for shipment elsewhere, or if it is to be returned to the Plaunt Hardware Company.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, 10 October 1946.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSIoux LOOKOUT, Ontario.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 1945, Purchase Order No. 6685 was issued to the Plaunt Hardware Company, Ottawa, for an outboard motor for the McIntosh School. This motor must have reached the school because we received a certified account from Rev. C. Perrault on Feb. 6, 1946, and cheque for $153.00 was sent to the Plaunt Hardware Company.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter which has just been received from this Firm and you will note that they claim two motors have been shipped and they have only been paid for one.\n\nPlease make immediate inquiries and advise this office if the two motors were received. If so, have they both been used? If the two motors have been received and one of them has not been used I presume we can arrange to return it to the Company.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Canoe Freighter for McIntosh School.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe McIntosh School is in need of a small canoe freighter, 18 feet long, to be operated by an outboard motor for the purpose of transporting children to and from the school. It will also be needed for recruiting purposes. I am informed that this canoe is made by the Peterborough Boat Company of Peterborough, Ontario and that the price is $165.00.\n\nPlease let me know if the school can depend on receiving this from the Department.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSIOUX LOOKOUT, Ontario.\n\nWe desire to refer to your letter of Oct. 31st with reference to two motors received at the McIntosh School.\n\nOnly one motor was originally ordered and we would like to know why the second motor was retained and for what purpose it is being used.\n\nWhen the second motor arrived, the Principal should have notified your office so that you could in turn advise us.\n\nAs the matter stands now it will be very difficult to obtain the approval of the Purchasing Division and this will likely necessitate payment for the second motor being made by the school management from their own funds. However, before making a final decision, we will await a further reply from you which should be sent as soon as possible.\n\nBernard F.

I might say that we apparently had no information or advice that the motor had been ordered for the School, otherwise we would have been in a position to check on its arrival.\n\nIt is suggested in future when equipment is being purchased for the Schools in this Agency through the Central Purchasing Office, that we be furnished with a copy of the Purchase Order or a letter advising that the purchase is being made, somewhat along the same lines as your recent advice regarding the purchase of a Stove for the Sioux Lookout Indian Residential School laundry.\n\nG.

We have not received any account covering the cost of this canoe and, therefore, presume you have not shipped it.\n\nPlease let me know at once when you expect to be able to deliver this boat.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Swartman,\n\nEnclosed herewith is an opportunity offer of a stationary Air Compressor Unit, from a very reliable firm. Our engineer has examined it thoroughly and found it in first class condition at a bargain price.\n\nAn efficient high pressure compressor, such as this one, has been wanting here at the McIntosh School, for a long time and it has become a very necessary equipment in our machine shop; for repair work on electric and gasoline motors, and so many other purposes. It is further intended to serve the purpose of our old homemade water tank compressor which is now insufficient and would otherwise need to be renewed.\n\nWe beg that you kindly take notice of this special offer and promptly recommend the purchasing of above equipment to the Department before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nC.E. Connaughton\nPrincipal\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nMarch 27, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith copy of a letter recently received from the Reverend Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School with respect to an Air Compressor. I understand that this can be used to good advantage at the school and if there are funds available it is recommended that the item be purchased. I do not know nor have I means of finding out what the price of a new unit would be but it is suggested that you might make some inquiries from one of the firms in Ottawa dealing in this type of equipment.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nApril 8, 1947.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nFile # 130-7-5.\n\nVOTE ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\nSHIP TO Reverend C.

Thanking you for your trouble, I remain: Yours truly:\n\nC.E. Comeau\nC.E. Comeau O.M.I. Principal.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nOctober 2nd, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter recently received from Rev. Father Comeau wherein he requests two Sewing Machines to replace the old machines which have been in use at the McIntosh Indian Residential School for many years.\n\nEnc. 2\n\nG. Swartman,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian School, Mo. Intesh, Ont.\nOct. 6th, 1947.\n\nMr. G. Swartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux-Loekout, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of your last visit to the School, Dr. Bell pointed out that the cause of the high rate of sickness amongst our girls was the unfitness of the basement class rooms. These rooms are cold and damp. The sun rays never penetrate into them. And to add to this all, at the epoch of heavy rains, water infiltrates into the school, through the concrete foundations at the North west corner of one of the classrooms. The girls have to sit for hours in this chilly atmosphere, their feet on the concrete floor.\n\nWe have on the second floor, a space suitable for two class rooms. It is on the actual play-room of the girls. Over there it is warm and comfortable. There is plenty of sun-light. In every respect, more suitable than downstairs.\n\nThis place is also used as a reception room, at the occasion of Christmas entertainments and on other occasions. The stage could be transported down, and rebuilt exactly at the same place, because the two floors have identical dimensions. This will eliminate the inconvenience caused by the infiltration of water, leaving a space between the two floors.\n\nThis cannot be done without expenses. It will take lumber for two partitions between classroom, leaving space for a corridor between. Downstairs, in the new play-room, it will take three water closets and six wash basins. And also lumber for lavatory room.\n\nIt will therefore require about 2000 feet of quality lumber, which will amount delivered here, to about $200.00. Let us say, about $150.00 for the water works, and $150.00 for labor. Total amount $500.00.\n\nAs this is in the interest of the Department who have to spend so much money for the health of the Indians children, I do not hesitate to make this requisition of $500.00 in order to be able to proceed in making this necessary transformation, without delay. With the hope that you will be successful, I remain.\n\nYours truly:\n\nC.E. Comeau O.M.I. Principal.\nSioux Lookout, Ontario,\nOctober 7th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find memo from Rev. Father Comeau, Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, with respect to changing the basement classroom to the upstairs recreation room, and having the recreation room in the basement.\n\nDoctor Ball recommended this move in his June monthly report. In discussing the matter again yesterday with him he strongly urges that this be attended to without further delay, as he feels it is actually detrimental to the health of the children to be confined to the basement classroom.\n\nWill you please advise as soon as possible if a grant of $500 will be allowed for the purposes mentioned, in order that the work may be completed before the cold weather sets in.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nMr. G. Smartman, Indian Agent,\nSioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 7th instant and the Principal's letter of October 6, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $500.00 in order to change the classroom and recreation room at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, as outlined in the communications above.\n\nBernard E.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian School, Mr. Intosh Ont.\nMarch 23rd, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief Training Division,\nMines & Resources, Ottawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 13th, I remember well to have received these shipments of paint from International Laboratories, but I do not see how I could produce the freight receipt. I have signed all the invoices sent to me and have forwarded them to your office. The International Laboratories are the ones in position to produce this receipt.\n\nI regret very much, dear Sir, to not be able to be agreeable to you in this matter. Sincerely yours:\n\nC.E. Comeau O.M.I. Principal.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1948.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to your account for $4.25 covering the cost of freight on paint shipped to Reverend C.E. Comeau, O.M.I., Principal of the McIntosh Indian Residential School, the audit regulations require that we receive a receipted account from the transportation company.\n\nPlease forward this and when it is received, the item of $4.25 will be paid.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMessrs. International Laboratories Co.,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\n\nPP/MOD\nOttawa, April 2, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention: Mr. James Sinton,\nMcIntosh Indian Residential School,\nMcIntosh, Ontario.\n\nIt is understood that you recently discussed with our Superintendent of Education, the possibility of having a road constructed to the above noted school.\n\nThere are two alternatives for the construction of a suitable link between this school and the existing road:\n\n(1) From McIntosh School via McIntosh Station to connect with the road constructed last summer by the Ontario Minnesota Pulp and Paper Company for winter hauling. This has been marked one on the attached sketch plan.\n\n(2) The road from McIntosh into the school via McIntosh Railway Station to connect with the road from Alexandria Bay and Vermilion Bay. This has been marked two on the attached diagram. It is understood that there was a road location survey made of this proposed road in 1935. Unfortunately, this latter course requires twelve miles of road and would be a very expensive proposition.\n\nTherefore, we requested Mr. G. Smartman, our Superintendent of Sioux Lookout Agency to discuss the situation with Mr. Kelly, your District Engineer at Kenora. We were advised that this official requested our assurance that the Department would share in the expense for the construction of the road outlined in bracket one above.\nMr. G. Swartman also took this matter up with the officials of the Ontario Minnesota Pulp and Paper Company at Kenora. Mr. Swartman advised that the road which they built last Summer from Quibell to the east end of the Lake near McIntosh, is a good one and that he feels that the Company would allow us to use it.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could advise us as to the possibility of sharing the construction of the road from the McIntosh Indian Residential School to connect with the Ontario Minnesota Pulp and Paper road as described in bracket one above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector\n\nThe Municipal Roads Branch,\nDepartment of Highways,\nQueens Park,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nEnclosure:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The compressor and controls are badly worn, and the tubing corroded. I have put this machine in working order for the present, but cannot guarantee how long it will operate.\n\nOwing to the fact this school is located in an out of the way place, I would recommend replacing the present open type unit with a sealed unit which will give years of satisfaction.\n\nIf you should decide to put in a new unit I would be pleased if you would give me the opportunity of quoting you a price.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Lawler\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nWe are enclosing herewith a letter recently received from Mr. Lawler dealing with the refrigerator at the McIntosh Indian Residential School. Following Colonel Neary's suggestion that we be on the lookout for a good used unit, I believe the General Electric in Winnipeg has a machine that should fill our requirements. I asked the General Electric service man to call at McIntosh today where he is to get in touch with the Reverend Principal and go into the matter thoroughly.\n\nThe refrigerator I have in mind is a 6'9\" walk-in type and recently completely reconditioned. It will cost approximately $500.00 delivered to McIntosh. There is no question that a good refrigerator is badly needed at McIntosh.\n\nG.

We expect it around the first of January. At the same time, we tried to buy a breaking plough, but without success so far.\n\nThis item is absolutely indispensable on the farm. With a good breaking plough, we would be able to cultivate about 75 acres of good new land. This would provide us with the feed needed for the coming year. This means a saving of approximately one thousand dollars.\n\nI thought that may be, you would be able to interest the Department of Indians Affairs to buy one for us. If not a new one, perhaps one from the \"War Assets.\" Of course, I would like the Department to pay for it. But if not possible, I am willing to pay for it.

Last fall they attempted to plough some of the new land with an ordinary field plough but their efforts were not very successful, consequently, I would recommend that a breaking plough be supplied for use in the spring providing funds are available.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 7)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI wish to acknowledge Colonel Neary's letter of December 15, File 472-5, with correspondence attached referring to the McIntosh Indian School road.\n\nReferring to the proposed reply to Mr. Lew of the Ontario-Minnesota Pulp and Paper Company, I am in accord with the alternative suggested by Mr. Mattice, however, it should be borne in mind that we are using a good many miles of road constructed by the O & M and I believe it might pay to be a little more conciliatory. It is my suggestion to submit a proposal such as extending the road along the south side of the C.N.R. track approximately two hundred yards eastward and having a new crossing installed there at some future date or when the present crossing and right-of-way is found to interfere with their operations. The extension of the road eastward paralleling a right-of-way should not be an expensive proposition as there is no rock to contend with. There is, of course, the possibility that we may never have to do this as there should be ample space for piling. The crossing is over the main line west of the switch, consequently, it would hardly seem logical that the company would pile wood except along the spur where it could be readily loaded into cars.\n\nI believe that if our crossing did actually interfere with the piling ground we could have the O & M with their equipment extend the road south of the track to point at the east end of their piling ground at very little cost to the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\nGS/HF\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nTO Stanley Brock Limited,\n135 Market Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nFILE NUMBER 62651-15-50-1\n\nOTTAWA August 4th, 1918.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND SHIP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nTO Mr. Swartman, Supt., Indian Agency, McIntosh, Ontario.\n\nVIA\n\nINVOICE NO. 1\n\nSEND A SEPARATE INVOICE FOR EACH ORDER AND SEND 4 COPIES AFTER SHIPMENT.\n\nTO Mr. Swartman, Supt., Indian Agency, Sioux Lookout, Ontario.\n\nFOR McIntosh, Ont.\n\nQUANTITY DESCRIPTION QUOTATION OF July 9th, 1918.

The used 3/4 Horsepower electric motor you could keep and use elsewhere on the premises.\n\nThe final cost minus the trade in allowance, the equipment installed and guaranteed, would be $1,056.50. Shipment is made F.O.B. Winnipeg.\n\nNot included is the plumbing and wiring necessary to connect the equipment to the services in the building.\n\nWith these freezers you could process your own meat in the Fall and keep it the year round. It would allow you to freeze vegetables, fruits and other perishables at the time they are picked thus enabling you to feed the children in your school a year round balanced diet with greater nutritional value and vitamin content. Over and above food value there is actually a definite economy in this method of handling the perishables. It meets alone, the calculated $18.00 to $20.00 savings per hundred pounds of beef.\n\nWe trust this proposal will meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFLUSHING MILLAR LIMITED,\n\nG. A. Guilbeault,\nSales Dept.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 7)\nGuarantee\n\nGeneral Electric refrigeration and air conditioning equipment is guaranteed against defective parts and improper workmanship for a period of one year from date of installation. Free service is supplied during this period. More important is the fact that General Electric equipment continues to deliver satisfactory service year in and year out long after any guarantee period has expired.\n\nService\n\nAll General Electric commercial and air conditioning equipment is installed only by authorized service and installation Dealers. These Dealers are located across the territory and they do nothing but commercial refrigeration and air conditioning work. They are, therefore, thoroughly competent to render first class service as needed as well as insuring an original installation installed by competent men to the end that it will deliver the utmost satisfaction.\n\nMaintenance\n\nAnnual or semi-annual Maintenance Inspection Service is available at extra cost to purchasers desiring same.\n\nFleming-Pedlar Limited\n\nDistributors: Manitoba - Saskatchewan - Western Ontario\nGENERAL ELECTRIC\n\"Conditioned Air\"\nUNIT COOLERS\n\nCORRECT TEMPERATURE\nThe outstanding success of General Electric \"Conditioned Air\" Refrigeration may be attributed in a large measure to the exhaustive study of foods, their structure, and the reasons for spoilage, which was conducted by the Company. It was relatively easy to determine the correct temperature to halt bacterial and enzyme growth in various fresh foods. But this alone was not enough.\n\nCORRECT HUMIDITY\nWith ordinary refrigeration systems, even though the correct temperature is maintained, perishables are found to lose a portion of their water content through dehydration, resulting in shrinkage and discoloration. Shrinkage in meats, for example, can under certain circumstances amount to 50 per cent of the original weight \u2014 a serious product loss. Refrigeration equipment for perishables must therefore also maintain the correct humidity conditions to keep shrinkage down to a minimum. It was also found that too much moisture in the air was liable to freeze-dried perishables to become slimy and to give off or pick up objectionable odors. Further tests established that the correct value varied between 70 and 90 per cent relative humidity, depending on the products stored and the length of storage.\n\nPOSITIVE AIR CIRCULATION\nIn addition to correct temperature and humidity conditions, ideal food preservation requires positive, gentle circulation of air through the entire refrigerated space in order to maintain uniform conditions throughout the area, without dead spots, or objectionable air blast.\n\nAIR PURIFICATION\u2014FASTER COOLING\u2014SPACE SAVING\nGeneral Electric \"Conditioned Air\" Unit Coolers, the first of the kind in the refrigeration field, provide this essential balanced combination of humidity, air circulation, and temperature to maintain the quality, appearance, and weight of perishable foods. They can be adapted to correct conditions for almost any variety of foods and types of storage. Selecting a unit on the basis of a 16 degree difference between entering air and refrigerant evaporating temperature will provide a relative humidity of from 80 to 85 per cent, which is satisfactory in the great majority of applications. A smaller temperature difference will produce a higher relative humidity and, conversely, a larger difference will result in a lower relative humidity.\n\nThe very nature of the system provides added benefits. As the air in the space is circulated, it passes over the moist cooling surfaces. The moisture absorbs odors and particles of dust and dirt, keeping the air fresh and clean. The positive air circulation also makes possible faster cooling. Thus all foods placed in the refrigerated space are brought down to the correct temperature quickly and uniformly. And finally, the highest cooling efficiency of G-E \"Conditioned Air\" Unit Coolers makes possible an extremely compact unit, saving valuable cooler space.\n\nTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nLOCKER PLANTS\nAPPLE STORAGE PLANTS\nPRODUCE WAREHOUSES\nFOOD STORES\nRESTAURANTS\nHOTELS\nINSTITUTIONS\nDAIRIES\nFARM STORAGE ROOMS\nINDUSTRIAL PLANTS\u2014\n\nin those spots where constant temperature and high humidity conditions within range of units must be maintained.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nCASE\nAll-steel construction consists of top, bottom and sides in one piece with one-piece end covers all held in place by through bolts. Rubber buffers make a tight seal to protect against any possible rattle. Case is bonderized and finished in a baked-on brown enamel. Highly resistant to corrosion. Streamlined air intake orifice avoids air noise and permits most efficient fan operation.\n\nCOOLING COIL\nVertical rows of tubes with continuous bonded fins connected in series to drier coil at air inlet end, and expansion valve at air outlet end, provide counterflow refrigerant and air circuits. Tin-plated copper tubing, silver soldered joints and aluminum fins feature the cooling unit core. Fins are spaced six per inch.\n\nFAN\nAphonic type\u2014a product of the General Electric \"House of Magic\"\u2014more efficient and quieter than ordinary fans, moves correct amount of air to give uniform temperature throughout the fixture with fast cooling.\n\nDRYER COIL\nAmple sized coil wrapped around and part of fan guard affords a means of preventing suction line sweating. It is located directly in path of intake air for greatest effectiveness.\n\nMOTOR\nTotally enclosed drip and splash-proof motor with pressure cast aluminum rotor winding. No brushes to wear, or to cause radio interference. High oil capacity, long life, trouble-free bearings need oiling only once a year. Only one size of motor used on all five cooling units.

These amounts are based on the comparative number of pupils in each school who will be playing hockey this season.\n\nI would also add that we expect to have two teams from the Sioux Lookout Residential School playing in organized hockey this winter and that some financial assistance is expected from local citizens. It is also recommended that the Department contribute towards the expenses of operating the teams, in the way of providing equipment for those beginners who are not actually playing hockey. As well as skating and hockey equipment there will also be scrapers and shovels required for clearing the ice.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWe have received your wire approving purchase of the condensing unit.\n\nThe price mentioned covers cost of the equipment and complete installation of same.\n\nFor your information we would advise that we are dealing here with a walk-in cooler and the refrigerating equipment consists of a cooling unit inside the refrigerator and a condensing unit to operate same. When originally investigated in 1948 this equipment which is sulphur dioxide equipment required replacement of the cooling unit inside the refrigerator, which was unsatisfactory, and a new electric motor to be placed on the condensing unit. On arrival at this job our installing mechanic discovered that this SO2 condensing unit was now in extremely bad shape and the installation of the new coil and motor would be a waste because the result would not be satisfactory.\n\nIt was therefore determined that a new condensing unit be installed and this would mean that the whole equipment is being replaced with a new 1950 freon 12 installation. This is the proper step and will give satisfaction and the proper length of life to be expected from a completely new and satisfactory job. The additional equipment being supplied is one GWC31T, 1/2 HP General Electric freon water cooled condensing unit complete with 110 volt DC motor. The extra cost over and above the amount of the original order is $411.00. The new condensing unit is being shipped today and we will follow it up and have it installed immediately.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFLEMING-PEDLAR LIMITED,\n\nC. M. Fleming, Manager.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: McIntosh Residential School\n\nWhilst in Sioux Lookout recently I met Rev. Father Brochet, the new principal, at the opening of the Sioux Lookout Hospital. Apparently things are going along quite satisfactorily at the school as far as he was concerned except for their refrigeration plant. I gather from his remarks that a new walk-in refrigerator was being built and that it was intended to use the old compressor. However the man who was installing the new outfit has recommended that a new compressor be purchased at a cost of $410.00 as he does not feel that the old unit would stand up to the work.\n\nYou may already have some decision made regarding this but thought I would pass on the information to you so that you may be guided accordingly.\n\nF.

McKay, the conditions which I found at the McIntosh School re the equipment for cutting and slicing bread.\n\nDue to the fact that our school girls are asked to attend school all day, very little help can be expected from them. So the director had asked the Brother-mechanic to rig up a machine for cutting bread. I saw it in action and I believe that it is dangerous for children to use it. I told the Principal that I would, on my return to Ottawa, ask the Department if it would be possible to supply a regular bread cutter.\n\nThe machine I would recommend is the one sold by the Pendrith Machinery Co. Ltd., of Toronto. It sells for $315.00\n\nHoping that you will accede to his request,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

White Cement for Fire Brick.\n\nThe Roman Tiles cost 20\u00a2 each.\n\nIt is likely that the Company would send along the necessary Fire Brick Cement, but it is safer to have it ordered.\n\nI have to add that the bake oven is in use every day, except Sundays, and that it is very satisfactory. In fact it is the best I have seen for the last 31 years.\n\nHoping you will be able to have the repairs obtained without much delay, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. Prachet\nRev. J.

This appears to be of great importance particularly in the winter when it is impossible to provide ventilation by any regular means. The Principal informs me that when a window is open for ventilation there is a draft created which is detrimental to the health of those working in the laundry and as a result there has been many colds as well as cases of pneumonia.\n\nIt is recommended that an aircooler, as supplied by The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Ltd., Winnipeg, be furnished. The model required is known as F-15 with 6/6 H.P. motor. The approximate cost is $55.00 complete with shutters, and the complete unit would be installed at no cost to the Department.\n\nSuperintendent,\nSioux Lookout Agency.\nMay 11th, 1950.\n\nMr. G.

Swartman, Superintendent,\nSioux Lookout, Ont.\n\nRe your File 144/15-1472:\nFleming-Pedlar account $ 551.00.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 2nd inst., regarding the second account of Fleming-Pedlar Ltd. to the amount of $ 551.00 I wish to say that it is regrettable that the account is not explicit enough and that it brought confusion to the point of refusal of payment.\n\nThe first item in the account concerns one CW331T \u00bd H.P. General Electric frozen water cooled Condensing Unit complete with 110 volt D.C. Motor, amount $ 411.00, which was authorized by Mr. Fleming as I see in a copy of the Company's letter giving to Mr. Henry on February 17th, 1950, complete explanation about the urgent necessity of replacing the old condensing unit, which was found not only defective but no more usable.\n\nThe second item concerns the 6 cu. ft. Refrigerator which should have been traded in with the coil and being kept by the school adds an amount of $ 140.00.\n\nHere is the trade in allowance offered by the Company on Nov. 4, 1948: \"We would be pleased to make you a trade in allowance of $ 150.50 on your present coil and the 6 cubic foot refrigerator. The used \u00bd H.P. electric motor you could keep and use elsewhere on the premises.\"\n\nIt was assumed then that the little refrigerator as well as the coil belonged to the Department, which fact is not right. It was likely thought also that it was useless whereas it could be serviceable with future repairs. The cook insisted on keeping the old small refrigerator owing to the fact that there is no reach in door on the large refrigerator and that the small refrigerator had always been so handy for many small items.\n\nAt the occasion of your visit here on March 1st, I showed you the small refrigerator asking you to inform the Department of its usefulness and of our wish to keep it. You said you would write the Department about it.\n\nI would be very surprised that the Department would refuse to pay the small amount of trade in balance when the circumstances are duly known about this small school refrigerator.\n\nHoping this explains thoroughly the account, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J. Brachet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6220, file 472-5, part 8)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of letter recently received from Father Brachet, Principal at the McIntosh Indian Residential School, with respect to condensing unit and 6 cubic ft. refrigerator which should have been turned in.\n\nApparently Father Brachet is under the impression that the purchase of the condensing unit with motor amounting to $411.00 was approved. As he points out, the old unit was certainly defective. The 6 cubic ft. refrigerator with motor should have been turned in in accordance with the Purchase Order but, since it can be used to good advantage at the school, it was retained. There also seemed to be some doubt in the Principal's mind as to whether the 6 cubic ft. refrigerator was the property of the school or Department.\n\nI would suggest that, if at all possible, the Department assume the cost of the unit installed by the Fleming Pedlar Company and that the school be assessed for the trade-in value of the small refrigerator.\n\nEncl.\n\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Indian Agency\n| QTY. | SIZE | DESCRIPTION | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|------|-------------|-------|--------|\n| 1    | 3-0  | H-305 HOSPITAL BED IN WHITE ENAMEL FITTED WITH |       |        |\n| 1    | 3-0X6-6 | H-611 HOSPITAL POSTURAL SPRING WITH TWO SIDE CRANKS AND |       |        |\n| 1    | SET   | STANDARD R.T.

Invoices for this work will be submitted when received. One of these was found to be beyond repair and four were reconditioned and returned to the school. On January 10 six new Pyrene extinguishers, 1\u00bd quart size, were received at the school consequently their requirements in this respect have been taken care of.\n\nThe school installed a pipe line through to the new part of the building for fire hose at no cost to the Department consequently the new portion of the building should now have adequate fire protection.\n\nG.

It is our desire to only pay $411.00, and we are arranging with the school management to pay the other $140.00, as they should have returned the refrigerator which they had at the school.\n\nOur reason for authorizing the expenditure of $411.00 was due to the following telegram which we received from the company:\n\n\"Mechanic on job installing new equipment covered by Mines and Resources Purchase Order 48842 file 95437-4-16.

He has also advised that as a result of using the large boiler he is unable to have same cleaned in preparation for the yearly inspection.\n\nPlease contact the Departmental Purchasing Agent and advise when delivery may be expected.\n\nG.
