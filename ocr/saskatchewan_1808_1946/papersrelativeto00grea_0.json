Sir E. B. Lytton, Bart., M.P., (Signed) EDMUND HEAD.\n\n&c. &c. &c.\n\nEnclosure 1 in No. 1.\n\n* * The Spelling of Names of Places, and occasionally the Dates, vary in this Paper; but, in the uncertainty, the orthography and dates have been retained throughout, as in the original Report.\n\nSir,\n\nRed River Settlement, July 4, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 16th and 20th of April, containing instructions for the guidance of the Expedition during the present season. These instructions it will be our endeavour to carry out to the satisfaction of the Government.\n\nI have now the honour to inform you that, as soon as the exploratory surveys in progress at the date of my last report were completed, I set out on the excursion I had proposed, by way of the Manituba and Winnepogoos Lakes, to the Saskatchewan River, and returned by the Assiniboine, reaching this place on the 29th ult.\n\nOn my arrival, I found the men brought here by Professor Hind waiting for me, the Professor himself having gone west to the Souris River.\n\nIn order that as little time as possible might be lost, I immediately dispatched two of my assistants, with eleven men and two canoes to commence work indicated in your instructions, retaining one canoe and five men until such time as I could collect provisions enough to prevent the necessity of sending immediately to Lake Superior, where Professor Hind had left the supplies of provisions, bringing here only enough for his own party. We have now obtained a sufficient supply, and are about to set out.\n\nAs the time at my disposal will not admit of my reporting so fully as I could wish on the various surveys which have been accomplished since the date of my last report, I shall, for the present, confine myself to a brief account of our last Expedition, and a description of the extensive region through which we travelled.\n\nOn the 10th of May, having provided ourselves with such supplies as the settlement could afford, we crossed over to Manitowba Lake. Embarking there in canoes, we had a very tedious passage, against strong head winds, to the north-west end of Winnepogoos Lake. From thence we crossed by the Mossy Portage to Lake Bourbon.\n\nLeaving my assistants to measure the distance, and ascertain the difference of level between the lakes just named, I descended the Saskatchewan to the Grand Rapid and examined it. Returning again to the Mossy Portage, I divided the party, sending my Chief Assistant, Mr. Wells, back by the western coast of Winnepogoos Lake, Lac Dauphin, and the Little Saskatchewan, as detailed in his report, which I send herewith. With the other division of the party, I ascended Swan River, crossed from thence to Fort Pelly, and came down by the Assiniboine.\n\nIn order to be the better comprehended in describing the general appearance of the country, I enclose a rough sketch, hastily compiled from our notes, to which I would respectfully refer you.\n\nA range of high lands, it will be seen, extends south-eastward from the Pasquin Mountain on the Saskatchewan in latitude 53\u00b0 30' North, to the United States boundary line. This range has, in all probability, at some period formed the south-western embankment of a great inland sea, which covered\nthe valley of Red River, and comprised within its mass, Lakes Winnipeg, Winnepegos, Manitouba, and the numerous smaller lakes which are spread over the great alluvial flat in which they lie. The country, bounded on one side by this range and on the other by Lake Winnipeg and the high lands to the eastward of Red River, is an almost unbroken level, sloping very slightly to the Red River and Lake Winnipeg.\n\nPart of this extensive tract is open prairie land, but by far the greater portion is densely wooded. A line drawn north 75\u00b0 West, from the confluence of Red River with Lake Winnipeg to Lac Dauphin, would pass through about an equal extent of woodland and prairie. From thence northward, a forest but rarely broken by prairie openings extends to the Saskatchewan. To the south the country becomes more open, until, on nearing the Assiniboine, the woods entirely disappear, and an apparently boundless prairie spreads out on every side. The streams, however, are all bordered more or less with wood. A heavy growth of oak, elm, basswood, &c. extends in many places for a mile or two from the banks of the Assiniboine.\n\nProceeding by the road from the Red River to Manitouba Lake, the country for the first twelve miles or so presents the appearance of an unbroken level, with clumps of trees rising here and there, like islands, in an otherwise boundless prairie. Further on the wood becomes more frequent, and sometimes the prospect seems bounded by forests. On approaching these however, other prairies open up and other woods appear, and in this way, woodland and prairie alternate all the way to Manitouba Lake. Although the ground seems level, it is not precisely so, but slightly rolling or undulating. The elevations are of every width from half a mile upwards, and run in a direction from north-west to south-east. Between them, in most places, the ground is more or less marshy, and covered with low bushes and willows, or presenting ponds, growing bulrushes, and rank grass. The road is, however, sufficiently dry to be travelled by wheeled vehicles at all times during the summer season. Sometimes little stony ridges occur, marking what has been at one time the shore of a shallow lake.\n\nAt the terminus of the road on Manitouba there is a small settlement, and the settlers are of opinion that their land is superior even to the soil at Red River, while it is not, like it, subject to be overflowed. My own opinion is then, as regards the soil, it is precisely of the same character.\n\nThe north-eastern shore of Manitouba Lake\u2014the coast by which we pass\u2014is low, and of a character so uniform that the same description will apply throughout. By the action of the water or ice, or both combined, a high back of shingle has been thrown up, consisting of water-worn fragments of limestone mixed with occasional boulders of granite. On the top of this range there is generally a dense growth of wood, while between it and the main land an open marsh, varying in width from half a mile to two miles, extends along the whole coast, broken only by occasional points of higher land, which run down to the lake. When we passed, the marsh was covered with withered bulrushes and long grass, which, although of last year's growth, still evinced the rankness of the vegetation peculiar to this region. The stems of some of the bulrushes, on being measured, were found to be an inch and three-quarters in diameter. From the marsh, the main land\u2014a rich alluvial soil\u2014gradually rises to a moderate elevation, and is not subject to be inundated. The country bordering on the lower end of Winnepegos Lake and Sanguiissippi River, the stream which connects it with Manitouba, is of the same description. About the middle of Winnepegos Lake, the land becomes slightly higher, and the marshes disappear. The limestone rock then shows itself for a short distance, rising in horizontal strata to an elevation of thirty feet or so above the lake. At the Mossy Portage, a comparatively barren ridge separates the waters of Winnepegos Lake from those of Lac Bourbon.\n\nFrom the latter lake to the Grand Rapid of the Saskatchewan the country has not a very inviting appearance. In many places the bare limestone rock appears on the surface; in others, a thin coating of vegetable mould over it scarcely supports a stunted growth of cypress, spruce, and aspen. Some of the islands, however, and there are many of them, appear to be fertile, especially at a little rapid just above Cross Lake; there the wood is of a large growth, and although it was so early in the season, the 30th May, when we passed, that ice was still visible on the shores of Lac Bourbon, the foliage at these islands was almost fully developed.\n\nThe Grand Rapid is about three miles in length, varying in width from 1,800 feet at the head to about three-quarters of a mile at the lower end. On the south side a perpendicular cliff of limestone rock rises abruptly from the water's edge, and extends along the whole rapid. On the north side the banks rise precipitously, but present a face of rock only in certain places. For the first mile or so the water, confined in a channel so narrow for a river of such volume, rushes down with great impetuosity. The current then gradually moderates, and two miles further on, the Saskatchewan is lost in Lake Winnipeg. The total descent at the Grand Rapid may be safely estimated at upwards of sixty feet. Canoes and batteaux can easily be run down, and even be towed up a part of the way; but of course in its present state this rapid, with such a descent, must be regarded as forming an absolute break in the navigation, that is, to vessels of a considerable size.\n\nBetween the Grand Rapid and Lac Bourbon there are two little rapids, which present obstructions of a less serious nature, but which could not yet be navigated in their present state by vessels of large size. From Lac Bourbon upwards the navigation of the Saskatchewan is unimpeded for a long distance.\n\nOn the 4th of June, having examined the Grand Rapid, and ascertained the difference of level between Winnepegos Lake and Lac Bourbon, I divided the party, as already explained, and crossed over to Swan River.\n\nThe country bordering on the western extremity of Winnepegos Lake is in general of a fair elevation, and the land appears to be remarkably fertile. Between Red Deer River and Swan River a level country extends to the base of the Porcupine Hills; it is well wooded, and upon the whole I should think this tract well adapted for settlement. Mineral springs occur in various places near the mouth of Swan River; one of these we visited, and found some people engaged in the manufacture of salt. At this place, in a bare flat of about twenty acres in extent, but slightly elevated above the level of the lake, numerous springs bubble up, all of them emitting more or less gas. Some are exceedingly briny, while others taste exactly like the St. Leon water of Lower Canada, and on being drunk, produce the same effect.\nFrom Winnepegoo Lake to Swan Lake the distance is about six miles, the stream which connects them here, appropriately enough called Shoal River, varies in width from 150 to 300 feet. It is shallow, and has a very swift course.\n\nAbout Swan Lake the country is highly interesting. Numerous islands appear in the lake. To the north an apparently level and well wooded country extends to the base of the Porcupine range, while to the south the blue outline of the Duck Mountain is seen on the verge of the horizon.\n\nAscending from Swan Lake, for ten miles or so the banks of Swan River are rather low; in the succeeding ten miles they gradually become higher, until they attain a height of nearly 100 feet above the river. The current is here remarkably swift, and the channel much embarrassed by round boulders of granite mixed with fragments of limestone, which latter is the rock proper to the country, although it does not crop out, so far as we could see, in any part of Swan River. Landslips occur in many places where the banks are high, exposing an alluvial soil of great depth, resting on drift clay or shale of a slightly bituminous appearance.\n\nAbout thirty miles above Swan Lake the prairie region fairly commences. Then the river winds about in a fine valley, the banks of which rise to the height of 80 or 100 feet. Beyond these an apparently unbroken level extends, on one side for a distance of fifteen or twenty miles, to the Porcupine Hills, and for an equal distance on the other to the high table land, called the Duck Mountain. From this, southwestward to Thunder Mountain, the country is the finest which I have ever seen in a state of nature. The prospect is bounded by the blue outline of the hills just named, while in the plain alternate wood and prairie present an appearance more pleasing than if either entirely prevailed. On the 10th of June, the time at which we passed, the trees were in full foliage, and the prairie openings presented a vast expanse of green sward. On approaching Thunder Mountain, which seems to be a connecting link between the Porcupine range and the Duck Mountain, the country becomes more uneven. Some of the ridges on the shoulder of the Thunder Mountain were sand, but there are wide valleys between them.\n\nOn leaving Swan River to cross to Fort Pelly, the land rises rapidly to a plateau elevated about 250 feet above the level of Swan River. The road then follows for some distance a tributary of Swan River, which runs in a beautiful valley, with alternate slopes of woodland and prairie. Numbers of horses were quietly feeding on the rich pasture of this valley when we passed, and what with the clumps of trees on the slopes, and the stream winding among green meadows, it seemed as if it wanted but the presence of human habitations to give it the appearance of a highly cultivated country. The Hudson's Bay Company keep a guard here to take care of the numerous horses attached to their establishment of Fort Pelly.\n\nArrived at Fort Pelly, we spent the greater part of the day, the 16th of June, there to refit our canoe, and prepare for the journey down the Assinniboine, and here I should mention that we were much indebted to Mr. M'Donald, the gentleman in charge of the establishment, who kindly furnished us with horses and carts to convey our canoes and articles across from Swan River to the Assinniboine, and was otherwise most attentive and obliging.\n\nLeaving Fort Pelly early in the morning of the 17th of June, we proceeded on our journey. For eighteen miles or so downward from Fort Pelly, the Assinniboine is very narrow, crooked, and much embarrassed by shoals and rapids. It is then joined by a stream appropriately named the White Mud River, which flows from the westward, and seems to be the main branch. This river drains a considerable portion of the great alluvial prairies which travellers pass on their way to Carlton House, and which have excited such general admiration on account of their great fertility.\n\nFrom the White Mud River to Fort Ellice, a distance of about 100 miles, the Assinniboine winds about in a deep valley varying from a mile to two miles, or so, in width. At the White Mud River the banks of this valley rise only to a moderate elevation. Near Fort Ellice they attain a height of nearly 250 feet. On ascending these heights a view is obtained of a rolling prairie, stretching away on either side of the Assinniboine as far as the eye can reach. It would seem as if the whole of this vast region were a sort of level plateau, and that the greater height of the banks at Fort Ellice indicated the descent which the Assinniboine had made in its course.\n\nWith regard to the quality of the soil, on going inland a little, we found it to be of an alluvial character, differing in no respect from the soil in the prairie lands at Red River.\n\nThe smallest brook that flows from the prairie has cut itself a valley almost as deep as that of the Assinniboine itself, and from the latter stream a fine view is often obtained of glens stretching far inland, with sloping banks covered in some cases with green herbage, and in others with forests which ascend to the level of the plain above.\n\nThe course of the Assinniboine is remarkably crooked. Occasionally it crosses the valley as much as three times in the course of a mile. The margin of the stream is in general wooded. Sometimes the woods extend across the whole valley, in other cases the green banks slope down from the prairie level to the water's edge.\n\nWhen the river runs close by some steep promontory, it occasionally happens that the whole hill has slumped down disclosing a yellow loam or drift clay resting on crumbling slate or shale, which again is curiously interspersed with other substances as soft as itself, some of which show the presence of iron ore. The immediate banks of the river are of soft alluvial earth and are constantly tumbling in. As might be supposed the water is muddy, and yet it is not unpleasant to the taste.\n\nBesides the White Mud River two considerable tributaries join the Assinniboine from the west above Fort Ellice. These are the Broden Arm and the Quiapelle Rivers. The latter stream draws a great extent of alluvial prairie land, and, at the Touchwood Hills, near its sources, it is said that coal is to be found in abundance.\n\nFrom Fort Ellice to the Rapid River the country is much of the same character that I have described it as being of, above that place, but on passing the Rapid River a change is perceptible. The high banks of the valley disappear, and the prairie slopes more gently to the river. A little above the Souris River, a still greater change occurs. The alluvial banks give place to sand hills which run in ridges from north-west to south-east. Through these the river cuts its way in an extremely tortuous course, sometimes running south-east in a direction parallel to the ridges, then cutting across a ridge,\nand suddenly turning in an opposite course. These ridges, where the river has cut through them, expose sand resting on stiff blue clay, with numerous springs issuing from between the sand and clay. In several places the limestone rock is seen beneath the clay in horizontal strata full of organic remains with sandstone resting on the top of it.\n\nThis comparatively barren tract may be about forty or fifty miles in width. It is evidently a continuation of the high lands at the Duck Mountain, and here forms the south-western embankment of the great alluvial valley of Red River. But even this tract, which is the poorest to be met with in the country, is not all barren, for those who have travelled inland say that the valleys between the Sand Hills are fertile, and that the whole tract would at least afford excellent pasturage.\n\nLeaving the Sand Hills, the Assiniboine flows by the Grand Portage, where the Venerable Archdeacon Corcoran has formed a settlement of half-breeds and Indians. The soil here is of the same character as at Red River, and superior to it, in so far that it is never subject to be overflowed.\n\nBut with regard to this part of the country it has been so often described, and it is so near the well known settlements at Red River, that I need not detain you by alluding further to it. I shall therefore only refer to the tracts which appear to me to be most valuable for settlement in the region I have visited, and then describe the manner in which I conceive they would be most easily rendered accessible.\n\nBy far the greater portion of the lands bordering on the Manitouba and Winnepogos Lakes is unquestionably well adapted for settlement. Experience already shows that wheat yields an abundant return on Manitouba and at the Little Saskatchewan. At the latter place even Indian corn is said to be a sure crop. This being the case, it is reasonable to conclude that wheat would thrive also at Sanguissippi Lake, and Lac Dauphin, and along the western coast at Winnepogos Lake. The valley of Swan River in point of fertility of soil is perhaps unsurpassed in any country, and as regards climate, it cannot, I think, be inferior to the valley of Red River, inasmuch as, if further north, it is also much further west, and removed from the influence of the cold winds of Lake Winnepog, which sometimes have a prejudicial effect on the crops at Red River.\n\nThe country bordering on Red Deer River is said to be very fertile, and the fact that maple is to be found there in considerable quantities would confirm the belief that the climate cannot be very unfavourable.\n\nThroughout this region wood is in sufficient abundance to ensure a supply of fuel for a long time to come, or until such time as the coal mines may be developed.\n\nIt is said that coal is to be found in various places on the Porcupine Hills and on the Duck Mountain. I found some specimens of lignite in going up Swan River, which fully confirms the fact, but whether it is to be found in available quantities can only be ascertained through time.\n\nThe great alluvial valley drained by the Assiniboine, and its tributaries above the Souris River, will no doubt become at some period one of the finest wheat growing countries in the world. No one, in this part of the country at least, even pretends that in point of soil or climate it is unfavourable to the growth of agricultural produce.\n\nIn regard to the means of communication that could be most easily made available, the country bordering on the lakes so often mentioned might be reached by steamers or other craft. There is nothing to prevent a steamer of light draught running from Red River Settlement to the upper end of Winnepogos Lake. On reference to Mr. Wells' report it will be seen that the Little Saskatchewan River is navigable from Lake Winnepog to Manitouba Lake. The latter lake is not deep, but there are not many shoals to be met with, and its bottom is in general as level as the surrounding country; I sounded wherever we went and found an uniform depth of from fifteen to eighteen feet after passing a few hundred feet from the shore. The Winnepogos Lake is on a higher level by about five feet than the Manitouba, and the sounding line showed that it was just by so much deeper, except at the upper end, where it attains a depth of from thirty-six to fifty feet. The Sanguissippi River, which connects the Winnepogos with the Manitouba Lake, has a general depth of from six to eight feet, except at one place near the middle of its course, where there is a very swift run, with a depth scarce amounting to five feet.\n\nThe distance from Winnepogos Lake to Lac Bourbon, by the Mossy Portage, is four miles and eighteen chains, and the difference of level four feet, the Winnepogos being that much higher than Lac Bourbon. The Saskatchewan was, however, very low at the time of our visit, and it is probable that when it is at its usual height the difference of level between the two lakes is but very slight.\n\nFrom Lac Bourbon upwards, for 400 miles, the Saskatchewan presents an unbroken reach of navigable water. Above that, accounts differ as to whether it is navigable or not, some asserting that it is too much embarrassed by rapids and shoals, and others that it might be navigated by boats of light draught and great power to the base of the Rocky Mountains. From what I have learned, I incline to the latter opinion, but the truth can only be ascertained by examination. At all events, from the Red River Settlement to Carlton House, following Lake Winnepog, the little Saskatchewan, Lakes Winnepogos and Mantouba, Lac Bourbon, and the Great Saskatchewan River, there is a navigable reach of 800 miles, broken only by the Mossy Portage. This one carrying place cannot be reckoned a great impediment in such a distance. Steamers might be placed on the waters on either side, and a land road made across it; and this, I conceive, would be all that could be desired until settlement should have advanced so far as to render a more perfect means of communication necessary.\n\nFrom what I have said, it will be seen that the lakes and the country bordering on the Great Saskatchewan are easy of access.\n\nIn regard to the facilities for communication in the valley of the Assiniboine, wheeled carriages can already be driven over the whole territory by the lines of route indicated on the plan, and it is only by such conveyances that settlers will, in the first instance, be able to supply their wants. The Assiniboine is only navigable for considerable vessels as far as the Grand Portage. Above that, indeed, canoes can be towed up, and bateaux can descend, except at extreme low water; but it has a very tortuous and rapid course, more especially among the Sand Hills, and it is in many places shallow, so that it could only be made navigable for vessels of any size at a great outlay. Everything considered, therefore, I am of opinion that transport could be more easily effected by land. The country is admirably adapted for railroads, but, of course, in an unsettled region these are out of the question.\nOn reference to the map it will be seen that Lac Dauphin, and part of Winnipegoos Lake approach within seventy or seventy-five miles of the Assinniboine. These places being accessible to steamers, land roads might be made across the country, which would afford all the accommodation required by a settlement in its first stage. Indeed, so obvious is this way of reaching the Assinniboine, that the Hudson's Bay Company supply their establishment at Fort Pelly by way of the lakes and Swan River, carting their goods from the latter place across the country to the Assinniboine.\n\nIn speaking of the navigable lines that might be made available, I should mention that at the Grand Portage there is said to be an old watercourse by which the Assinniboine, in all probability, has at some period discharged its waters into the Manitouba Lake. Now, as the Assinniboine is navigable, or in a state that it might easily be made so, as far as the Grand Portage, it may yet be found advantageous to open a water communication between it and the Manitouba Lake. The advantages which this route would possess over those by Lake Winnipeg and the Little Saskatchewan are that it would be considerably shorter, and would be open somewhat earlier in the spring.\n\nIn considering the project of colonising a country so remote to this, and of which so little is as yet generally known, the question will naturally arise as to whether the native population would be likely to offer any opposition to settlement, or whether the country, if occupied, would be easily governed. Believing that any information which will enable the Government to judge of these important matters will be acceptable, I shall, before concluding, describe the present state of the country through which we passed, confining myself to what has come under my own observation.\n\nAt Manitouba, Lac Dauphin, and Partridge Cross there are small settlements of Indians and people of mixed origin. At the first and last named settlements the people are pretty industrious, and raise wheat, Indian corn, and a variety of articles. At Lac Dauphin the settlers simply grow potatoes and Indian corn. They are gradually acquiring habits of industry, but they can live so easily by fishing or hunting, as Mr. Wells says in his report, that they are slow to adopt the more laborious pursuits of civilized life. Ducks, geese, and aquatic fowl of all sorts frequent the waters in that quarter in great numbers, and the lakes and rivers literally swarm with fish.\n\nNear the Grand Rapid of the Saskatchewan we saw about fifteen families of Indians from Swan River, who migrate there annually to catch sturgeon. They seemed to me to be a very quiet and orderly people, and I thought that I could detect on their countenances that they were not wholly of Indian origin. On inquiring as to this point, some of them were proud to boast of their descent from the Canadian fur traders, who had occupied this country many years ago. At the upper end of Winnipegoos Lake we only saw one family, engaged in making salt, and from thence, in a journey of 500 miles, by the valleys of Swan River and the Assinniboine, we saw not a living being, except the few people in charge of Hudson's Bay Company's establishment of Fort Pelly and Fort Ellice, until we got to the settlements in this neighbourhood. At Fort Ellice we were told that the hunters had gone further west. But from all we could see or learn, there was no avoiding the conclusion that the population which once wandered over the vast plains of the Assinniboine had decreased to an unexampled extent. This I attribute partly to the indiscriminate slaughter of the buffalo to supply the pemican required for the trade of the country, and partly to the introduction of horses, which has rendered these clumsy animals, the buffalo, an easy prey to the hunter; and the Indians, so that he can supply his immediate wants, in a profusion however boundless, never troubles himself about the future. Numerous, therefore, as the buffalo still are, there can be but little doubt that they will soon be destroyed. Large supplies of pemican used to be obtained at Fort Pelly and Fort Ellice; these establishments can furnish but little now. At many places we observed the plains furrowed with old tracks of the buffalo, and in some cases the banks of the Assinniboine were strewn with their bones; but there were none of these animals, we were informed, to be seen within several days' journey of any place we were at. This shows how fast they are being destroyed, and it leaves but the reflection that as their staple article of food diminishes, the Indians must decrease in numbers, unless they can be induced to adopt the habits of civilized life. That with proper management they may be so is fully shown by the success which has attended the labours of the zealous missionaries at the Grand Portage, Red River, Partridge Cross, and elsewhere. As to the people of the Red River Settlement, they are as orderly and quiet a community, I may safely say, as can be met with anywhere, and I believe there is nothing they desire more than to see the country opened up. In leaving this part of the country I have much pleasure in saying that, both from the people of this settlement and the officers of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, we have met with every kindness and civility. It is almost invidious to mention names, and yet I cannot omit those of Chief Factor M'Cavish, at Fort Garry, who furnished us with many articles which we could not have otherwise obtained, and of Chief Trader Murray, at Pembina, who always had his hospitable quarters open for any of the party that passed his way.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) S. J. DAWSON.\n\nThe Hon. Provincial Secretary,\nToronto.\n\nP.S. Both Mr. Wells and I made a cursory survey, taking the courses, and correcting the distances by numerous observations as we proceeded, and I have left a letter for Professor Hind, informing him of our operations.\n\nS. J. DAWSON.\n\nSub-Enclosure in Enclosure 1.\n\nSir,\n\nAfter leaving the Mossy Portage, on the morning of the 4th June, I proceeded agreeably to your instructions to make a cursory survey of the west shore of Lake Winnipegos, the River Dauphin and the lake of that name, the Little Saskatchewan, and the southern part of Lake Winnipeg, and would beg leave to submit the following report of my operations.\n\nThe western shore of Lake Winnipegos, in common with the other lakes through which I passed, is much better adapted for settlement than the eastern one, inasmuch as the land is higher and the climate, if anything, a little better. In crossing Lake Winnipegos from east to west, a distance of only about\ntwelve miles, I found vegetation somewhat further advanced than on the side I had just left; the soil is also better, inasmuch as that it is higher. Timber, such as maple, elm, oak, and poplar, covers the country to the water's edge. I visited several places where sugar had been made, and saw specimens of that article equal to any that I have ever seen in Eastern Canada.\n\nThe Duck Mountain, which occupies almost the entire background, commences to rise not far from the lake shore, keeping a gentle ascent for fifteen or twenty miles back, where it attains its greatest elevation, a height of 300 or 400 feet above the lake. I learned from the people who reside in Duck Bay that the entire face of the mountain is a succession of gentle slopes and flat table lands, and that the summit itself is an extensive plateau of alluvial soil, covered with a fine growth of timber.\n\nThere are three salt springs near the southern end of Lake Winnipegoos, one of which I visited, where there are works established for the manufacture of salt.\n\nThere are some forty or fifty half-breed Indians, who reside here, and at the Duck Bay, and though assured by them that all kinds of grain succeeded well here, yet they cultivated only a few potatoes, as fish and game are so plentiful and of such good quality, that they may be said to live almost without exertion.\n\nFrom the Salt Springs I passed through the Dauphin River, almost sixteen miles, to Dauphin Lake. The Dauphin River is a fine stream, about forty yards broad, and having five feet of water in the shallowest places. Its banks are a strong grey clay, covered with black mould, and timbered with oak, elm, and poplar. It has two considerable tributaries rising in the Duck and Riding Mountains, which appear to drain a country well adapted for settlement. There are several places on the Dauphin River where the Indians grow potatoes, Indian corn, and melons. The wild grape, wild hop, and wild vetch are also common on the banks of the river.\n\nLac Dauphin is about thirty miles long from north-west to south-east, and six miles broad, its western shore is bounded by the Riding Mountain, similar in all respects to the Duck Mountain already mentioned. Its southern shore is bounded by a prairie interspersed with wooded knolls, which I was informed extended without interruption south-east to the Assiniboine and Red Rivers.\n\nI saw fixed rock only in two places in this part of the country, viz., at Snake Island, near the lower end of Lake Winnipegoos, and at the lower part of the Dauphin River. That on the Snake Island, a whiteish limestone, is full of organic remains, the other is similar to the Manitoba limestone, and nearly without organic remains.\n\nFrom Lac Dauphin I returned through the north-east end of Lake Manitoba, to its discharge, the Little Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe Little Saskatchewan, as its name implies, has a very strong current, which I found, on measuring to be two and a half and three miles per hour, but it is entirely free from rapids, its average breadth is 250 yards with from eight to twelve feet of water, it appears well adapted for steamboat navigation.\n\nThe country in the vicinity of the Little Saskatchewan present every inducement for settlement, as is proved by the flourishing state of the present settlement at Fairford, or, as it is more generally known, by the name of Partridge Cross, a mission established under the Bishop of Rupert's Land, about six years ago, by the Rev. Mr. Cowley.\n\nThe present establishment is some six miles higher up the river than the first one, which, being subject to inundations in times of high water, was abandoned. There are several well-built houses, a chapel, school, and mill at this place, with a population of about 250 souls, Indians and half-breeds.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Stag, the missionary now in charge, informed me that the school which is attached to the mission was usually attended by from fifty to sixty children, the half of whom are Indian children. Indeed the Indians belonging to this place appear to be fast acquiring the tastes and habits of civilization, being clean and better dressed than any I have seen in the country. Mr. Stagg also informed me that, notwithstanding the ease with which the ground was cultivated and the large returns of grain, that he required to use all his influence to induce the Indians to cultivate the land, as their wants are so easily supplied by fishing and hunting.\n\nFrom the Little Saskatchewan I returned through Lake Winnipeg, arriving at this place on the 26th of June.\n\nThe journey through Lake Winnipeg presented no feature of essential difference from the other lakes, except that the western shore of Lake Winnipeg is low land, with occasional limestone cliff, and the eastern shore high land with granite rock.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) A. W. Wells.\n\nEnclosure 2 in No. 1.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Ellice, Rupert's Land, July 9, 1858.\n\nIn the letter I had the honour to address to you from the Red River on the 3rd June last I stated that, after making the necessary preparation, I should immediately commence the exploration of the valley of the Assiniboine River. The distrust, and even dread, with which the Sioux Indians are regarded by the Red River hunters, made it necessary to secure the services of a strong party for the exploration of the Little Sonris River, where the tertiary coal was reported to exist in abundance. In consequence, however, of the failure of last year's autumn buffalo hunt, and the ravages of the grasshoppers at Prairie Portage and elsewhere in the settlements, most of the able-bodied men fitted for the exigencies of a journey into the Indian country had left the settlements a few days before my arrival, either for the Buffalo Plains or for St. Paul, and it was with some difficulty that I could procure eight men and the necessary provisions for a three month's journey, but by the 14th of June the expedition was en route for the interior.\n\nAfter arriving at St. James's Church, on the Assiniboine River, I proceeded with Mr. Dickinson to ascertain the position of the Big Ridge, bounding the Valley of the Assiniboine, and follow its windings for a distance of seventy or eighty miles, until it is cut by Portage River, near Lake Manitobah, opposite Prairie Portage. Mr. Fleming proceeded with the carts and canoes by the Hunter's Road to Prairie Portage, making on his way a section of the Assiniboine River, ascertaining by numerous trials its rate of current, volume of water, &c.\nThe Assiniboine Valley south of the Big Ridge, on the north side of the river, comprising an area exceeding half a million acres, was described in my report of last year as possessing a soil of remarkable excellence: the results of a more particular examination during the present season fully bear out the favourable opinion previously formed.\n\nAfter reaching Prairie Portage we proceeded on the north bank of the Assiniboine as far as the mouth of the Little Souris River. During this part of our journey we occasionally stopped for half a day to make the necessary astronomical observations, to measure the valley of the river, and make sections of its banks.\n\nThe impressions with which I returned to Toronto last year respecting the extent of forest on the banks of this river, confirmed as they appear to be by all descriptive accounts I received from residents at Red River, led me to suppose that the Assiniboine flowed for about eighty miles from its mouth through a vast level prairie, timbered only at the points or bends of its course. I was much astonished to find that this is true only as regards the north bank of the river, the south bank being occupied by an immense forest, which commences some thirty miles from Fort Garry, and covers the country westward for a distance exceeding seventy miles, with a depth varying from five to twenty-five miles. We frequently saw the vast forest from hills on the north side of the river covering a tract of country which could not be less than twelve or fifteen miles in breadth, and, with a good telescope, the prairie between it and an extension of Pembina Mountain or Ridge was traced. I have ascertained that the forest contains fine timber, and is well known to Indians, who hunt there during the winter; but the trails of the buffalo hunters avoid it, and keep to the open prairies; hence its existence is even unknown to many of the residents of Red River, and the buffalo hunters, always shunning it, have but little knowledge of its timber resources.\n\nIt is my intention, on returning to the settlements, to penetrate through this forest in two or three directions, with a view to ascertain its character, as far as time will allow.\n\nIt is needless to dwell upon the great importance of so abundant and unexpected a supply of serviceable timber within one or two days' journey of a very extensive and fertile arable country, and on the banks of a navigable river, within a day's march of Fort Garry.\n\nThe country on the north side of the Assiniboine, between Prairie Portage and the mouth of the Little Souris, for a distance of several miles back from the river, is poor and scantily timbered. The prairies on the Little Souris are also light, and the deep valley of that river contains but little timber. At Snake Creek numerous specimens of drift lignite were found, and after a few hours' exploration, favourable indications led me to have a section of the river's bank exposed, by making a cutting at right angles to it, with a view to show the stratification. Here no less than four distinct beaches of a former lake were brought to light, each beach bearing numerous rounded and polished boulders and pebbles of drift lignite, varying from two to fifteen inches in diameter; but no trace of the lignite or place was seen on the Little Souris north of the forty-ninth parallel. The beaches just referred to were several times noticed further up the river; they are accompanied by a bed of ferruginous sand, above which several extensive deposits of bog-iron ore and shell marl were found.\n\nHaving determined to return to the settlements via the Assiniboine in canoe, I forbear for the present from referring to the geology of its rock exposures, further than to state that what I have already seen leads me to think it will repay an attentive and careful exploration.\n\nHaving reached the forty-ninth parallel, the expedition proceeded up the banks of Red Deer's Head River for about fifteen miles, and then crossed over a treeless prairie, sixty miles broad, towards Fort Ellice. The hill sides in the valley of the Little Souris River were scored with tracks of buffalo, and everywhere we saw the bois de vache of last year, but it was not until arriving at the Two Creeks, in the Assiniboine Valley, that we killed a buffalo bull. The buffalo this year are far south, and the hunters have suffered much distress on that account. Yesterday we saw three bulls at a considerable distance from us; they are considered to be the pioneers of numerous herds, which are anxiously looked for by the people of the fort, who are almost altogether destitute of provisions.\n\nEverywhere we find grasshoppers. On the Assiniboine the brood of this spring is yet unable to fly, but when traversing the treeless prairie, between Red Deer's Head River and the Assiniboine, innumerable hosts of grasshoppers were flying northward in the direction of the wind. At times they would cast a shadow over the prairie, and for several hours one day the sky, from the horizon to an altitude of thirty degrees, acquired an indescribably brilliant ash white tint, and seemed faintly luminous, as the semi-transparent wings of countless millions of grasshoppers, drifting towards the north and north-east, reflected the light of the sun.\n\nOn Monday, July 12, I propose to start for the Saskatchewan, by the Quapelle River, returning to the settlements by the end of August.\n\nMr. Dawson passed Fort Ellice on the 21st of June, and will arrive at Red River by the beginning of July.\n\nThe weather on the whole has been very favourable, but in the early part of our journey thunderstorms for many days in succession caused three or four hours' delay during their continuance. We have had seventeen thunder-storms in twenty-three days; nearly all were of a violent character, with hail, heavy rain, and boisterous winds. We did not see any Indians before our arrival at Fort Ellice. On the Red Deer's Head River an attempt was made in the night to stampede the horses, which was fortunately frustrated by the distant neighing of a horse reaching our ears, and giving us time to take precautionary measures; but the tracks of hostile Indians close to our camp were found in the morning.\n\nThis letter is written in the expectation that some hunters may soon be returning, via Fort Ellice, to Red River for supplies, who will be instructed by Mr. McKay, the gentleman in charge of Fort Ellice, to place it in the post office at Fort Garry.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY G. HIND,\nIn charge of the \"Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition.\"\n\nThe Hon. F. J. J. Loranger,\nProvincial Secretary, &c., &c., &c.\nEnclosure 3 in No. 1.\n\nSir,\n\nAfter my arrival at Red River, I made numerous inquiries respecting a report, extensively circulated, that gold dust and scales were in the possession of some of the settlers, and that gold had been found in the neighbourhood of Sturgeon Creek.\n\nI visited Sturgeon Creek in company with a person who had sent the so-called \u201cgold\u201d to England and the United States for analysis. Certain persons some years since residing in Red River Settlement, who ought from their position and education to have been quite familiar with the characteristics of gold, had informed my companion that there was no doubt whatever of his specimens being the precious metal. From the United States he received no answer; from England, through the company\u2019s agent, he was informed that it was oxide of iron (probably iron pyrites).\n\nAfter a careful search in the stream, I found golden mica, and handing it to him, he believed it to be gold, until I informed him of its true character.\n\nI found abundance of golden mica, and have no doubt that this mineral is the \u201cgold\u201d of the settlers at Red River.\n\nRings rudely made from gold were shown to me as well as scales of gold; but after much inquiry, I succeeded in tracing the gold to two or three voyageurs, who had been across the Rocky Mountains, and had brought it from the Columbia River and Fraser\u2019s River.\n\nSir George Simpson told me, when I saw him at Fort Garry, that Capt. Palliser had stated that in seasons of high water or by the removal of a trifling obstruction, or by making a small portage a small canoe might pass from the Assiniboine, through the Quapelle River (Calling River) and Lakes, to the Saskatchewan, thus connecting the Red River with the Great Saskatchewan by a short direct course. Some of the hunters, who profess to know that part of the country, state that in seasons of high water, the Saskatchewan may send part of its waters through this river to the Assiniboine. Yesterday I visited the Quapelle River, and Mr. Dickenson to-day is to measure its rate of current, volume of water, &c.\n\nSince the river lies in the direction of the south branch of the Saskatchewan, I have determined to ascertain its true character, and intend sending Mr. Dickenson from the height of land in a canoe to the Assiniboine while I proceed by the western water communication, if any, to the Saskatchewan.\n\nCaptain Palliser, I am informed, had no canoe with him, and I find in this country that it is as impossible to describe a river and its capabilities from observations made at intervals on its banks, as it is to form a correct idea of the region it unwaters from a canoe voyage down its course.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nThe Hon. T. J. J. Loranger, M.P.P., Provincial Secretary.\n\n(Signed) HENRY G. HIND.\n\nEnclosure 4 in No. 1.\n\nReport on the Exploration of the Country between Lake Superior and the Red River Settlement.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acquaint you that, confiding in your integrity, judgement, and energy, together with your acquaintance with the Red River Territory, your knowledge of the communication with that country, and with the tribes of Indians which traverse it, His Excellency the Administrator of the Government has been pleased to appoint you to the chief direction and control of the party about to be sent there.\n\nThe party organized consists of the following:\u2014\n\nMr. Gladman, the chief director and controller of the expedition, and his assistant;\nProfessor Hind, geologist and naturalist, and his assistant;\nMr. Napier, engineer, with his assistant and staffmen; and\nMr. Dawson, surveyor, with his assistants and chainmen.\n\nAlso, such voyageurs or canoeemen as in your judgment may be necessary, the probable number of canoes being assumed at four, with four voyageurs in each; such men to be selected with a view to their being capable of assisting the engineering and surveying branches of the expedition as axemen, &c., when required.\n\nThe primary object of the expedition is to make a thorough examination of the tract of country between Lake Superior and Red River, by which may be determined the best route for opening a facile communication, through British territory, from that lake to the Red River Settlements, and ultimately to the great tracts of cultivable land beyond them. With this view, the following suggestions are offered for your guidance, so far as you will find them practicable and supported by the topography.\n\nIn the first place, after being landed at Fort William, to proceed by the present Hudson\u2019s Bay canal route, by the Kaministiquia River, Dog Lake, Lake of the Thousand Islands, &c., to Lac la Croix, and thence, by Rainy Lake, Lake of the Woods, Wimppeg River, to Lake Winipeg, and up the Red River to Fort Garry.\n\nFrom Rainy Lake to Lake Winipeg, the route as at present affords a good navigation for boats of considerable size, with the interruption, however, of some short portages; but from Rainy Lake eastward to Lake Superior the route is very much interrupted, and rendered laborious, tedious, and expensive, by the great number of portages, some of considerable length, which have to be encountered, to avoid the falls and rapids in the ravines and creeks which this route follows.\nFor the establishment of a suitable communication for the important objects aimed at, it is believed that the construction of a road throughout from some point on Lake Superior, probably either at Fort William, or at or near the mouth of the Pigeon River to Rainy Lake, must be undertaken. To ascertain, therefore, at present, by general exploration, what the route for this road should be, whether in the vicinity of the Hudson's Bay route, or by the line of country in which lies the chain of waters from Rainy Lake to the mouth of Pigeon River, this question can obviously be only satisfactorily determined by the difficult portions of both being tested instrumentally; but in either case, as the construction of such road would be a matter of time and much expense, it is considered necessary that the portages, &c. of either of the routes above described should be improved, so as to be made more available and facile, and to be auxiliary to the works of the road, by facilitating the transport of men, supplies, &c.\n\nTo determine, therefore, the portages to be improved, and the best mode of doing so, and whether the present reaches of canoe or boat navigation may not be further extended, by the removal of shoals or the erection of dams, will be points to which you will direct the attention of the engineering and surveying branches of your party.\n\nFrom Rainy Lake, by Lake of the Woods and Lake Winnipeg, to Fort Garry, as before described, is now comparatively a good water communication, but very circuitous; and should the character of Rat River, which rises at no great distance from the Lake of the Woods, and falls into the Red River above Fort Garry, be found susceptible of its being made a boat channel, a saving probably of 150 miles in length might be effected; or on an exploration of the country through which that river flows, it may be found more desirable to construct a road along it from Red River, and should this be so, the nature of the communication between Red River and Lake Superior eventually would be about 100 miles of road from Red River to Lake of the Woods, thence about 140 miles of water communication to the eastern end of Rainy Lake, and from that point a continuous road to Lake Superior of from 160 to 200 miles in length.\n\nWhen you shall have reached Rainy Lake by the Hudson's Bay canoe or northern route, it is left to your discretion whether you should or not leave the engineering party with sufficient force to return and explore back to Lake Superior the southern or Pigeon River route, while you proceed with the surveying party by Lake Winnipeg to Red River, and return by Rat River.\n\nAll the members of the party, with the exception of the geologist and his assistant, are, it is understood, to winter on the expedition, if required. The expediency of adopting that course can only be determined by you some time hence; but should you decide upon so doing, you will of course take due precautions for the safety and comfort of the party, and for their effective and profitable employment.\n\nAs director and leader of the party, you will govern all matters whatsoever connected with the conducting and provisioning of it, the hiring, discharging, and payment of men. The lines to be explored, and the water examinations to be made will be determined by you, on consultation with the gentlemen conducting the engineering and surveying branches. You will also decide the times and places for separating the party or parties, and for their re-union, the engineer and surveyor have been instructed to afford you all the assistance in their power, and have been informed that they are to consider themselves under your guidance and direction. Any occasional additional assistance they may require will be obtained through you, as well as all necessaries whatever; but the conducting of their immediate professional duties will, of course, be regulated by themselves.\n\nAt the very outset, it is important that you should regulate the number of fire-arms that you may consider it necessary to take, which it is believed should not exceed six, one with the director, one with the geologist, two with the engineer, and two with the surveyor. You will adopt, also, full precautions against any spirits, &c. of any description being carried, except what shall be under your own sole charge and control, and such as you may consider it necessary to have in case of illness.\n\nWith regard to the procuring of canoes, camp equipage, medicine, &c., &c., for the expedition, it is not considered necessary, from your experience in such matters, to offer any suggestions, further than to draw your attention to some Crimean rations of pressed vegetables, now in the commissariat store, which occupy but little space, and a small portion of which makes in a short time excellent soup.\n\nIn order further to give effect to your control and authority, a commission of magistracy will be conferred upon you.\n\nAbout the time of your reaching Rainy Lake, or at such period as you may deem proper, you will send a messenger with despatches, reporting upon your progress, &c., &c., and whether you find it necessary or desirable to winter in the territory, &c.\n\nFinally, you will impress upon each member of your party that no communication or information whatsoever, with regard to the progress or results of the expedition, are to be transmitted by writing or otherwise, except to the Honourable Provincial Secretary.\n\nThe ad interim reports of the geologist, engineer, and surveyor you will enclose with your own, and transmit by the messenger above adverted to.\n\nYou will also peremptorily require that the weight of all personal effects taken by each of the party, including that of the bag or leather valise containing them, shall not exceed ninety pounds.\n\n(Signed) E. Parent,\nAssistant Provincial Secretary.\n\nGeorge Gladman, Esq., Fort Hope, U. C.\n\nSin,\n\nCrown Lands Department, Toronto, July 14, 1857.\n\nThe Government having determined upon sending out an expedition under G. Gladman, Esq., to explore the country lying between the head of Lake Superior and the Red River Settlement, I am directed by the Honourable the Commissioner, to request that you will inform him whether you are prepared to take charge of one of the parties under that gentleman; if so, you will please to repair to Toronto, with as little delay as possible, there to await further instructions from this department.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nS. J. Dawson, Esq., Three Rivers, C. E.\n\n(Signed) E. A. Genereux.\nINSTRUCTIONS to S. J. Dawson, Esq., to assist in the Exploration of the Country between the Head of Lake Superior and the Red River Settlement.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Government having determined upon sending out an expedition under George Gladman, Esq., to explore the above-mentioned country, you have been selected to act as surveyor. You will therefore put yourself in communication with that gentleman, who, as chief of the expedition, will have the general direction thereof, but who will not interfere with the professional working of your party.\n\nAs the rate of progress of the expedition will be too rapid for an accurate instrumental survey of the whole of the route, you will make such a reconnaissance of those portions thereof which present no engineering difficulties, as the time and circumstances will permit, ascertaining the bearings by a prismatic compass, and estimating the distances on land by pacing, and on the lakes and rivers by the rate of progress of your canoe, or by a Rochon's micrometer, when you have leisure and opportunity of using it, but making an accurate survey where such difficulties occur.\n\nYou will note the kind and quality of the soil and its fitness for agriculture; the kinds of timber and their commercial value; the general nature of the face of the country, whether level, rolling, broken, hilly, or mountainous; the marshes, swamps, and meadows; the lakes, with a description of their banks, and whether their waters are deep or shallow, pure or stagnant; the courses, widths, and depths of the streams, with their rapids and falls, estimating the difference of level where an instrumental survey is not required; the kind and localities of the fixed rocks, of which you will collect small specimens (from one to two cubic inches), attaching a number to each, and wrapping it up in birch or cedar bark, or such other suitable materials as are to be had on the spot, noting the number and locality in your field book, and the dip and strike of the rock, if stratified.\n\nYou will keep a diary of your proceedings and a register of the thermometer and Aneroid barometer at regular hours of the morning and evening daily.\n\nAscertain the latitude and variation of the compass when you have opportunity.\n\nYour own pay will be \u00a31.10s. a day while employed in this service. Mr. Gladman will pay your party, and furnish provisions and other necessaries for the exploration.\n\nYou will draw a plan of your operations, on a scale of one mile to an inch, showing as much of the natural features of the country as may come under your observation.\n\nIn addition to your diary and field notes, you will furnish a report containing a concise summary of your proceedings, with general observations on the physical geography of the country, its capabilities, and the best mode of developing them.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) E. P. TACHE,\nCommissioner of Crown Lands.\n\nSir,\n\nCrown Lands Department, Toronto, July 22, 1857.\n\nI have been directed to transmit you, for the information and guidance of yourself and your staff on the expedition about to proceed to explore the route from Fort William to the Red River, an extract from the letter of instructions addressed by the Government to Mr. G. Gladman, the director of the party, relative to the general conduct of the party, and the control to be exercised by Mr. Gladman in reference thereto, and I have to direct you to be subject to those instructions which are authorized by Order in Council.\n\nA copy of the Order in Council of the 18th instant, authorizing the expedition, is also enclosed herewith.\n\nAlexander Wells has been appointed your chief assistant, Charles De Salabury your explorer, and G. F. Gaudet and Lindsay Russell your chain-bearers.\n\nMr. Wells is to be paid at the rate of 20l. a month, and your other assistants above mentioned at the rate of 7s. 6d. a day each.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) ANDREW RUSSELL,\nAssistant Commissioner of Crown Lands.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, July 22, 1857.\n\nI am directed to inform you that His Excellency the Administrator of the Government has been pleased to appoint you to conduct the engineering branch of the expedition about to be sent to the Red River Territory, under the control and direction of George Gladman, Esquire.\n\nThere are appointed on your staff an assistant, a rodman, and two chainmen. Your remuneration is fixed at \u00a31.10s. per day, that of your assistant 20l. per month, and that of each of the others on your staff at 7s. 6d. per day. All matters and details whatsoever connected with the provisioning and transport of the party, with the hiring and discharging of the men, and the conducting of the expedition, determining routes, stoppages, encampments, &c., &c., are under the direction of Mr. Gladman, who has received full instructions and authority therefor. Among these instructions he is specially directed to prevent spirits of any description from being taken up or procured by any of the party at any time. He is likewise to regulate the number of fire-arms that will be allowed, and to caution each member of the party, while attached to it, from communicating by writing, or otherwise, any information upon the progress or results of the expedition, except to the Provincial Secretary.\n\nHe will, some time hence, when he considers it expedient, send a messenger, who will carry his despatches to the Government, of the time of doing which he will give you due notice, in order that you may have an ad interim report prepared to be transmitted by such messenger, addressed to the Provincial Secretary, which report will detail minutely the operations of your branch of the party.\n\nThe nature of the duties connected with the engineering branch will, in the first instance be, to examine generally the present Hudson's Bay canoe route from Fort William (by which Mr. Gladman\nwill first lead the party) paying particular attention to the parts where obstructions present themselves, whether in the form of falls, or shallows, on the rivers, lakes, or creeks, or of long and difficult portages, so as to be enabled to furnish a tolerably correct sketch thereof, describing the nature and extent of the obstacles, and in what manner they could best be removed or overcome. For this purpose instrumental examinations, levels, and measurements will in some cases be indispensable, in other cases you will be enabled to arrive at a sufficiently correct approximating decision without them.\n\nAfter the Hudson's Bay canoe or northern route is so examined, Mr. Gladman will probably direct your attention to the southern route, between Rainy Lake and Lake Superior, by Pigeon River. This, also, will be similarly explored and examined, so as to enable you to report on the relative merits or demerits of each.\n\nThe ultimate intention of Government is the construction of a good commissariat road through British territory, suited to the great amount of trade that may reasonably be calculated on between Lake Superior and the Red River district, and the immense region of cultivable territory beyond it. It is considered probable that the most eligible route for communication may be found to be about the course of the present Hudson's Bay route between Fort William and Rainy Lake, on which account Mr. Gladman will, in due time, draw your attention to different lines to be explored in that direction, with the view of avoiding the present obstruction; and as the chief difficulties to be encountered in the communication to the Red River Settlements lie between Rainy Lake and Fort William, this section will necessarily require careful exploration.\n\nWhether your party will continue on from Rainy Lake to Fort Garry, or will return either by the southern or Pigeon River route, or proceed to explore north and south of the course by which you ascend, with the view of ascertaining whether a good line may not be found in that direction, will be governed by Mr. Gladman, with whom it will be your duty cordially to co-operate, and offer any suggestions in your line you may think will tend to the interest of the expedition.\n\nEach individual on the staff of the expedition, with the exception of the geologist and his assistant, is distinctly to understand that his services are to be at the command of Government for twelve months, and that he is to winter in the territory, if required.\n\nIn all cases of your party being separated from the general body, such separation is to be governed by Mr. Gladman, who will take care that you are provided with the means of transport, the necessary assistance, provisions, &c. &c. An abstract from the instructions furnished to Mr. Gladman is hereto appended for your instruction and guidance.\n\n(Signed) E. Parent,\nAssistant Provincial Secretary.\n\nW. H. Napier, Esq., C.E.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that His Excellency the Administrator of the Government has been pleased to nominate you, geologist and naturalist to the party which is to leave this city immediately for Fort William, for the purpose, in the first instance, of examining the line and state of the communication thence to Fort Garry on the Red River. It being indispensable to the satisfactory result of the expedition, as well as to the safety of the party, that one individual should be invested with the general control and management of it, Mr. Gladman has been invested with the authority and responsibility, for which he is considered eminently qualified, from his long residence in the territory, his acquaintance with the leading lines of communication, with the trading posts, with the tribes of Indians with whom the party will necessarily come in contact, and with the extent and nature of the supplies which can safely be calculated on as procurable in the country during the course of the expedition. By him, therefore, will be regulated and determined the movements of the party, the routes to be taken and explored, and all matters connected with the provisioning and transport of the party, the hiring and payment of all the men, and all other matters of detail whatever comprised in the general conduct of the expedition.\n\nFrom the nature of your duties it may be necessary that you should occasionally separate yourself from the party. In such cases you will state so to Mr. Gladman, who will take care that you are provided with the necessary provisions and means of transport, and with all such necessaries as you may require; and he will arrange with you as to the places and times for your re-uniting yourself with the main body.\n\nAs you will require the services of an assistant, the appointment of an efficient one is left with you, his remuneration not to exceed 20l. per month. That of the geologist, engineer, and surveyor is fixed at thirty shillings per day each.\n\nThe objects to which your attention is requested are of general character, comprising a description of the main geological features of the country you traverse, and whatever pertains to its natural history, which you may have an opportunity of observing and recording.\n\nIn relation to its geology, you will be guided by the memorandum furnished you by Sir William Logan, giving especial attention, as far as lies in your power, to the following points:\n\n1. The boundaries of formations.\n2. The distribution of limestones.\n3. The collection of fossils.\n4. The occurrence of economic minerals.\n5. The exact position of all faults, and the altitude of the rock.\n\nThe distribution of limestone should be made a constant subject of question with everyone you meet.\n\nWith reference to natural history, you will, if at the time convenient, and the object capable of transportation, collect whatever may appear to be new or of interest; and you are requested to record in a daily journal such facts in connexion with this subject as may present themselves to your notice, when not susceptible of representation by specimen or illustration.\nA general description of the whole of the country you traverse from Fort William westward is very desirable; and it is advisable to note, as minutely as possible, all leading features of topography, vegetation, and soil along your line of route.\n\nYou will proceed with the main party to Fort William, and continue with it or with such party as may be detached from it, as much as is consistent with the efficient prosecution of your own exploration and researches. It may, of course, be occasionally necessary, as already adverted to, that you should separate from the others for a short time, for which course Mr. Gladman will afford you all requisite accommodation; but as that gentleman's instructions require him to explore not only the present canoe route of the Hudson's Bay Company from Fort William, by Dog Lake, Lake of the Thousand Islands, Lac Croix, Lake of the Woods, and Lake Winnipeg, to Fort Garry, but also in returning to examine the former North West Company's route by Pigeon River, and further to examine or survey the line of Rat River from the Red River to its source, and the intervening country between it and the Lake of the Woods, it is not probable that there will be much necessity for your leaving the party for more than a few days at a time, which is desirable, from its limited number and the late season of the year.\n\nIt is arranged with Mr. Gladman, that he is to send a messenger, some time hence, with despatches to the Government, explanatory of the progress made towards carrying out the object of the expedition, and by this means you will also have an opportunity of making such ad interim report as you may consider desirable. You will determine the return route to be taken by you and your assistant, whether by Lake Superior or by St. Paul's, as you may be led to believe will most conduce to the attainment of the object of your branch of the expedition.\n\nWhen materials for illustrating the geology and natural history of the country accumulate, so as to render their transportation an inconvenience, you will hand them over in packages, properly made up and directed, to Mr. Gladman, who will take care that they are safely lodged at some of the posts, and arrangements made for their being securely conveyed to this city.\n\nYour reports and communications upon the various subjects to which your attention is directed will be addressed to the Hon. Provincial Secretary; and it is presumed to be unnecessary to impress upon you the propriety and expediency of taking care that the subject of such reports, and the results or your labour, shall be only so communicated.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nH. Y. Hind, Esq., Professor, &c.,\nTrinity College.\n\n(Signed) T. L. TERRILL,\nProvincial Secretary.\n\nREPORT.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Francis, Rainy Lake, August 19, 1857.\n\nI have the honour to report my arrival here yesterday evening. I came on in advance of the other canoes, for the purpose of obtaining guides for parties to proceed by way of \"Rat River,\" to \"Fort Garry,\" and by the \"River des Bois,\" from \"Rainy Lake,\" to \"Lake of the Woods.\" Before proceeding further, however, I beg to detail briefly our proceedings to this time.\n\nLeaving Collingwood on the 24th July, after calling at various places on Lake Huron, the steamer arrived at the Sault Ste. Marie on the 27th. On the 28th, during an extremely dense fog, the steamer ran on the rocks off Michipicoton Island in Lake Superior. She was got off again late the following afternoon, without sustaining any material damage, and put into the harbour to re-arrange coals, &c., which had been moved the previous day in order to float the steamer. Leaving the harbour on the next evening (30th) we arrived in safety at the mouth of the Kaministiquia, and landed at Fort William late on the 31st. My attention was immediately given to the arrangements of canoes, men, and provisions, and on Monday I was enabled to send off three canoes in advance, and followed with three more on the next day. Pursuing the route designated in my instructions as the Hudson's Bay route, I arrived as above remarked, yesterday, and expect the other canoes will be here in course of the day.\n\nThe greatest difficulty to be encountered in navigating this route, appears to me to be the shoalness of the waters immediately below the Mountain Fall. For about nine miles above Fort William there is sufficient depth of water to enable a steamer to ascend the stream, and the distance from thence in a direct line, according to the surveyor's estimates, not exceeding eighteen miles. I see no better means of improving that part of communication than by opening a road that should pass the three first and most difficult portages. Mr. Napier is of opinion that it would be impracticable to raise the water by damming the stream, the fall being too precipitate and the banks not sufficiently high or firm to admit of the construction of such works.\n\nFrom the Dog Portage to the Prairie Portage, a distance of thirty miles, it appears to me quite practicable to remove the greater part of the obstructions caused by the few intervening shoals of rocks, and thus admit of free navigation, even for boats; and I do not think the cost of the improvements would be great.\n\nFrom the east end of the Prairie Portage to the head of the Savanne Rivulet (the first stream of waters descending towards Hudson's Bay), embracing about five miles and a half of land carriage, by present route, it is probable that a minute survey would show that a road may be formed, which would pass at one stretch the three longest portages in the whole communication. Being obliged, however, by the necessity of economizing our voyaging provision, and passing rapidly onward, we could not make that particular examination of this portion of the route which we would have wished to do. Had we a stock of provisions on hand here at Rainy Lake to meet the requirements of so large a party, we should have been glad to spend two or three days in determining this interesting point, but under present circumstances, a more particular survey must be deferred to a future time.\n\nThere is yet another line of communication between the Kaministiquia and the Lake of Thousand Islands, on which I would offer a few remarks. A small river falls into the Kaministiquia from the westward, a few miles south of the Dog Portage. It is represented by the Indians who hunt in that\npart of the country as impracticable for a large canoe, but quite passable in a small one. There are numerous portages, and it appears to take its rise in the same line of swampy country over which we passed at the \"Savanne.\" If a guide can be procured, I shall endeavour, on the return voyage, to send a party to report upon it. The distance from the Lake of Thousand Islands to Fort William is travelled over in winter by that track in three or four days.\n\nFrom the Savanne River to the French Portage (which is the last long one on the route) the obstructions in the navigation are not of any great magnitude, and certainly do not present greater, if so great, difficulties as are met with on the route from York Factory to Red River. A small stream running to the southward of French Portage admits of passing without making that portage at all, except the water be very low; and this may be provided against by the erection of a barrier, for which there is abundant material. My own canoe passed that way, and the only impediment met with was from the overhanging branches and trees fallen across the stream, which being removed by my men enabled the other canoes to pass freely.\n\nFrom the French Portage to the Rainy Lake there are few portages, and those very short. Here again improvements may be made, which would increase the amount of open navigation, and facilitate greatly the transport of emigrants and goods.\n\nHaving thus given a brief outline of past proceedings, I will now state the course I propose to take from here.\n\nI have engaged a guide to proceed with a party from the north-west end of the Lake of the Woods to Red River. The route is represented as being perfectly feasible in a small canoe, the only portage being the swampy height interwoven between the waters that fall into the Winnipeg River. I am assured that this passage by Rat River will not occupy more than six or seven days, the party travelling with light equipment.\n\nThe results of this interesting exploration I hope to transmit from Red River. I have also engaged another guide to lead a party from Rainy Lake to the Lake of the Woods, by the Rivi\u00e8re du Bois, which party will join me on my way to Red River at the Rat Portage. This tract is, as I am informed, invariably used by the Indians, in coming from this port to the Lake of the Woods. It is much shorter, and they avoid the strong current of the Rainy River.\n\nI beg to refer to the accompanying brief reports by Messrs. Napier, Dawson, and Hind, for a statement, each in his particular department, of the rivers of the route over which we have passed; and I trust that the whole of our joint proceedings will meet with the approval of the Government.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nHon. T. L. Terrill, Provincial Secretary,\n\n(Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN.\n\n&c. &c. &c.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Francis, Lac la Pluie, August 20, 1857.\n\nI have the honour to report for the information of the Government, the safe arrival at this point yesterday of that portion of the Red River Expedition under my charge, in company with Professor Hind and Mr. Dawson.\n\nWe arrived at Fort William on the 31st ult., where we were detained three days, procuring men and preparing canoes. Whilst there we received the greatest kindness and assistance from Mr. James McIntyre, the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company's officer in charge of that fort, but for whose prompt aid we might have been considerably retarded, as, from the near approach of the fishing season, men expressed a decided unwillingness to accompany us, and even those who finally consented to hire could not be induced to continue with us beyond the Rainy Lake.\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Gladman, that those men return to Fort William in the morning; in accordance, therefore, with my instructions I beg to forward the ad interim report upon the nature of my operations hitherto and plans for the future. Owing to the very limited time for preparation, it must be but a very brief sketch.\n\nMr. Dawson and Professor Hind, with their respective parties, left Fort William on the 3rd inst., and Mr. Gladman and I on the following day. On the 5th we all again met at the head of the Mountain Portage (Kallabeka Falls), since which time we have continued together, with the exception of Mr. Gladman, who parted from us on the 8th inst., at the Dog Lake Portage, considering it expedient to hasten with all speed to Fort Francis in order to make further arrangements as to men and equipage, to prevent any delay upon our arrival.\n\nIn conjunction with Mr. Dawson levels have been taken throughout from Fort William on Lake Superior to this place, together with measurements and observations, which, when completed to the Red River Settlement, will afford sufficient data to form plans and sections of the entire route; these, together with a detailed report, I hope to be able to forward to you as soon as possible after my arrival at the settlement.\n\nUp to this time we have been favoured with a continuance of fine weather, which we have taken every advantage of, invariably starting soon after daybreak, and not camping until a late hour in the evening; the advanced period of the season rendering it expedient to hasten on with the least possible delay.\n\nIn approaching the height of land dividing the water-shed of Lake Superior from that of Hudson's Bay, we experienced a gradual increase in the coldness of the nights; on the night of the 15th inst. the thermometer fell as low as 33\u00b0 Fahr.; as we descended this way the temperature has sensibly increased.\n\nFrom Fort William to this point, owing to various causes, the parties have all travelled by the same route; but as from this place westward there are three distinct routes, which should undoubtedly be examined without delay, in order to ascertain their respective merits, and which would be most deserving of more critical examination at a future period, it has been decided to divide into three parties.\n\nProfessor Hind and Mr. Dawson, in two small canoes, proceeded by the Roseau River, from the Lake of the Woods to the Red River. Mr. Gladman, with the bulk of the party and baggage, in three\nnorth canoes, takes the usual route down the Rainy River to the Rat Portage at the end of the Lake of the Woods, while I, with one assistant, in a small canoe, examined the northern route, from the Lac la Pluie, down the Rivi\u00e8re des Bois to the Lake of the Woods, joining Mr. Gladman at the Rat Portage. We purpose starting from here in the morning, and hope to reach the Red River Settlements by the end of the month.\n\nSince our arrival at Fort Francis, we have experienced the greatest assistance and attention from Mr. R. Pether, the Hudson's Bay Company's officer in charge. He has kindly furnished us with guides, and the small canoes necessary for making these separate explorations, besides affording us a deal of valuable information concerning the country through which we have to pass; indeed, from the general good feeling exhibited towards us by all the Company's officers whom we have as yet met, we may reasonably expect similar assistance at other posts, which in this country we feel to be essentially necessary, both for safety and comfort.\n\nWe have been exceedingly fortunate in finding the waters in the rivers at an excellent pitch for running the heavy rapids, through all of which we have as yet passed without a single accident, and from all we can ascertain of the remaining portion of our journey, we have every confidence of arriving at our destination with safety, and in good season.\n\nI have, &c.\n(Signed) W. E. NAPIER.\n\nCopy of Chart by Indian Guide of the Route proposed to be taken from Lake of the Woods to Red River by Muskeg River (E.) Swamp, and Muskeg River (W.) into Reed River.\n\nRainy Lake, August 20, 1857. H. Y. HIND.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Francis, Rainy Lake, August 20, 1857.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I arrived at Fort Francis, Rainy Lake, in company with the other members of the Red River Expedition, on the evening of August 19th.\n\nThe misfortune which happened to the steamer \"Collingwood\" near Michipicoton Island, and the necessary arrangements for procuring men and canoes at Fort William, delayed our departure from that establishment of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company until Monday, August 3rd, at 5 p.m. when, in company with two canoes conveying Mr. Dawson and his assistants, I proceeded with my assistant, Mr. L. Fleming, up the Kaministiquia River.\n\nThe general plan of observation adopted at starting, and continued up to the present time, has been as follows:\n\nWhen in canoe, we took the courses of the rivers and lakes by compass, noting the distance of each turn by time and the speed of the canoe, to serve as the basis of a general geological and topographical\nchart of the route; we directed especial attention to all rock exposures on the banks of the rivers and on the shores of the lakes, and where no doubt existed as to their character, appended to each record of such exposure its appropriate designation and position on the chart.\n\nSimilar attention was directed to the general character of the vegetation, and the different kinds of trees were enumerated; also, as far as opportunity would permit, the nature of the soil, and the rock on which it reposed.\n\nThe temperature of the rivers and lakes was ascertained several times during the day, I have also noted in a daily journal the different kinds of animals seen, and all other incidents or observations which appear to possess any importance or interest.\n\nWhen crossing the portages or when in camp our attention was directed to the collection of specimens of rock, and in some instances of subsoils; also to the determination of the dip, strike, and mineral characteristic of the rocks; to the collection and preservation of all kinds of vegetable met with; and, when opportunity offered, we ascended some neighbouring hill or eminence, and took general bearings by means of prismatic compass. A minimum thermometer enabled me to keep a record of the minimum temperature during the night.\n\nThe canoe assigned to me proved unfortunately to be not only very slow, but in bad travelling condition, requiring constant repair; and no small canoe being attached to the brigade, I have not been able to visit many localities out of the direct line of route, and even had such a canoe been available, it is not probable that much use could have been made of it, as the brigade was compelled, with its heavily laden components, to push on to our destination with the least possible delay.\n\nThe weather has hitherto been very favourable, and the waters of the rivers and lakes, for this season of the year, unusually high.\n\nAt Fort William I received, in common I believe with every member of the expedition, great kindness and ready assistance from the gentleman in charge, Mr. McIntyre.\n\nThe health of the people in my canoe has been uniformly good, with the exception of one Ojibway Indian, who acted as bowman; he has not been able to work for four days, and is now in a very weak condition.\n\nThe time at my disposal will not permit me to enter upon a description of the country we have traversed, and I am therefore compelled to limit this ad interim report to a few general remarks, in relation to past observations and future plans.\n\nThe whole of the country from the Portage d'Ecartier, on the Kaministiquia, to the foot of the Rainy Lake shows a constant recurrence of the so-called primary or unfossiliferous rock, comprising granite, gneiss, micaceous, chloritic and stonblendic schists. Below the falls of Rainy River I have this day seen abundance of silurian limestone in detached masses, without, however, meeting with the rocks in situ.\n\nThe aspect of the country about the extensive and beautiful Lake of the Thousand Islands, and in many other localities on the shores of the larger lakes, bears traces in all directions of having, at a not very remote period, been covered with magnificent forests of white and red pine, and also, in patches with the pitch pine of the voyageurs, a tree which now prevails in its second growth, with aspen and birch. Everywhere, isolated groves or trees of white and red pine of large dimensions occur, and among the comparative young forest growth are seen scathed or half burnt trunks of large dimensions, remaining as witnesses of vast conflagrations at the different epochs, which have spread over many thousand square miles.\n\nThe region about Dog Lake, Lake of the Thousand Islands, Sturgeon Lake, &c. is very interesting and in some respects promising, while the shores about Rainy Lake are by no means inviting.\n\nIn relation to my future operations, I beg leave to state that I proceed with the main party to the Lake of the Woods, and then in company with Mr. Dawson, pass up the Muskeg (swamp) River, cross the dividing ridge or swamp, and go down Roseau River, according to an enclosed copy of a rough plan which an Indian from that part of the country drew for me this morning. We shall be compelled to travel as light as possible in two of the smallest sized canoes capable of holding three persons each.\n\nMr. Dawson will take one canoe, with a guide and an Iroquois Indian. I shall have a similar canoe with the Indian guide who drew the map, and a French Canadian voyageur.\n\nThe only difficulty we apprehend is the accidental meeting of a returning war party of the Lac La Pluie Indians, who have been on \"the war path\" against the Sioux. We trust, however, to the proper interpretations of our reasons for travelling through that part of the country being made to any Indians we may happen to meet by the guide in Mr. Dawson's canoe, who has been kindly permitted to go with us by Mr. Pether, the gentleman in charge of Fort Francis.\n\nThis precaution Mr. Pether considered to be necessary, not only on account of the possible treachery of the Indian guide, but because the Lac la Pluie Indians have, it is here stated, prevented the botanist attached to Capt. Palliser's party from continuing his botanical explorations, and have expressed considerable anxiety and feeling at so large a number of white men coming into their country, for reasons which they profess they cannot understand.\n\nMr. Fleming will proceed with Mr. Gladman down the Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg and Red River, and will continue to make and record observations similar in character to those in which he has been hitherto engaged.\n\nI propose to return to Toronto by way of Pembina and St. Paul's, as that route will afford much longer time for exploration and inquiry in the Red River country, besides offering opportunities for obtaining information of interest or value.\n\nTo the Hon. the Provincial Secretary, Toronto.\n\n(Signed) H. Y. HIND, M. A.\n\nAugust 21, 1857.\n\nP. S.\u2014Since the foregoing report was written, I have been informed that the guide who was permitted by Mr. Pether to accompany us to Red River by the Muskeg route will not be able to give us the benefit of his services on account of illness; we shall be therefore compelled to rely on the good\nfaith of the Indian who drew the original of the accompanying plan, but who has already expressed fears that his people will upbraid him for showing us the way through this comparatively unknown country.\n\nH. Y. H.\n\nRainy Lake Fall, Fort Francis, August 20, 1857.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that we are so far on our way to Red River; but as the canoes make but a short delay, there is no time for compiling a detailed statement, or writing a particular description of the country through which we have passed, I must therefore be brief.\n\nAfter arriving at Fort William it was determined upon that all the parties should proceed by the way of the Kaministiquia, Dog Lake, and the Lake of the Thousand Lakes to Rainy Lake. On the evening of the 3rd instant I started in company with Professor Hind. Next morning Mr. Gladman and Mr. Napier followed, and came up with us on the succeeding day at the Grand Portage; from thence all the parties have travelled in company, Mr. Gladman preceding us by a day's journey in a well-manned canoe to this place, in the hope of being able to engage men to replace the Indians hired at Fort William, none of whom could be induced to accompany us further, on account, as Mr. McIntyre informed us, of the dread they entertain of the Indians in the direction of Red River. But now that we are here, only two or three Indians can be found, nearly all the tribes being either on their hunting-grounds, or out towards Pembina, on an excursion against the Sioux, with whom they are at feud. The greatest portion of the party Mr. Gladman will take with him, by the usual route, the Winnipeg River and Lake to Red River, in three large canoes, manned partly by the Iroquois who are with us, and partly by the young gentlemen assistants who accompany the expedition.\n\nThe chief of the geological branch, Professor Hind, and I, are to cross the country from the Lake of the Woods, by way of Reed River; my principal assistant, Mr. Wells, will accompany the party going by the Winnipeg River, while Mr. Napier, with some of his staff, proceeds by the Indian route to the north of Rainy Lake; once arrived at Red River, Mr. Gladman is confident of being able to engage men and procure provisions, so that we shall then, I sincerely trust, be in a position to organize proper working parties.\n\nI have made a careful estimate of the distances as we proceeded, and traced the outline of the rivers and lakes, besides which I have obtained Indian charts of the streams near the line of route, and also of some of the rivers falling in on the north shore of Lake Superior, all of which appear to be drawn with great fidelity.\n\nThe temperature has been duly registered, but the nature of our progress would not admit of regular barometrical observations; but these, as soon as an opportunity offers, shall be duly attended to.\n\nIn taking the levels of the different rapids and falls, where there were portages, Mr. Napier and I, in order that no delay might be occasioned, have acted in concert, going alternately in advance, or where there was much work to be done, commencing at once from either end of the space, over which the levels had to be taken. By this means we avoided delaying the canoes in the least by our operations.\n\nImmediately on arriving at Red River I shall report at length, giving a full description of the country we have traversed. In the meantime I can only endeavour to convey very briefly a general idea of the route.\n\nThe Kaministiquia is but a small stream, not so large quite, I should say, as the River Trent, which falls into the Bay of Quinte. For the first ten miles or so it is smooth, and the navigation for canoes unimpeded, there is then a continuous flat rapid to the Grand or Kakabeka Falls, which, however, is not so difficult but that canoes can be poled up with facility. From the Grand Falls upward to Dog Lake the river is exceedingly rough, there being a continuous succession of falls and rapids, with but short intervals of smooth water between them.\n\nFrom Dog Lake there are nearly forty miles of uninterrupted canoe navigation, by a small stream that winds through a marsh; then occur two little rapids, over one of which a portage has to be made; after which the route lies by a narrow brook, just wide enough for the canoes, which runs from Cold Water Lake, the source of this branch of the St. Lawrence. Across the height of land, taking the Prairie, Savanne, and another little portage together, there is a land carriage of nearly five miles, broken only by two little lakes or ponds. From the Savanne Portage to the Lake of the Thousand Lakes, there is no impediment except from trees that have fallen across the stream. Leaving the lake just named, the route passes by a chain of lakes to the Manackan River, the northern branch of which runs into Rainy Lake, as shown on the plan, a copy of which has been furnished me.\n\nThe navigation throughout, although tedious, is not difficult; we ran no dangerous rapid, and as to finding the way, it is well known to all the Indians and voyageurs, and is not by any means intricate.\n\nIn regard to its general features, the country is varied. The valley of the lower part of the Kaministiquia is, I should think, well adapted for settlement. On ascending, however, the land becomes very rough and broken, although the hills are of no great elevation. Dog Lake is a large sheet of water, with numerous islands interspersed. The land rises to a considerable elevation round it, but the hills are not steep or in continuous ranges, but swell up gradually as it were in isolated mounds. The prevailing growth of timber, as far as could be perceived, seemed to be poplar, of a large size, and birch; the undergrowth is, however, in some cases of maple, and I dare say, that that description of wood may be found inland, although not in great quantities.\n\nI have not made up my notes so as to be able to give the exact elevation of this lake above Lake Superior, but I may state that the difference of level in round numbers exceeds 700 feet. From Dog Lake upwards the Kaministiquia, or, as it is here called, Dog River, winds through a marsh varying from half a mile to a mile in width; on either side the country is of the same character as at Dog Lake.\n\nAt the Prairie Portage, which here forms the dividing ridge between the waters flowing in this direction and those running towards the St. Lawrence, the country appears comparatively level,\ncovered with a dense growth of pitch pine, spruce, tamarack, white birch, and on the rising ground, poplar. The Savanne Portage is nothing more than an ordinary spruce and tamarack swamp, with about two feet of soft vegetable mould over a stiff bottom of yellow clay. At the Lake of the Thousand Lakes I think there must be good soil. The green woods inland appeared to me like maple, and on the islands and projecting points there is, in some instances, white pine of a large growth. Although the country appears to be considerably elevated, there are, properly speaking, no hills. The land rises gradually from the lake, presenting a smoothly swelling outline against the distant horizon.\n\nThe other lakes between the Lake of the Thousand Lakes and this place have the same general character of being dotted with islands, but the country about them is in general more broken than at that lake. In some cases there appeared to be abundance of red and white pine of a good size. As regards the climate or the soil, no correct inference can be drawn, as in other countries, from the growth of wood. From the Grand Lakes on the Kaminitstiquia to this place, the whole country seems, at no very distant period, to have been overrun by fire. In every direction, in going into the woods, are to be found the charred remains of a former growth, and where an extensive view presents itself, solitary trees or isolated groves of tall white pines stand out from forests of surrounding poplar. There can be no doubt, however, that the climate about the height of land, from the great elevation of the country, must be rather cold. Where we now are, I should say, it was something like the climate of the Ottawa. At the Hon. Hudson's Bay Company's farm at this place the potatoes look luxuriant, and the spring wheat is fast ripening.\n\nShould the route by which we have come, be adopted as the leading highway to the Red River, the communication might be made easy, so far as the source of the Kaminitstiquia, by making a good road from Thunder Bay to Dog Lake, and throwing a dam sixteen feet in height across the outlet of that lake, which would have the effect of converting the marsh through which Dog River winds into a lake as far as the Prairie Portage at the height of land. Kaminitstiquia from Dog Lake down, tumbling as it does as far as the Grand Portage over broken rocks and down steep declivities, with its barren and rugged shores, can never be made an available route for traffic. I merely advert to these subject., and shall report more at leisure on reaching Red River. In the meantime I cannot close this letter without mentioning the kind attention and assistance we have met from the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company. But for Mr. M'Intyre, we should have had difficulty in getting men at Fort William. So anxious was he to aid us and forward us on our journey, that he not only used his all-powerful influence with the Indians to induce them to go with us, but actually took his own men from the work they were at, and made them come.\n\nMr. Pether, the officer in charge of this place, has not been less obliging. He has obtained us guides for the different routes by which we are going, and has otherwise been most civil and attentive.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) S. J.

I now beg to acquaint you with the arrival here of myself, Professor Hind, and Mr. Napier, with the greater number of our party, safe and well.\n\nMr. Dawson was detached at Rainy Lake from our main party, as already advised, with instructions to proceed by the Red River to Fort Garry, making such observation of the route as time and circumstances might permit. Most unfortunately, that gentleman became alarmingly ill, and after ascending the lower part of the stream was obliged to retrace his steps, and, following the course of the main party, arrived at the Mission Station, Islington, on the Winnipeg River, where his illness obliged Professor Hind to leave him until the state of his health would permit his removal to this settlement.\n\nI have sent a canoe for him, and hope, by the aid of medical advice and attention, that he will soon be here and able to resume the duties of exploration and survey.\n\nAt Fort William, the information I had previously received of the portages on the Pigeon River, being chiefly on the American side of the frontier line, and necessarily so, was confirmed. On arriving at Rainy Lake, however, I made further inquiry on this point, and that information was distinctly corroborated. I then directed my attention to the best means of opening the communication between the Lake of the Woods and this settlement. Meeting with many conflicting statements, I thought our best course would be to explore thoroughly (which has never yet been done) the whole country between the Red River and the Lake of the Woods, and thus determine with certainty how and where the best line of communication could be carried through. I therefore leave instructions with Mr. Napier, to examine during the autumn, winter, and spring the section of country between the Stone Fort and the Rat Portage, as far south as the Rat River; and have assigned to Mr. Dawson the exploration of the other section (south of the Rat River), to the boundary line, between the upper part of the Red River and the Lake of the Woods. I look upon this as a very important part of the survey, inasmuch as the communication by the Winnipeg River may be considered of no practical utility. The boat navigation of that river is exceedingly broken and interrupted by heavy falls and rapids, as well as being very circuitous, thus increasing the distance also very greatly. I therefore think it will be quite unnecessary to occupy our time any further in explorations or measurements of that route.\n\nI have made every arrangement in my power for the support and comfort of the parties whom I shall leave here. They have an ample field of employment, and I have no doubt they will acquit themselves with the same zeal and energy which they have hitherto displayed.\n\nIn the month of June next they will extend their survey to Rainy Lake, and it will be necessary to have supplies sent to meet them at that point, as soon as the opening of navigation in spring will admit of their being sent forward. On this point I shall have plans to submit when I arrive at Toronto.\n\nMr. Hind purposes remaining at the settlement until the first week of October, when he will leave for St. Paul\u2019s, accompanied by three other gentlemen of our expedition party. There will then be left for the winter, Mr. Dawson, with his assistants, Messrs. Wells, Gaudet, and Russell; and Mr. Napier and his assistants, Messrs. Killally, De Salaberry, and Campbell. I shall be prepared to set out on my return to Canada on the 11th, and hope to arrive at Toronto on the 15th or 20th October.\n\nThe reports of my colleagues in this expedition cannot be got ready during the short period of my stay here. They will consequently be transmitted by Professor Hind.\n\nI beg leave to advise having drawn, on account of the expedition, for twenty pounds currency, favour of John Rowand, Esq., being to cover the expenses of Mr. John Cayley from Red River to St. Paul\u2019s, which draft will, I hope, be duly accepted and paid.\n\nThe arrangements for the wintering of my party necessarily occupy a large portion of my time, therefore I defer my report on the route until I shall reach Toronto.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nTo the Honourable (Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN\n\nThe Provincial Secretary, Toronto.\nSir,\n\nIslington Mission, Winnipeg River, August 30, 1857.\n\nThe circumstances which have led to the opportunity now afforded me of informing you of the result of an attempt to penetrate from Lake of the Woods to Red River by way of Muskeg River, as intimated in my last report, will be best explained by a brief narrative of proceedings since our departure from Fort Francis.\n\nIt will, perhaps, be sufficient to state meanwhile that I am detained at this mission by the illness of Mr. Dawson, who is prostrated by a very severe attack of remittent fever, and I am much pained to say that if no favourable change takes place within the next twenty-four hours, I find difficulty in suppressing a fear that the most distressing results may be anticipated. Under any circumstances, he will probably not be able to regain his usual health and strength for some weeks. As I do not intend to take any decisive step until to-morrow, for reasons which will appear in the course of this narrative, I beg leave to occupy the time which is thus painfully placed at my disposal in penning this report.\n\nOn Saturday, August 22nd, I started from Fort Francis at noon, in company with Mr. Dawson, from Muskeg River, Lake of the Woods. We were provided with two small canoes fit for transportation through the swamp which separates the water-shed of Red River from that of the western shores of the Lake of the Woods. In Mr. Dawson's canoe we were a French Canadian (Fran\u00e7ois) and an Iroquois (Pierre). In my canoe an Indian guide from Garden Island, Lake of the Woods, and Lambert, a French Canadian, who acted as interpreter. We were furnished with provisions to last for ten days, one change of clothing, a small tent, and a pair of blankets each.\n\nRainy River.\n\nThe valley of Rainy River afforded a very delightful contrast to the barren shores of Rainy Lake, and for a distance of sixty miles offered the utmost luxuriance of vegetation and all the aspects of a most promising field for future settlement. I made numerous inquiries of the Indian guide during our journey respecting the breadth of the valley, and the answers received, coupled with the statements of Mr. Pether, the gentleman in charge of Fort Francis, and my own and Mr. Dawson's observations, have enabled me to form a definite idea of its geology, and to furnish a tolerably accurate view of its extent and capabilities.\n\nOn the north, or British side, the valley of Rainy River is of variable breadth; behind Fort Francis it is bounded by a swamp, distant from the fort about half a mile. This swamp soon retires from the river, until it is distant half a day's journey from it, or from twelve to fifteen miles. Near the Lake of the Woods it again approaches the river, and about twelve miles from its mouth the valley is three hours' journey in breadth, which may be represented by from seven to nine miles.\n\nThe Indian guide said that the valley on the United States side was similar in many respects to the northern half. He described it as also bounded by a swamp, with several ranges of low hills crossing it at nearly right angles, two of which occur at the rapids on the river, and others approach and terminate at the south bank, the river gently sweeping round them.\n\nConfining my observations almost exclusively to the British side, the description which follows refers solely to the valley on the northern bank.\n\nThe river flows upon an alluvial bed partly of its own formation, the materials being derived probably in great part from the cutting away of the drift clay and sand which constitutes the higher of two plateaux by which its boundary is now defined. The first or lowest plateau is generally from twelve to fifteen feet above the present water level; it frequently terminates on the river in abrupt low clay bluffs, capped with loam and sand or rich alluvial deposits.\n\nBehind the lowest plateau, and often almost imperceptibly rising from it, a second plateau occurs, elevated above the first from fifteen to thirty feet; occasionally both plateaux come upon the river together in one bold bluff, often forty feet in altitude, and again the lower plateau is sometimes found to occupy the bank without the higher one in the rear, being visible from a canoe.\n\nThe separation of these plateaux is a very important item in the description of the topography and general characteristics of Rainy River.\n\nWhere the lower plateau is alone visible, the vegetation it sustains is often characteristic of a poor and sandy soil. Red pines, some of them of fair dimensions, red cedar, and small poplars occupy it; and if any passer-by were to draw an inference from the prevailing timber which in such situations meets the eye, he would at once form the opinion that the land was comparatively worthless. But let him cross the lower plateau until he reaches at a distance of 200 yards, or perhaps a quarter or half a mile, the higher plateau, and the magnificent growth of poplar, balm of gilead, with elm and basswood, would quickly reverse such judgments. As far as I penetrated in different places back from the river, the soil of the higher plateau was of admirable quality, and supported a heavy growth of timber. The clay upon which it rested was often exposed by the steep banks of numerous sluggish streams, which cut the plateau to nearly the level of Rainy River, and evidently form channels by which the swamps in the rear are drained.\n\nI often observed what I considered to be drift clay, when high bluffs, formed by the union of the two plateaux, came upon the river. The accompanying section* will perhaps serve to show the relation of several parts of the valley of Rainy River to one another.\n\nThe following extracts from my journal will convey a more correct impression of the country than a brief description. Numerous items of interest, however, are necessarily omitted here, which will appear in the general report to be furnished when I return to Toronto.\n\nExtracts from Journal.\n\nAugust 22nd. . . . Dined about twelve miles below Fort Francis, on a high bank destitute of trees, which had probably been destroyed long ago by the Indians or by fire. The ground is covered by the richest profusion of rose bushes, woodbine, convolvulus in bloom, Jerusalem artichoke just beginning to flower, and vetches of the largest dimensions.\n\nFringing this open interval, of perhaps 280 acres in extent, were elms, balm of gilead, ash, and oak. One elm tree measured three feet in diameter, or nine feet eight inches in circumference, and there is\nno exaggeration in saying that our temporary camping place is like a rich, overgrown, and neglected garden.\n\nThe golden rod is showing its rich hue in all directions, and gives a distinct yellow tint to an open grassy area on the opposite side of the river, at the mouth of Red Lake River.\n\nSimilar intervals to the one on which we are now encamped have been noticed occasionally, and hitherto the banks have maintained an average altitude of about forty feet, bearing a fine growth of the trees before named. No part of the country through which we have passed from Lake Superior westward can bear comparison with the rich banks of Rainy River thus far. The river has preserved a very uniform breadth, varying only from 200 to 300 yards. The soil is a sandy loam at the surface, much mixed with the vegetable matter.\n\nOccasionally where the bank has recently fallen away, the clay is seen stratified in layers about two inches in thickness, following in all respects the contour of what seems to be unstratified drift clay below.\n\nBasswood is not uncommon, and stumpy oaks, whose trunks are from eighteen inches to two feet in diameter, are seen in open groves, with luxuriant grasses and climbing plants growing beneath them. The lodge-poles of an Indian camp of former seasons are covered with convolvulus in bloom, and the honeysuckle is twining its long and tenacious stems around the nearest support living or dead.\n\nThe banks of the river maintain for twenty miles (the distance we have now come) an altitude varying from fifteen to sixty feet. Occasionally the banks show abrupt boundaries of the plateaux, the lower boundary having the form of a sloping bank or an abrupt cliff of from fifteen to thirty feet in altitude on the river, the upper plateau rising gradually or abruptly from fifteen to twenty feet higher, according to its position with reference to the river.\n\nThere is every appearance, in places, of fire having destroyed a former larger growth of trees than those which occupy now these areas.\n\nThe extraordinary height of the water at this season of the year is seen by the lodge-poles of former Indian encampments at the foot of the bank being under water to a depth of one and even two feet! The river does not appear to rise high in the spring, as the trees fringing the banks to the water's edge show no action of ice.\n\nMr. Pether states that the river never freezes between the Falls at Fort St. Francis and the Big Fork, a distance of twelve miles, or between Rainy Lake and the Falls, a distance of three miles. The difference between the highest and the lowest water levels may be seven feet, and no records of recent higher levels meet the eye.\n\nAugust 23rd. Reached the rapid of Rainy River* at a quarter past six, a.m. They let us down about two and a half or three feet, and appeared to be caused by a belt of rock crossing the river at right angles to its course.\n\nOn the American side the hill range has an altitude of about eighty feet, on the Canadian side it is much lower, and appears to subside in gentle undulations. High clay banks are exposed above and below the rapids. I was much surprised at the number of birds of different kinds, chirruping and singing in the light and warmth of a bright morning sun. I heard more birds in ten minutes there than during the whole journey from Kakabeka Falls, on the Kaministiquia.\n\nAt the second rapids, an extensive area, destitute of trees, offers a very beautiful prairie appearance. Here we landed to examine two immense mounds, which appeared to be tumuli. We forced our way to them through a dense growth of grasses, nettles, and Jerusalem artichokes, twisted together by wild convolvulus. On our way to the mounds we passed through a neglected Indian garden, and near it we observed the lodge polls of an extensive encampment.\n\nThe garden was partially fenced, and contained a path of Jerusalem artichokes six and seven feet high in the stalk, and just beginning to show their flowers.\n\nThe wild oat here attained an astonishing size, and all the vegetation exhibited the utmost luxuriance. The mound ascended was about forty feet high, and 100 broad at the base: it was composed of a rich black sandy loam, containing a large quantity of vegetable matter. On digging a foot deep, no change in the character of the soil was observable. The Indian guide called them underground houses. About 300 yards below the second rapids, twenty-three skeletons of Indian lodges are seen, all clothed with the wild convolvulus, and now serving as records of the love of change which seem to form a characteristic in the habits of this barbarous race who possess, without appreciating or enjoying, the riches of this beautiful and most fertile valley.\n\nLimestone fragments and boulders, more or less water-worn, with pebbles of the same rock, are found everywhere on the beach at the foot of the clay or loamy banks.\n\nWhen we landed for dinner to-day, I strolled about half-a-mile back from the river, and Mr. Dawson went about half a mile further. We found the vegetation improving vast as we receded from the river. Aspens of very large dimensions, balm of gilead, basswood, birch, and oak, with some elm, formed the forest. The land rose very gradually, and on inquiring from the Indian how far back the good land stretched before coming to the swamp, he said that here the valley was broadest, and it would take us half a day to reach the swamps, journeying the whole time through land similar to that around us, but with larger trees.\n\nThe singular topographical knowledge acquired by these Indians, and (as far as we have yet been able to ascertain,) the accuracy and fidelity with which they communicate it, assures us of the Indian's statement; we shall have opportunities of testing his knowledge of these matters soon, which must not be overlooked.\n\n* Two in number: are capable of being ascended by a small steamer of good power without difficulty, and cannot be considered as presenting an obstacle to the navigation of this important stream as long as the water maintains its present altitude, which is about three feet higher than is usual at this season of the year, but often exceeded in spring. Mr. Dawson informs me that two locks of ten feet lift, with one guard lock, would overcome the falls at the mouth of the river, and thus form a splendid water communication between the head of Rainy Lake and the foot of the Lake of the Woods, a distance of about one hundred and eighty miles (189).\nThe remaining portion of Rainy River exhibited features similar to those already described in foregoing extracts from my journal. There are numerous items of interest relating to the geology, topography, soil, and Indians, which I have not thought proper to introduce in this brief sketch, as they will form part of my general report.\n\nMr. Pether, of Fort Francis, informed me that the swamps in the rear of Rainy River valley, consists of a peaty accumulation, through which a pole may be thrust in places to a depth of thirty feet without finding bottom.\n\nThe guide stated that the swamp supported no large trees, but a thick growth of low bushes.\n\nAs we approached the Lake of the Woods, the river increased in breadth, and at each bend a third low plateau was in process of formation, often two or three hundred acres in area, and elevated above the present high-water level from one to three feet. Coarse grasses grow in abundance upon many of the rich outline alluvial deposits, and it appears very probable that in ordinary seasons they would furnish some thousand acres of rich pasture land, as the grasses are like those which, on the Kaministiquia, the settlers cut for their winter supply of fodder for cattle. Near the mouth of the river the tall tops of a few red and white pines rise far above the aspens occupying the lower plateau, and a vast reedy expanse, probably in ordinary seasons available for grazing purposes, marks the junction of Rainy River with the Lake of the Woods.\n\nOmitting for the present the enumeration of some interesting phenomena observed and recorded in our traverse of the Lake of the Woods direct to Garden Island, near the western coast, I must be content with mentioning that on the evening of August 24th we camped near a well-cultivated field of Indian corn, and a rapid exploration of the island revealed to us a large potato patch, and a small area devoted to squashes and pumpkins of different kinds.\n\nWe ascertained that the island had been cultivated by the Lake of the Woods Saulteux Indians for generations. Mr. Dawson and the Iroquois Pierre, both complained for the first time that evening of being unwell.\n\nOur camp fire evidently soon attracted the attention of a number of Indians, who were then living on a neighbouring island about four miles from us, for at midnight we were aroused by the sudden appearance at the door of the tent of two of these people, and in half an hour twenty or more had arrived. In the morning we answered their inquiries, and were requested to visit their chief, who remained with his tribe on the island already referred to. Declining their invitation, as we were anxious to hasten to the mouth of the Muskeg River, they told us they would send for their chief, who would arrive as soon as the wind fell. We made the necessary preparations for a long council, and about noon the chief's son, who was amongst the first arrivals on the evening previous, announced that the canoes were coming.\n\nWe counted thirteen canoes, and found that they contained in all fifty-three men and boys, there being seven of the latter; the others were the chief and warriors of the tribe. A portion of them had just returned from an expedition against the Sioux, and were decorated or disfigured, according to taste, with whatever advantages paint, feathers, and ornaments could confer. As the object of their visit was to ascertain the reasons why we wished to pass through this part of their country, and as some excitement had been occasioned among them by Captain Palliser's party, briefly referred to in my former report, I considered it necessary to note with care the conversation which ensued, and previously arranged with Mr. Dawson what our line of conduct should be, in anticipation of not improbable difficulties.\n\nThe following conversation then took place, Lambert acting as interpreter, receiving the necessary questions and replies from Mr. Dawson and myself:\n\nChief.\u2014Tell them, all these they see around me are my own tribe. It is our custom to smoke before talking. We shall follow the practice of our fathers.\n\nAbout half an hour was devoted to the distribution of tobacco, the filling of pipes, and the smoke, after which the chief resumed.\n\nChief.\u2014We do not think you will start to-day, we wish to know what you are doing in our country. (To the interpreter.) What are these men, are they ministers, or surveyors, or what are they?\n\nReply.\u2014We are instructed by our chief to journey to Red River, and have been told to take this route.\n\nChief.\u2014We have heard that you have been gathering flowers. What does that mean?\n\nReply.\u2014To amuse ourselves when on the portages or in camp; we have gathered your flowers because some of them we have never seen before.\n\nChief.\u2014The white man looks at our flowers and trees, and takes away the Indian's land. Did these men see nothing near the fort on Rainy River?\n\nReply.\u2014They saw nothing extraordinary.\n\nChief.\u2014Did they not see a grave near the fort? A single grave; a chief's grave. All these people here are descendants of that chief; and they do not know for what purpose you have been sent here, or why you pass through this part of our country.\n\nReply.\u2014We are merely travelling through the country, by the shortest route to Red River: we have said so before.\n\nChief.\u2014We ask this, because there are braves here who have not heard this reason for visiting our country, and we have asked it again that all may hear and know it. All around belong to one tribe and are one people; we are poor, but we have hearts, and do not wish to part with our country.\n\nReply.\u2014Our Government have no intention of taking your country, and have no wish to interfere with your property in any way; we are anxious to be on friendly terms with you.\n\nChief.\u2014Some people are gone down the Great River from the Rat Portage two or three days ago, why did you not go with them?\n\nReply.\u2014We were ordered to go this way to Red River; and as your young men obey your orders, so do we those of our chief.\n\nA Brave.\u2014Why did their chief send them by this route?\n\nReply.\u2014Our Government gave orders to our chief, and he told us to go by this route to Red River; they thought it was the shortest way; we are not traders, but messengers.\nA Brave.\u2014Why did you not go with your chief?\nReply.\u2014Our chief sent us, and waits for us at Red River. He will return by the Rat Portage, and give every explanation to you; he will return in three weeks.\nChief.\u2014We think you want to do something with these paths, and that is the reason why you have been sent.\nReply.\u2014We have been sent by this route, because it is the shortest, and we have to obey our instructions.\nChief.\u2014We hear there is one who is gone by the back lakes (Mr. Napier), the worst path he could have taken; why did he go?\nReply.\u2014He was sent, and therefore compelled to go.\nChief.\u2014It would be thought very hard by our young men, and must be thought hard by you, to be sent on a journey for purposes which you are not allowed to know.\nReply.\u2014Our Government has business at Red River, and has sent us as messengers by this route. Our chief will soon come back, and give you all the information you seek.\nA Brave.\u2014Why did that man send his people through our country without asking our leave?\nReply.\u2014He was greatly hurried, and heard that you were scattered, some on the \u201cwar path,\u201d others fishing, and others gone to the rice grounds. He did not think there was any chance of finding your chiefs.\nChief.\u2014All these paths through which you wish to go are difficult and bad. They are of no use at all, and we cannot let our people work for white people, or go with you.\nReply.\u2014We do not expect them to go for nothing; we cannot go alone at present, and must rely upon your assistance.\nChief.\u2014I do not know what good it will do us to show you that road.\nReply.\u2014It will do you no harm, and as strangers we cannot go alone.\nChief.\u2014The man who sent you, did he think he sent you through his own country?\nReply.\u2014On our road we met a traveller who had just passed through the lake, he was an officer of the company, and he told us you could not now be found, as you were either on the war path or fishing; he said that we might see you at Fort Francis, but you had left some days before we arrived here.\nChief.\u2014I don\u2019t think you will be able to pass by that way, the path is bad. What did the guide receive from you at Fort Francis? he must give all back, we cannot let our young men go with you to show the path. Your head man has no right or claim to the road, and you must pass by the old way.\u2014If you will go, we shall not interfere; but you will go alone, and find the way for yourselves. Recollect, I have said the path is bad.\nReply.\u2014We ask you now to send us one of your young men to show us the road; we shall pay him well, and send back presents to you: what do you ask?\nChief.\u2014It is hard to deny your request; but we see how the Indians are treated far away. The white man comes, looks at their flowers, their trees and their rivers; others soon follow him: the lands of the Indians pass from their hands, and they have a home nowhere. You must go by the way the white man has hitherto gone. I have told you all.\nReply.\u2014What reason can we offer to those who have sent us for your having refused to allow us to travel through your land?\nChief.\u2014The reason why we stop you is because we think you do not tell us why you want to go that way, and what you want to do with those paths. You say that all the white men we have seen belong to one party, and yet they go by three different roads, why is that? Do they want to see the Indian\u2019s land? Remember, if the white man comes to the Indian\u2019s house, he must walk through the door, and not steal in by the window. That way, the old road, is the door, and by that way you must go. You gathered corn in our gardens and put it away: did you never see corn before? why did you not note it down in your book? did your people want to see our corn? would they not be satisfied with your noting it down? You cannot pass through those paths. (Cries of No! No! (Ka-ween! Ka-ween!) from all.)\nReply.\u2014We paid you for your corn in tobacco; we tell you now that we are anxious to go by that Muskeg road to Red River, because we have learned that the path is travelled by the Americans (Long Knives); we want to see if it be true, if they come through this country, and what these white men are doing. Remember, we are your friends, and we shall be glad to be always friendly with you.\nChief.\u2014Why did you not say that at first; we know you had good reason for going through those bad paths?\nReply.\u2014We spoke without authority; we have told you our own opinion, but we were not told to tell you this.\nChief.\u2014A pity you did not say that at first. A pity you did not say that at first (repeated). (After some consultation with other chiefs, he continued), We thought there was something, but our own word to-day is spoken and we cannot change it. All say this, and the council is at an end.\nThe chief then said to the interpreter, \u201cLet not these men think bad of us for taking away their guides; let them send us no presents, we do not want them. They have no right to pass that way. We have hearts, and love our lives and our country. If twenty men came we would not let them pass to-day. We do not want the white man; when the white man comes he brings disease and sickness, and our people perish. We do not wish to die; many white men would bring death to us, and our people would pass away; we wish to love and hold the land God has given to us and our fathers won. Tell these men this, and the talk is finished.\u201d\nA hasty consultation with Mr. Dawson as to what we should do in this dilemma was abruptly closed by being informed that the Iroquis Pierre was very ill, and at the back of the tent. Without his paddle, without guide, and Mr. Dawson feeling much worse than on the evening previous, we determined at once not to attempt to cross the swamp at the height of land alone, and decided to go to Red River by the Rat Portage.\nWe told this to the chief and asked for assistance to take the canoe to Red River.\nHe pointed out two young men, who received orders to take us down the Winipeg. One was to return from Rat Portage, the other to go on to Red River. We then told the chief that we should send him some presents from Red River, at which he expressed satisfaction, and at our request he\nsuggested tea and tobacco. We told him we should soon come again, and by these paths, and hoped that we should then have no difficulty in procuring guides. An old man, not a chief, said, another day it may be different; we have spoken to-day and cannot alter a word.\n\nIt remains for me now to say, that on the next morning both Mr. Dawson and the Iroquois were very ill, and lay quite helpless in their canoe. I gave the only medicine accessible, and Mr. Dawson found much relief from mustard emetics. At Rat Portage no medicine could be obtained, and Mr. McKenzie, the gentleman in charge, was absent. We remained for an hour, and then hurried on to the Mission, where we hoped to overtake Mr. Gladman or Mr. Napier, who were well supplied with the necessary medicines. I beg leave to extract the following note from my journal, which will best explain the difficulties of our position.\n\nExtracts from Journal.\n\nWednesday, August 26. Camped on an island about six miles from Garden Island. Pierre complained of much pain: \"My meat (flesh) all bad, all great pain.\" Terrific thunderstorm during the night. Mr. Dawson passed a sleepless night. In the morning, when seven miles from our camp, saw numerous lodges. Our guide informed us that the tribe accompanying them were more than twice greater in number than those we had seen yesterday. Entered at noon a labyrinth of islands. Mr. Dawson commenced vomiting, and we stopped to take dinner. Gave mustard emetic; it relieved him, and felt better.\n\nMr. Dawson and Pierre are lying at the bottom of the canoe, wrapped in blankets, Francois and an Indian paddling.\n\nThursday, 27. Mr. Dawson passed a sleepless night in a high fever, with frequent vomiting of bilious matter; mustard emetic gave him much relief for a time. Pierre as before, but weaker. Our route lay through innumerable islands, not marked in any chart in our possession. The invalid still in the same condition. Reached Rat Portage at half-past twelve noon. Finding no medicine or proper food, and hearing that the other canoes started at seven a.m. this morning, and Mr. McKenzie being absent, we set out from Rat Portage at half-past one, p.m.\n\nThe Indian guide took us by a short cut which he said was half a day shorter than the Winnipeg route. Heavy thunderstorm with hail at half-past two. Mr. Dawson was wet through, with all his bedding soaked; camped to dry his clothes. Both invalids worse, and growing weaker. Neither of them has taken food which remains for a minute on the stomach since we left Garden Island.\n\nAugust 28. Arrived at the mission at half-past nine, p.m. Were received with the greatest kindness by the Rev. Mr. McDonald, the missionary of Islington; gave Mr. Dawson calomel.\n\nSaturday. Another sleepless night. Proposed in the morning to start alone with one light canoe, and endeavour to catch those of the main party before us, who had set out from the mission at noon yesterday.\n\nMr. McDonald thought there was no doubt but I should catch them before they reached Fort Alexander, procure proper medicine, assistance, and food, and return in three or four days.\n\nMr. Dawson, however, being very ill indeed, urged upon me to stay with him, and I yielded, contrary, as I told him, to my own judgment; but I feared, with Mr. McDonald, that my leaving him, even for three or four days, would seriously increase his illness, and perhaps endanger his life.\n\nMonday morning, August 31st. Lambert told me early this morning that Pierre's body was covered with purple blotches or blisters. Mr. Dawson, who heard the communication, was evidently troubled.\n\nGave Pierre a strong dose of salts, no other medicine which we thought appropriate being available. In the afternoon Mr. Dawson showed symptoms of delirium; at night gave five grains calomel, fifteen grains jalap; during the night delirium increased, and at 3 a.m. Monday he was quite delirious, asking repeatedly about the mission, the Winnipeg, what time we would be all ready to start, &c. &c. At four he slept soundly, and woke at seven quite calm and collected.\n\nWe decided then that it would be better for me to start at once for assistance, and dictated the letters\u2014a copy of which I beg to enclose, to Mr. Gladman, and Mr. Wells, his first assistant. I now finish this narrative to make preparations for an immediate start. I may perhaps mention, that I have just asked Mr. Dawson why he objected to my leaving him on Saturday to obtain assistance. He replied, that he did not expect to live.\n\nIt would ill become me to conclude without expressing in the warmest manner our deep sense of obligation to the Rev. Mr. McDonald. The haste with which I am necessarily compelled to draw this imperfect narrative to a close, does not allow me to enumerate here the acts of attention, kindness, and Christian sympathy which that gentleman has showered upon us; we feel indeed that under these very painful circumstances, he has nobly, both to the letter and the spirit, worked out to the utmost of human power the profession of his faith: and had it not been for his exertions and the means at his disposal, it might, humanly speaking, have been my painful duty to have recorded a different close to these brief but serious troubles, in the midst of a barren and desolate waste. I am happy to say too, that Pierre is better, the spots have all subsided, and he is now moving about. When I arrive at Fort Alexander or Red River, I shall hasten to submit further intelligence.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY YOULE HIND,\nGeologist, Red River Expedition.\n\nTo the Hon. the Provincial Secretary.\n\n(Section referred to on page 21.)\nSir,\n\nFort Garry, Red River, Tuesday, September 8, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter which I have just sent to the Rev. Mr. McDonald, of Islington Mission, Winnipeg River. From it I trust you will learn the nature of the steps I have taken to assist in sending relief to Mr. Dawson, and that they will, so far as they go, meet with your approval; I feel conscious that no further efforts on my part, under present circumstances, would have enabled me to extend or increase them. In reviewing report No. 2, which I wrote at Islington Mission, I find it conveys a very inadequate idea of the importance of the valley of Rainy River, and that I have not been able to introduce some very interesting facts respecting the islands and coast of the west side of the Lake of the Woods, a region quite out of the ordinary canoe track, and but little known as far as I can ascertain from inquiry here. I have taken copious notes during the whole trip, since leaving Fort Francis, and shall have great pleasure in communicating what I think will be information of some value, at my earliest leisure moment.\n\nFrom what I have seen of the Red River settlements there is a vast field for inquiry open here, and of a character so surprising and encouraging, and so much opposed to the impressions which generally prevail respecting this country, that I shall have great difficulty in securing all the information I require during the short month which now remains at my disposal. Each succeeding hour's experience shows the necessity of relying upon personal observation alone in all that relates to the physical aspect of the country and its immense capabilities.\n\nPermit me to offer one illustration. I was informed that here and there, a mile back from the River, swamps oppose the progress of settlement into the Prairie, and that there was an insuperable objection to their being drained on account of the enormous gullies which a single spring flood would cut from the swamp, through the soft rich prairie soil and its subjacent marl and clay. Along the course of the little ditch first dug, I saw some of these gullies originating from a ditch two feet deep; they were thirty feet deep, and perhaps a hundred feet across. But while they effectually drain the swamps and create admirable pasture fields, they involve the necessity of the construction of bridges to cross them. These items of expense the settlement cannot afford to pay, and no other funds are available but those derived from the inhabitants. Hence in order to avoid building a few cheap wooden bridges, the swamps remain undrained, the pasture limited and exhausted by constant cropping, and the boundaries of the settlement confined.\n\nOn Thursday, I propose to go across the Prairie to the Prairie Portage, on the Assiniboine, a distance of seventy miles; where, I am told, but I receive the information with doubt, that I shall find the extremity of an outlying patch of the great lignite bed of the Saskatchewan. This excursion may take five days, and offers many facilities of seeing the Prairie country. I propose then to proceed up the Rat River to the boundaries of the limestone, and afterwards up Red River to the boundaries thereof of the same formation, these being the main points of geological interest which are at this late season of the year accessible. About the 5th of October I hope to be able to start by way of Pembina to St. Paul's, and by slow travelling acquire materials for a sketch of the country through which we shall pass.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY YOULE HIND.\n\nTo the Hon. the Provincial Secretary.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nFort Garry, Tuesday, September 8, 1858.\n\nNotwithstanding a head wind on the Winnipeg Lake which delayed us several hours, we managed to reach the Lower or Stone Fort, at 6 p.m., on Saturday last. On enquiring I found that the canoes had started for Fort Garry at about 11 o'clock, four in number. I therefore immediately procured a horse and hastened on to the Upper Fort, arriving there at half-past nine in the evening; and having seen Mr. Wells, I learned that Mr. Gladman was visiting his relations at some distance from our camp, about five miles as he supposed. Nothing could be done that night, but early in the morning Mr. Wells procured a horse and went to see Mr. Gladman, who after hearing the statement of the case, decided that nothing could be done that day (Sunday), and promised to be in the camp early the next morning. He arrived at half-past ten on Monday but although every effort was made by many attached to the expedition to see him, he could not be found until two p.m. All items necessary to send to you and Mr. Dawson had long been ready, but for reasons which I am not prepared to explain, no canoe was dispatched last night, although I did not fail to urge the necessities of the case, and was repeatedly seconded in this endeavour by Messrs. Napier, Wells, Gaudet, and others. This morning there is a prospect of the canoe being despatched. I have seen Archdeacon Cochrane, and he kindly undertook to deliver the letters with which you favoured me to their several destinations.\n\nYour Indian boy, who acted as guide, has expressed a wish to remain here until you arrive, but I have insisted upon his returning with the canoe according to your express desire. Mr. Gladman is to give him a complete suit of clothes for the winter for his services, and I shall leave a little present which you will please give him at your discretion when you come to Fort Garry.\n\nI hope that Mr. Dawson is now fast recovering, and I cannot but feel and express the deepest regret that so much unnecessary trouble should have occurred here in despatching a canoe. I feel persuaded that there did not exist a single satisfactory reason for not despatching a canoe on such an errand on Sunday morning. Even if a crew among our men could not be found we should not have had the least difficulty in getting any number of men we wanted at the door of the Roman Catholic church after mass; as it is possible the canoe may soon start it is probable that I shall not have time to write to Mr. Dawson, but if you will kindly show him this hurried letter, he will see that I have done the utmost in my power to obtain for him the assistance he so much requires. The men in the canoe worked very well, and often rose an hour before daylight.\n\nI almost forgot to say that neither men nor a canoe were to be found at Fort Alexander. Through the kindness of the Chief Justice of Rupert's Land, Mr. Gaudet will bring with him numerous little\nthings for Mr. Dawson, which he will find very acceptable. I hope I shall see you again before I leave the settlement.\n\nMeanwhile accept my warmest thanks for your kindness and sympathy.\n\nAnd believe me, &c.\n\nThe Rev. Robert McDonald, Islington Mission,\nWinipeg River, Rupert's Land.\n\n(Signed) HY. HIND.\n\nSir,\n\nProfessor Hind will explain our reasons for coming this way. The Professor has promised to send a canoe from Fort Alexander, but should he fail in being able to do so, I trust you will lose no time in sending a canoe for me.\n\nIslington Mission, August 31, 1857.\n\nG. Gladman, Esq.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) S. J. DAWSON.\n\nMy dear Wells,\n\nThe Professor will explain all our journeyings to you since we parted. I am very low and very weak, and it may possibly be a fortnight before I am able to do anything. Urge Mr. Gladman, if Mr. Hind does not succeed in finding men at Fort Alexander, to lose no time in sending a canoe for me. I have had a very narrow escape indeed. Send such things as Mr. Hind will name, such as rice and sugar, and if you can procure it, a bottle of Port wine, to put in the sago. Survey Reed River as far up as you can. It would be better to do this first, and also the streams running in from that direction. Consult Mr. Gladman about it.\n\nYours, &c.\n\n(Signed) S. J. DAWSON.\n\nMr. Wells.\n\nFort Garry, September 9, 1857.\n\nAvailing myself of the opportunity of Mr. John Cayley's departure to-morrow for Canada, by way of St. Paul, I have deemed it advisable to inform the Government of the safe arrival of my party at Fort Garry on the 5th instant, in company with Mr. Dawson's party under Mr. Wells. As we are still under canvass, and unlikely to get settled for some days to come, I shall not be able to forward the plans, &c., of the routes I have examined as soon as I had anticipated, but I hope to send them by Professor Hind, who purposes leaving for Canada by the 6th.\n\nI can, therefore give only a short account of my proceedings from the date of my last letter from Fort Francis, together with a general description of the route. In consequence of my canoe men being discharged at Fort Francis, being engaged only thus far, great difficulty was found in procuring another crew for the remainder of the journey. However, by the 22nd a crew of four men was made up, and I then started my canoe with my assistant and baggage down the Rainy River, the usual route. Immediately afterwards I left in a small canoe with Mr. Gaudet and two men, taking another route, returning to Rainy Lake, and then by series of small lakes and creeks reached the N.E. extremity of the Lake of the Woods, and having passed through countless channels caused by the numerous islands in this part of the lake, I arrived at the Rat Portage on the evening of the 26th, when I met my assistant and Mr. Wells' party who had arrived there that morning. This route is only preferable to that by Rainy River in winter, as it is shorter. I shall, however, forward a plan and detailed account of it hereafter. My assistant describes Rainy River as a fine large stream of an average width of seven chains, and depth six feet. There are no portages in it, and but three small rapids which are easily run; it is very straight throughout its entire length, and the current, when he passed down, never exceeded in any part except at the rapids, which are very short, the rate of two miles an hour. About ten miles from the Fort Francis a large tributary joins the Rainy River from the east, and five miles further on another large river flows in from the same direction. The land is from ten to fifteen feet above the water, and in several places seems to be very good, elms and oak appearing here and there. The passage across the Lake of the Woods was happily made by them without much difficulty, the weather fortunately being favourable, but it is generally considered dangerous, as some of the traverses are rather long, and sudden storms are frequent, which renders the passage of them rather hazardous.\n\nMr. Gladman arrived at the Rat Portage the day before us, and staying there a few hours again left us behind. I had great difficulty in procuring here a guide and another man absolutely necessary for safely descending Winnipeg River, where the rapids are so numerous and dangerous, those men I got at Fort Francis not knowing the river sufficiently well. At Islington Mission it was considered necessary to procure another canoe, as mine and Mr. Dawson's were considerably overloaded. The Rev. Mr. McDonald kindly lent us one, into which some of the baggage and two of the party were put with a crew of four men. The advantage of this arrangement was seen shortly when we had to cross numerous portages and descend several rapids, most of them exceedingly dangerous. Winnipeg River may be said to be the most difficult and dangerous part of the whole route; for some distance it has more the character of a chain of large lakes dotted with islands, and then contracting to a rapid river a few chains in width. We succeeded in reaching Fort Alexander on the 1st of September, when we met Mr. Gladman. After waiting there but a few hours we proceeded to cross Lake Winnipeg, and after the detention of one day on the lake, owing to a gale of wind, we arrived finally here on the 5th.\n\nOn my next return, I will forward the plans and sections of the route, which will clearly explain the various portages and rapids, shewing their respective position and peculiarities. It was our intention, on leaving the Rat Portage, for one party to explore the Pinewa, a branch of the Winnipeg, which falls into the head of Lac de Bonnet, but owing to the water in the river being low, and the heavy manner in which our canoes were loaded, it was not deemed prudent by the guide to attempt it. I shall be able, however, to procure from Professor Hind, who came by it in a light canoe, correct information as to its general character, which will enable me to form an opinion as to whether it would be desirable to make a further exploration of it.\n\nOwing to the unfortunate illness of Mr. Dawson, and his detention at Islington Mission, I have not as yet been able to decide as to when the examination of Roseau River and Rat River can be made. It is,\nhowever, my intention to examine the country between Red River and Lac des Bois; and much valuable information concerning its nature can be procured here from persons who have hunted over it, and are thoroughly acquainted with it.\n\nMr. Gaudet has been despatched to Islington Mission with the necessary medicine and other articles for Mr. Dawson; and I trust we may have the satisfaction of seeing him again in ten or fifteen days.\n\nAt Fort Garry we have been very well received by Governor Johnson, and Mr. McTavish, the chief factor, and indeed by all the inhabitants whom we have as yet met; and I have no doubt but that every facility will be afforded us, as far as it is possible, to carry out our explorations and examinations with satisfaction. We are making exertions to procure quarters and the necessary provisions for the winter; but find it a matter of some difficulty, as most of the available stock has been secured for the troops which are expected here shortly; still I have no fear but that we shall be, in every respect, well provided for before the winter sets in.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) W. H. E. NAPIER.\n\nTo the Hon. the Provincial Secretary.\n\nSir,\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota Territory, October 28, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I arrived at this place in company with my assistant, Mr. Fleming, and Messrs. Dickenson and Cayley, formerly associated with Mr. Napier's party, after a journey of forty days from Fort Garry, Red River Settlement.\n\nI am happy to be able to state that Mr. Dawson arrived at Fort Garry on the evening of the 8th October. I delayed my departure until the 9th, in order that I might see him, and thus be able to afford the testimony of an eye-witness respecting his recovery. I regret, however, to have to say that he has endured much suffering, and is greatly reduced, but with a fair prospect of speedily regaining health and strength. I also visited the Rev. Mr. McDonald, of Islington Mission, Winnipeg River, who accompanied Mr. Dawson to Fort Garry. From him I learned that some day after my departure for Red River, in search of assistance, Mr. Dawson's illness increased; he became deaf, blind, and senseless; a looking glass put before the mouth was not dimmed, and all hope of recovery was given up by those around him. Subsequently a change for the better took place, and as a last resource, Mr. McDonald brought an Indian \"medicine man,\" who bore an excellent reputation among his tribe for his skill in the use of herbs, to see him. The Indian \"medicine man\" administered his specifics, and so far effected a cure that in a few days Mr. Dawson was able to sit up; and eventually became sufficiently strong to bear the fatigue of a canoe voyage from Islington Mission to Fort Garry. With care and attention, under the direction of the medical officer in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, it is to be confidently hoped that he may soon be able to resume his duties.\n\nSince the date of my last report I have visited,\n\n1st. The Assiniboine River, for a distance of seventy miles in a straight line from Fort Garry.\n2nd. The Reed Grass or Rousseau River, as far as the dead water of that river, at its junction with the swamp leading to Reed Grass Lake.\n3rd. Big and Little Rat Rivers, and the Reed Grass River, as well as between Rat River and Fort Garry.\n4th. The Red River Settlement, as far as the Indian Mission north, and Pembina on the 49th parallel south (100 miles).\n\nIf the following scheme of a general report on my department of Red River Expedition meets with your approval, I shall be able to furnish on my return to Toronto the several sections in the order and at the times mentioned below.\n\nREPORT, &c.\n\nPart I.\u2014Topography of the Route.\n\nSection 1.\nFort William, Lake Superior, to Fort Francis, Rainy Lake.\n\nSection 2.\nFort Francis, Rainy Lake to Indian Settlement, Red River via west side Lake of the Woods.\n\nThese two sections to be accompanied with a topographical sketch or map of the whole country traversed, including Red River to the 49th parallel, the Assiniboine River to Prairie Portage, Reed Grass River to the dead water of its feeding and lake, Little and Big Rat Rivers, some of the ancient beaches of the Lake Winnipeg, in the valley of Red River, and the whole of Red River Settlement.\n\nThe foregoing sections and the topographical sketch or map, on a scale of two miles to one inch, can be furnished by the 12th of December.\n\nSection 3.\nRed River Settlement, the Assiniboine River, as far as the Prairie Portage, and its settlement.\n\nSection 4.\nFort Garry to Pembina, the Reed Grass River, the Little and Big Rat Rivers.\n\nThese sections can be furnished by the 1st of January.\n\nPart II.\u2014Geology of the Route.\n\nSection 1.\nGeological sketch of the country between Fort William, Lake Superior, and Fort Alexander, at the mouth of the Winnipeg River.\nSection 2.\nGeological sketch of Red River valley, from the 49th parallel to Lake Winnipeg.\n\nSection 3.\nEconomic materials met with during the explorations.

These may require a longer time than I am at present aware of; and in view of the labour involved in preparing the topographical and geological reports, I beg permission to name four months from the time of my arrival in Toronto as the limit within which this part of my report will be prepared for your inspection. I propose to accompany the journal with sketches of the Hudson's Bay Company's forts on the route of exploration, the chief waterfalls, outlines of scenery, and sketches of implements of husbandry, &c., &c., used by the people of Red River.\n\nI am compelled to remain for two or three days at St. Paul, until the arrival of my baggage from Crow Wing, but I hope to be in Toronto on Thursday or Friday next (the 4th and 5th of November).\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY YOULE HIND, M.A.\nThe Hon. the Provincial Secretary,\nToronto, Canada.\n\nGeologist and Naturalist, Red River Exploring Expedition.\n\nRossin House, Toronto, December 5, 1856.\n\nMemorandum in reference to Professor Hind's remarks in his letter to the Rev. Robert McDonald, dated Fort Garry, Tuesday, Sept. 8, 1857, which have only now come under my notice.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Sept. 5, as the canoes were ascending the Red River, I landed at my daughter's house, which is five or six miles distant from Fort Garry, and remained there for the night. The gentlemen of the expedition party being directed to proceed on with the canoes and encamp near the fort. On Sunday morning at nearly 11 o'clock, Mr. Wells, (Mr. Dawson's chief assistant,) called on me (he was on horseback) with a note sent by Mr. Dawson, acquainting me with the Professor's arrival at Fort Garry the previous night. Mr. Wells was immediately directed to procure at the Company's fort, if to be had, all the items which he named to me as being considered necessary for Mr. Dawson, and to prepare a canoe to start as soon as possible with those supplies, intimating at the same time my doubts whether the canoe men, just come off a long voyage, could be prevailed on to leave the settlement so soon, particularly on Sunday.\n\nI was at the fort at 10 o'clock on Monday, when I consulted Dr. Bum, the Company's medical officer, who considered it unsafe to send medicines without seeing the patient, and having a better knowledge of the true nature of the case.\n\nI then went to the camp, and found that Mr. Wells, Professor Hind, and Mr. Napier had one and all declined to assume the responsibility of sending off the canoe. I again directed Mr. Wells to have the canoe prepared, pointed out the men to be sent, and ordered the requisite provisions for them; but notwithstanding these repeated directions, it was late on Tuesday morning before the canoe, under the conduct of Mr. Gaudet, (another of Mr. Dawson's staff,) was ready, and took his departure from the fort. The detention, as regarded the men, I found to be caused by their having occasion for shoecleather and clothing out of the Company's shop, and which they could not obtain elsewhere, particularly on Sunday.\n\nThe Professor does not say that he considered the crisis of Mr. Dawson's illness to have passed before he left him, although I observe he expresses to Mr. McDonald \"a hope that Mr. Dawson is\n\"fast recovering?\" Neither does he say it was expected that Mr. Gaudet would meet Mr. Dawson on his way to the settlement.\n\nIt is unnecessary to make further remark on this matter, except to say it required no \"effort\" to see me as I was at no greater distance than Dr. Bunn's consultation room, within half a minute's walk of the expedition camp, and that I do not clearly see how I could have been \"repeatedly urged\" upon the necessities of the case by Messrs. Napier, Wells, Gaudet, and others! if, as the Professor says, I could not be found.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nRossin House, Monday, Dec 7, 1857.\n\nI beg to return thanks for the perusal of the reports relative to the Red River expedition, which were kindly placed in my hands on Saturday, and beg further to draw attention to the remarks made by me in the margin.\n\nI remain, &c. &c.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nTo Edmund A. Meredith, Esq.,\nAssistant Provincial Secretary West, &c.\n\nSir,\n\nPort Hope, Dec 7, 1857.\n\nI have the success of the scheme for opening out communications with the Red River Settlement so much at heart, that although I know your time at this particular juncture is fully occupied in making arrangements of more immediate importance, I cannot refrain from addressing you a few words, called for in my opinion by the circumstances in which we, of the Red River Expedition, are placed.\n\nIn the first place, I beg to represent the necessity of sending a trustworthy messenger to the Red River Settlement as soon as possible, with remittances and with instructions to Messrs. Napier and Dawson for their future guidance.\n\nAs preparations require to be made during the winter for successfully carrying through the works of the next year on the line of communication, I beg further to say, I am prepared to undertake the task of making the Portage Roads, and improving all the water courses between Lake Superior and Red River, provided I am allowed to select my own staff of working assistants, and that sufficient means are placed at my disposal; also, that I have power and authority as an agent of Government to treat with the Indians for the surrender and occupation of such lands as may be needful for the purposes in view.\n\nI would suggest that arrangements be immediately made for a supply of boats adapted to the navigation of shallow waters. Such boats to be ready for delivery at Fort William, on Lake Superior, early in May next. That provisions and other supplies for the use of the parties now employed and for those hereafter to be engaged, be prepared during the winter, in packages adapted for the carrying over the portages, and that foremen and men accustomed to road making and bush work be sought out during the winter, and engaged in the spring for active service.\n\nIt is very desirable that all the lands between Fort William and the Mountain Portage should be surveyed and lotted out, and, as an inducement to its being immediately occupied by immigrants, that the system of free grants should be extensively acted upon. The soil on the banks of the river appears to be tolerable fertile, and although wheat has not been raised there, in consequence of all the present cleared lands being too much exposed to the fogs of Lake Superior, it is scarcely doubted that grain may be cultivated with success on lands but a short distance from the lake, when the country is laid open. Looking at all the sites north of the frontier line at Pigeon River, this appears to me the nearest and most eligible place for forming an extensive settlement, and when such settlement is formed it will aid very much in filling up the whole of the interior country wherever advantageous locations can be found.\n\nA monthly mail would be a great boon to the Red River population, and can very easily be carried by canoe from post to post during the summer season.\n\nIn the winter the carriage of mails would be difficult and interrupted, except it were undertaken by the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company stationed on the north shore of Lake Superior. The expense would not be very heavy, indeed my impression is, it would nearly, if not entirely, be defrayed by the postage on letters and newspapers.\n\nI have deferred sending in the report which I had prepared on the 3rd ultimo, immediately after my return to Toronto, under the expectation of receiving the reports of the gentlemen who accompanied me on the expedition. I have now been favoured with the perusal of the reports forwarded by those gentlemen to the several departments, and beg reference more especially to that of Professor Hind, who best describes the general features and products of the country through which we passed.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nTo the Hon. the Provincial Secretary, Toronto.\n\nSir,\n\nToronto, November 3, 1857.\n\nOn the 8th September I had the honour to address you from Fort Garry, Red River Settlement, acquainting you with the progress of the Expedition party under my direction, our several positions at that time, and my views in regard to operations during the winter season.\n\nI delayed my departure from the settlement until the 15th September, hoping that Mr. Dawson's health would have been so far re-established as to admit of his rejoining us at that date. Unfortunately, however, this was not the case, as on the 21st I found that gentlemen yet confined to his bed at the Islington Mission Station, and entirely unable to discuss with me the affairs of the Expedition. Mr. Gaudet, who had been sent from the Red River in a large canoe with supplies of provisions, and\nwith instructions to remove Mr. Dawson as soon as possible within reach of medical assistance at the settlement, was at the station awaiting his convalescence. All anxiety concerning Mr. Dawson is now happily removed, as Professor Hind brings information that he (Mr. Dawson) had reached the settlement, and that there was every prospect of his restoration to perfect health in a short time.\n\nI beg to annex copies of the letters addressed by me to Messrs. Napier and Dawson before I left the Red River Settlement relative to the affairs of the expedition.\n\nOn the 27th September I arrived at Rainy Lake on my return towards Canada. Here I met again with exceedingly contradictory reports respecting the chain of rivers and lakes forming the water communication with Lake Superior on the route followed by the North West Company of Canada previous to the year 1803. Having passed several times over the Kaministiquia route, and our party having obtained a knowledge of all the difficulties and obstructions presented on that line, I determined on a personal examination of this \"Old North West Route,\" in order to arrive at some conclusion that would be more satisfactory than any to be deduced from the information I had hitherto obtained.\n\nI accordingly engaged an Indian guide, and leaving Rainy Lake on the 30th September branched off on the Kamakum Lake at the point where the northern and southern lines of routes separate. Thence to the Lake Seignanagock, which I reached on the evening of the 3rd October. I found the whole line of communication to be very good indeed, being a succession of small lakes connected by small streams and sixteen small portages, all easily improved, and which on the aggregate do not occasion much more than two miles of land carriage.\n\nBetween the Lake Seignanagock and the shore of Lake Superior, where I arrived on the afternoon of the 7th October, we encountered the chief difficulties and obstructions that are met with on this route.\n\nThe height of land dividing the waters which flow into Lake Superior from those which run towards Lake Winnipeg and Hudson's Bay is short and steep, the small streams exceedingly shallow, and the seventeen portages over which we passed are long, rugged, and hilly, amounting on the whole to about sixteen miles of land carriage.\n\nIn a direct line the distance from Lake Seignanagock to Lake Superior appears by the map to be about forty or forty-five miles, passing over United States' territory. From the same point to the Kaministiquia River the distance is about sixty miles. Here the country is so imperfectly known that we cannot form any opinion whether a communication is practicable, either by water or land, and I regret exceedingly that the season was too far spent to admit of my determining this interesting point. As far as I can learn from the Indians who hunt over that part of the country there are lakes and rivers which may be made available as channels of communication, and to these it is very desirable we should direct our first attention in commencing the work of next summer. In the meanwhile I have instructed my son and assistant, Henry Gladman, whom I left at Fort William for that purpose, to explore during the winter, as far as may be practicable, the whole tract of country between the Seignanagock and Dog Lake. We shall thus be fully prepared, in the month of May next, to commence the active work of opening out this part of the road in the direction that may be deemed most suitable, and that work will be very much facilitated by the previous knowledge of the country which we shall have obtained.\n\nThe whole difficulty at the eastern end of the line of communication lies within the compass of a few miles, and in my opinion a choice is to be made between a road of about eighteen or twenty miles (that is to say, from Lake Superior to Dog Lake, and a road to the Sagenagack or Arrow Lake, the length of which is not at present known to us), and in fact can only be ascertained by a careful examination.\n\nHaving casually heard that a road had been commenced recently between the shores of Lake Superior and \"Saxton\" and the head waters of the Pigeon River, I thought it advisable to gain some certain knowledge on this point. I accordingly directed my course thither, and landing at Saxton on the 17th October found a small party there clearing land, but there was no appearance of any road making. I am since assured such a work is in contemplation and will be undertaken next year.\n\nThe season being very far advanced and the weather becoming more and more tempestuous I proceeded from Saxton to Superior City, and there taking advantage of a propeller bound to Cleveland I embarked on the 23rd October with the whole of my party for Detroit, and arrived at Toronto on the morning of the 28th.\n\nThe detailed reports, plans, and sections to be furnished by the gentlemen who have accompanied me on this expedition will show that the whole chain of rivers and lakes between Fort William, on Lake Superior, and Fort Garry on Red River, following the Kaministiquia route, as indicated by my letter of instructions, has been as fully surveyed as the season and circumstances permitted. Time did not admit of so complete an examination as we could have wished, nevertheless much information has been acquired that will be useful in carrying on the operations of next year.\n\nUpon reviewing the Kaministiquia route the impression on my mind is that to make it available for the purposes of commercial communication and colonization, the most feasible plan of operations will be to make a road from the \"Current River,\" on the shores of Lake Superior, to the Dog Portage thus avoiding the shallow and circuitous waters of the \"Kaministiquia,\" with all its numerous falls and portages; thence improve the Portage Road and streams as far as Rainy Lake; then make a road from the Lake of the Woods to the Red River instead of passing by the Winnipeg River. So far as we know at present this latter road will be from 90 to 100 miles in length, through a wooded country for the greater part of that distance; but on these points information will be given during the winter by the gentlemen whom I have left at Red River for the purpose of fully exploring that large tract, and early in spring they will be prepared to follow any course that may be directed by instructions from Toronto.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Red River Settlement feel so much interested in opening out this road of communication, that I am well assured they will promptly assist, as soon as the direction of the line is determined upon. Many of them have passed frequently over the tract, and their information and co-operation will be exceedingly valuable.\n\nIn our intercourse with the Indians who hunt over the country adjacent to the \"Rainy Lake\" and \"Lake of the Woods,\" we have found them very unwilling to afford correct information respecting it.\nThey are strongly opposed to any colonial settlement on their lands, and look with distrust on the movements of surveying parties, whose operations they apprehend will result in the total extinction of their native claims, and the loss and destruction of their fisheries. We experienced this feeling of opposition in the case of the small party which I detached at Fort Francis with instruction to proceed by the Red River to Fort Garry. The guide whom I had engaged to accompany the gentlemen sent on that service, instead of directing the route along the shore of the \"Lake of the Woods\" to the entrance of the Red River, as he should have done, led the party to the \"Plantation Island,\" where he well knew there was a large encampment of his own people. Arrived there the guide at once quitted the party. Messrs. Dawson and Hind found it impossible to engage another to take his place, and were consequently obliged to relinquish the object for which they had been detached. It appears to me that in following out the proposed plan of opening out this road of communication it will be necessary to treat with the Indians for the disposal of that portion of their land which lies in the line of route. I do not apprehend that there would be any difficulty in making an arrangement when the objects which the Government have in view are clearly understood; but it will be requisite that full explanations be given, and such a treaty made as will prevent all opposition or collision hereafter. That it is in their power to interrupt any chain of communication that may be formed cannot be doubted, and as they have already shown themselves to be exceedingly tenacious of their right of soil, I am of opinion our only course will be to make an amicable arrangement with them, by which free commercial intercourse with the Red River Settlement may be permanently secured. They raise no objection whatever to parties passing by the Winnipeg or the Rainy Rivers, these, as themselves say, are open to every one, but the occupation or possession of the soil, without previous treaty or agreement, and without any view of establishing a trade with them, is what they are most decidedly opposed to.\n\nWith reference to the future course of the expedition party which the Government did me the honour to place under my direction, both Mr. Napier and Mr. Dawson having received their instructions, under seal, direct from the Governmental Departments to which they were respectively considered as attached, and their reports having been transmitted in like manner to the several offices for which those instructions were issued, I do not see how I can efficiently direct or control those operations, or how any benefit can accrue to the expedition from my being only nominally at its head. Nevertheless I feel it incumbent on me to say that some steps require to be immediately taken, to meet the expenses of the eight gentlemen left by me on the Red River Settlement with the view of continuing the exploration during both winter and spring, and of the one gentleman left at Fort William for a similar object. Contracts and arrangements were made by me for the supply of a quantity of provisions sufficient for the winter use of the several parties, but a remittance of funds to cover the amount of those expenses is indispensable.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Garry, Red River Settlement, September 10, 1857.\n\nBeing now about to return to Toronto by canoe, I, in accordance with my instructions, beg to direct your attention to the examination of the country that lies between the Red River and the Lake of the Woods, as far south as the British boundary admits.\n\nI have been informed that there is a line of farm land on which a good cart road may be made, and that there is a good water communication for small canoes at a certain season, (between the points I have indicated,) but the statements made to me are so conflicting and contradictory that nothing but actual exploration can determine whether these things be so or not.\n\nI am persuaded that both yourself and Mr. Dawson will see the importance of determining these points, and that on consultation together, when his health is re-established, you will act with entire unanimity, and carry the exploration to a satisfactory result.\n\nOn the opening of the navigation in spring, you will be able to continue your surveys eastward towards Rainy Lake. I anticipate you will there find all requisite supplies for after operations about the 25th June or 1st July; but on this point you will most probably receive, in the interim, full instructions from the Canadian Government.\n\nHaving at length succeeded in renting houses for your accommodation, and in making contracts for the provisions you require until June next, I leave the settlement under the full conviction that everything will be done by you that is possible, to accomplish the ends the Government had in view in sending out the expedition.\n\nI remain, &c.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Garry, Red River Settlement, September 12, 1857.\n\nSince you left here, Mr. McTavish, for reasons which it is not necessary I should mention, considers it would be better that whatever cash I have to leave for the expedition should be in the hands of yourself or Mr. Dawson.\n\nIf the money I leave with you should be insufficient to meet your wants before you receive remittances from Canada, Mr. McTavish is kind enough to say he will assist the expedition with funds, as far as lies in his power, until such time as your own shall arrive. This is the only arrangement I can make at the present moment, and will, I am persuaded, meet all the requirements of the expedition.\n\nThe best men of the settlement being absent in the boats on the York factory voyage, I would recommend that none be engaged until they arrive. Wages here, in the winter season, are very moderate, say from \u00a31 sterling per month upwards to \u00a35 sterling. It therefore appears to me you would do well to be in no haste to engage men, but occupy the present time in delineating the work already done between Fort William and this place, and in preparing the reports and plans which it is requisite should be sent to the Government by the hands of Professor Hind.\nI also recommend that you send a list of all such supplies as you may think may be required to be forwarded from Canada to Rainy Lake next spring; and that you keep regular and accurate accounts of the expenses of the expedition in the settlement.\n\nI shall engage a canoe builder to make canoes at Rainy Lake: in the meantime, I leave you one of the \"north canoes,\" which we had on the voyage, and a small canoe brought here by Professor Hind. If more are required, you will probably obtain them from the Indians at the Indian settlement.\n\nMr. John Rowand has engaged to give the expedition the use of four horses as long as may be required.\n\nDogs and appointments for winter travel can only be obtained at a later period in the year.\n\nI enclose a copy of the list of provisions, &c., which Mr. McDermot has engaged to furnish the expedition. This, however, does not include what you may require for extra men or for your voyage to Rainy Lake in June, such as hams, pork, biscuit, &c. I therefore recommend that you make an early estimate, and endeavour to have them on hand, so that you may experience no inconvenience for want of supplies in May or June.\n\nProvisions of all kinds being at the present moment held back throughout the settlement, in expectation of the arrival of the troops, allow me to recommend economy in your expenditure.\n\nI remain, &c.\n\nW. H. E. Napier, Esq.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nMemorandum for Mr. Henry Gladman at Fort William.\n\nEndeavour to ascertain the precise character of the country between the mouth of the Current River and Dog Portage, and from Point Meuron to the same place. Go over the ground, and see whether a cart road can be made from one point or the other, or from both.\n\nAlso the character of the country from Point Meuron (or thereabout) to \"Whitefish Lake,\" and whether any communication can be opened so as to fall in upon the old north-west route above the Grand Portage, or beyond the height of land.\n\nIn the spring, when snow-shoe travel is good, endeavour to ascertain what the track is from Lake Superior to Arrow Lake, and whether a cart road can be made there or not.\n\nIf Fort William people can be engaged, secure wood for repairing the Swampy Portage.\n\nIf the season permits, clear and widen the Portage road in the Kaministiquia, and enlarge the landing places. The spring of the year will be the best time for this work.\n\nMore particular instructions will be sent by the earliest mail from Toronto.\n\nFort William, October 13, 1858.\n\nFort Garry, Red River Settlement,\nDecember 8, 1857.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report upon the Hudson's Bay canoe route from Fort William, Lake Superior, to the Red River Settlement, together with accompanying plans and sections.\n\nThe plans have been projected from track survey, delineating the features of the rivers, lakes, and creeks followed, their relative positions, and the obstructions which occur in each, from which it is hoped a sufficient idea of the route, and its suitableness or otherwise for improvement, may be formed, upon which to base future operations.\n\nThe sections have been plotted from actual levels taken at all the principal breaks, and from careful estimates made of the rapids and currents, showing the heights of the different waters followed above the datum of Lake Superior.\n\nThe route may be divided into three sections:\n\n1st. From Lake Superior to the entrance of Rainy Lake, embracing the Kaministiquia River to the height of land, and the chain of lakes and rivers flowing into Rainy Lake.\n\n2nd. The Rainy Lake, Rainy River, and the Lake of the Woods to Rat Portage.\n\n3rd. The Winnipeg River, Winnipeg Lake, and Red River to Fort Garry, at the mouth of the Assiniboine.\n\nThe Kaministiquia River is the first link in the canoe route between Fort William and the Red River. Rising in the vast region of swamp about the height of land which divides the waters flowing from Hudson's Bay from those tributary to Lake Superior, it has a general downward bearing of south by east, and for a distance of forty-three miles from its mouth is exceedingly tortuous and broken by numerous falls, rapids, and shallows. It empties into the south-west angle of Thunder Bay, with a delta at its mouth, upon the northerly channel of which, and one mile from the lake, is situated Fort William, a post of the Hudson's Bay Company. The mouth of the river is surrounded by a narrow bar, where only five feet of water is found.\n\nFrom Fort William the river is sluggish and meandering, with width of five chains, and an average depth of six feet for a distance of twelve miles. At this point the rapid water commences, and continues to the foot of the Grand Falls Portage, a distance of 25-5 miles from the mouth. In ascending the river in canoes, these rapids are only overcome by poling, and the depth of water at these points (August 6th) did not exceed two feet, with rocky bottom.\n\nThe first regular portage is made passing the Kakabeka Falls, of 119 feet. It is four chains in length, rising abruptly from the water to a table-land, which continues to the head of the portage. From this point to Little Dog Lake there are nineteen falls and rapids. The falls are passed by portages, none of which, however, exceed eight chains in length. The rapids are here also ascended by poling the canoes or towing with a line from the shore.\n\nThe Little Dog Lake at the foot of Great Dog Portage has an elevation of 360-8 feet above Lake Superior, in a distance of 44-5 miles by the river. The country between this point and Fort William, to the north of the Kaministiquia, does not present any formidable obstacles to the construction of a road which, in a tolerably direct line, would reduce the distance by water one-third, and a great portion of the country in the neighbourhood of Fort William is available for settlement.\nThe Great Dog Portage leads from the Little Dog Lake to the Great Dog Lake, and is one mile and fifty-two chains in length; it has an elevation at its summit of 502 feet over the Little Dog. The river connecting these lakes bends away to the south of the portage road, and is one succession of cascades through rocky cliffs, with a total fall of 348 feet.\n\nThe Great Dog Lake is an extensive sheet of water, 708 feet above Lake Superior, and is followed by the canoe route for eight miles to the mouth of Dog River. The Dog River has a general width of three chains, and winds sluggishly through a low swampy country, timbered with poplar, pitch pine, and tamarack. For a distance of twenty-five miles from the lake the river, upon August 8th, maintained an average depth of four feet water, with mud bottom and banks. A small rapid of three feet fall here occurs, which is polled up, the baggage being portaged three chains.\n\nThe country becomes then more elevated to the north, with a larger growth of timber. At twenty-seven miles from the Dog Lake is the Portage du Jordain, of 8'60 feet fall, and six and a half chains in length. Above this fall the river resumes its sluggish character, until left by the canoe route, thirty miles from its mouth, where a small winding creek, a branch of the Dog River, is entered, bearing away to the south-west. The average width of this branch is ten feet, with a depth of two feet; it is followed for two miles, when a small lake is entered, the source of this creek. The shores of the creek and lake are low and marshy. At the western extremity of this small lake is the Portage de l'Eau Froide, of three chains in length, leading to another small lake or pond at the foot of the Prairie Portage.\n\nThe Prairie Portage of two miles and five chains forms the height of land, and is 887 feet above the water of Lake Superior. It is high and level, with sandy soil. The timber has all been destroyed by fire, and appears to have been spruce and little pine. A small lake of about a quarter of a mile in width forms the western extremity of this portage, and is the highest water level, from which the route now commences to descend in a westerly direction.\n\nThe Portage du Milieu, upon the opposite shore of this lake, is thirty-nine chains long; marshy at its approach, it rises in its centre, falling again at its western end, the Lac du Milieu, which is one mile long, and leads to the foot of Great Savanne Portage. The shores of this lake are low, timbered with spruce and tamarack.\n\nThe Great Savanne Portage is one mile and forty-one chains in length, through a low tamarack swamp. It is considered one of the worst portages on the route. In the days of the North-West Company, when the route was a thoroughfare and the outlet for the fur trade, this portage had been made passable by a pathway of longitudinal timbers; at present, however, these are in a state of dilapidation, and partially buried in the mire, serving only as stumbling blocks to the voyageurs staggering through under a load. There is abundance of timber in the neighbourhood, with which at trifling labour or cost a new roadway could be laid, and also sufficient fall to afford drainage into the Riviere d'Embarra, its western termination.\n\nLeaving the Savanne Portage, the canoe route now follows down the Riviere d'Embarra or Savanne River for a distance of twenty miles to its entrance into the Mille Lac or Lake of a Thousand Islands.\n\nThis river has an average width of three chains, and a depth of four feet water, but is in many parts almost impassable from the quantity of driftwood which has accumulated from time to time; this could, however, be removed with little difficulty, where the river would form a navigable reach in connexion with the Mille Lacs. The banks of the Riviere d'Embarra are muddy and low, timbered with pitch pine, spruce, and birch, much of which has, however, suffered from the ravages of fire.\n\nFrom the mouth of Riviere d'Embarra, at the Lake of the Thousand Islands, forms a navigable reach of twenty-three miles by the canoe route to the Portage du Baril, where it is left. It is an extensive sheet of water, stretched away to the north some thirty miles to its outlet; its shores are rocky timbered with pine, spruce, birch, and poplar.\n\nThe Portage du Baril of seventeen chains, over a rocky ridge, leads to the Lake du Baril, which is seven miles in length; it has a good depth of water, the shores rocky and rolling, timbered with pine and spruce. The Lac du Baril is left by the Brule Portage of twenty-one chains, which terminates upon the Cannibal Head, a chain of small lakes with short intervening narrows, some of which are shoal. These lakes discharge by a small creek from which the French Portage is made. The creek falls into the Lake Francis, the western end of French Portage, and at high water is navigable throughout. It is, however, much obstructed by small rapids and driftwood. The French Portage is one mile and sixty chains in length, over a succession of rocky ridges, with intervening swampy bottoms, and is accounted one of the most difficult portages on the route. Leaving the French Portage, there is a reach of eleven miles to the Portage des Morts, interrupted only by two short narrows where but three feet water is found. The Portage des Morts is twenty-six chains in length, and is rocky and uneven. Crossing the Dor\u00e9 Dalle Lake, the Portage des Deux Rivi\u00e8res is made, twenty-six chains in length, and having a fall of 117 feet to a creek at its western extremity; this creek is only one chain in width, but deep, and leads into the two Sturgeon Lakes, where a navigable reach of sixteen miles occurs.\n\nSturgeon River now forms the next link in the route. Immediately at its mouth is a rapid of four feet fall, passed by a discharge of eleven chains: a few chains of still water and second rapid, of 621 feet fall, are passed by a portage of three chains.\n\nContinuing on down the Sturgeon River, five small rapids are passed in the next seven miles, having in all a fall of eleven feet. Jauner Rapid, also called Mininis Falls, next calls for a portage, which is five chains in length; the river now becomes wider, with strong current, for four and a half miles to the Island Portage of two chains, passing a chute of ten feet. Narrows of two chains and four feet water occur at the mouth of Sturgeon River, which falls into Pine Lake, a deep reach of six miles and a half, discharging into the Macan River.\n\nContinuing down the Macan River, the route is next interrupted by the Snake Portage of five chains, and a fall of twelve feet; the river here has a width of four chains, and a current of two miles per hour.\nThree miles below the Snake Falls is the Crow Portage of nine chains, made on an island, below which the river is broken by short rapids and shoals, where two feet of water only is found. The grand falls of the Macan occur \u2014 miles below the Crow Portage, and are the largest upon the river, being sixteen feet perpendicular height. The approach to the portage from above is exceedingly dangerous, being made by the immediate head of the fall; it is six chains in length, rocky and uneven. Two miles below the grand falls are the long rapids, a succession of pitches and broken water, one mile in length, and having a total fall of ten feet. These rapids are run by experienced canoe men, but are dangerous at low water; the shores are low, rocky, and timbered with a small growth of spruce and poplar.\n\nThe Macan continues about four chains in width, and has a good depth of water for two miles to the Nameaukan Rapids, the last on the river; these rapids are fifteen chains in length, with a fall of seven feet, and are run, but considered unsafe except at high water; the shores are rocky, but level.\n\nThe route now follows the Macan for two miles, where the Nameaukan Lake is entered, skirting along the north shore of which for six miles and a half, we come to the Portages Nie, two in Nimsku, avoiding a detour to the south, by which the Nameaukan Lake discharges itself in the Rainy Lake. The first portage Nie is six chains in length, at the end of which a fall of 8.5 feet to a pond of ten chains in length, at the end of which the second portage of eleven chains leads to the entrance of the Rainy Lake.\n\nThe Rainy Lake now affords thirty-five miles of uninterrupted navigation to the mouth of the Rainy River, its outlet; it is an expansive sheet of water, studded with numerous islands, affording good shelter, and throughout its length there is a good depth of water.\n\nImmediately at the mouth of Rainy River is a small rapid which is run by canoes, and three miles further down are the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls of twenty-two feet, with a portage upon the British side of eight chains.\n\nOpposite these falls and situated upon a high bank is Fort Francis, a post of the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nFrom Fort Francis I made an exploration of the northerly route from the north-west angle of the Rainy Lake to the Rat Portage.\n\nThis is the winter road, and is preferred to the route by the Rainy River, as being more sheltered, and free from the long open traverses necessary in crossing to the Rat Portage from the mouth of Rainy River. From Rainy Lake this road follows a chain of small lakes and connecting creeks, with occasional portages, until the north-east corner of the Lake of the Woods is reached where the route continues through the numerous islands on the Rat Portage. The land throughout is rugged, rocky, and timbered with spruce and birch. A sketch of this exploration is shown on the plan accompanying.\n\nThe Rainy River is a fine stream with an average width of seven chains, affording an unembarrassed navigation for a distance of thirty-one miles from Fort Francis, where a small rapid occurs of two and a half feet fall, and seven miles further down another of three feet; these are the only interruptions to its course for a distance of seventy-three miles from Fort Francis to the Lake of the Woods. These rapids are caused by a contraction of the banks of the river, and could with little difficulty be removed. At present they are run by canoes, and have a fair depth of water.\n\nThe banks of the Rainy River are about fifteen feet above the water, timbered with poplar and white birch; the soil is sandy clay, which is reported to extend back from the river for a distance of ten miles.\n\nThe canoe route now continues through the islands in the Lake of the Woods for a distance, from the mouth of Rainy River to the Rat Portage of sixty-four miles. There is here a fall of sixteen feet, where the Lake of the Woods discharges by several channels into the Winnipeg River, and a portage is made of thirteen chains over a rock, at the foot of which is the Hudson's Bay Company's post. The Winnipeg River from the Rat Portage is wide, and bears more the appearance of a lake, being full of islands, but at nine miles it contracts to narrows, where the first rapid, the Dalles, of three feet fall are run.\n\nBelow these rapids the river again resumes its lake-like appearance for eighteen miles, to the second rapid of 5.5 feet, which are portaged, the canoes running light. The Yellow Mud Falls of twenty-two feet is next portaged five chains, followed by a heavy pitch at its foot of seven feet, and three-quarters of a mile further down in the River Portage of ten chains, passing a fall of eight feet. A small rapid next occurs, called the Cove, of four feet fall, which is run; and three miles lower down is the missionary station, Islington, about which fifty acres of land is under cultivation. To this point the shores of the Minipeg are rocky, barren, and covered only with a small growth of pine, spruce, and poplar timber.\n\nContinuing down the river from Islington thirteen miles is the De l'Isle Rapid of 3.4 inch fall, with a short portage of three chains. The De l'Isle is sometimes run, but is accounted dangerous from the heavy eddies at its foot.\n\nTo the Jocho Chute (a distance of twenty-one miles) the river is navigable, with a current of variable space; the Chute of Jocho is thirteen feet, and the portage five chains over a bare rock. With the exception of one small rapid of one foot, the river continues a distance of seven miles unbroken water to the head of the three Points de Bois falls of thirty-eight feet in one and a quarter miles, passed by a portage. The second portage is made from the immediate head of the fall, and is exceedingly dangerous to approach from above.\n\nThe river continues with an average width of 15 chains for 3.5 miles, when Slave Falls of 19.80 feet are portaged thirty chains.\n\nLeaving the foot of the Slave Falls (a reach of six miles) brings us to the Barri\u00e8re Chute of five feet, which is portaged three chains, below which the current becomes very strong for a distance of six miles, where the Otter Falls, of three feet, are run in descending the river.\n\nAt the foot of the Otter Falls, the Pinewa, a small branch of the Winnipeg, leads off to the north into the Lac de Bonnet. This branch is often used at high water in preference to the main river, as it is less obstructed by falls and has fewer portages; but when the water is low it is impassable for large canoes, which continue down the main river, here called La Rivi\u00e8re Blanche.\nThe Sept Portages (three miles below the mouth of the Pinewa) form the most dangerous and difficult portion of the Winnipeg River. With a total fall of 47.26 feet in a distance of about two miles, these portages are only passed with great caution. Owing to carelessness on the part of one of the guides, two canoes of this expedition were in imminent danger of being precipitated over these falls.\n\nThe river below the Sept Portages widens gradually into the Lac de Bonnet, which forms a navigable reach of eleven and a half miles to its discharge, where a chute of 7.30 feet, called the first Gala de Bonnet, occurs, and is portaged two chains over a rock. The second Gala de Bonnets, of five feet fall and four chains portage next follows; and three miles further down is the Grand Bonnet, of thirty-four feet fall, with a land portage of fifty-one chains. The Petit Roche de Bonnet, of 8.25 feet fall, passed by a portage of three chains, next occurs, one mile below the last; and three miles lower down are the White Mud Falls, of thirteen feet, portaged fifteen chains. Continuing on for 4.5 miles, we come to the Silver Falls (two in number), of 21.5 feet, and avoided by a portage of twenty-three chains.\n\nThe river has now a strong current for 4.5 miles to the Pine Falls, the last portage in the river, of twelve chains, with a fall of 8.35 feet. Below the Pine Falls the river becomes wider and a moderate current to Fort Alexander, five miles below the Falls, where the current ceases: two miles below Fort Alexander the river enters the Lake.\n\nThe portages upon the Winnipeg are all well cut out, being used regularly by the Hudson's Bay Company in bringing up their boats from York Factory with the supplies for their posts upon Lac la Pluie, Lac de Poisson Blanc, and the Rat Portage, but many of them are extremely dangerous to approach. The boats used throughout this part of the country by the Company are thirty feet long, with a light draft of water, and particularly adapted to the broken navigation of these waters, carrying loads of from two and a half to five tons.\n\nThe land upon the banks of the Winnipeg gradually improves after we leave the Silver Falls, and in the neighbourhood of Fort Alexander, about the mouth of the river, the soil appears of excellent quality.\n\nCoasting along the south shore of Lake Winnipeg, the canoe route enters the mouth of the Red River through an immense marsh, the river continues without any perceptible current, for nineteen miles, to the Stone Fort or Lower Fort Garry; and four miles above the fort are the Grand Rapids, of about one foot fall and two feet water: twenty-two miles from the Stone Fort is Upper Fort Garry, situated at the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers.\n\nThe total distance from Lake Superior to Fort Garry by the canoe route I estimate at 647 miles, viz.:\n\n| Route                                      | Distance |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| From Superior to the entrance to Rainy Lake |          |\n| East end of Rainy Lake to the Rat Portage  |          |\n| Rat Portage to Fort Garry                  |          |\n\nTotal distance: 647\n\nFrom the foregoing, it will be perceived that the main difficulties are encountered upon that portion of the route between Lake Superior and the Rainy Lake.\n\nThe formidable ascent from Lake Superior to the Dog Lake, by the Kaministiquia, and the broken character of the country about the height of land, points to the necessity of adopting a communication by road, the most favourable portion for which remains to be determined by further exploration. Many of the waters followed by the canoe route from the height of land to Rainy Lake (such as the Mille Lacs, the Cannibal Head, two Sturgeon, and Pine Lakes) afford long reaches of navigation in the line of direction required, but their connecting streams are for the most part tortuous, and impeded by rapids and shoals.\n\nTo determine the most eligible line of communication through this section, a thorough examination of the country between Fort William and the Rainy Lake would be requisite both by the north and south of the canoe route.\n\nNo reliable information could be obtained as to the nature of the adjoining country, as little is known of it; the route itself is seldom traversed, as is evinced from the fact that the portages are for the most part completely grown up with brushwood and scarcely traceable.\n\nThe Rainy Lake, from its eastern extremity to its discharge by the Rainy River, forms an interrupted reach of deep navigation. In the Rainy River but one break may be said to occur, viz., the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, near Fort Francis.\n\nThe small rapids occurring below are merely swift runs below caused by the contraction of the banks, and as both have a good depth of water they present no impediment to the navigation. The Lake of the Woods is navigable in all directions, and the numerous islands form good shelter for vessels.\n\nFrom the north-west corner of the Lake of the Woods, a direct line across the country to Fort Garry is estimated at 116 miles; this would avoid the long d\u00e9tour by the rapid and dangerous Winnipeg River.\n\nAlthough little is known of the nature of this country beyond a range of some forty miles eastward from the Red River, still there is every reason to expect that a direct and easily constructed road can be formed through. A party is at present engaged in exploring a line through from Fort Garry, and further operations are to be carried out in that direction, as soon as the necessary equipment can be procured.\n\nLeaving the distance from Lake Superior to Rainy Lake as estimated by the canoe route, the through distance will now appear as follows:\n\n| Route                                      | Distance |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Lake Superior to Rainy Lake                |          |\n| Rainy Lake to north-west corner of Lake of the Woods |          |\n| Road from north-west corner of Lake of the Woods to Red River |          |\n\nMaking the total distance: 502\nNo examination of Pigeon River was possible last season; whether, therefore, attention is to be directed to that route in the spring or to the country between Rainy Lake and Fort William remains to be determined by further instructions.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed) W.

Settlement,\nDecember 10, 1857.\n\n(Signed) W. H. E. Napier.\n\nSir,\n\nAs such a length of time has elapsed since the date of my last report, I beg to state, in explanation, that I was detained for some weeks at the Winnipeg River by illness, having caught a fever which had been prevalent among the canoeemen for some time previous, and that since I came here there has been no suitable opportunity by which a report, with the necessary plans, could have been sent to Canada.\n\nI have now the honour to report that the party under my directions are engaged in exploring the country between this place and the Lake of the Woods; but before referring more particularly to their operations, I would respectfully submit to your notice a brief report on the country through which we have passed, describing the route as it now is, and, explaining the manner in which I think the communication between Red River and Lake Superior could be most effectually and economically opened up.\n\nWe came by the usual canoe route from Fort William, following the Kaministiquia, the Rainy, and the Winnipeg rivers.\n\nThe principal difficulties on this route are to be met with, in the first place, on the Kaministiquia River, between Lake Superior and Dog Lake; in the next, between the Lake of a Thousand Lakes (Lac de Milles Lacs) and Rainy Lake, and, again, between the Lake of the Woods and Lake Winnipeg.\n\nThe Kaministiquia for ten or twelve miles upwards from Lake Superior has a smooth course; rapids then occur in close succession, for ten or twelve miles further, to the Grand Falls, but canoes can be either towed or poled up these with tolerable facility. Within the next ten miles the river makes a descent of about three hundred feet, forming many serious obstructions to the navigation, with but short intervals of quiet water between them. On this portion of the route there are numerous portages, half portages, and rapids which render the ascent of canoes extremely tedious and difficult. After this there is a short reach of quiet water to the Great Dog Portage. There the river makes a descent of three hundred and forty-seven feet, in the short distance of a mile and seventy-three chains. This is the steepest portage on the route, the summit of the ridge over which it passes being five hundred feet...\nabove the level of the water at the lower end. Arrived at Dog Lake, the distance from Lake Superior, by the windings of the Kaministiquia, is about forty-six miles, while in a direct line from Thunder Bay, on that lake, it is only about twenty-four miles. It will at once occur that the rough and rocky Kaministiquia would be best avoided by making a road direct from Thunder Bay to Dog Lake, which would then be within half a day's drive of Lake Superior, instead of its taking nearly five days to reach it, as it did us by the Kaministiquia, although we were tolerably well mannered but lightly loaded.\n\nThrough Dog Lake the water is deep, and from thence to Jourdain's Rapid, a distance of about twenty-five miles, Dog River winds through a marsh, on either side of which the land rises to a considerable elevation. In this distance only one little rapid occurs, about three miles below Jourdain's, where there is a fall of three feet six inches. The fall at Jourdain's is eight feet six inches. Here the route diverges from Dog River, and for two miles follows a small brook, which is so narrow that the willows which fringe the margin on either side almost meet over it. Above this there are three small ponds, which, taken together, are scarcely a mile in length. The last of these ponds is called \"Cold Water Lake,\" and it has usually been regarded as the source of the St. Lawrence.\n\nThe rise from Dog Lake to Cold Water Lake, I estimate at about eighteen feet. A dam, therefore, of sufficient height, thrown across the outlet of Dog Lake, would have the effect of converting the marsh, through which, as just explained, Dog River winds, into a lake, and thus rendering the navigation easy between the road which should cross from Thunder Bay and the Prairie Portage. Nor would the dam have the effect of flooding a great extent of country, for the lands about Dog Lake are high, as they likewise are on either side of the lake just referred to.\n\nBetween Cold Water Lake and the Savanne River there are three portages, namely: the Prairie Portage, which crosses the dividing ridge between Cold Water Lake and the waters which flow towards the Winnipeg; the Middle Portage, separated from the former only by a pond; and the Savanne Portage, about a mile from the Middle Portage. The entire distance from Cold Water Lake to the Savanne River being about five miles. The country here is densely wooded, and the ground is in every respect favourable for a road. The Savanne Portage does not pass through a morass as is usually supposed but through an ordinary swamp, with about two feet of black earth over a bottom of hard clay, and having a fall of thirty-one feet eight inches in the distance of a mile and a half.\n\nFrom the Savanne Portage, by the present route, there is a reach of forty-four miles, interrupted only by a little flood-wood in the Savanne River; but if the Lake of a Thousand Lakes and its discharge could be followed to the first rapids, there would then be a navigable reach of about seventy-four miles in a direct line, or eighty-four miles by the windings of the river and lake. The canoe route, however, diverges from the Lake of a Thousand Lakes at Baril Portage, and thence follows a chain of small lakes to the Maligne, or Nameaukan River, which flows into Lac la Croix, which again empties itself into Rainy Lake. Between these lakes the portages are long and difficult, and in the Nameaukan River there are many rapids and falls. Returning again to the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, the river which flows from it, according to the information we have from the Indians, discharges itself into the north-eastern arm of Rainy Lake, as shown on the accompanying plans. The distance between the two lakes is only about sixty miles in a direct line, but the river has never been followed as the canoe route, on account of the length of some of the portages. If a road could be made past the impediments, however, it would be the most direct route to Rainy Lake, and advantage would be taken of the long navigable reach in the Lake of a Thousand Lakes. The exploration of the stream which flows from this lake, as I shall presently explain, is a part of the work which we have in contemplation for the present winter.\n\nThrough Rainy Lake, and from thence by Rainy River and the Lake of the Woods to Rat Portage, in a distance of 164 miles, there is no impediment to the navigation except at Fort Francis, where a short portage has to be made past the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, where there is a descent of twenty-two feet in a distance of seven chains. From the Lake of the Woods to Lake Winnipeg, the distance, according to our estimate, is over 160 miles by the windings of the river, and the difference of level about 369 feet. The Winnipeg is a river of immense volume, not much inferior in size, I should say, to the Ottawa, and the approach to the portages, and whirlpools, and eddies below them, are, in some cases, not unattended with danger. In this long distance, however, there are many smooth reaches, varying from four to twenty-five miles in length, as will be seen on reference to the accompanying table of levels and distances.*\n\n* Vide p. 48.\n\nFrom the mouth of the Winnipeg to the mouth of Red River, the distance, through Lake Winnipeg, is about forty-five miles, and from thence to Fort Garry, at the mouth of the Assiniboine, about thirty-six miles. By this circuitous route, the total distance from the Lake of the Woods to Fort Garry is not less than 240 miles, while in a direct line from Fort Garry to Lac Platte, from which place to the Lake of the Woods, if I am correctly informed, there is no impediment, it is only ninety-six miles. A land road, therefore, over this distance would be a great improvement on the present route, inasmuch as the dangerous navigation of Lake Winnipeg, and the numerous portages and rapids on the Winnipeg River would be avoided, and the distance shortened by at least 140 miles; and although the distance would still be great for a land road, it must not be lost sight of that the means of transport are to be had here in abundance; the people of this settlement esteem it but a light thing to travel immense distances over the prairies in carts in search of buffalo, and in summer they go in the same way to St. Paul's, distant from this place, as the road winds, over 600 miles. This is an important consideration in estimating the advantage of a road from Fort Garry to the Lake of the Woods.\n\nThe length of land and water carriage from Lake Superior, by the route which I have thus imperfectly sketched out, would be nearly as follows:\u2014\n\n| Route                                      | Distance |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| From Lake Superior to Dog Lake             |          |\n| Through Dog Lake and to Cold Water Lake    |          |\n| From Cold Water Lake, over the Prairie, and past the Middle and Savanne Portages, to the Savanne River\u2014land carriage |          |\n\nF\nFrom the Savanne Portage, by the river of the same name, and through the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, to the rapids below its western extremity\u2014water carriage ........................................... 84 miles\n\nFrom these rapids to Rainy Lake the distance is about sixty miles, but this part of the route is not yet explored; however, from the information we had from the Indians, it would be safe to allow two-thirds of the distance to be navigable, say, therefore\u2014land carriage ......................................................... 20 \"\n\nAnd\u2014water carriage ............................................................................... 40 \"\n\nThrough Rainy Lake, by the river of that name, and the Lake of the Woods, to the head of Lac Platte, interrupted only by the falls at Fort Francis, navigable for .................................................. 160 \"\n\nFrom Lac Platte to Fort Garry, allowing for curves, say\u2014land carriage ......................................................... 100 \"\n\nTotal distance ........................................................................................ 469 miles\n\nof which 150 miles would be by land, and the remaining 319 miles by water; the distance by the present route is not less than 635 miles, so that in this respect there would be a great saving.\n\nReturning again to Lake Superior, and regarding the Kaministiquia apart from the numerous falls and rapids which embarrass its course, the water at its mouth is so shallow, as not to admit the approach of vessels drawing over three feet, while in Thunder Bay, the water is of sufficient depth, and where, moreover, it is said, there is an excellent harbour sheltered by an island. This point, however, can be determined on reference to Captain Bayfield's charts, which I have not with me. If I am correct in supposing that the depth is sufficient, the advantage of having the terminus of the road where vessels of all sizes would approach it and lie in safety, taken in connexion with the shorter distance, will be a powerful argument in favour of having the road to cross from Thunder Bay, instead of following the more circuitous route of the Kaministiquia.\n\nI shall now, for a moment, suppose the communication opened as proposed, and that merchandise is about to be sent through from Lake Superior to the Red River Settlement. In the first place, it would be necessary for those engaging in the forwarding business to have a depot at the terminus of the road in Thunder Bay, and to maintain there the horses, oxen, and outfit necessary for the land transport. A like outfit would be required at the prairie carrying place, and at the carrying place or places which it might be necessary to have between the Lake of a Thousand Lakes and Rainy Lake, the number of horses and oxen at the respective stations being of course proportioned to the length of the road.\n\nThe next carrying place, at the Falls at Fort Francis, has been already alluded to as the only break in a reach otherwise navigable of 160 miles. If a considerable trade were established, it would, no doubt, be found advantageous to construct locks at these falls, but until such is the case, the portage being only 150 yards in length, over even ground, the present mode of transport can involve no great difficulty.\n\nFor the next and last carrying place, from the Lake of the Woods to Red River, no provision would have to be made, inasmuch as it would have its terminus, as already stated, where the means of transport are to be had in abundance, and where, moreover, an active and vigorous population are seeking an outlet for their produce, and a means of communication with the rest of the world. There are merchants now in this settlement who keep boats, and contract with the Hudson's Bay Company for the conveyance of articles from York Factory, and I have no doubt that, were the route opened, they would be equally ready to contract with the Canadian merchants for the transport of their goods from Lake Superior. At all events, they might easily bring them from the head of Rainy Lake, provided, as they are, with the horses and carriages necessary for the land transport, and with boats for the water carriage.\n\nThe terminus of the road on Lake Superior being accessible from every port in Canada, it would not be difficult to maintain horses and oxen there, neither would it at Prairie Portage, inasmuch as, in the first place, it is only thirty-five miles from the road which should reach Dog Lake, and, in the next, as the land carriage would be but short, but few would be required. It will at once suggest itself, however, that at the carrying place or places between the Lake of a Thousand Lakes and Rainy Lake, the situation being remote from the resources available at either end of the route, it would not be so easy to provide forage for cattle, but this difficulty would not be so formidable as it may appear at first. Rainy Lake is not so far from Lake Superior,\u2014there would be navigable water with only one break for nearly two-thirds of the distance, and all that would be required would be an occasional boatload of oats, the country would afford good pasturage, and wild hay could be had in abundance.\n\nThe next point to be considered is the sort of vessels that could be most advantageously used in the navigable reaches. Boats such as the Hudson's Bay Company have for the transport of articles from York Factory to the interior of the Continent would, perhaps, be the best, inasmuch as they are so light that they can be easily drawn over a portage, and of such capacity that they carry about four tons, while the cost of their construction is only about \u00a325l. or \u00a330l. In the long navigable reaches, larger boats might, no doubt, be used with advantage, and in the transport of merchandise a great saving would be effected by having a relay of them at every carrying place, as the Hudson's Bay Company have at the Methy Portage on the route to the Mackenzie River.\n\nHaving thus explained the manner in which I conceive the communication could be most advantageously opened up, it is but proper that I should endeavour to convey some idea of the cost of the undertaking; but, until further exploration takes place, any estimate that can be made must be regarded as the merest approximation. The country from the Lake of a Thousand Lakes to Rainy Lake is but little known. The present route between these Lakes is objectionable on account of the frequency of the portages and the shortness of the navigable reaches; rather than follow it, it would be better to have a land road, say sixty miles in length, all the way through but this would not be necessary, for, according to the information which we have, the discharge of the Lake of a Thousand Lakes is navigable throughout the greater part of its course, but the precise extent to which it is so can only be determined on further exploration. There remains also to be considered the route from Pigeon Bay, which has not yet at all been explored, with a view of\nascertaining its fitness for a line of communication. It has, however, been very accurately surveyed by the Boundary Commissioners, and on reference to Mr. Thompson's map, it will be seen that it has the objection of frequent portages, with but short navigable reaches; all the way from Lake Superior to Rainy Lake there is no such unbroken reach as that through the Savanne River and the Lake of a Thousand Lakes. It has, moreover, the disadvantage of being on the United States' frontier, and having many of the portages on the United States' territory.\n\nApart from this, however, until it is explored, it would be premature to offer any positive opinion regarding it. But to return to the question of cost, in reference to the route which I have ventured to propose, and which, I think, from what is yet known of the country, will be the one eventually adopted, and to begin with the line which we are now exploring, to the Lake of the Woods, to which place a road will be required, whatever route may be ultimately selected from Rainy Lake to Lake Superior. If the ground should not prove more difficult than we have found it so far,\u2014and the party is now half way through,\u2014a good road could be made at an outlay of \u00a3225 per mile, that is, an earth road, about twenty-four feet in width, well grubbed, thoroughly drained and properly rounded, with log bridges over the brooks. Should it occur, however, that large streams are to be crossed, and we only hear of one, the Broken Head River, an additional estimate would have to be made for bridges. From Rainy Lake to the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, the country, so far as we could observe it, or ascertain its character, is favourable for a road; it is neither very swampy nor very hilly, and I think that the same estimate of \u00a3225 per mile would be ample for the extent of land road that might be necessary. From the Savanne River across the height of land to Cold Water Lake, a distance of five miles, a like sum per mile would be sufficient. From Dog Lake to Thunder Bay the country is hilly, but not more so than some of the districts through which a road has been made, within the last few years in Lower Canada. Here, however, a large allowance would have to be made, inasmuch as a considerable amount of grading would likely be necessary. I should, therefore, say for this part of the route \u00a3400 per mile.\n\nThe stream which rises from Dog Lake being but small, a dam of sufficient height to flood the narrow marsh through which Dog River winds to a navigable depth might be constructed at an outlay of, at most, \u00a32,000.\n\nAccording to this estimate, which, however, is made from very imperfect data, the total sum required to open the route as proposed would be nearly as follows:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Cost (\u00a3) |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| One hundred miles of land road from Red River Settlement to Lac Platte, between which and the Lake of the Woods there is supposed to be no impediment, at \u00a3225 per mile, would amount to | \u00a322,500   |\n| Twenty miles of land road, allowing that so much would be required, between Rainy Lake and the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, at \u00a3225 per mile, would amount to | \u00a34,500    |\n| Five miles across the height of land from the Savanne River to Cold Water Lake, at say \u00a3225 per mile | \u00a31,250    |\n| Twenty-eight miles from Dog Lake to Thunder Bay, the country being hilly allow, say, \u00a3400 per mile, which would amount to | \u00a311,200   |\n| To build a dam across the outlet of Dog Lake, say | \u00a32,000    |\n| To clear away the flood wood in the Savanne River, and cut down the overhanging trees, say | \u00a3250      |\n| Add, for the bridging of considerable streams throughout the line, say | \u00a32,500    |\n| Allow to complete the surveys and to have the line thoroughly located in the most advantageous ground | \u00a37,500    |\n\nTotal | \u00a351,575 |\n\nThis is a large sum of money, but the advantages which the Province would derive from opening the communication would soon afford an ample compensation for the outlay; it requires no argument to prove this, when it is considered with what vast regions it would be the means of establishing an intercourse, what a field for colonization it would open up, and what a trade it would in the course of a few years pour through Canada.\n\nIt has been urged that, as this was once the route of the great Canadian North-West Company to their trading establishments in the interior of the Continent, and that as it was then an highway of a great traffic, all that is required now is to put the carrying places in the same order as they were in at that time. But this is a mistake: the route was not suited then, any more than it is now, for the purposes of a general commerce. Heavy articles could not be transported over it, and the enormous profits of the fur trade alone enabled the company to sustain the cost of the conveyance of light ones. On the other hand it would be easy to suggest a mode of opening the communication, which, could it be carried out, would be more perfect than that which I have proposed, although not so economical. Thus, a system of canals or railroads all the way through may appear at first sight to be a feasible project; but it must be borne in mind that the country between Lake Superior and Red River, although well adapted for settlement throughout the greater part of its extent, is as yet but a wilderness, and until settlement has advanced, and emigration taken this direction, to the vast and fertile prairies of the West, I conceive that it would be premature to entertain such schemes.\n\nAs the adaptation of the country on this route for settlement is a very important point to be considered in connexion with opening the communication, I trust I shall not be considered tedious, if I endeavour to convey as clear an idea on this head as I possibly can. To begin at Lake Superior, the lower part of the valley of the Kaminitiqua, that is, from Fort William upwards to the Grand Falls, is unquestionably, well adapted for settlement. The country is comparatively level, and to judge from the growth of wood and the luxuriance of the vegetation when we passed, the soil must be good. There is already an Indian settlement at a bend of the river a short distance from Fort William. Here the\nRev. Mr. Chon\u00e9 has established a mission and built a commodious church. This gentleman has spent many years in the country, and from him we obtained much valuable information in regard to the climate and soil. According to his observations, the Kaministiquia never freezes over sooner than the 3rd, nor later than the 18th of November, and seldom breaks up earlier than the 23rd of April.\n\nThe soil where the Indians are settled he describes as not being very good, on account of its being too low, but further up the river he said the land was better, and well adapted for the growth of cereals. From the Kakabeka, or Grand Falls, upwards to Dog Lake, the river is very rough, and its shores in general broken and rugged; although the soil here is not well adapted for settlement, large quantities of white pine are to be seen occasionally, which, sooner or later, must become a valuable article of commerce; and those who settled on the river lower down would have the prospect of profitable employment in preparing it for the market during the winter months, when their farms demand less of attention.\n\nAbout Thunder Bay, I am inclined to think a settlement could be formed, and from thence by the road which should cross to Dog Lake; if, on exploration, the land should prove suitable, I do not think the climate would be found unfavourable. About Dog Lake, and from thence westward, for more than a hundred miles, to the lower extremity of the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, the country is at a considerable elevation, and the climate must be rather cold. The heights of this part of the route, allowing Lake Superior to be 641 feet above the sea level, are as follows:\n\n- Dog Lake, above Lake Superior, 704 feet; above the sea, 1,345 feet.\n- Pond at west end of Prairie Portage, 874 feet; above the sea, 1,290 feet.\n- Lake of a Thousand Lakes above Lake Superior, 823 feet; above the sea, 1,464 feet. In this high region the winters must be rather severe, and yet the growth of timber would not indicate a very cold climate, while the soil, more especially about the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, is apparently of good quality. At the carrying places settlers would no doubt find it their interest to establish themselves, but it is questionable if many would remain on the most exposed part of a route which led to more favoured localities.\n\nBetween the Lake of a Thousand Lakes and Rainy Lake the country appears to be greatly cut up with small lakes; indeed, so much is this the case, that it would be difficult to say whether it would be better described as land intersected by numerous lakes, or as one great lake with ridges of land running through it. On descending towards Rainy Lake, however, there is a very perceptible and evident change in the climate; the maple, elm, and oak begin to appear, the vegetation becomes more rank and luxuriant, and although the country is broken there are many fine situations where settlers might establish themselves with advantage, and there are those who would find a great inducement to do so, in the fact that the country abounds in game, which is but little hunted, and the lakes in fish of the finest description. Rainy Lake is so full of islands, and there are so many deep bays and indentures on the Canadian side, that it is difficult in passing through it by the canoe route to obtain a view of the main land. From all we can learn, however, there can be no doubt that there are many places favourable for settlement. This lake is on a lower level by 404 feet than the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, which partly accounts for the remarkable difference which evidently exists in the climate of the two.\n\nAnother reason may be found in the fact, that Rainy Lake lies in a sheltered valley, with a broad extent of high land to the north about the lake, and at many places before reaching it, there are extensive forests of pine, which, considering the vast extent of unwooded prairie country to the west, must at some period become the staple of considerable commerce.\n\nAt Fort Francis, two miles below Rainy Lake, the Hudson's Bay Company have a farm, where we saw wheat and potatoes growing to perfection. Mr. Pether, the gentleman in charge of the establishment, informed us that, in regard to climate, he considered the country much the same as Montreal, of which place I understood him to say he was a native, only that he believed the winter at Fort Francis to be a little colder.\n\nRainy River, which forms here the boundary between Canada and the United States, is a magnificent stream, varying from 150 yards to a quarter of a mile in width, and flowing with a winding course through a valley of deep alluvial soil. The banks rise from the height of thirty to forty feet, with a gentle slope to the river, while back of that the country is apparently level. The prevailing growth of wood is poplar, as in the rich alluvial soil at Red River, but the balm of gilead tree is abundant, and elm in many places line the margin of the stream. As this is the finest country for settlement on the route, I shall here, with your permission, transcribe an extract from my journal, in which I have described it more at length:\n\n\"23rd August 1857.\u2014Start at daybreak, and continue our course down Rainy River. There is no change to note in the appearance of the country; the broad river glides on between banks, which on either side are clothed with forests of the most luxuriant green, broken only, as yesterday, by an occasional little Indian clearing, of which the artichoke and wild oats have taken undisputed possession. About 8 a.m. we run a little rapid, on the north side of which there is an extensive old clearing, with two mounds like little pyramids, evidently raised at some period by the hand of man. We ascend one of these, which may be about forty feet in height, with a breadth of 100 feet at the base. It is covered with a rank growth of weeds and wild oats, and asking the Indian guide for what purpose such mounds had been raised, he replied that long ago a hostile tribe had penetrated into the country, and that the mounds were erected as earth houses (they go by that name in Indian), where the warriors of this tribe had sheltered their women and children. It is probable that they may have been erected as works of defence, for they overlook the river at a narrow point, where there is a rapid. It is possible, also, that they may be the burying-places of past generations of Indians, whose history has been forgotten by their descendants. On landing to dine to-day, I went a few miles into the woods, and found the soil of the richest description, growing poplar and balm of gilead trees of a very large size. We camp in the evening on a sandy point, the first we have seen growing red pine. The distance we have come to-day cannot be more than forty miles; such an extent of rich land without a break, or a country so well adapted for settlement, I have seldom seen. Rainy River does not seem subject to great floods; the trees on the bank grow within a few feet of the water as it now is; four feet over the present level, I should think the greatest height to which it ever attains. It is said, however, that it is sometimes as much as three feet lower, so that there may be a difference of six or seven feet between extreme low and high water.\"\n\"24th August 1857. Start at 20 minutes to 5 a.m., and breakfast late at the entrance of the Lake of the Woods; then set out on the Grande Traverse, find the lake covered with a sort of green scum or vegetable substance, which thickens as we proceed; at four miles from shore, try the temperature of water six inches below the surface, and find it to be 77\u00b0 Fahrenheit; also measure the depth, which we find to be 35 feet; at 10 miles from shore, sink the thermometer two feet below the surface, and find the temperature to be 71\u00b0 Fahrenheit, while the depth at the same distance is 36 feet, with a muddy bottom; at half-past 4 p.m., we reached a small island, where we dine, having made the Grande Traverse in four hours and forty minutes; there was not a breath of air as we crossed, and the cloudless sun beat down on the tepid water with great intensity. Notwithstanding the motion occasioned by the paddling, the thermometer in my canoe, and being in the sun, rose to 120\u00b0. After dinner we proceeded on our course to Garden Island, now in sight. Clusters of beautiful islands appear to our right, some of which seem to be fertile, while others, on the contrary, are rocky and sandy, growing white pine, cypress, and poplar. In the evening, we camped on Garden Island, where we saw considerable fields of Indian corn, and where the Indians informed us that they had cultivated the land from time immemorial, and that they had never once known an instance of their crops being injured by frost. This should be rather conclusive as to the climate being not unfavourable to the growth of corn of all kinds. On the following day we were detained for some time by a strong gale of wind, which prevented us from leaving the island, and, on its abating a little, we had a visit from a large war party of Indians, who were encamped on an island not far distant. They came to question us as to our right to travel through their territory without asking their consent; but as the character and habits of these people has to be considered at some length, I shall not at present interrupt the subject under consideration, by alluding further to the interview we had with them.\"\n\nFrom Garden Island to Rat Portage it is seldom that a view of the main land can be obtained. Islands appear at every turn, in a continuous labyrinth, which none but experienced guides could find their way through. These islands are in some cases covered with pine, while in others they are rocky and bare, or partially wooded. All accounts, however, agree in representing the main land as being in many places well adapted for settlement.\n\nFrom Rat Portage downwards, by the Winnipeg River, for about thirty miles, to the White Dog Island, the country appears somewhat hilly and broken; there are, nevertheless, occasional places where settlements might be formed with advantage. At the White Dog Island, there is the Indian Missionary establishment of Islington, in charge of the Rev. Mr. M'Donald, of the Episcopal Church. At this gentleman's house I was detained by illness, until the 1st of October, and had in consequence a good opportunity of observing the progress of the season. The first frost which affected the colour of the foliage in the least occurred on the 22nd September; up to that time the most delicate plants were untouched. Mr. M'Donald has a small farm, on which he grows wheat, potatoes, and a variety of articles, and several Indian families have settled beside him, who also cultivate the land for some extent, and with success.\n\nBetween Islington and Lake Winnipeg, the shores of the river and the islands are in most cases rocky, and on approaching Lake Winnipeg, the climate becomes evidently colder. The prevailing growth of timber in this long distance is poplar, but oak and elm are to be seen occasionally, and also balm of gilead, a species of poplar, which invariably indicates a good soil. Much of this extensive country is, no doubt, well fitted for settlement; but it will be observed that the route which it is proposed to open, does not follow the course of the Winnipeg, but stretches across from the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods to the Red River Settlement. This tract, so far as we have yet explored it, in point of soil, is not inferior to most other parts of Canada.\n\nTo recapitulate, the country about Thunder Bay and in the lower part of the valley of the Kaministiquia may be regarded as in every way suited for a considerable settlement. The high region again, across which the route lies for about a hundred miles, from Dog Lake to the western end of the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, may be cold, but there is nothing in the growth of the wood, or in the appearance of the soil, to indicate that it is not also, in many places, suitable for settlement. However, the climate is better on the western slope of these high lands between the Lake of a Thousand Lakes and Rainy Lake.\n\nAbout Rainy Lake and from thence to Rainy River and the Lake of the Woods, following from the latter place the proposed route across to Red River, the country is, I think, as well adapted for settlement as any other part of North America. The climate is good, the soil in general fertile, water power is to be had in abundance, and in the woods there are many valuable kinds of timber. This, of itself, is a country of considerable extent; the distance from the head of Rainy Lake, by the proposed route, being about two hundred and sixty miles, and yet it is but small and insignificant when compared to the vast region with which the road would open a communication.\n\nThe Red River Settlement, of which I shall now endeavour to convey some idea, commences a short distance above Lake Winnipeg, and follows the Red River for about fifty miles. At Fort Garry this stream is joined by the Assiniboine, which flows from the westward. Up this river a continuous settlement extends for twenty-five or thirty miles, and from thence there are occasional houses to the Grand Portage, which is about seventy-five miles from Fort Garry. The population, by the last census, was 7,000, but this, I believe, does not include the settlement at the Grand Portage, nor a small settlement on a stream called the Seine, which joins the Red River from the eastward. Neither does it comprehend a large number of Indians who encamp here in summer, nor a population of half-breeds, who follow the customs of their Indian ancestors, and live on the produce of the chase, without any fixed habitation, but who, nevertheless, regard Red River as their head quarters.\n\nThe soil throughout the settlement, and far beyond it in the prairies, is a rich alluvial deposit. But the extent of land under cultivation is not great in proportion to the population; nor is it to be wondered at, seeing that the settlers have no market for their surplus produce. They seem all, however, to have a great many horses and cattle, and there is scarcely a limit to the number they might keep, as hay and pasturage can be had to any extent in the prairies.\n\nIn other respects the settlement is far advanced; churches are to be met with at intervals, and there are several educational establishments, and a library. The importance of this little flourishing colony cannot be overrated, when considered in connexion with the great prairie region beyond it. It will\nform a nucleus from whence settlements may spread in every direction; and it is at the commencement of what might be made, and will doubtless become, a great system of water communication. The Red River is navigable from this for a long distance to the south, beyond the United States' boundary. To the north there is no interruption to the further end of Lake Winnipeg. The Assiniboine, which drains a great extent of the finest prairie land, is navigable for several hundred miles to vessels of light draught. The stream which flows from Manitoba Lake is navigable, and from Manitoba, I believe, there is no interruption to the Winipigoos Lake.\n\nThe Saskatchewan, which gathers its waters from a country greater in extent than the vast region drained by the St. Lawrence and all its tributaries, from Lake Superior to the Gulf, is navigable by either the north or south branch for more than a thousand miles of its course, with the single exception of a few rapids near its confluence with Lake Winnipeg. So mild is the climate on the south branch of this great river that the Indians hunt the buffalo on horseback all winter, and so little snow is said to fall that snow shoes are seldom used.\n\nThat the extensive territory drained by the Saskatchewan and its tributaries is fit for settlement, in as far as regards climate, is fully proved by the success which attends the farming operations which are carried on, although on a small scale, at the various trading posts throughout the country, and by the fact that the cattle and horses at these establishments are generally left to forage for themselves during the winter.\n\nAs regards the soil, from what is yet known of the country, there is not perhaps on the globe so great an extent of territory so little broken by barren tracts. It is said indeed, that there are plains of drifting sand in some places, between the two great branches of the Saskatchewan, but the extent of these can only be ascertained on exploration.\n\nRegarding the territory, however, in its general aspect, there is not in the universe a finer field for colonisation. It has a salubrious climate, and the soil in many places, as at Red River, is unsurpassed in fertility. Iron ore, coal, and salt, these indispensable articles to the wants of a community, are to be found in abundance, and the whole territory, from Lake Winnipeg to the base of the Rocky Mountains, is intersected by navigable rivers and lakes.\n\nHaving thus briefly and imperfectly described the country with which is proposed to open a communication, I would respectfully invite your attention to the necessity of coming to some understanding with the Saultaux Indians, who inhabit the country about Rainy Lake and the Lake of the Woods. These people are well informed as to the object of our visit, and they have conceived the idea (to some extent reasonably enough) that the opening up of the communication and colonization of the country would deprive them of their hunting grounds, and, impressed with this conviction, they threaten to stop us even in carrying on the surveys and explorations, and indeed they have done so in one instance already. I have alluded to an interview which we had with a large party of them at the Lake of the Woods, I shall now, with your permission, describe it more particularly, as it will inform you in some measure as to the character of these people, and the views which they entertain. Before leaving Fort Francis it had been arranged that Professor Hind, the chief of the geological branch of the expedition, and I, should cross the country from the Lake of the Woods to Red River. We accordingly provided ourselves with two small canoes, each manned with two men, one of whom was an Indian guide engaged for the occasion. In the meantime we had been informed that a war party of the Saultaux were out against the Sioux, with whom they are constantly at feud, and that it was probable we should meet them, as we were going by the route which they usually follow on such excursions. Having encamped on Garden Island, in the Lake of the Woods, we were detained during the greater part of the following day by a gale of wind, which prevented us from leaving it. In the meantime our guide had conversed with some Indians, and they carried the intelligence of our arrival to the party just referred to, who were encamped on an island some miles off. In the morning sixteen painted warriors made their appearance, and told us that their chiefs desired to see us on their island, in order to learn from us the reason and the object of our visit. This invitation we declined, at the same time making the messengers a present of some tobacco, and such little articles as we could spare. Our reply was sent back to the chiefs, but most of those who had come remained with us, squatting themselves about the camp fire and talking of various subjects. A little after noon, the wind having somewhat abated, we observed thirteen canoes quitting off from the island where the main body of the party was encamped, and as they approached Professor Hind and I arranged that he should keep notes of what took place while I conversed with the chiefs, through the medium of one of the men, who was an excellent interpreter, and quite familiar with their language. When the Indians arrived they drew their canoes on the shore, and coming up to our tent seated themselves in a semicircle about the fire. I do not think I ever saw a finer body of men: they were tall, some of them over six feet, and well formed, and they had a free, easy, and independent air about them, very unlike the subdued bearing of the Indians in the settled parts of Canada. With the exception of the principal chief they all had their faces painted in every variety of colour, in which, however, black and red were the predominant. They were evidently arranged in their best attire, most of them having hawks' feathers in their hair, which again was painted and tied with ornamented bands, except the scalp lock, which was painted red, and left free. Some of them were completely dressed, while others had only on a pair of embroidered leggings, with a blanket thrown carelessly about their naked forms. The principal chief alone, an aged man, wore no paint or ornament of any kind.\n\nWhen they had all squatted themselves, I sat down in front of them, and after the pipe of peace, which, with them, is always a preliminary to discussion, had been smoked, the old chief rose, and said, \"What brings the white man to our country?\" I replied that we were travelling by order of the Canadian Government, and that we were on our way to Red River. He then said, \"My children\u2014those you see about you are my children\u2014have desired to have a conference with you; I leave them to speak for themselves.\" Another chief then spoke, and, alluding in the first place to the deeds of their ancestors, asked us if we had seen a grave at the Great Falls, and said that that grave was the resting place of a mighty chief who had conquered all this country; that they were all descended from him, and that he had left them the woods and rivers as an inheritance, which they would sooner lose their lives than relinquish. He then taxed us very pointedly with our want of courtesy, in sending expeditions to the right and the left, in short wherever we chose, through their territory, without even so\nmuch as coming to consult them or ask their consent; and concluded by saying that we must go by the old route. I replied that we had no wish to interfere with their privileges; that the director of the expedition had been pressed for time when he passed, but that I had no doubt he would make a point of seeing them when he came again; and then appealed to them, whether, as Indian chiefs and warriors, they should not rather forward the stranger on his way, than thus to stop him when they beheld him powerless. This had evidently a great effect upon them, for they consulted and argued a good deal among themselves before replying; another chief then spoke, and said that they all regretted very much the necessity of stopping us from going by the way which we had intended, but that they had made up their minds, and could not alter their decision; they saw what befell the Indians in other lands\u2014a few white men first examine the country and its productions; others come after them, and the result always was, that the Indians lost the land, and the country which they had inherited from their fathers; he concluded by saying that we must go by the route which the white man had hitherto followed. It would be tedious to detail everything that passed in a conversation which lasted more than two hours. I argued the point with them in every way that I could think of; but they were very acute, and always ready with a reply; we tried the effect of presents, and said that if they sent two of their young men with us as guides, we should send them home with a quantity of tea and tobacco, and whatever else they might reasonably fancy. This they haughtily refused, saying that we might keep our presents, and reiterating that, as they were all of one mind, nothing could induce them to alter their decision. I then said to them, that as they had denied us the privilege of going the way we had intended, the least they could do was to furnish us with guides, to go by the Winnipeg, as we were totally unacquainted with the route. Upon this the old chief at once indicated two young men, whom he at once ordered to accompany us; they obeyed with alacrity, and were ready for the journey in a few minutes, and I must say that it seemed to afford the whole party the greatest pleasure to have it in their power to oblige us in one way, after having thwarted us in another. During the conference they were grave and silent, only one speaking at a time, and although, if they had been evilly disposed, they were the stronger party, they treated us throughout with the utmost deference and respect. The conversation or rather council once over, however, they crowded about the tent, and became quite friendly and familiar; one old chief made us promise that we should never come to the Lake of the Woods without going to see him on his island. We then divided the remainder of our tobacco among them, and after a friendly smoke they all shook hands with us, wished us a prosperous journey, and departed.\n\nAs the tribe to which these Indians belong inhabit a considerable part of the country which it is proposed to open, it becomes a matter of importance to learn their character, and ascertain the manner in which they may be best conciliated. This branch of the tribe, as I learn from a clergyman who has spent many years in a vain attempt to convert them, numbers about 800 warriors or hunters; but they are spread over an extensive country, and except in summer, when the fish is abundant in the lakes and rivers, they cannot collect in large numbers; they are the remnants of a very old and once powerful tribe, whose chief had his residence at Rainy Falls, and held sway from Sault Ste. Marie to the confines of the great prairies. They are generally accounted to have been among the bravest and most warlike of the Indian tribes, until that fearful scourge of the Indian race, the small-pox, reduced them to their present diminished numbers. They are still proud of their traditions, and very sensitive as to any encroachment on what they conceive to be their rights, and they still adhere pertinaciously to their old customs and ceremonies; every attempt to convert them to Christianity has failed, except in the case of Mr. Mc'Donald, at Islington, who has a congregation of about fifty, and Mr. Chron\u00e9, at Lake Superior, who has also a small congregation. But these latter can hardly be accounted as belonging to this branch of the tribe, for they never meet them in council, and have but little communication with them.\n\nIn dealing with them therefore, it must be borne in mind that they are still the same barbarians that they ever were, and that, although they are perhaps among the most intelligent of the Indian tribes, and have many good traits of character, they are uncertain in disposition, and like all savages, ready to resort to violence on but slight provocation.\n\nThe United States Government, as I understand, has purchased from the same tribe a tract of land at the Grand Portage, for which they pay them a yearly sum in the shape of presents, and this I think would be the best way of dealing with the Indians at Rainy Lake and the Lake of the Woods. A tract of, say, ten miles in depth might in the meantime be taken up along the whole route, and if for relinquishing so much, they were paid in yearly presents of the articles they most value, such as blankets, tobacco, powder, shot, &c., they would find it their interest to offer no opposition to the operations which it might be necessary to carry on. In the meantime I think the surveys can be carried out by keeping up a friendly intercourse with them. Just before the close of the navigation I had a visit from another Saultaux Chief, who lives in the direction of Pembina. He came attended by sixteen followers, all of whom had their faces painted yellow, with black streaks down across the throat and cheeks. On introducing himself, he said that he had heard of the strangers from Canada, and that he had come such a long journey to bid them welcome to the country. I immediately got him and his party some refreshments, and when they had partaken of these gave them some trifling presents, when they went off, as I since learn, mighily pleased with their reception.\n\nWith regard to the operations which are now being carried on, two of my assistants, Mr. Gaudet and Mr. Russell, with a well-organized party, are exploring the country between this place and the Lake of the Woods; and in order more effectually to accomplish this, they are running a line direct across, on either side of which they examine the ground as they proceed. This line is now opened for more than half the distance through, and so far the only serious obstacle to making a road that has been met with is a morass about thirty chains in width, which, however, can be avoided by making a d\u00e9tour. My chief assistant, Mr. Wells, has been aiding me for some time past in compiling the Map which I send with this report. He will now be engaged for a few weeks in surveying the country from Fort Garry by the Red River and Winnipeg Lake to the mouth of the Winnipeg. When this survey, with the line to the Lake of the Woods, is completed, and connected with the survey of the Boundary Commissioners from Lake Superior, the geography of this part of the country will be accurately established. When the work now in hand is completed, we shall endeavour to explore the country between the Lake of a\nThousand Lakes and Rainy Lake. With regard to the accompanying map, the canoe route from Lake Superior to Rainy Lake is laid down from a sketch which I took in passing through. The Nipigon River, the stream entering the head of Black Bay, the two main tributaries of the Kaministiquia, Fish River and the Matawin, together with the upper tributaries of Dog River and the lower part of the Lake of a Thousand Lakes, are from Indian charts; from Rainy Lake to the lower end of the Lake of the Woods, the plan is reduced from the boundary survey, while the Winnipeg River and Lake to the mouth of the Red River are from a sketch taken by Mr. Wells.\n\nThe annexed statement of levels can only be regarded as a close estimate, except where, as stated, actual measurements took place.\n\nMy assistants, Messrs. Wells, Gaudet and Russell, have all exerted themselves to forward the objects of the expedition to the utmost of their ability. Mr. De Salaberry, the bearer of this, although attached to another branch of the expedition, has been very energetic, and has rendered us all the most valuable assistance, and he now undertakes the long journey to Canada with the greatest alacrity. I have, therefore, much pleasure in recommending him to your favourable notice.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nThe Hon. the Commissioner of Crown Lands, &c. (Signed) S. J. DAWSON.\n\n---\n\n**LEVELS of the Kaministiquia and Winnipeg Rivers, by the Canoe Route, from Lake Superior to Lake Winnipeg.**\n\n| No. | Distance | Rise in Feet | Height above Lake Superior |\n|-----|----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n|     | Miles    | Chains       |                           |\n| 1   | Estimated rise from Lake Superior to lower end of Kakabeka or Grand Falls Portage:\u2014 From Lake Superior to the first rapid on the Kaministiquia River, the rise is supposed to be 4 inches per mile, and the distance about 12 miles.\u2014 Dist.

J. DAWSON.\n\nGeorge Gladman, Esq.,\nDirector Red River Settlement,\nHon. Provincial Secretary's Office, Toronto.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with your memorandum of instructions, transmitted to me by the director of the Red River Expedition, I beg leave to submit to your notice through him, for the information of the Government, the following report on the progress which, with the aid of the party under my charge, I have made in the exploration of this part of the country since the date of my last report.\n\nThe accompanying rough sketch, which is hastily made up from the field notes, shows the position of Lac Plat, and the character of the region explored between that lake and the Red River Settlement.\n\nIn its general aspect the country is flat, presenting an appearance of an almost uniform level, with but slight elevations. It rises, nevertheless, though gradually and almost imperceptibly, to an elevation of nearly 400 feet above the level of Red River; and as there must be everywhere a sufficient fall for drainage, the prevalence of marshy ground, as indicated on the map, can only be accounted for on the assumption that the surface soil rests on a bottom impervious to the absorption of water, which, indeed, we have found to be generally the case where we have dug down in the low grounds.\nThe exploratory line which, as explained in the report just referred to, I conceived it expedient to run in the first instance, is represented on the plan by a black dotted line; while the line dotted in red indicates the route which, on a critical examination, was found to be the most favourable for a road.\n\nThe total distance from Fort Garry to Lac Plat in a direct line is eighty-six miles; from the Rapids Church it is eighty-three miles and a half; and by the route it is proposed to follow as the line of road, ninety-one and a half. By the latter route thirty-one miles and a half would be over open prairie, and sixty miles through a wooded country. Wheeled vehicles can already be driven over the prairie with facility, except in very wet weather, and the wooded portion of the route is in every way favourable for a road. From the prairie to the White Mouth River, the soil is good, consisting, in general, of a dark loam, mixed with small angular pebbles of limestone. For some distance to the eastward of that river the country is of the same character. It then becomes more marshy, and on approaching Lac Plat, the growth of timber indicates a poorer soil. The whole region having been swept at no distant period by fire is not heavily wooded; and, as is usual in such cases, the prevailing growth on the higher grounds is poplar, while in the lower, cypress and spruce predominate.\n\nOn the worst part of the line between White Mouth River and Lac Plat there is not over four miles which can properly be called swamp, and even where the ground partakes of that character, it presents no serious obstacle to the construction of a road, for beneath the surface coating of vegetable mould, the subsoil is either of a stiff clay, or coarse sand mixed with waterworn pebbles, as will be seen on reference to the annexed extract of a letter from my chief assistant, Mr. Wells, who spent nearly two months in examining the country to the east of the White Mouth River.\n\nIt will be seen, on reference to the map, that a line drawn from the Rapids Church to Lac Plat, would pass nearly parallel with the east branch of White Mouth River. It therefore appeared to me to be advisable to examine the country between the rapids and the point of confluence of the east with the main branch of that stream, and also to ascertain whether and to what extent the east branch was navigable. This route was accordingly examined, but on exploration it was found to be unfavourable throughout a considerable portion of its extent. A beautiful wooded country of the richest land conceivable extends for about twenty-five miles eastward from the rapids, but on approaching Broken Head River, the ground becomes marshy and maintains that character to the White Mouth River, the east branch of which, near its confluence with the main stream, is too rough to be available for either boat or canoe navigation.\n\nFailing in finding a suitable line of communication by this route, I directed the explorations to the south, and in as far as regards the discovery of ground suitable for a road, with the most satisfactory result. The route indicated on the plan by the red dotted line, whether as regards economy of construction, the gentleness of grades that would be necessary, or the general adaptability of the land bordering on it for settlement, is, I may say, all that could be desired for a line of road; and the ground is throughout so even that a railroad will be easily constructed when colonization shall have advanced so far as to render such a work necessary.\n\nBy actual measurement the distance from Red River to the monument erected by the Boundary Commissioners at the north-west angle of the Lake of the Woods is less by sixteen miles than it is represented to be on the maps with which we were provided; so that assuming the position of the monument to be accurately established by careful astronomical observation, too great a longitude by about twenty-one minutes has been assigned to Red River. The mistakes to which this error has led we will be enabled to correct when the surveys and explorations now in progress are completed.\n\nIn my report of the 18th December I mentioned that the Indians who inhabit the country in the direction of the Lake of the Woods objected to surveys being carried on in their territory. When we had reached White Mouth River with the line, they sent us a haughty summons to stop our operations, and commanded the Indians who were in the party to leave us under pain of incurring their serious resentment. This summons we disregarded, but most of the men who were with us, taking alarm, left. I replaced them with others on whom I thought I could rely, and continued the work. In the meantime some of our party went through to Lac Plat, where they saw several Indian families. At first they met with a cold and sullen reception; gradually, however, the Indians became more friendly, and ere the survey was completed they rendered us the most valuable assistance in pointing out the direction of the streams and the position of the marshes and dry grounds. Some of them even came to visit me here, and when our people were withdrawn, they parted with them apparently with as much regret as they had evinced displeasure at seeing them in the first instance.\n\nIn carrying on the explorations two small parties were employed; one under the direction of Mr. Wells to the eastward of White Mouth River, and the other under Mr. Gaudet between that stream and this place. On the 3rd instant, having completed the surveys in as far as they could be accomplished during winter, both parties came in. By the 8th I had them again equipped and sent Mr. Gaudet to scale the Red River and Lake Winnipeg to Fort Alexander, and in this service he is now engaged. On his return he will scale Red River to the boundary line at Pembina, noting the points of confluence of the Roseau, Rat, and other tributary streams. Mr. Wells is now on the Assiniboine, having been despatched at the same time to make a cursory survey of that river for 200 miles or so to the westward, or as far as the season will permit. These surveys will be attended with but an inconsiderable outlay, Mr. Gaudet having only three men with him and Mr. Wells but two, with a train of dogs.\n\nImmediately on the breaking up of the ice I shall, in conformity with the instructions transmitted me by the director of the expedition, examine the Rat and Roseau Rivers; but after this service is completed there will still be an interval of some time, which can be employed in further exploration before Mr. Gladman can arrive from Canada: I would, therefore, respectfully recommend the expediency of occupying this time in exploring in the direction of the Manitoba and Winipegoos Lakes. The country bordering on these extensive sheets of water is represented as being admirably adapted for settlement, and presenting as they do such an extent of inland navigation it is of importance to ascertain whether the stream which connects them with Lake Winipeg is also navigable, and whether, as some voyagers report, there is a connexion at high water between Winipegoos Lake and the great Saskatchewan River. If it should be judged expedient to carry the exploration so far, it would not occupy much additional time to take the levels and ascertain the precise nature of the obstructions at the Grand Rapid,\nwhich is said to be the only impediment to the navigation of the Saskatchewan, between Lake Winnipeg and the base of the rocky mountains.\n\nI could accomplish this exploration and return here to meet the director of the expedition by the 15th of June, which is about the earliest date at which canoes usually arrive from Lake Superior. If instructions on this subject were mailed at Toronto not later than the 16th April they would reach this about the 13th May, by which time I shall have completed the exploration of Rat and Roseau Rivers.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) S. J. DAWSON.\n\nThe Hon. the Provincial Secretary, Toronto, C. W.\n\nExtract of a Letter from Mr. Alexander Wells, Assistant to Mr. Dawson, dated White River, February 17, 1858.\n\nLac Plat is more a bay of the Lake of the Woods than a separate lake, its discharge being through a long deep bay, which in some places has the appearance of a broad river. This bay terminates in two ripples, distant from each other twenty-four chains. The first ripple is about twenty-three miles from the end of Gaudet's line, upon a course of about N. 70\u00b0 E. I scaled through, but it is too cold to make a plan here. The fall in the first ripple is twelve or fourteen inches; in the second it is from five to seven inches, not more. The first ripple from deep water to deep water, is one hundred feet. The channel is sixty-six feet wide, and there is an average depth of two feet of water over the bar. The bar is of a loose friable slate, soft and easily removed. The second bar is only forty feet from deep water, in other respects it does not vary from the first. The water between and on either side of the ripples is very deep. I was surprised at the small quantity of water discharged from so large a lake, and searched for another outlet, but found none. The Indians assured me that there was no other discharge. They also said that at high water the current would be for some days from the Lake of the Woods into Lac Plat.\n\nI had collected quite a lot of specimens, intending to send them by this opportunity; but my man has unfortunately sent the bag in which they were kept to the shanty. A specimen of the slate in the bar at the outlet of Lac Plat is, amongst others, in this bag. I send you, however, two specimens from the N.W. side of Lac Plat. The quartz I wish you would examine closely, as I think it contains sulphate of copper; the other is a kind of a flint, which the Indians here use for arrow heads.\n\nIn the bay of the Lake of the Woods, into which Lac Plat discharges itself, there is a small cut of trap rock, with veins of jasper. On one or two islands in Lac Plat I observed a coarse red granite, the rest is all slate, more or less resembling freestone.\n\nFrom the first lake to the N.E. branch of the White River, I dug holes upon every mile, so as to be able to state accurately the nature of the surface and bottom earth; the latter is a whitish yellow clay, the surface is of a black vegetable mould, varying in depth from two inches to three feet; the depth of three feet occurs only once, and from the nature of the timber I am certain that it does not extend more than three quarters of a mile. Over the whole distance there may be an average of ten inches of black mould on top of the clay. I examined the N.E. branch of the White River for about ten miles westward from where the line crosses it. After which I returned by the line, as I had not finished what I wished to do in that quarter. I found that the river diverges very slowly from the line, as at that distance it is not more than four miles and a half north of it. I intend to start from here in the morning, and to complete this part by following the river to where I turned the other day. So far as I saw the river, it is not very crooked, is from forty to sixty feet wide, has from six to ten feet water, with but little current, and has banks rising to a height of from five to eight feet above the ice. All the streams here have high banks. Those at the main White River are forty or fifty feet in height.\n\nAfter this I returned to the line where it crosses the river, and examined it from the N.E. branch to this place, in the same manner that I had previously examined that portion of it between the lake and river. I found the surface earth to be of the same description, but not so thick, as in several cases it is not over an inch or two in depth for two or three miles. The subsoil is of a totally different character, being of a whitish grey sand, in some places fine, and in others coarse and waterworn. The bottom changes immediately on crossing the N.E. branch.\n\nIt is a mistake to suppose that all the open land here is bottomless swamp. I found in several other instances that there were only from twelve to fifteen inches of black mould or wet coarse sand.\n\n(Signed) ALEXANDER WELLS.\n\nS. J.

T. J. J. Loranger, M.P.P.,\nProvincial Secretary.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe exploration of the route between Fort William, Lake Superior, and Fort Garry, Red River, having been made in canoes, the description of the line of communication between those distant points necessarily refers to the available water facilities which were found to exist, so that in the following sketches of the topography of the country bordering the route, only as much is described as was actually visible from river or lake, when in canoe, or from the summit of hills which were ascended at different portages and camping places whenever opportunity afforded. At the most, therefore, a very narrow strip of country is comprehended in succeeding delineations, but from the nature of the region through which the strip runs, it is highly probable that it represents the general character of a very large portion of the area between the valleys of Lakes Superior and Winnipeg, as far as the Lake of the Woods, and the right bank of the Winnipeg River.\n\nThe speed at which we were obliged to travel, in order to accomplish our voyage within a stated time, very considerably lessened the number of opportunities which might otherwise have been offered for acquiring more ample knowledge of many parts of the country, bidding fair to reward a minute exploration. The distance between Fort William and Fort Garry is about 699 miles, and the time occupied in traversing this great extent of country was thirty-three days, including a stoppage of two days and a half at Fort Francis, one day at Garden Island, and two days at Islington Mission, Winnipeg River; so that the time actually spent in canoe was twenty-seven and a half days, which gives an average of twenty-five and a half miles a day. This average refers solely to the different canoes I occupied at the several stages of the voyage, which were, in order, a five fathom north canoe, with the main party from Fort William to Fort Francis, a distance of 303 miles; a small canoe, carrying three persons in company with Mr. Dawson, similarly equipped, from Fort Francis to Islington Mission, 190 miles; and a small canoe, alone, from the Mission to Stone Fort, Red River, a distance of 187 miles. The average daily progress being in the large canoe twenty miles, and in the small canoes forty-seven miles. But the average daily progress of the large canoes along the whole route was twenty-five miles.\n\nThe valley of the Kaministiquia, below the Grand Falls, contains an area of good land probably exceeding 20,000 acres. It will doubtless acquire much importance as a terminus of any line of communication, whether by boat or winter road, which may eventually be established between the valleys of Lake Superior and Winnipeg.\n\nFrom the prevalence of shoal water for a long distance in the Kaministiquia, and the great length of the portages at the height of land, it may not happen that this route will be selected for improvement as a boat communication, but from the considerations which will soon be noticed, Fort William, and the valley in which it is situated, may become under any circumstances points of special interest. Arrow Lake, on the Pigeon River route, formerly pursued by the North-west Company, is within forty, and Gun Flint Lake within sixty miles of Point des Meurons, on the Kaministiquia, as shown on the map.\n\nBetween the Grand Falls of the Kaministiquia and Fort Francis, a distance of 273 miles, very few areas of cultivable land occur on the water communication; but it is probable that many areas of limited extent might be found, if sought for, on the shores of the lakes and on the banks of the rivers.\n\nThe country, as a whole, must be considered as a sterile waste, offering no inducements for settlement beyond those which a mining interest might foster, or small village stations on a line of communication create.\n\nThe valley of Rainy River is by far the most important tract seen, and I do not think that the estimate of 220,000 acres of good land assigned to the British side in this report is too much.\n\nThe islands in the Lake of the Woods offer some spots available for cultivation, many of which are now occupied by Indians, who cultivate Indian corn, potatoes, squashes, and pumpkins.\n\nThe Winnipeg River, until within a few miles of its mouth, flows through a desolate and irreclaimable rocky waste, furnishing a very small supply of timber for lumbering purposes in proportion to its length of 163 miles.\n\nSmall patches, varying from 50 to 300 acres of excellent drift clay, occur at and below the Islington Mission; but within a few miles of the mouth of the river an extensive area of good arable land is to be found.\n\nThese areas, both large and small, will possess only a local importance: the country through which the Winnipeg flows, the character of the river, with its rapids and cascades, having a fall of 333 feet, altogether preclude the hope of its being made available as a permanent means of communication with the valley of Lake Winnipeg.\n\nThe distance from the north-west corner of the Lake of the Woods to Fort Garry cannot exceed 100 miles, while, by the Winnipeg, the distance from the same point is 282 miles. Whatever may\nbe the result of Mr. Dawson's exploration of the route between those two points, it is very probable that as a station on a winter route the north-west corner of the Lake of the Woods will occupy a very prominent position.\n\nOf the valley of Red River I find it impossible to speak in any other terms than those which may express astonishment and admiration.\n\nThe description which I had read previous to my arrival there, certainly did not in any way prepare me for the magnificent country at present occupied and controlled by those whose interests, no one seeks to deny, have been opposed to settlement or communication with what may be termed the outer world.\n\nI entirely concur in the brief but expressive description given to me by an English settler on the Assiniboine, at the valley of Red River, including a large portion belonging to its great affluent, is a \"paradise of fertility.\"\n\nDuring my visit to Assiniboia, a district embracing the settlements on both rivers. I paid particular attention to the objections which have been urged against the climate and soil of the country with reference to agricultural operations, and I have no hesitation in saying that erroneous impressions respecting the available area of cultivable land, the soil, the crops, and the climate still exist, and find publicity.\n\nI do not wish it to be understood that these descriptive errors result from a determination to misrepresent facts, but arise either from unconsciousness of the true nature of existing physical impediments to settlement, or a disposition to explain how those impediments were produced or may be remedied.\n\nI was frequently referred to the Big Swamp as forming an insurmountable barrier to the rearward progress of settlement from Red River. This Big Swamp I found to be maintained by a mill dam at its chief outlet; and while reference was constantly made to the evil, the cause which produced it was ignored or really unknown.\n\nIn suggesting to residents at Red River the drainage of the Big Swamp, two objections were urged; the first, that its height above the river would not admit of drainage; the second, that if drained, it would require expensive bridges to be erected over the gullies which would soon be formed by its waters seeking their outlet to Red River.\n\nThe first objection was soon answered by my assistant, Mr. John Flemming, who ascertained, instrumentally, the relative heights of Big Swamp, the Prairie, and Red River, at the middle settlement.\n\nHe found the elevation of the swamp to be twenty-seven feet above the river level. Section No. 6 shows those relations; and I may here remark, that as far as my observations enabled me to form an opinion, all other swamps on the Assiniboine or on Red River may with equal ease be drained.\n\nThe second objection proceeded from a retired factor of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, and a member of the Board of Public Works at the settlement.\n\nHe admitted the practicability of the measure, but stated that the gullies formed in the yielding clay of the prairie would require expensive bridges to make them passable for settlers, the cost of which might amount to two or three hundred pounds.\n\nI have no doubt that the swamp on the east side of the river would be as easily drained as the one to which I have referred at length.\n\nThe origin of these swamps is, I think, simply explained in the following way: Red River occupies a trench which it has cut for itself about thirty feet below the level of the beautiful prairies through which it flows. Its banks are fringed with heavy timber for a depth of perhaps a quarter of a mile or more on one side or the other, and during the lapse of many years occasional overflows have \"silted up\" the wooded banks for perhaps a foot above the level of the prairies, so that in some places the river flows for miles between banks which are a little higher than the prairies beyond them. When, therefore, a great flood occurs, as in 1826 and 1832, the prairies are flooded, and the low natural level on the immediate banks, prevents the return of the waters to the bed of the river, and forms a swamp.\n\nIt is to be well observed that the Big Swamp did not assume its present formidable dimensions until after the flood of 1852; and the construction of the mill dam at Mill Creek now effectually prevents it from drying up, and affording many thousand acres of admirable pasture land to the public grazing grounds of Red River.\n\nI mentioned this impediment to the drainage of the Big Swamp to the owner of the mill, who is one of the most wealthy and influential residents; but he did not think the removal of the dam would assist in draining the swamp, \"it was too big.\"\n\nThe summer climate of this region appears to be very well adapted for agricultural operations.\n\nThe summer temperature is nearly four degrees warmer than at Toronto, as ascertained by a comparison of corresponding observations.\n\nIndian corn, if properly cultivated and an early variety selected, may always be relied on.\n\nThe melon grows with the utmost luxuriance, without any artificial aid, and ripens perfectly before the end of August.\n\nAnd yet with these natural and most truthful registers of climate, we are accustomed to hear of late spring and early autumn frosts deplored, lamented, and held up as one of the great drawbacks of Red River.\n\nThe opinions expressed at the settlement by different individuals on the soil, climate, and natural productions of the country, are often of a very opposite character; and I found invariably that descriptions and opinions were remarkably affected by the relation which the individual bore to the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nIn making these statements I do not wish it to be supposed that any attempt was ever made intentionally to mislead, but the habit of deerring everything not connected with the fur trade appeared to have been a second nature to many of the old residents, whose interests are locked up in it.\n\nAll kinds of farm produce common in Canada succeed admirably in the district of Assiniboia; these are wheat, oats, barley, Indian corn, hops, flax, hemp, potatoes, root crops, and all kinds of common garden vegetables.\nThe potatoes, cauliflowers, and onions I have not seen surpassed at any of our provincial fairs; an enumeration of the weight of some of these productions of the garden and farm will be found in the text, and numerous specimens accompany this report.\n\nThe character of the soil in Assiniboia, within the limits of the ancient lake ridges, cannot be surpassed. It is a rich black mould ten to twenty inches deep, reposing on a lightish coloured alluvial clay, about four feet deep, which again rests upon lacustrine or drift clay to the level of the water, in all the rivers and creeks inspected.\n\nI frequently examined the soil some miles distant from the rivers along my line of route, as shown on the map, and I invariably found the prairie portion to exhibit a uniform fertility.\n\nThe area occupied by fertile prairies I visited and saw certainly exceeds 1,500,000 acres; and as will appear from an inspection of the map of Minnesota the greater portion of the rich and available prairie land in the valley of the Red River lies within British territory, while the valley of the Assiniboine is wholly within it.\n\nThe altitude of the valley of the Red River above the sea is about 680 feet, or 320 feet less than the elevation given to it by high authority, and from which erroneous conclusions respecting its climate in relation to agriculture have been drawn.\n\nAs an agricultural country I have no hesitation in expressing the strongest conviction that it will one day rank amongst the most distinguished.\n\nThe present state of society and the condition of the people in the settlements is far from being a pleasing or encouraging subject.\n\nThe European and Canadian element have been gradually diminishing for years, and the half-breed population is apparently drawing closer to the habits and tastes of their Indian ancestry.\n\nThat agriculture and all the simpler arts have been discouraged is but too apparent.\n\nThe interests of the fur trade are necessarily opposed to the centralization and settlement of the half-breed and Indian hunters, and it is everywhere evident that these interests have been upheld at a great sacrifice of means and by the practice of a far-seeing and skilful policy.\n\nRed River has been settled for 40 years, and now contains a population of 7,000 souls, yet no single branch of industry common even in the thinly settled parts of Canada is practised there.\n\nWhatever efforts were made in times past, and there have been many, they have terminated in failure, and it is difficult to resist the impression that these failures were designed by some in authority.\n\nSuch artifices appear to have been thought necessary when the controlling authorities were weak, and indeed almost powerless in the face of a strong but irresolute and uneducated peope.\n\nThe valley of the Red River is capable of supplying all the necessaries of life, with the exception of iron, for some years to come. The most important want is fuel, but there is much probability that on the Upper Assiniboine and the Little Souris River, one of its affluents, tertiary coal, or lignite, will be found in available quantities.\n\nThe whole question of a boat communication between Fort William and Red River will be fully discussed in the reports of my colleagues; but having enjoyed the opportunity of seeing the country between Crow Wing, in the State of Minnesota, and the settlements at Red River, open throughout the year, I may, perhaps, venture to introduce a few remarks with reference to a winter road on British territory.\n\nIt is well known that many years since the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company commenced to cut out a winter road between Red River and York Factory, Hudson's Bay, a distance of, perhaps, 600 miles, with the view to admit of the transport of articles of export during the long winter months. The project, however, was abandoned, but the idea still remains strong in the mind of some of the settlers at Red River.\n\nA winter road from Fort Garry to the Lake of the Woods would not exceed 100 miles; it is a route which is often travelled in the winter, and the cattle at Fort Francis were brought that way. Once on the Lake of the Woods the road is open for 170 miles, requiring only two or three detours into the forest to escape that portion of Rainy River which never freezes. The other detours from lake or river would necessarily be at the portages along the line of boat route, or near to them.\n\nThe recommendation which a winter road, in conjunction with a summer boat communication, enjoys is, that the poor or floating population of Red River would easily be induced to settle at the different posts on the route, which would be necessary at stated intervals, with a view to accumulate supplies of provisions, hay, &c., during the summer months. It would be merely transferring their rude industry from the open prairies, where they are often compelled to live in misery during the winter, to a settled village life which might soon become self-supporting, and continually assist in improving the means of communication.\n\nThe following tables show the respective lengths of different routes traversed, or which might be suggested, between Lake Superior and Fort Garry, Red River:\n\n| Route Description                                                                 | Length |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| I.

The only point of present difficulty appears to lie in the communication between Point des Meurons and Gun Flint Lake, or perhaps even Arrow Lake, only thirty-eight miles and a third in an air line from that part of the valley of the Kaministiquia. But little reliable information is accessible concerning this tract of country.\n\nThe experience possessed, when assisted by the means at the disposal of the private freighters of Red River, may render their services very valuable auxiliaries in opening a line of communication without much present outlay. Their employment might be regarded as a necessary preliminary step towards establishing a permanent commercial connexion between Canada and the valley of the Red River.\n\nIn conclusion, it affords me very great pleasure to have the opportunity of expressing sincere thanks to my assistant, Mr. John Fleming, whose zeal and industry never for a moment flagged from the day of our departure to the present hour.\n\nIn addition to the duties to which I referred in my report from Fort Francis, Mr. Fleming levelled across the valley of Red River, from the Big Swamp to the Lake Ridge, while I was engaged on the Assiniboine, and all the views and sketches of forts, cascades, rapids, portages, churches, and implements are from Mr. Fleming's pencil.\n\nThe maps, sections, diagrams, and sketches which accompany this report are as follows:\n\n1st. A topographical map of the whole country traversed, including the Assiniboine and Roseau Rivers, and a plan of Red River Settlement, on a scale of two miles to one inch.\n\nThe authorities consulted in the construction of the geographical portion of the map are: for the Pigeon River route, Rainy Lake, and the Lake of the Woods, the map of the Canadian Boundary Commission; for the plan of the settlements on Red River, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. M'-Tavish, the chief officer at Fort Garry. The survey of the settlements was made about ten years since by the Honourable Company's Surveyor. The soundings in Thunder Bay and the outline of the coast, and M'-Kay's mountain range, are from Bayfield's chart.\n\nThe route from Fort William to Rainy Lake, Rat Portage to the Stone Fort, part of Red River, the Valley of the Roseau and Rat River, the Assiniboine, the ancient ridges of Lake Winnipeg, and the whole of the descriptive outline, of the country traversed, made or described in my report from Fort Francis, are the portions for which this report is responsible.\n\nFor the elevation and length of each portage, I am indebted to Messrs. Dawson and Napier; but the total rise and fall along the line of route has been made the subject of an independent calculation, as great difference of opinion is known to exist among practical engineers with reference to the allowance which ought to be made in estimating the descent of water by the speed of its current.\n\n2nd.

The expedition should be placed under the sole control and management of Mr. Gladman, and Messrs. Dawson and Napier should be instructed that thenceforth that gentleman must be considered as the channel through which they will receive instructions, and make their report to the Government.\n\n2. That Mr. Gladman should repair to the settlement to take charge of the party as early in the spring as possible.\n\n3. That in accordance with Mr. Gladman's suggestions, Mr. Napier and his party should be withdrawn without delay, and that they should be instructed to return to Toronto as soon as possible coming back by way of Pembina and St. Paul's, it being, however, understood that Mr. Dawson may retain Mr. De Salaberry, should he think it necessary to do so.\n\n4. Assuming that the proposed route from Fort Garry to the Lake of the Woods, by Lac Platte has been sufficiently explored during the winter months by Mr. Dawson and his party, Mr. Dawson's first duty in the spring will be to explore the route between Rainy Lake and the Lac des Mille Lacs, following the line indicated on Mr. Dawson's map in the \"supposed course of the discharge of the Lac des Mille Lacs;\" should the route in question be found after exploration to be practicable and desirable, it will be Mr. Dawson's next task to endeavour to ascertain the best means of communication either by land or water from Lac des Mille Lacs to Dog Lake.\n\n5. Should it be found, however, that the proposed communication between Rainy Lake and the Lac des Mille Lacs is impracticable, Mr. Dawson will proceed at once to examine the \"Old North-West Route\" between Lac la Croix and Lake Seignagah, and will then endeavour to ascertain the best means of communicating between the last-named lake and Fort William.\n\n6. When in possession of the result of Mr. Dawson's explorations, above indicated, between the two routes from Rainy Lake and Lake Superior, &c., the Government will be better enabled to decide between the two routes from Rainy Lake to Lake Superior, viz., that recommended by Mr. Dawson and laid down upon his map, and the \"Old North-West Route.\"\n\nThe foregoing suggestions are respectfully submitted by the undersigned.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, January 30, 1858.\n\nAdverting to your letter of the 14th inst., I have the honour to transmit to you herewith for your guidance a copy of a memorandum of instructions approved by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, on the subject of the Red River Expedition under your charge.\n\nYou will have the goodness to communicate to Messrs. Dawson and Napier a copy of these instructions for the guidance of their future movements.\n\nMr. C. De Salaberry, who is about to return to the expedition party will take charge of any letters you may desire to send by him.\n\nI am directed to add that should you or Mr. Dawson, or the officer for the time being in charge of the exploring party, deem it desirable, upon further information, to make other explorations than those indicated in the instructions, he shall be at liberty to do so.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nGeorge Gladman, Esq., Rossin House, Toronto. (Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\nSir,\n\nPort Hope, February 5, 1858.\n\nAs it has been determined by the Honourable Executive Council, that I should repair to the Red River Settlement to resume the charge of the expedition party there, as early in the spring as possible, I consider it necessary that preparations of men, canoes, and other materials should be made at Fort William, so that no detention may take place when I shall arrive there.\n\nI therefore propose to send a messenger thither next week, with instructions to my assistant who is passing the winter at Point Menson, near Fort William.\n\nI shall be happy to receive your instructions relative to Sir George Simpson's letter and the receipt for 500l., which I had the honour to place in your hands.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nThe Hon. T. J. J. Loranger, Provincial Secretary.\n\n(Signed) GEO. GLADMAN.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nHudson's Bay House, Lachine, January 26, 1858.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 21st inst., covering a draft on the Molson Bank for the sum of $3,289 20c. in payment of accounts against the Canadian Surveying Party employed at Red River, for supplies by the Hudson's Bay Company to the amount of $526 52c., and by Mr. McDermot to the amount of $2,762 68c. I now hand receipts for both sums, that for Mr. McDermot's account being in duplicate, in order that you may be enabled to transmit one to him at Red River. I shall be glad to receive payment of Mr. McDermot's second account as soon as the necessary vouchers may reach you.\n\nI am obliged by your offer to forward any letters I may have for Red River by the hands of Mr. De Salaberry, but need not trouble you in that way, having sent my packet by mail a few days ago. I, however, enclose a letter to Mr. McDermot, advising him of the partial payment of his account, which you will perhaps do me the favour to transmit to Red River.\n\nI hand herewith an order on Chief Factor William McTavish, at Fort Garry, for the sum of 500l. in the Hudson's Bay Company's notes, to be applied to the service of the Canadian surveying party at Red River. I am authorizing the advance of funds as a matter of accommodation, contrary to our usual routine, which is to require the deposit of the funds at this establishment before giving an order on Fort Garry.\n\nIn order to guard against accident or difficulty hereafter, I should feel obliged by your obtaining for me an acknowledgment of this sum from some member of the Government, so that when the funds are voted by Parliament, there may be no question as to their liability to repay the Company for this advance.\n\nBelieve me, &c.\n\n(Signed) GEO. SIMPSON.\n\nToronto, February 2, 1858.\n\nReceived from the Hon. Hudson's Bay Company, by the hands of Sir George Simpson, an order on William McTavish, Esq. for the sum of five hundred pounds sterling, to be paid to my order, at the Red River Settlement, in the notes of the Company; said amount of five hundred pounds sterling to be repaid to the Company at their office at Lachine by the Government of Canada, out of the appropriation that shall be made by Parliament for account of the \"Red River Expedition.\"\n\n(Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, February 23, 1858.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor-General has had before him in Council your letter of the 5th instant, proposing to despatch a messenger to Fort William, with instructions to your assistant respecting the preparations necessary with a view to your resuming charge of the Red River Expedition in the coming spring, and also requesting instructions relative to an order for 500l. sterling given to you by Sir George Simpson, payable at Fort Garry in notes of the Hudson's Bay Company, for the accommodation of the exploring party.\n\nI have to acquaint you in reference thereto, that His Excellency has been pleased to authorize you to send a messenger to Fort William as proposed, and also to allow you to avail yourself, for the purposes of the expedition, of the sum of 500l. sterling placed at your disposal by Sir George Simpson, giving that gentleman your receipt for the amount.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 30th January, Toronto, enclosing me an order signed Mr. M'Dermot, for the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds currency, and also a copy of instructions from the Provincial Secretary, directing me and my party to return to Toronto via Pembina and St. Paul's with the least possible delay.\n\nIn compliance with these instructions I made preparations to leave this by dog sleds on the 10th instant; owing, however, to the late heavy rains and total disappearance of the snow, as well as the unsafe condition of the rivers and Muskeys travelled by, the winter route has been rendered impracticable for the remainder of the season.\n\nI shall, therefore, be obliged to remain here until such time as the journey to Crow Wing is practicable with horses, which I am told may be about the middle of April, and every arrangement has been made for starting as soon as the state of the roads will permit.\n\nGeorge Gladman, Esq., Toronto.\n\n(Signed) W. H. E. NAPIER.\n\nPort Hope, Canada West, March 24, 1858.\n\nSir,\n\nThe question of opening a line of communication between Lake Superior and the Red River is assuming an aspect of so much greater importance than heretofore, that I trust you will excuse my presuming to offer a few more observations on the subject.\n\nFrom a careful consideration of the two routes, the one by the Kaministiquia and the other by the old North-West line by Pigeon River, mentioned in my report to the Hon. Provincial Secretary of the 3rd November last, I am led to the conclusion that the latter must eventually be decided upon as the best, as it possesses the advantage of good navigable waters, less land carriage between the height of land and the Lake of the Woods, and safety in either boat or canoe; in fact it is the best water communication that has hitherto been met with by myself or my Indian guides during a long experience in various parts of the country.\n\nThe difficulties either way are considerable certainly, but not insuperable to Canadian energy and enterprise; on the contrary, I feel confident that this undertaking can be speedily accomplished if proper measures be taken and the requisite means be applied to it. The first difficulty to be encountered is the formation of a road from the Kaministiquia to the waters flowing towards Lake Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay, the length of which would not exceed sixty miles. There would then be a water communication of about 240 miles requiring some improvement, although the land carriage or \"portaging\" is less than three miles; and lastly, there would be a land road of from 90 to 100 miles to be made from the Lake of the Woods to Fort Garry, the present capital of Red River.\n\nThis last road is so desirable to the inhabitants of Red River that we may safely rely upon their assistance in its formation. They perceive the advantage it would be to them if they had only 100 miles of cartage distance to the Lake of the Woods, instead of 700 miles to St. Paul's, in the transport of their supplies; besides the earlier period of the year at which their supplies would reach the settlement. The sixty miles of road requiring to be made at the eastern terminus of the line being within Canadian limits, accessible with facility from Lake Superior, and therefore within the reach of our home population, would be constructed before the expiration of the Hudson's Bay Company's lease, in 1859.\n\nMy own observations of the north-west shores of Lake Superior lead me to think that the entrance of the Fort William or Kaministiquia River presents the most favourable point from which to commence this great link in the chain of our Canadian internal communication. It is accessible in steamers and other lake-going vessels, by which any amount of materials and supplies may be forwarded as found requisite. There are, however, very few inhabitants settled on the banks of that river, and looking upon that station as the key to the whole of the British north-west possessions, I feel that I cannot too strongly urge upon the Canadian Government its immediate occupation. This may be effected without any great outlay or cumbrous machinery; that is to say, by simply employing a surveyor, under Government authority, to lay out one or more townships and inviting settlers. During the past four months I have had numerous applications from mechanics and others to join any party that may be sent to those countries next summer; and I have no doubt whatever, if the system of free grants to actual settlers were adopted, a numerous population would soon be located there.\n\nIn the report of the canoe route by Professor Hind, recently published, it is stated that the arable lands in the valley of the Kaministiquia, at the Lake Superior terminus (of the line of northern communication), is about 20,000 acres, that is to say, between Fort William and the Kakabeka Falls. Thus we have ample space, and I think it will be obvious to you that a large settlement may be made at Fort William, which cannot fail to be attended with many important advantages to Canada, not only as regards the line of communication which we are now seeking to establish, but also as it will affect Canadian commerce with that vast territory of the north in years to come.\n\nThe lands through which, in the course of our operations, the exploring party has had to pass, being Indian property, the necessity of making some arrangements with the tribes to which they belong becomes immediately apparent, and the Government will no doubt take this into consideration, in order that measures may be devised to prevent difficulties and collisions.\n\nTo the Hon. the President of the Council.\n\n(Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nPermit me again to offer a few remarks relative to the correspondence between the British Colonial Office and Mr. Shepherd on the affairs of the Hudson's Bay Company,\n\nIn Mr. Shepherd's letter to Mr. Laboucane, of 21st January 1858, he observes, \"It is, however, right to notice, that the territories mentioned as those that may probably be first desired by the\nGovernment of Canada; namely, the Saskatchewan and Red River districts, are not only valuable to\nthe Hudson's Bay Company as stations for carrying on the fur trade, but that they are also of\npeculiar value to the Company as being the only source from which the Company's annual stock of\nprovisions is drawn, particularly the staple article of pemican, a regular supply of which is absolutely\nnecessary to enable the officers of the Company to transport their goods to the numerous inland and\ndistant stations, and to feed and maintain the people, both Europeans and Indians, stationed thereat.\nIt is proper, therefore, that I should draw your attention to the fact that the ultimate loss of those\ndistricts would most probably involve the Hudson's Bay Company in very serious difficulties, and\ncause a great increase of expense in conducting the trade.\"\n\nThe object of Mr. Shepherd in the foregoing statement appears to be to induce a belief that the\nCompany would sustain an immediate pecuniary loss by the occupation of the Red River and the\nSaskatchewan districts as a portion of Canada, and under its jurisdiction, and that by reason of the\nCompany being deprived of the power to trade or buy pemican from the hunters, they would be placed\nin circumstances of difficulty and expense.\n\nIt need scarcely be observed that the object of immigrants into that country, from Europe, Canada,\nor other places, being settlement and the cultivation of the soil, their farming operations could not\nmaterially interfere, for some years to come, with the providing of the staple article of \"pemican\" by the\nHudson's Bay Company, upon which so much stress is laid by Mr. Shepherd. If my understanding of\nthe question is correct, the desire of Canada is, the extinction of the monopoly or exclusive rights of\nthe Company in every portion of territory under Canadian rule, and the admission of the people of\nCanada to carry on business operations at Red River, the Saskatchewan, or any other portion of\nBritish North America, as freely and as unrestrainedly as they may do in Toronto or Montreal. It is\nnot, I presume, the desire of Canada to exclude or prevent the Hudson's Bay Company from carrying\non their commercial transactions at the Red River or the Saskatchewan, as freely as they now do at\nLachine. Equal rights as British subjects and merchants is all that is contended for by Canada, and as\nCanada does not seek to deprive the Company of any of their establishments or possessions in the\nSaskatchewan or Red River districts, there is no good reason for supposing that the Company will in\nany way be debarred from providing as much pemican as they may think necessary for carrying on\ntheir trade as heretofore. It is evident many years must elapse before the cultivable prairie lands\nwill become so occupied by settlers as to interfere materially with the trading of provisions from the\nhunters at Saskatchewan, and when that time arrives domesticated animals will take the place of the\nbuffalo.\n\nThe question of pecuniary compensation can, as I conceive, have reference only to the right of soil\nwhich the Company claim to possess under their charter or by purchase from the Earl of Selkirk.\n\nThe licence of exclusive trade with the Indians by the Company being limited to a certain time only,\nand those territories being reserved to be formed into colonies by Her Majesty's Government whenever\nit may be considered proper to do so, I apprehended the rights of the Company will cease as soon as\nthe present lease expires, and other government than that of the Company is established.\n\nAnother remark made by Mr. Shepherd is this:\u2014\"The Company assume that the Government\n(Canadian) will be responsible for the preservation of peace, and the maintenance of law and order in\nall the territory ceded to them, and that they will prevent lawless and dishonest adventurers from\ninfringing, from thence, the rights of the Company over the remaining portions of their territory.\"\n\nIn these observations, the Hudson's Bay Company assume to treat for the cession of certain territo-\nries. As a trading company of British merchants they assume that the Canadian Government will\nmaintain law and order in the territories ceded to them by the Company, which territories yet, in point\nof fact, belong to the natives. It may be well here to consider what the present government of the\nRed River and the Saskatchewan districts really is. So far as the uninitiated know of the matter, it\nis generally understood to be this: a Governor and a Council appointed by the Hudson's Bay Company,\nand holding their meetings at the Company's forts in the Red River Settlement, form the entire execu-\ntive administration. The Governor being also the only legal functionary in the settlement, the Com-\npany's legal adviser, the judge, the directors of the Company (in London), and their representative, the\nGovernor of Rupert's Land, residing for the most part at Lachine, make all the appointments. Hence\nit devolves chiefly on \"the Governor and Council of Assiniboina,\" as it is in Hudson's Bay form ex-\npressed, to preserve the peace, and to maintain law and order in those districts. Can that government,\nappointed although they be by the Company, and with all the influence of the Company to support\nthem, can they prevent adventurers (I will not call them \"lawless and dishonest,\" for they are chiefly\nnatives seeking to earn an honest livelihood in their own land) from infringing upon the assumed\nrights of the Company over the other portions of what they are pleased to call Rupert's Land? They\ncannot, and it would be clearly an impossibility for any government established by Canada to prevent\nnatives of that country, or in fact any others who might choose to do so, from trading in that extensive\nterritory, wherever they might find it most advantageous to do so. Nor can I suppose that a Canadian\nGovernment would for one moment, under any circumstances, entertain such an idea.\n\nAs is well known, the Hudson's Bay Company have for years past held leases from Government of\nthe King's Posts and Seigniories in Lower Canada. Have they been able to prevent intrusion on the\nQueen's domain and infringements of the rights given by these leases? No; certainly not, and what\nhas been their remedy? Recourse by civil action to the Courts of Canada whenever they were\ndisposed to try the question. And so it will and must be in the districts of Red River, when other\nlaws than those of the Hudson's Bay Company shall have been there established.\n\nWhatever the form of government that may be decided upon, the preservation of peace and the\nmaintenance of law and order will of course be its legitimate objects. There need, however, be no\napprehension of any disturbance of the peace, except from the officers or servants of the Company who\nmay take upon themselves to determine (as in the case of Mr. Bannatyne) what is an infringement of\nthe Company's rights, or an intrusion on the Company's undefined boundary line, according to their\nown ideas. It is, therefore, in my humble opinion, much to be desired, even for the sake of peace and\ngood order, that the whole trade should be free and open to all British subjects.\nThat it would be requisite, in such case, to place the trade under certain restrictions and enactments (as to the introduction of ardent spirits, for instance,) is clear, but that all in the territory, from the Rocky Mountains to the Hudson's Bay, whether servants of the Hudson's Bay Company or not, whether at Red River or on the shores of Hudson's Bay, should be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Red River Government, is equally clear and a measure of necessity and good policy.\n\nAs regards the governing of these territories from or by Canada, the difficulties do not appear greater than they are at the present moment under the rule of the Company. The gentleman who fills the office of Governor of Assiniboia is a lawyer from Montreal, and it will have been observed by my previous remarks that the whole machinery of his government consists of a council acting under instructions from Lachine or from London. If the Company can govern these districts in a mode so simple, there is no question but that the Canadian Government can devise one equally as simple, or one more efficacious and more satisfactory to the mass of the people, especially when the line of inter-communication between Lake Superior and the Red River will be less difficult than it now is. If the lands on the borders of Lake Superior, on the Rainy River, and on Red River were surveyed and laid out in townships for settlement, under the authority of the Government, and gradual occupation promoted by the opening out of a practicable road, the appointment of magistrates, and the establishing of a municipal code similar to that of Canada, conferring on the inhabitants the rights of election in their several municipalities, would be all that the state of the country would require for several years to come.\n\nI am confident I speak the sentiments of the Red River people when I say their chief desires are, a voice in their own government, and freedom to trade in the best markets within their reach.\n\nI venture to offer these few remarks, suggested by the local knowledge and experience acquired in the several positions in which I have been placed, and submitting them to your favourable construction as to the motives by which I am actuated,\n\nI have, &c.\n\nTo the Honourable the President of the Council. (Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN.\n\nSir,\n\nToronto, April 9, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that, in compliance with your instructions to make immediate arrangements for proceeding to Red River at the opening of the navigation, to convey supplies, men, and canoes to Mr. Dawson, and to continue the exploration of the country west of Red River, I have engaged the services of Mr. James A. Dickenson, C.E., as surveyor, and Mr. John Fleming as his assistant.\n\nIn a former communication I referred to Mr. Dickenson's standing as an engineer and surveyor, and enumerated the references which he is ready at any time to submit. It will, perhaps, be sufficient here to mention that Mr. Dickenson is an engineer of ten years' standing, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and that he accompanied the exploring expedition of 1857 to Red River, in the capacity of chief assistant to Mr. Napier, winning, by his industry, talent, courage, and eminent trustworthiness, the esteem and confidence of all members of the expedition.\n\nOf Mr. John Fleming's excellent capabilities and industry I have already spoken in my report, dated 7th February, and yesterday Mr. Fleming completed the series of sketches, fifty in number, alluded to in that report, thus closing his connexion with the expedition of 1857, and assuming the office of assistant to Mr. Dickenson in the one now in process of organization, under such stipulations as will prove most advantageous to its general interests.\n\nMr. Gladman informs me that the canoes he brought with him to Sault Ste. Marie, on his return from Red River, are not in a condition to make the journey from Fort William to Fort Garry. It will therefore be advisable to secure two good north or three bastard canoes before leaving for Lake Superior, as it would not be judicious to rely upon the probability of obtaining canoes from the Hudson's Bay Company's stores at Fort William.\n\nIn order, however, to ensure the good will of the gentlemen in charge of the posts, I beg leave to suggest that a letter should be written for me to take to Sir George Simpson or Mr. Finlayson, at Lachine, requesting either of those gentlemen to favour me with a document addressed to the gentlemen in charge of the posts I may visit, containing instructions to offer every facility in the prosecution of the exploration.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nThe Hon. T. J. J. Loranger, Provincial Secretary. (Signed) HENRY Y. HIND.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 14, 1858.\n\nI am commanded by His Excellency the Governor-General to state to you, for the information of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, that it is the intention of the Canadian Government to send another expedition this year into the country, in the neighbourhood of the Red River Settlement, for the purposes of exploration.\n\n2. The expedition will be divided into two parties, of which one will be under the direction of Professor Hind, and the other under that of Mr. Dawson. Both of these gentlemen served with the expedition last year, and the latter is still at Red River.\n\n3. The operations of Mr. Dawson and his party, probably about twenty men, will be confined pretty much to the same ground as last year, namely, the route from Fort William to Fort Garry; while the operations of Professor Hind and his staff will extend to the country west of Red River and Lake Winnipeg, and below the Rivers Assiniboine and Saskatchewan, as far west as \"South Branch House.\"\n4. His Excellency desires to bespeak through you, for the expedition this year, the same courteous assistance from the officers and servants of the Company on the line of the proposed expedition, which was so readily proffered last year, and which was (His Excellency is informed) so freely extended to all the members of the expedition.\n\n5. This letter will be delivered to you by Professor Hind, who is about to repair to Montreal on business connected with the expedition.\n\n6. Professor Hind would be glad to be favoured by you with a general letter, addressed to the officer in charge of the Company's posts, on the route about to be visited by him, requesting them to promote, as far as in their power, the general objects of the expedition under his charge. His Excellency desires me to state that he trusts it will be in your power to gratify Mr. Hind's wishes in this matter, as he doubts not it would very materially advance the object of the expedition.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\n\nSir George Simpson, Governor Hudson's Bay Company,\nHudson's Bay House, Lachine, Montreal.\n\nSir,\n\nHudson's Bay House, Lachine, April 23, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your communication, dated 14th instant, informing me, by command of His Excellency the Governor-General, of the intention of the Canadian Government to send another expedition this year to the neighbourhood of the Red River Settlement, for the purposes of exploration, and requesting for the expedition the same assistance from the Hudson's Bay Company as was rendered to its members last season.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that your letter was delivered to me in person by Professor Hind, to whom I intimated verbally, that it afforded the Hudson's Bay Company at all times great pleasure to render good offices to the Government of Canada, and that such assistance as could be given at the Company's posts to the expedition under his command would be freely rendered.\n\nI have already furnished Professor Hind with the letters of introduction to the Hudson's Bay Company's officers, which you apply for, and given him the necessary authority to obtain canoes and other supplies at Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William. The usual equipment of tent and other camp appointments for his use while travelling in the interior has been provided from the company's store.\n\nBegging you will assure His Excellency the Governor-General that the Hudson's Bay Company will forward the objects of the exploring expedition with the same cordiality with which they are ever anxious to co-operate with the Government of this province,\n\nI have, &c.\n\nThe Honourable T. J. J. Loranger,\nProvincial Secretary, Toronto.\n\n(Signed) G. SIMPSON.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 27, 1858.\n\nI have had the honour to receive and lay before His Excellency the Governor-General your letter of the 23rd instant, in reply to mine of the 14th instant, and am directed by His Excellency to thank you for your acts of courtesy to Mr. Hind, and for the promises of the co-operation of the Hudson's Bay Company in promoting the object of the expedition, during the present year, to the neighbourhood of the Red River Settlement.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER.\n\nSir George Simpson, Governor Hudson's Bay Company,\nHudson's Bay House, Lachine, Montreal.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 14, 1858.\n\nIn my conversation with you last week I intimated to you that His Excellency the Governor-General in Council deemed it advisable, with a view to reduce as much as possible the expenditure of the Red River exploration party for the current year, to dispense with your services as general conductor of the expedition.\n\n2. I have now to notify you formally, that your official connexion with the expedition will terminate on the 22nd inst.\n\n3. His Excellency has further been pleased to dispense with the services of all those individuals connected with the exploring party who were under your more immediate control, and whom Mr. Dawson may not require, and specially direct to remain with him.\n\n4. You will lose no time in notifying these gentlemen accordingly.\n\n5. I have further to inform you that Professor Hind, who is about in a few days to leave for Red River, has been directed to take possession of the canoes and other articles, as well as any provisions belonging to the Government, either at Collingwood or Sault Ste. Marie. You will therefore give any directions that may be necessary for the transfer of the things above mentioned to Mr. Hind.\n\n6. You will also furnish me with a complete inventory of any other Government property connected with the expedition, showing where and in whose custody it is.\n\n7. It is of course desirable that all accounts connected with the expedition, while under your management should be closed and audited as speedily as possible.\n\nI have, &c.\n\nGeorge Gladman, Esq., Port Hope.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 14, 1858.\n\nDuring the last week I communicated to you verbally instructions in reference to the proposed expedition to the neighbourhood of the Red River during the present year.\n\n2. It has been acceded, as you are aware, with a view to keep down as much as possible the expense of the expedition this year, to dispense with the services of Mr. Gladman as its general manager.\n3. The exploration party this year will consist of two divisions, one to be placed under your direction and control, and the other under the direction of Mr. Dawson.\n\n4. His Excellency in Council has been pleased to place under your charge the topographical and geological portion of the exploration, respecting which full instructions will be given in another letter, while Mr. Dawson will continue to perform the same duties as last year, viz., those of surveyor, &c.\n\n5. The estimate of the probable expenditure of the expedition submitted by you on the 6th inst. was laid before His Excellency in Council, and has been approved of by them, and I have accordingly now to direct you to be guided as much as possible by that estimate in engaging your assistants, hiring your men, as well as in the other necessary expenditures of the expedition.\n\n6. It is hardly necessary to say that His Excellency relies upon your exercising a due economy in all matters connected with the expedition.\n\n7. As soon as you have completed your contemplated party, you will furnish me with a schedule, giving the names of all the persons composing it, and stating their rates of pay, and the dates from which their pay is to commence. Such a schedule will be necessary, to supply the auditor with the means of auditing your accounts.\n\n8. Having organized your party, you will lose no time in repairing with them to Red River, taking with you the supplies (referred to in the estimate) required for Mr. Dawson.\n\n9. On your way to the Red River, you will take possession of the canoes, provisions, and other articles belonging to the Government, either at Collingwood or Sault Ste. Marie. These, with the men intended for Mr. Dawson, you will deliver over to that gentleman when you meet him, either at Red River or on his way back.\n\n10. You are to consider all the articles and materials of any description belonging to the Canadian Government, connected with the late expedition, as available for the purposes of the present expedition, and you and Mr. Dawson may therefore divide them between you in whatever way you may think most advantageous. Such articles, if any, as may not be required by either of you should be left in the custody of some trustworthy person to await the orders of the Government.\n\n11. As soon as you shall have put Mr. Dawson in possession of the men and canoes intended for him each of you will be held separately responsible for the expenses of his own party. You will therefore, be careful to keep an accurate account of your expenditure.\n\n12. The Auditor-General of Public Accounts will give you any information you may require as to the most convenient mode of making out and furnishing your accounts, &c.\n\nEstimate of the Cost of the Red River Expedition, for the year 1858.\n\n| Description                                                                 | Mr. Dawson Returning | Mr. Hind Going |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| Two north canoes, with twelve Caughnawaga Indians and two French Canadians, at $1 per day; half the expense to be charged to each expedition, as it serves the object of both equally, for a period of two months | -                   | 420 00        |\n| Twelve men for six months for Mr. Dawson                                  | -                   | 2,160 00      |\n| Provisions for Mr. Dawson                                                  | -                   | 760 00        |\n| Provisions for Mr. Hind                                                    | -                   | 760 00        |\n| Instruments for Mr. Hind: Levels, Chains, thermometers, compasses, &c.     | -                   | 260 00        |\n| Photographic apparatus complete                                            | -                   | 200 00        |\n| Water-proof boxes                                                          | -                   | 30 00         |\n| Stationery                                                                | -                   | 30 00         |\n| Medicine chests                                                           | -                   | 20 00         |\n| Presents for Indians at the Lake of the Woods; half to be charged to each party. | -                   | 50 00         |\n| Presents, consisting of tea, tobacco, hooks, &c.                           | -                   | 50 00         |\n| Salaries: Mr. Dawson, at $6 per diem; seven months                         | -                   | 1,260 00      |\n| Mr. Hind, do. do. eight do.                                                | -                   | 1,440 00      |\n| Surveyor to Mr. Hind's party, at $4 per diem; eight months                 | -                   | 960 00        |\n| Assistant to surveyor, at 20L per month; eight months                      | -                   | 640 00        |\n| Photographer to Mr. Hind's party                                          | -                   | 640 00        |\n| First assistant to Mr. Dawson                                             | -                   | 960 00        |\n| Second and third assistant to Mr. Dawson                                   | -                   | 630 00        |\n| Returning expenses of Mr. Dawson's party from Superior City to Toronto, by steamer and rail | -                   | 400 00        |\n| Further expenses of Mr. Hind's party in exploring the region about Manitobah, and in transacting business at Red River: | -                   |               |\n| Seven horses                                                              | -                   | 420 00        |\n| Three carts, with hire of men (eight men)                                  | -                   | 364 03        |\n| Feed for entire party, at 30 cents per day, for ninety days                | -                   | 824 00        |\n| Return by winter route via Lake of the Woods and Fort William             | -                   | 700 00        |\n| Camp equipage, ammunition, &c.                                             | -                   | 400 00        |\n| Deduct sale of seven horses, at a loss of 20 per cent                     | -                   | 336 00        |\n| Total expense of Mr. Dawson's party for 1858, after leaving Red River     | -                   | 6,640 00      |\n| Total expense of Mr. Hind's party, going to Red River, exploring, and returning | -                   | 7,322 00      |\n| Total combined expenses                                                   | -                   | 13,962 \u00a33,491 C'y. |\n\nExpense of the Exploration of the Assiniboine and Souris Rivers for tertiary coal, and of Lake Manitobah for salt, and of the country between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitobah, and the country\nbetween Winnipagoose Lake and the Assiniboine, and westerly to the Saskatchewan, as far as the season will permit, between Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitobah, in excess of the expense of sending supplies to Mr. Dawson, $1,872, say \u00a32,000 or 500l. currency.\n\n(Signed) H.

On your return from Montreal I shall be prepared to give you your instructions in reference to the localities in which your explorations are to be conducted, and as to the objects to which your attention is to be more especially directed.\n\nTo H. Y. Hind, Esq., Toronto.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 16, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that His Excellency the Governor-General has recently had under his consideration in Council, the subject of the organization for the present year of the exploring expedition in the neighbourhood of the Red River Settlement.\n\n2. His Excellency in Council has decided, with a view to keep down as much as possible the expense of the expedition this year, to dispense with the services of Mr. Gladman as its general manager.\n\n3. The exploration party will consist of two distinct divisions, of which one division will be placed under your direction and control, and the other under the direction, &c. of Professor Hind.\n\n4. Professor Hind is now engaged in making the necessary preparations for his departure for the Red River, and will probably set out from this in about ten days.\n\n5. Professor Hind has been instructed to take with him the men (14), canoes, and other supplies, which you require for the prosecution of your explorations, and to hand them over to you when you meet.\n\n6. You are to consider all the articles and materials of every description belonging to the Canadian Government connected with the expedition as available for the purposes of the expedition this year, and you and Professor Hind may therefore divide them between you in whatever way you may think most advantageous. Such articles, if any, as may not be required by either of you should be left in the custody of some trustworthy person to wait the orders of the Government.\n\n7. As soon as Professor Hind shall have handed over to you the men and canoes, &c. intended for you, each of you will be held separately responsible for the expense of his own party.\n\n8. It would facilitate the auditing of the accounts of the expedition for the future, if you would furnish me with a complete list of your party as soon as you receive the men to be furnished you by Professor Hind, with their several rates of pay and other details.\n\n9. I am to add that should you consider it advisable, you are at liberty to detain with you any of the individuals on either Mr. Gladman's or Mr. Napier's staff.\n\n10. All your reports should in future be made direct to the Government through this office.\n\n11. The instructions as to your future movements will be embodied in a separate communication.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\n\nJ. S. Dawson, Esq., Surveyor,\nCanadian Red River Expedition, Red River Settlement.\nSir,\n\nAdverting to the last paragraph in my letter to you this day, I have the honour to inform you that it is not thought necessary to make any alteration in the instructions for your future operations contained in the Order in Council of the 29th January last, and which have been communicated to you by Mr. Gladman.\n\n2. You will therefore consider those instructions, so far as your explorations, &c. are concerned, still in force.\n\n3. I am to add, however, that if time allows it, you will endeavour to survey the road between Gun Flint Lake and Pointe de Meuron, and when returning from the north-west corner of the Lake of the Woods, and passing through Rainy Lake, make occasional traverses, when practicable, with a view to ascertain the extent of arable land in that locality.\n\n4. I am further to state that His Excellency, having every confidence in your judgment, does not think it right to trammel your movements by detailed instructions, and that you are therefore at liberty to make any other explorations in addition to those particularly mentioned in the instructions already conveyed to you, should you, upon the information obtained in the locality, deem it desirable you should do so.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. LORANGER, Secretary.\n\nS. J. Dawson, Esq., Surveyor, in command of the Red River Expedition, Red River Settlement.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nPort Hope, April 15, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt, this morning, of your letter of yesterday\u2019s date, conveying to me formally the intimation that His Excellency the Governor-General in council deemed it advisable, with a view to reduce as much as possible the expenditure of the Red River exploration party for the current year, to dispense with my services as general conductor of the expedition, and that my official connexion with the expedition will terminate on the 22nd instant.\n\nAlso, that His Excellency has further been pleased to dispense with the services of all those individuals connected with the exploring party, who were under my more immediate control.\n\nAn opportunity being presented by a steamer going from Detroit to Superior City, and acting on your conversation with me on the 12th instant, I immediately wrote to my son and assistant (Henry Gladman) now at Fort William, directing him to cease all operations on his part in connexion with the explorations he was instructed to make between the Kaministiquia and Pigeon rivers, and to return to Toronto.\n\nHe is the only officer of the exploring party who can be said to have been under my immediate control.\n\nBy the memorandum of instructions which you were pleased to hand me on the 30th January, Mr. Dawson was directed to report, through me, to the Government, on the proceedings of the expedition in his department as surveyor.\n\nI beg to acquaint you that I have not received any report whatever from Mr. Dawson, therefore have no knowledge of his present position. His assistants, nominated and appointed by the Government at the outset of the expedition, continue under his control, as far as I know.\n\nOn the 13th instant I placed in the hands of Professor Hind the receipt given by Mr. Spalding for the two canoes and the paddles left by me at the Sault Ste. Marie, in October last, with an order for their delivery to him.\n\nMy son is further directed to take an inventory of all stores belonging to the Government, and to transfer to Mr. Hind whatever he may require.\n\nOn the 13th instant (in conformity with your personal instructions) I handed to the Auditor-General all the accounts of the expedition; amongst those documents will be found lists of the instruments, &c. furnished to Professor Hind, Mr. Dawson, and Mr. Napier, in whose custody they always have been.\n\nHaving left my son alone at Fort William, with natives only to assist and guide him in his explorations through the country, without money and with an exceedingly scanty stock of provisions, he must have been under the necessity of borrowing supplies from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, or from the French residents, both for his own subsistence and the payment of the natives employed. These supplies will of course have to be repaid. The quantity of supplies I have ordered to be sent forward to Superior City will amount to about 70l. only; I would therefore beg to suggest that Mr. Hind should by no means depend upon obtaining any portion of those supplies, but provide himself entirely from Toronto or from Detroit, as may be found most convenient.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) GEORGE GLADMAN.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary\u2019s Office, Toronto, April 27, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to communicate to you the instructions promised in the last paragraph of my letter to you of the 14th instant, for your guidance in connexion with the branch of the expedition to the west of Red River, which has been committed to your charge.\n\n2. The instructions contained in that letter will suffice for your guidance up to the time of your arrival at the Red River Settlement, and the present instructions therefore have reference merely to your operations after having left that settlement.\n\n3. The region of country to which your explorations are to be then directed is that lying to the west of Lake Winnipeg and Red River, and embraced (or nearly so) between the rivers Saskatchewan and Assiniboine, as far west as \u201cSouth Branch House,\u201d on the former river, which latter place will be the most westerly point of your exploration.\n\n4. It will be your endeavour to procure all the information in your power respecting the geology, natural history, topography, and meteorology of the region above indicated.\n\n5. As to the general character of the geological portion of your labours, it is unnecessary to add anything to the instructions communicated to you last year, and which, so far as this point is concerned, will serve for your guidance for the present season.\n6. There are, however, two matters to which I am to request you to direct your particular attention, namely, the salt region in the neighbourhood of Lake Manitoba, adverted to in your report for last year, and the deposit of tertiary coal or lignite reported to exist in the valley of Mouse River.\n\n7. It is most important that you should ascertain, by actual examination, as far as possible, the existence, extent, and character of these deposits.\n\n8. In ascending or descending the different rivers you may have occasion to explore, it is advisable that you should note with care their breadth, depth, rate of current, and the probable quantity of water discharged by them at different points, and at different seasons of the year, their facilities for navigation by boats or steamers, and whether they overflow their banks to any great extent at any season of the year.\n\n9. The general aspect of the whole regions should be carefully described. The character of the timber and soil observed, and the general fitness of the latter for agricultural purposes ascertained as far as may be from observation and inquiry.\n\n10. It is desirable that your meteorological observations should be made with the maximum and minimum thermometer, and with the wet and dry bulb. The temperature of the rivers, lakes, and springs should also be recorded, and the rain fall observed.\n\nAny reliable information you can obtain as to the quantity of snow precipitated during the winter would also be of interest.\n\n11. Your topographical explorations should be made with reference to the construction of a map (as complete as possible) of the region explored, on a scale of two miles to one inch; and your operations should be conducted in view of a possible extension, at some future time, of the exploration, so as to embrace the entire valley of Lake Winnipeg and its feeders.\n\n12. With a view to illustrate the natural history of the country, you will avail yourself of such opportunities as may present themselves to collect any objects that may be useful for that purpose.\n\n13. Any geological or natural history specimens which you may have collected during your explorations may be left by you at Red River on your return, with the other property of the Government belonging to the expedition, to await the orders of the Government, with the other articles referred to in the tenth paragraph of my letter of the 14th instant.\n\n14. I am to add that His Excellency, having every confidence in your judgment and discretion, does not wish to trammel you with more detailed instructions, and that you are left at liberty to make any other exploration in addition to those particularly named therein, should you, upon information obtained in the locality, deem it desirable for the general purposes of the expedition.\n\n15. It is hardly necessary to state that you will be held responsible for the conduct, diligence, and fidelity of the party under your charge.\n\n16. With a view to distinguish your branch of the expedition for the present year it will be convenient to designate it as the \"Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition,\" by this title, therefore, you will describe it in your report.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T. J. J. Loranger, Secretary.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nToronto, April 23, 1858.\n\nI respectfully ask permission to endeavour to make arrangements with Dr. McKay, the editor-in-chief of the \"Illustrated London News,\" and now in this city, to have published in the \"Illustrated London News\" a series of sketches of the forts belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, of Indians, and of scenery, either drawn by hand or taken by photograph during the proposed exploration of the valleys of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan under my charge.\n\nI would suggest that each sketch or photograph should be accompanied by a brief description furnished by myself, and in all instances sent to Toronto for your inspection and approval before transmission to London.\n\nI would further beg to suggest that it should be made, if possible, a condition of the arrangement, that stereotyped copies of all sketches or photographs taken during this exploration and published in the \"Illustrated London News\" be supplied by the proprietor of that journal for the purpose of illustrating my report and narrative of the progress of the expedition.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) H.

Loranger, Provincial Secretary.\n\n---\n\nSir,\n\nSecretary's Office, Toronto, April 27, 1858.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that His Excellency the Governor-General has been pleased to approve of the arrangement which, in your letter of the 23rd instant, you state you desire to be permitted to make with Mr. McKay, the editor of the \"Illustrated News,\" relative to the publication in that journal from time to time of sketches to illustrate the scenery, &c. of the country which you are about to explore this season.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that no charge will be made for the publication of the sketches, &c. in the \"Illustrated News.\"\n\nHis Excellency agrees with you in thinking that it would be very desirable to secure, if possible, from the proprietors of the \"News,\" stereotyped copies of any sketches furnished by you and published by them, for the purpose of illustrating your report.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) T.

Marie Canal.\n\n3. With the single exception of the Sault Ste Marie Canal, all the great public works which have been contrived and executed for the purpose of reducing the obstacles to uninterrupted navigation between the great lakes and the ocean lie within Canadian territory, and are under the control of the Canadian Government.\u2021\n\nElevation of Lake Superior above the Level of the Ocean according to Bayfield, Messrs. Foster and Whitney, Sir Wm. Logan, and Sir Jno. Richardson.\n\n4. The elevation of Lake Superior above the ocean level has been variously estimated by different observers. Captain Bayfield considered it to be 627 feet above the level of the sea, which altitude is adopted by the narrators of Agassiz's tour in that region; and by Messrs. Foster and Whitney in their Report on the Geology of the Lake Superior Land District; Sir William Logan, in his Geological Report for 1846-7, states that its surface is 597 feet above the ocean; and in Professor Hall's Geology of the 4th District, N.Y., 596 feet is its assigned elevation. Sir John Richardson assumed its level to be 641 feet above the ocean.\n\n* The Sault Ste. Marie Canal is one mile and an eighth in length, seventy feet wide at bottom, and 100 at water line, depth twelve feet. The average lift of the locks is seventeen feet six inches.\n\n\u2020 See a map of the Province of Canada, showing the connexion by steam navigation of the region of the great lakes with Europe, by the route of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes, prepared for the Canadian Commissioners of the Paris Exhibition, by Thomas Kuffer, C.E., Montreal, 1855.\n\n\u2021 The cost of the construction of these remarkable links in the chain of unbroken communication, which now penetrates a distance exceeding 2000 miles into the interior of the North American Continent, approaches $15,000,000, and the annual revenue has risen from $131,000 in 1850, to $337,896 in 1856.\nMr. Keefer finds the Level to be 600 feet above the Ocean.\n\n5. The altitude deduced in 1855 by Mr. Keefer, for the map prepared for the Canadian Commissioners at the Paris Exhibition, with the advantages and information derived from the levels obtained in the construction of various railways and canals from the ocean to Lake Superior, established a difference of only three feet in excess of that obtained by Sir William Logan in 1847.\n\n6. The occasional fluctuations in the level of the waters of Lake Superior certainly exceed three feet, so that the elevation in the foregoing table of 600 feet is probably a correct estimate of the mean height of the waters of this Kitchi-gum-mi,* or Great Lake of the Ojibways, above the ocean.\n\nNature of the Barriers opposing further progress.\n\n7. The barrier which opposes further westward progress by steam or boat navigation follows the general direction of the north-western and western coast of Lake Superior. Near Fond du Lac, in the territory of the United States, the dividing ridge is distant from the St. Louis River about eighteen miles, in a southerly direction, and here the elevation of the ridge is 475 feet above the waters of the lake.\n\nSuperior City distant from the Navigable Portion of the Mississippi, above Crow Wing, only forty-nine miles.\n\n8. Kettle River, flowing into the St. Croix, a tributary of the Mississippi, issues from a small lake not twenty miles from Lake Superior, and the distance of the navigable portion of the Mississippi adjoining Sandy Lake is scarcely forty-five miles from Fond du Lac. The Mississippi is said to be navigable for steamers of light draught from Crow Wing to beyond this point, and Crow Wing is 130 miles from St. Paul by the travelled road, and less than 120 miles in an air line from Superior City.\n\nThe Route by Superior City to Crow Wing, a line of future commercial importance.\n\n9. The construction of a plank road between Superior City and Crow Wing is already in contemplation, and the route is even now occasionally travelled. This line of communication between the valley of the Mississippi and the great lakes, will no doubt become of great commercial importance to the region of the Upper Mississippi and its numerous tributaries; and it is not improbable that its influence may extend to other water-sheds, viz., those of Rainy Lake, Red River, and the Saskatchewan.\n\nDistance between dividing Ridges of Lake Superior and Rainy Lake.\n\n10. The dividing ridge between the Embanans River, a tributary of the St. Louis River, and Vermillion River, which flows into the valley of Rainy Lake, is about forty-eight miles in an air line from the north-west coast of Lake Superior. On the Pigeon River, which forms the boundary between the United States and Canada, the dividing ridge is only twenty-eight miles in an air line from the north-west coast of the same great water level, but by the course of Pigeon River this height of land, or Ash-a-soi-si-ta-gon Lake, is more that double that distance.\n\nRoutes from Valley of Lake Superior to that of Rainy Lake in Canadian Territory.\n\n11. In Canadian territory there are several routes by which access is gained from the valley of Lake Superior to that of Rainy Lake. The most southerly of these is the old North-West Company's frontier route by Pigeon River, already referred to; the second by the Kaministiquia River, which forms the main subject of the first section of this report; the third an Indian route by Current River to Great Dog Lake; and the fourth an Indian route by the Neepigon to Winnipeg Rivers.\n\n12. A brief notice of the Pigeon River route, with a glance at the Current River and Neepigon River routes may not be out of place before proceeding to describe in detail the topography of the Kaministiquia route.\n\nSKETCH OF THE PIGEON RIVER ROUTE TO THE HEIGHT OF LAND SHOWN ON THE CHART.\n\n(See accompanying Chart.)\n\nPigeon River Route.\n\nCascades numerous: Timber of the Country, Poplar, Spruce, and Birch.\n\n13. Pigeon River debouches into Lake Superior about 150 miles in a north-easterly direction from Fond du Lac, or Superior City, in an air line, but little over thirty miles from Fort William, and fifteen miles from the south-west corner of Ile Royale. The first falls occur one mile and a half from the mouth of the stream, and the river is here seventy-five feet broad, the perpendicular descent is sixty feet. Below the falls, the river runs through a deep gorge from fifteen to twenty feet in width; about one mile further up a small fall occurs, and a mile and a half beyond a perpendicular fall of nineteen feet is caused by a dyke of greenstone, bearing east and west. Above this fall is a rapid, which extends eleven feet in forty yards; it rushes between hills on either side of the river, three and four hundred feet in height. Between the mouth of Arrow River and the Great Cascades the river presents a succession of rapids and small falls; the country is rolling and covered with poplar, spruce, and birch.\n\nThe Grand Portage nine miles long.\n\n14. The Great Cascades are one mile below the west end of Grand Portage, once the site of Fort Charlotte, for many years the most important post of the North-West Fur Company. In the distance of 400 yards the river falls 144 feet. Three quarters of a mile beyond the Great Cascades several rapids occur, and the river flows between Slate Hills until the west end of the Grand Portage is gained. To avoid all these obstructions, the Grand Portage of about eight miles and a quarter is made from Grand Portage Bay, on Lake Superior, to this point of the river.\n\n* Spelt by Longfellow Gitche-Gumee, Big Sea Water (Hiawatha).\n2nd, 3rd, and 4th Portages.\n\n15. Calling the Grand Portage the first portage on this route, which it really becomes; if, instead of ascending the river, transhipment is made directly from Grand Portage Bay on Lake Superior: the second transhipment will be round three perpendicular cascades, having, with the accompanying rapids, an aggregate fall of fifty-five feet. The third portage is 630 paces long. The fourth portage is 750 paces long, and avoids a rapid.\n\n5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Portages.\n\n16. The fifth portage is 2,200 paces long, and terminates at the lower end of Lac du Coq, or Fowl Lake. The sixth portage is 550 paces long, and leads to Moose Lake. At the upper end of Moose Lake a portage, marked on Thompson's map as 2'24 miles or 4,505 yards long, leads to Arrow River. The seventh portage (Great Cherry Carrying Place) is 1,035 paces long, and leads to Lower Lilly Lake. The ninth portage (Lesser Cherry Carrying Place) is 300 paces long, and leads to Hill Lake (Mountain Lake), seven miles and a half long, and a quarter to one-half mile in width.\n\n10th, 11th, and 12th Portages.\n\n17. The tenth portage is 640 paces long, and leads to Watab Lake. The eleventh portage is 3,315 paces long, and terminates at Mud Lake, the source of Arrow River. About a mile from the east end of Mud Lake the portage begins, which leads to a small lake, tributary to Wisacode River. This portage is about 1,000 yards long; the stream, before entering the lake, has a fall of 66 feet. The twelfth is 480 paces in length, and leads to Ashawinisitagom Lake.\n\nThe 13th Portage leads over the Height of Land.\n\n18. The thirteenth portage is 540 paces, and leads over the dividing ridge, between the tributaries of Lake Superior and those of Hudson's Bay, to the source of Rainy Lake River, passing into and through Gun-flint Lake, and thence into Lake Seiganogah, with numerous cascades and picturesque falls.\n\nAdvantages of the Pigeon River Route.\u2014Comparison of Distances.\n\n19. The Pigeon River route has the advantage of being much shorter than by the Kaministiquia, and on to the west side of the height of land it is said to possess facilities for boat communication, which are not enjoyed by the route from Mille Lacs to Rainy Lake, the lake and rivers through which it passes having a greater body and depth of water. In former times it used to be much travelled by the voyageurs in the service of the North-West Company. Grand Portage Bay is only 220 miles east of Rainy Lake, while Fort William, on the Kaministiquia, is 263 from the same point.*\n\n---\n\nA SKETCH OF CURRENT RIVER ROUTE TO THE GREAT DOG LAKE.\n\nCurrent River Falls in Thunder Bay.\n\n20. About six miles in a north-east by east direction from Fort William, on the Kaministiquia, the waters of Current River are seen to fall over a precipitous ledge of black aguillaceous slate, within a few yards of their exit into Thunder Bay.\n\nCharacter of the Forests in the Valley of Current River.\n\n21. A succession of rapids and cascades, which in the aggregate, perhaps, exceed forty feet in height, occur within the space of half a mile from the mouth of the river, and forests of canoe birch, balsam, white and black spruce, tamarack, and cedar, with mountain ash and other small trees, fringe its rocky banks and occupy its shallow valley.\n\nOf the Soil.\n\n22. The soil is of small depth, and reposes upon the slates, generally without the intervention of a subsoil, but is covered, over large areas, with moss to the depth of one foot and more.\n\nCountry back of Thunder Bay.\n\n23. Mr. M'Intyre, the gentleman in charge at Fort William, stated that the vegetation and country back of Thunder Bay, in the valley of this small river, for a distance of about fifteen miles, was similar to what we saw near its mouth. The moss which covers the thin coating of soil resting on the slates increases in depth as we retire from the lake, until it gives place to a better soil and timber of larger growth, within twelve to fifteen miles in an air line from the mouth of the stream.\n\nCurrent River the Winter Route of Indians to Great Dog Lake.\n\n24. The valley of this river forms the winter route of the Indians from Thunder Bay to Great Dog Lake, and while the Great Dog Portage, by the circuitous route of the Kaministiquia, is not less than forty-three miles from Fort William, Great Dog Lake is reached by the valley of Current River in an eighteen or twenty miles march from Thunder Bay.\n\nA Road from Pointe Meuron, on the Kaministiquia River to Dog Lake, would save many miles of a difficult Canoe Route.\n\n25. In making their winter journey to Great Dog Lake, the Indians generally proceed, we were informed, from the Mission in the neighbourhood of Fort William to the mouth of Current River,\n\n* For the foregoing brief notice of the route by Pigeon River as far as the height of land, I am indebted to the Report of Dr. J. G. Norwood, which will be found in extenso, in a Report on a Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, by Dr. D. D. Owen, U.S.G., and to the Map constructed by David Thompson, Esq., in 1826, by order of the Commissioners for the Boundary Survey.\nand ascend its open and unencumbered course, reaching Dog Lake in one day from Fort William. A cursory inspection of the map will show that the direct line of route from Fort William, or rather from Pointe Meuron through the forest, if a track were cleared, would save several miles.*\n\nHeight of Dog Lake and Length of Portages on the Canoe Route.\n\n26. The height of Great Dog Lake above Lake Superior is 710 feet, and to reach it in canoes by the route of the Kaministiquia involves portages, which in the aggregate amount to 325 chains, or four miles in length, with an ascent nearly equal to the elevation of Great Dog Lake above Superior.\n\nImportance of Current River Route.\n\n27. As a means of communication between Thunder Bay and Great Dog Lake, the Indian Trail up the valley of Current River appears to be of sufficient importance to require this special notice, and a bird's-eye view of the country from the summit of the Great Dog Portage, showed no mountainous range between that point and Lake Superior, apparently equal in altitude to the great barrier of Dog Lake, which at the summit from where the sketch which accompanies this report was taken, exceeds 850 feet above Lake Superior; it acquires additional importance from the fact that a travelled Indian canoe route and winter road exists between Dog Lake and Thousand Lacs, on the west side of the height of land.\n\nA SKETCH OF THE NEEPIGON\u2020 ROUTE TO WINIPEG RIVER.\n\nAn Indian Route not much travelled or known.\n\n28. An Indian canoe route, respecting which little certain is known. The Mission Indians on the Kaministiquia describe it as passing through a large number of lakes not figured on any map to which I have had access, and communicating with Rainy Lake by Mille Lacs, or with the Winnipeg River, through numerous large lakes, among which Lac Sal, near the height of land, is the most extensive.\n\nOutlet of Neepigon River.\n\n29. The Neepigon River has its outlet in Neepigon Bay, about sixty miles in a direction north-east from Fort William, but by the canal route round the coast, a much longer distance.\n\n30. The route from the Neepigon enters the Winnipeg River a short distance above Island Portage, by a large river, named English River, which is now used as a canal route by the Hudson's Bay Company's servants from Red River to Moose Factory, at the mouth of Moose River, on James Bay, and formerly at rare intervals to Lake Superior.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE KAMINISTQUIA ROUTE.\u2014THUNDER BAY TO GREAT DOG LAKE.\n\nThunder Bay, 31\u2014Entrance to the Harbour, 32\u2014The Welcome Island, 33\u2014Channel of the River, 34\u2014Banks of the River, 35\u2014Mission of the Immaculate Conception, 36\u2014McKay's Mountain, 37\u2014Maple on McKay's Mountain, 38\u2014The Village at the Mission, 39\u2014Freezing and drying on the River, 40\u2014Indian Camp, 41\u2014Limnoriae, 42\u2014Remains of extensive settlements, 44\u2014Vegetation, 45\u2014Rapid, 45\u2014The Grand Falls of Kakabeka, 46\u2014Height of, 47, 48\u2014Alluvial Valley, 49\u2014Vegetation of, 50\u2014Area of Cultivable Land in, 51\u2014Limit of Good Land, 52\u2014Falls and Rapids, 53\u2014Vegetation poor, 54\u2014Burnt Forest, 55\u2014The Great Dog Portage, 56\u2014View from, 46\u2014Physical Situation of the Great Dog Mountains, 57\u2014Much good land on the peaks of the Great Dog, 58\u2014Track of a Team, 59\u2014Black Spruce Swamp, 59\u2014Labrador Tea Plant, 59\u2014Coal Wells in Moss, 59\u2014Good Road on the Great Dog, 60\u2014Section of Great Dog Portage, 60.\n\nThunder Bay, Position and Extent.\n\n31. Thunder Bay, which receives the waters of the Kaministiquia, forms a portion of the north-west expansion of Lake Superior. It is the most southerly of three large and deep land-locked bays which characterize this part of the coast, and it is situated between the parallels 48\u00b0 13' and 48\u00b0 30' north latitude, and in longitude 89\u00b0 and 89\u00b0 30' west of Greenwich. Its greatest length in a northeasterly direction is thirty-two miles, and its breadth from Thunder Cape to the mouth of the Kaministiquia, upon which Fort William is situated, about fourteen miles.\n\nEntrance to the Harbour exceeds 180 feet in depth.\n\n32. The main entrance to the bay is between the imposing headlands of Thunder Cape, 1,350 feet above the lake level and Pie Island, five miles, south-west of the cape, with an altitude of 850 feet. The depth of water in this broad entrance exceeds 180 feet, and a measure of sixty feet to 120 feet is maintained in many parts of the bay.\n\nThe Welcome Islands, Water inside, thirty feet; Water on the Bar varies from three and a half to five feet and a half.\n\n33. Immediately opposite, and east of the three mouths of the Kaministiquia, the Welcome Islands are distant about two miles, and inside of these islands from sixty to thirty feet of water is shown on Bayfield's chart. Within half a mile of the river's mouth the water shoals rapidly, and the bar has a variable depth of three and a half to five feet and a half water upon it; but within one thousand yards of the north or main channel, twelve to fourteen feet water is maintained. Land is forming fast near the mouths of the river, and large areas in advance of the increasing delta sustain a thick growth of rushes.\n\n* In the Current River speckled trout are numerous, and its valley abounds with red and black currants, raspberries, strawberries and gooseberries, wherever sufficient light and air for their growth obtains admittance into the forest which covers the country.\n\n\u2020 Neepigon\u2014dirty water\u2014Nee-pi-gon.\n\n\u2021 Spelt Kaministikwoya by Sir Jno. Richardson, \"the river that runs far about.\"\nMain Channel of River; Fort William situated on it; Aspect of the Country about the Fort.\n\n34. At a distance of about half a mile from the exit of the northern or main channel Fort William is situated. Upon the left or north bank, and opposite, is a large island formed by the middle channel of the Kaministiquia, which branches off from the main stream, about one mile and a half from the bay. In the time of the North-West Company this island was denuded of the trees it sustained, which consisted mainly of tamarack, for fuel and other purposes, and the greater portion is now covered with second growth. A large area south of the fort still remains destitute of wood, and forms the site of an Ojibway village, besides serving as an excellent open pasture ground for a herd of cows belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, which swim across the river every morning, a distance of 400 feet, and return at an early hour in the afternoon to the farmyard in the vicinity of the fort.\n\nBanks of River low.\u2014Timber, Soil, &c.\n\n35. The banks of the river here are low and flat, not exceeding ten feet in altitude. In the rear of the fort tamarack of small but dense growth prevails. The soil is a light sandy loam reposing on yellowish clay.\n\nMission of the Immaculate Conception.\u2014Indian Reserve embraces much good Land.\n\n36. Two miles above the fort, and in a direction nearly south from it, the third or southern outlet separates from the main channel. The banks of the river continue to rise above the level of its waters until they attain, at the Mission of the Immaculate Conception, an altitude of eighteen or twenty feet. Near the Mission the Indian Reserve of about twenty-five square miles begins; it embraces the best and largest area of cultivable land in the valley of the Kaministiquia, and much of it being situated on the flanks of M'Kay's mountain range, portions possess many advantages which do not belong to the available tracts near the shores of Thunder Bay.*\n\nM'Kay's Mountain.\n\n37. The general course of the river above the Mission for a distance of nine miles is towards the south-west, by very tortuous windings. Five miles from Fort William it approaches the base of the elevated table-land, to which M'Kay's Mountain forms an imposing and abrupt termination. M'Kay's Mountain has an elevation of 1,000 feet above the lake, and is the north-eastern boundary of an irregular but extended plateau, whose south-eastern flank follows the trend of the coast as far as Pigeon River.\n\nMaple and other Hardwoods grown on the flanks of M'Kay's Mountain.\u2014The Area over which good Timber extends is very large, following the Trap Ranges.\u2014Soil at the Mission.\n\n38. It is worthy of remark, that the flanks of M'Kay's Mountain support a heavy growth of hardwood timber (maple, &c.), and from various sources I was informed that this heavily timbered land stretches far to the south-west, on the side and borders of the table land. The rock formations which comprise the country between the Kaministiquia and Pigeon Rivers, indicate the presence of a fertile soil on the flank of the irregular table-land; the trap with which the slates are associated giving rise upon disintegration to a soil of superior character. At the Mission a light reddish loam constitutes the soil; this reposes, to a depth of six feet upon a bluish grey clay, which extends from the water's edge to ten feet lower.\n\nThe Village of the Mission very thriving, and consists of 30 to 35 houses, well built of wood.\n\n39. The Mission of the Immaculate Conception is under the charge of the Rev. Jean Pierre Chor\u00e9 who has resided on the banks of the Kaministiquia for nine years. From that gentleman, who kindly afforded me every information respecting this valley in his power, I obtained numerous facts of interest in relation to its adaptation for settlement. At the Mission there are already congregated from thirty to thirty-five houses, substantially built of wood, and in their general arrangement and construction far superior to the log houses of Canadian pioneers in the forest. Many of them were surrounded with gardens, a few of which were in a good state of cultivation, and with some small fields fenced with post and rail.\n\nFreezing and thawing of the River, 15th November and 10th April.\n\n40. The average period of the river freezing is from the 3rd to the 15th November, and it becomes free from ice between the 20th and 23rd of April. The present year has proved an exception in many respects: the ice did not pass out of the river until the 13th of May, and on the 1st of August, the day of my visit, the waters of the river were higher than they had ever been known before at that season of the year.\n\nIndian Corn does not ripen at the Mission, but ripens in flank of M'Kay's Mountain.\n\n41. Indian corn will not succeed in this settlement, early and late frosts cutting it off. Frost occurs here, under the influence of the cold expanse of Lake Superior, until the end of June, and begins again towards the end of August. A few miles further up the river, west of M'Kay's Mountain, the late and early frosts are of rare occurrence, and it was stated that Indian corn would ripen on the flanks of M'Kay's Mountain.\n\nFour or five miles up the River many Vegetables succeed well, which will not grow near the Lake.\n\n42. All kinds of small grain succeed well at the Mission, and the reason why they have not been more largely cultivated is owing to the want of a mill for the purpose of converting them into flour or meal. Near the lake, at Fort William, for instance, oats do not always ripen: the cold air from the lake, whose\n\n* By treaty concluded in 1850, between the Hon. W. B. Robinson and Joseph Jeande Chat and his tribe, a reservation to commence about two miles from Fort William on the right bank of the river Kaministiquia, thence westerly six miles, parallel to the shores of the lake; thence northerly five miles; thence easterly to the right bank of the said river, so as not to interfere with any acquired right of the Hon. Hudson's Bay Company.\nsurface fifty miles from land showed a temperature on the close of the hottest month of the year of 39\u00b05, is sufficient to prevent many kinds of vegetables from acquiring maturity, which succeed admirably four or five miles up the river.\n\nLimestone exists in the Neighbourhood.\u2014Ruins of a Kiln seen.\n\n43. Fragments of limestone have been procured in the neighbourhood, but the locality could not be pointed out by any of its inhabitants. The ruins of a lime kiln, used by the North-West Company, have been discovered, and it is very probable that the limestone was obtained from the crystalline layers, the existence of which has been established over wide areas in Thunder Bay by Sir William Logan, and are noticed by him as being of a \"reddish white colour, and very compact, some of which would yield good material for burning.\" These beds of impure limestone are mentioned by Mr. Murray (Geological Survey, Canada, 1846-7) as occurring in the lower portions of the formation occupying this valley.*\n\nRemains of extensive Settlements not uncommon.\n\n44. It is worthy of notice that substantial records of far more extensive settlements than now exist and a higher degree of civilization and improvement, are found at or near the various posts along this route, and particularly at Fort William, which date from the time of the North-West Company: many of these lie only in the recollection of the voyageurs. There is reason to believe that much valuable knowledge respecting the resources of particular localities has been forgotten, or is hidden in the memories of those who may have neither interest or opportunity to make it known. For an account of the progress of the seasons at Fort William, see Appendix (1), p. 141.\n\nClay Banks of the River.\u2014Vegetation rich and luxuriant.\u2014First Rapids.\n\n45. Opposite McKay's Mountain the clay banks of the river were about fifteen feet high, and continued to rise on one side or the other until they attained an elevation of nearly sixty feet, often, however, retiring from the present bed of the river, and giving place to an alluvial terrace, some eight or ten feet in altitude, and clothed with the richest profusion of grasses and twining flowering plants. The current begins to be rapid about nine miles from Fort William, soon after passing Point de Meuron, the site of a fort established by Lord Selkirk, and continues so, in the ascending course of the stream, to the foot of the first demi-portage, called the \"D\u00e9charges des Pareseux,\" where a rock exposure creates the rapids which occasion the portage. The fall here is five feet one inch in a distance of 924 feet. The distance of this portage from the lake, by the windings of the river, is about twentytwo miles and a quarter, and the total rise probably reaches thirty-nine feet.\n\nThe Grand Falls of Kakabeka.\n\n46. The current continues rapid up to the foot of the Grand Falls, and high rock exposures commence on the precipitous banks three miles below them. These gradually assume the form of mural cliffs, capped with drift, increasing in altitude until they attain at the foot of the Grand Falls the height of about 160 feet on the left bank, while on the opposite side of the river the mountain portage path winds round the steep of a bold projecting escarpment ninety-one feet in altitude, and nearly half a mile from the falls.\n\nHeight of the Grand Falls.\n\n47. At our camp, seven miles below the Grand or Kakabeka Falls, as they are termed, the level of the river was estimated to be forty feet above Lake Superior, and the foot of the falls sixteen feet higher. The Grand Falls themselves were found, by levelling, to have an altitude of 119\u00b005 feet, and involved a portage of sixty-two chains or three-quarters of a mile. They are distant from the mouth of the river by its windings about thirty miles, and in an air line seventeen miles.\n\nAltitude of the Grand Falls by different Observers.\n\n48. As the altitude of these falls has attracted the attention of several observers, the different results obtained may not be without interest.\n\n| Altitude ascertained by levelling | Mr. Dawson, (August 1837) | - | - | - | - | 119\u00b005 |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---|---|---|---|--------|\n| Capt.

The alluvial valley of the river, from about three miles below the Mountain Portage to Fort William, varies in breadth from a few hundred yards to one mile; the breadth occupied by land of a quality which might fit it for agricultural purposes, extends to near the summit of the flank of a low table-land, which marks the true limit of the river valley, and the average breadth of this may be double that of the strictly alluvial portion.\n\nVegetation of the Valley.\n\n50. The low table-land is thinly wooded with small pine, and the soil is poor and dry. The alluvial valley sustains elm, aspen, balsam, poplar, ash, butternut, and a very luxuriant profusion of grasses, vetches, and climbing plants; among which the wild hop, honeysuckle, and convolvulus are the most\n\n* Geological Survey of Canada, 1846-7, p. 15.\n\u2020 See p. 361 of the New York Edition of Sir John Richardson's Arctic Searching Expedition.\nconspicuous. The rear portion of the valley, with an admixture of the trees just named, contains birch, balsam, white and black spruce, and some heavy aspens. The underbrush embraces hazel nut, cherries of two varieties, &c.\n\nArea of cultivable Land in the Valley of the Kaministiquia exceeds 20,000 acres, not including the flanks of McKay's Mountain.\n\n51. Occasionally the flanks of the low table-land approach the river, contract the valley, and give an unfavourable aspect to the country. This occurs near the Decharges des Paresseux and at most of the heavier rapids. The area available for agricultural purposes below the Grand Falls probably exceeds 20,000 acres; but if the flanks of McKay's Mountain be included in the estimate a large addition may with propriety be assumed.\n\nThe Grand Falls mark the Limit of available Country for Agricultural Purposes in the Valley of this River.\n\n52. The Grand Falls mark the limit of a tract of country differing in many important physical aspects from the valley of the river lower down. From black argillaceous slates we pass to a region in which granite, gneiss, and chlorita schist prevail, and where the vegetation is often scanty and poor.\n\nFalls and Rapids, with their Descents.\n\n53. The course of the river is almost due north to Little Dog Lake, and its flow much broken by falls and rapids, which occasion in a distance of nineteen miles six portages and five discharges. The falls have respectively an altitude of 6'59 feet; Ecart\u00e9 Portage (Nicolet Portage) 12'62 feet; Portage de l'Isle (third above Ka-ka-be-ka) 6'90 feet; Recouss Portage (fourth above Ka-ka-be-ka) 25 feet; (Couteau Portage) 3 feet; (Portage des Martres) and 14'94 feet (Little Dog Portage).\n\nVegetation poor.\n\n54. In the forests which lined the banks at the different discharges the canoe birch was frequently seen eighteen inches in diameter, the underbrush consisted chiefly of hazel nut: wherever the gneissoid and syenite rock prevailed the valley of the river was much contracted, the timber light, and the soil shallow and full of boulders or detached masses of rock. The volume of water in the river appeared to be very small, considering its unusual height at this season of the year. An approximate measurement at one of the rapids gave a breadth of seventy with an average depth of two feet.\n\nBurnt Forest. Luxuriant Vegetation on the Great Dog Mountain.\n\n55. Extensive areas covered with burnt forest trees, consisting chiefly of pine, occur in the valley of the river as far as Little Dog Lake, when the formidable barrier of the Great Dog Mountain, sustaining a heavy growth of timber, comes into view. Occasionally aspens of large dimensions may be seen from the canoe, but it is not until the plateau of the Great Dog Mountain is attained that they acquire a diameter reaching eighteen or twenty-four inches, five feet from the ground. Trees of this species and of the above dimensions are found in abundance on the elevated barrier which separates the region of Great Dog Lake from the valley of the Kaministikwia, 347'81 feet below.\n\nThe Great Dog Portage elevation above Little Dog Lake. View from the Great Dog Mountain.\n\n56. The Great Dog Portage* rises 490 feet above the level of the Little Dog Lake, and at the greatest elevation of the ridge cannot be less than 500 feet over the same lake. The difference between the levels of Little and Great Dog lakes is 347'81 feet, and the length of the portage between them one mile and fifty-three chains. The view from the summit of the Great Dog (more than 700 feet above Lake Superior) is very striking. Little Dog Lake lies at our feet, an unbroken forest of pines dotted with groves of aspen and birch, and in the swamp portions with tamarack, stretches in all directions from east to west, being bounded in the view by the distant undulating outline of the wooded hills, which limit the valley of the Kaministikwia. A portion of the abrupt escarpment of the elevated table-land in the neighbourhood of McKay's Mountain was distinctly visible.\n\nPhysical Structure of the Great Dog Mountain.\n\n57. The base of the Great Dog Mountain consists of a gneissoid rock supporting numerous boulders and fragments of the same material. A level plateau of clay then occurs for about a quarter of a mile, from which rises, at a very acute angle and to an altitude of 283 feet above Little Dog Lake, an immense bank or ridge of stratified sand, holding small water-worn pebbles. The bank of sand continues to the summit of the portage or 185 feet above the clay plateau. The portage path does not pass over the highest part of the sand ridge. East of the path it is probable that its summit is 500 feet, as before stated, above the Little Dog Lake.\n\nMuch good Land on the flanks of the Great Dog Mountain.\n\n58. In an endeavour to reach the head of Little Dog River, before it begins to make in its short course of\u2020 about four or five miles, a descent of 347 feet, I found that much of the soil on the flanks of the Great Dog Mountain was far superior to the average quality in the valley of the Kaministikwia. It consisted of a clay loam, with a gravelly subsoil, containing numerous pebbles and water-worn fragments of rock: this was particularly noticed on the flanks and surface of the lower plateau.

On approaching the source of Little Dog River a black spruce swamp was found to occupy an extensive area, but little above the level of the river. The clay soil in this swamp was covered to the depth of two feet with moss, which was again largely overgrown with the Labrador tea plant. Small holes in the moss filled with clear cool water afforded a striking contrast to the heated water of the rivers and lakes; the temperature of these shallow wells did not exceed $42^\\circ$, while the water of Great Dog Lake, tested a few hours afterwards (half-past five p.m.), was $69^\\circ$, a difference of $27^\\circ$.\n\nA good Road could be constructed in the flanks of the Great Dog Mountain and the 148 feet of ascent.\n\nSection of Dog Portage.\n\n60. The Great Sand Bank declines in steppes towards the river, and by turning its flank an excellent level road on the side of the first plateau could be constructed, with a length not exceeding twice that of the present portage path which rises over 140 feet above the lake to which it leads. The following section, kindly furnished me by Mr. Napier, will exhibit the relation of the several plateaux to one another and to Great Dog Lake.\n\n| Height in Feet | Distance in Feet | Little Dog Lake |\n|---------------|-----------------|----------------|\n|               |                 |                |\n| 163'53        | 1000            | Beginning of First Plateau. |\n| 215'00        | 1450            | Termination of do. |\n| 251'74        | 1650            | Beginning of Second Plateau. |\n| 283'78        | 2550            | End of Second Plateau, and commencement of Sand Bank. |\n| 468'19        | 3300            | Commencement of Third Plateau. |\n| 472'00        | 5920            | End of Third Plateau. |\n| 490'00        | 6180            | Summit of level and commencement of Fourth Plateau. |\n| 474'00        | 7400            | End of Fourth Plateau, and commencement of descent to edge of cliff. |\n| 395'00        | 8680            | End of descent. |\n| 348'00        | 8712            | Bottom of cliff, and level of Great Dog Lake. |\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nGREAT DOG LAKE TO THE HEIGHT OF LAND.\n\nArea of Great Dog Lake, 61\u2014Vegetation, 61\u2014Depth of water in Great Dog Lake, 62\u2014Distance from Fort William, 63\u2014Great Dog Lake an old centre of communication, and is connected with Mille Lacs, 64\u2014Many other routes probably exist, 65\u2014Professor Keating speaks of these routes 33 years ago, 66\u2014Valley of Dog River, 67\u2014Banks alluvial, 67, 70\u2014Ancient Forest, 71\u2014Action of ice, 72\u2014Labrador Tea, 73\u2014Dam at mouth of Little Dog River, 73\u2014Climate, 74\u2014Action of Ice, 74\u2014Prairie River, 75\u2014Sources of Dog River, 76\u2014Height of Land and Barrier, 77\u2014Prairie Portage, 78\u2014Height of Land Lake, 78\u2014Vegetable of Prairie Portage, 79\u2014Height and Distances, 80, 81\u2014Temperature of Lakes and Rivers, 82.\n\nArea of Dog Lake about 200 square miles.\n\n61. The area of Great Dog Lake, according to Mr. Murray,* whose opportunities of examining it were considerably greater than those of the members of the Exploring Expedition, probably exceeds 200 square miles; and, according to that gentleman, the country surrounding it is hilly, and covered with forests in which white spruce prevails, interspersed with groves of aspens, and occasionally dotted with the Weymouth (white) and Banksian (red) pines; white and yellow birch are abundant, and some of them of large dimensions. The lake is bounded by bold primary rocks, and studded with innumerable islands.\n\nDepth of Water in Great Dog Lake very great.\n\n62. The traverse of the canoe route, from the head of the Great Dog Portage to the mouth of Dog River, is about eleven miles in length, and the lake is seen to stretch far to the north of the last-named point; the canoe route follows closely the direction of its longest diameter, which is nearly due north and south; the depth of water, as ascertained by occasional soundings along the line of traverse, is very considerable. In one instance, seventy-two feet was recorded about 200 yards from a low rocky shore, and another sounding showed ninety feet half a mile from land: both of these soundings are marked on the map which accompanies this report.\n\nDistance of Great Dog Lake from Fort William, eighteen miles, in an air line.\u2014Former extension of Dog Lake visible.\n\n63. The position of this lake in relation to Thunder Bay is interesting, as it forms the termination of a long land traverse from Current River, which is used by the Indians during the winter season; its distance in an air line from Fort William is about nineteen miles; whereas, by the windings of the Kaministiquia, it is fifty-five miles and a quarter: the former extension of Dog Lake in a westerly direction up the valley of the river of the same name, for fourteen or fifteen miles, is probably shown by numerous sand ridges which cross the valley of Dog River nearly at right angles to its course, as well as by the probable former extension of a portion of the Great Sand Ridge Barrier, which has been described as occurring at the Great Dog Portage, across the valley of the Little Dog River.\n\n* Report of Progress for the year 1846\u20137.\nGreat Dog Lake an old Centre of Communication for the Indians.\u2014Is connected with Mille Lacs.\n\n64. Great Dog Lake appears to be a certain centre of communication to which some degree of speculative interest may be attached; our guides pointed out the direction from one of the great westerly bays, through which a communication with Thousand Lakes, on the other side of the watershed. No doubt the route through this communication passes through extensive marshes, yet, if it avoids the objectionable ascent of Prairie River and Portage, it may be worthy of attention. Thousand Lakes, or Mille Lacs, as it is more commonly called, is \u2014 feet above Lake Superior, consequently above Dog Lake.\n\nThis Route an old Route.\u2014Many others probably exist.\n\n65. This route has long been known to the voyageurs and to the Indians about Fort William, and the same may be remarked of many other routes of which the Indian guides speak, and attempt to describe. Thirty-three years ago it was an old \u201cpath,\u201d and may have been one for centuries to the Indians of this region. No doubt that water communications superior to those now travelled may yet be found, but it seems clear that until the watershed of Rainy Lake is reached, no communication holding up sufficient water to form a boat route exists, or can be made without extensive and repeated dams.\n\nProfessor Keating speaks of this Route thirty-three years ago.\n\n66. Professor Keating, so far back as 1823, relates that his party were shown an arm of the Lake which extends to the south-west, and which they were informed connects Great Dog Lake by an uninterrupted water communication with the Thousand Lakes. The route is shorter than that by Prairie Portage, but much filled with rapids. The same authority says that there is a communication between the Kaministiquia and Thousand Lakes passing more to the south than that from Dog Lake.*\n\nValley of Dog River flooded in Spring, extending Dog Lake many miles in a Westerly Direction.\n\n67. So sluggish is the flow of water in Dog River that a rise of ten feet in the level of the lake would push back its waters to a distance of thirty-five miles up the tortuous course of that stream, and the voyageurs relate that in the spring of the year they are accustomed to paddle their canoes over the tops of the willows which fringe its banks below the first rapids, fourteen miles in an air line from the mouth of the river; the greater portion of the intervening valley being then under water.\n\nBanks of the River alluvial.\u2014Depth small, twenty-three feet; rises in Spring ten to fifteen feet at the upper end of its valley.\n\n68. The banks of Dog River are altogether alluvial, for some distance up the valley, with the occasional exception of the abrupt sand cliffs noticed, which come upon the river and seem to form the termination of ridges, which traverse the valley at nearly right angles to the course of the stream. Recent watermarks showed a rise of five feet within three miles of the mouth of the river, and the shores of the lake itself indicated a recent water level about four feet above its present height (August 8th). Higher up the stream, a recent rise of six feet was indicated. The banks showed alder bushes, willow, dogwood, and tamarack; its average breadth is about eighty feet in ordinary seasons; its general depth at this period of the year cannot be above two or three feet, as we were informed by our steersman, that he has often known canoes to be constantly impeded by shallows and drift islands, at times when the level was probably four feet lower than during the present extraordinary season.\n\nDog River connects with the Neepigon, and the Neepigon with English River.\u2014Winipeg River.\n\n69. The average height of the bank rises from four feet, a short distance from the mouth of the river, to ten feet, fourteen miles further up. At nearly every turn, newly formed oval and elongated banks of sand protruded and showed a general elevation of five feet above, the present level. Low hills of granite begin to narrow the valley, after passing a small stream coming from the north, and said to lead to a communication with the Neepigon.\n\nThe Valley of Dog River.\n\n70. From the summit of a low granite hill, perhaps 200 feet above the river bed, the surrounding country was distinctly mapped out at our feet. The valley of the river appeared to have a breadth of a mile at our point of view, widening out in the direction of Dog Lake, and contracting towards the height of land between low ranges of granite hills, which did not seem anywhere to exceed 200-280 feet in altitude.\n\nRemains of an ancient Forest seen.\n\n71. Some of the hills consisted of bare rock, others were covered with a young forest growth, which seemed to consist chiefly of the Banksean pine and aspen. In the distance the tops of a few hills showed clumps of red pine standing erect and tall above the surrounding forest. They may be the remnants of an ancient growth, which probably once covered a large portion of this region, having been destroyed by fire at different epochs, as large areas were still strewed with the blackened trunks of trees; and in the young bush which seems fresh and green at a distance, the ground was found to sustain the charred remains of what had once been a far more vigorous vegetation.\n\nHill abraded, probably by Ice.\u2014The Labrador Tea common.\n\n72. The low ranges of hills bear a great outward resemblance to those which surround Dog Lake. No precipitous escarpments are visible, but most of them have a rounded, dome-like aspect, and close inspection of some of them gave strong indications of the abrading action of ice. Large quantities\n\n* Narrative of an Expedition to the Source of the St. Peter's River, &c., &c., by Wm. H. Kenting, A.M.S., 1824.\nof Labrador tea (*Ledum palustre*), were seen everywhere we landed. The flow of the river until we approach a stronger current, twenty-five miles from Dog Lake, varies from a half to one mile an hour.\n\n**General Character of the Valley of Dog River similar to that of Dog Lake.\u2014Effect of a Dam at the Mouth of Little Dog River.\u2014Boulders left by Ice on a Ledge of Rock, on the Margin of the River.**\n\n73. The general character of this valley is very uniform, and the idea presented to the mind in endeavouring to picture its aspect when covered with water in the spring was that a general rise of twenty or twenty-five feet would give it an appearance very similar to Great Dog Lake; with analogous deep bays formed by the valleys of its tributaries, and having on its shores hills of the same altitude and similar formations as are found bordering the lake below; in fact, a high (twenty-five feet, dam, as has already been hinted, at the source of Little Dog River, might perhaps convert Dog Lake into a magnificent sheet of water, having in a westerly direction a further extension of at least fifteen miles. It would remain, however, to be ascertained whether Dog Lake has not other outlets than the one which leads through Little Dog River. It is not at all improbable that this may be the case.\n\n**Difference in the Climate of the Grand Falls and this Part of the Dog River Valley.\u2014Difference in Altitude 542 feet.**\n\n74. At our camp on the 9th of August, at the head of a small portage round a fall of three feet and a half, about three miles below the mouth of Prairie River, blue berries, not yet ripe, were very abundant, showing a marked difference in the climate of this spot, and the Grand Falls, where some days before we had found them perfectly ripe, and in the greatest profusion. The difference in elevation is about 542 feet. About a quarter of mile from the camp, in our course up the river, we came upon a bare granite hill, about 250 feet high, ascending from the water's edge, at an angle of nearly 45\u00b0, its surface, consisting of smooth rounded ridges; and about fifteen feet above the river a collection of water-worn boulders, from six inches to two feet in diameter, were deposited upon a ledge, leading to the inference that they had been left there by ice during spring freshets, and so far showing some confirmation of the statements of the Indians respecting the remarkable rise of water in the long valley during the spring months.\n\n**Prairie River only ten feet broad.\u2014Dog River.**\n\n75. The last portage on Dog River in the canoe route to Fort Francis is the Jourdain Portage, four miles in an air line from the height of land. It involves an ascent of 8'60 feet by a portage six chains and a half long; a very short distance above it, the mouth and windings of Prairie River are seen with difficulty through the tall rushes which seek to conceal its course for a distance of 200 or 300 yards. Up this little streamlet, scarcely ten feet broad, the canoe route lies, while Dog River, still measuring a breadth of forty feet, can be traced far to the north by a succession of small lakes and ponds which mark its course.\n\n**Description of Dog River to the Feeding Swamp.**\n\n76. Mr. Murray, of the Geological Survey, ascended Dog River up to its feeding marsh in 1847, and describes its course after receiving Prairie River, through which our route lay, as \"turning off nearly due north, and widening out into a long narrow lake for about two or three miles, after which there follows in the same line a chain of twelve small lakes or ponds, connected by short rapid streams, comprised within the distance of ten to twelve miles. The uppermost pond appeared at its northern extremity to terminate in a great marsh, which was supposed to be the ultimate source of the river, and to extend far and wide along the height of land, probably joining the Great Marsh of the Savannah Portage on the Red River route.\"\n\n77. Prairie River is scarcely more than ten feet broad at its mouth, and for a few hundred yards it is so thickly fringed with rushes that two canoes cannot proceed side by side, or even pass one another with facility. The length to Cold Water Lake is about one mile and three quarters, in an air line, and perhaps nearly double that distance by its windings; its general course is a few degrees to the south of west. Much of the route towards the high barrier of land at Cold Water Lake, which now comes into view, lies through small marshy lakes or ponds, three in number, and the whole distance does not exceed three miles. The barrier behind Cold Water Lake, which stretches far to the north and south, may rise 200 or 220 feet in height, the end of the portage path over it, according to measurement at the Height of Land Lake being 157 feet above the lake. It constitutes the great and formidable prairie or Height of Land Portage, two miles and five eighths of a mile long. Cold Water Lake is well named on account of its temperature. Careful observation made it 41\u00b05, and the large spring or source which feeds it, and gives rise to the Prairie River, gushes out of the rocky side of the barrier, about fifty feet above the lake, with a temperature of 39\u00b05.\n\n**Prairie Portage does not pass over the highest Land between Lake Superior and Rainy Lake.\u2014Height of Land Lake 157 feet above Cold Water Lake, and 885 above Lake Superior.**\n\n78. Prairie Portage passes over the height of land, but not the highest land on the route, and its course lies first south-west up a steep wooded hill, without rock exposure, but composed of drift clays, sand, and numerous boulders; it then enters a narrow valley, which terminates in a small lake, about five acres in area, and twenty feet deep, occupying a hollow among the hills on the height of land. The portage path continues on in the same direction until the Height of Land Lake is reached, a small sheet of water, about a square mile in area, and 157 feet above Cold Water Lake. The utmost elevation reached on the Prairie Portage is probably 190 feet above Cold Water Lake, or nearly\n\n---\n\n* Report of Progress, 1846\u20137.\u2014Prairie River ten feet broad.\u2014Height of land barrier rises 220 feet above Cold Water Lake, at the foot of the height of land.\n900 feet above Lake Superior. It is probable that no hill within sight attained an elevation exceeding twenty or thirty feet above this limit. Mr. Dawson makes the Height of Land Lake 879 feet above Lake Superior.\n\nPrairie Portage sustains good-sized Spruce and Pine.\u2014Labrador Tea common.\u2014Fragrant Indian Tea common.\n\n79. Prairie Portage sustains some spruce and pine of fair dimensions, one *Pinus Banksina* measured five feet nine inches in circumference four feet from the ground, and many of equal dimensions were seen in the neighbourhood. A considerable portion of the timber is burnt, and the underbrush everywhere shows a profusion of hazel nut, and small shrubs and plants, such as raspberries, blue berries, gooseberries, and strawberries, all of which were here gathered ripe, the Labrador tea (*Ledum palustre*) was in great profusion in particular spots, and at the termination of the portage, near the Height of Land Lake, the fragrant Indian tea plant (*Ledum talifolium*) abounded in the moss bordering this elevated sheet of water, which is 885 feet above Lake Superior, or 1,485 above the sea.\n\n80. The following estimates of the heights of Prairie Portage above the sea are taken from Sir John Richardson's \"Arctic Searching Expedition.\"*\n\n| Location                                      | Height (Feet) |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Dog Log Lake, above Lake Superior             | 657           |\n| Ascent of Dog River                           | 14            |\n| Portage to Cold Water Lake                    | 2             |\n| West end of Prairie Portage and Middle Portage| 161           |\n| Lake Superior above the sea                   | 641           |\n| Height of Prairie or Middle Portage above the sea | 1,475         |\n\n81. \"In 1849 the height of the upper end of Dog Portage was ascertained by me with Delcro's barometer. In the previous season the aneroid barometer gave 328 feet as the height, which was a greater degree of accordance between the instruments than I generally found. Major Long estimates the watershed between Lakes Winnipeg and Superior at 1,200 feet above the tide; Major De lafeld calculates the height of Cold Water Lake at 505, to which if 161 be added for the Prairie Portage, and 641 for Lake Superior, we have 1,307 feet for the height of Prairie Portage over the sea; Captain Letroy, by barometrical measurements, made in connexion with the observatory at Toronto, makes the west end of Prairie Portage 1,361 feet above the sea; but the distance between the two places of observation renders the result liable to some error.\"\n\nTemperature of Lakes and Rivers.\n\n82.

The summit or Height of Land Lake is about the third of a mile broad, but its length from north-west to south-east could not be determined on account of the vast expanse of rushes, with islands of tamarack, which seemed to blend it with an extensive marsh stretching far in both directions.\n\n* Arctic Searching Expedition: a Journal of a Boat Voyage through Rupert and the Arctic Sea, in search of the Discovery Ships under Sir J. Franklin, by Sir John Richardson, C.B.; American edition, 1854.\nA portage about half a mile in length, letting us down sixteen and one-third feet, brings Savanne Lake into view. The shores of this recedy expanse of water are fringed with Labrador and Indian tea, and here, too, for the first time, the beautiful Indian Cup or Pitcher Plant (sarracenia purpurea), once so common at the Grenadier Pond near Humber Bay, Lake Ontario, was seen in great profusion. From near the summit of a pine tree, a slight depression to the north and north-east of the dividing ridge was observed in the generally level outline of the horizon; by this depression it seemed probable that the waters of the height of Land Lake and its connecting swamps drained into Dog River. With this exception the horizon appeared to be perfectly uniform, the slight difference in the height of the tamaracks and spruces, which seemed most to abound, furnishing the only deviation from a perfectly level expanse in all other directions.\n\nSavanne Lake tributary to Hudson's Bay.\u2014Connexion between Water-sheds not uncommon.\u2014Savanne Lake.\n\n84. The Savanne Lake with its feeding swamps may therefore be considered to be the source of the waters which, in this latitude, send tributaries to Hudson's Bay; although the Indians say that there exists a connection between the Height of Land Lake and Savanne Lake; the portage between them is named Portage de Milier, and passes over a low sandy ridge supporting small pine, and at its edge tamarack and spruce. The connections, indeed, which exist between different water-sheds, by means of the swamps, impassable to a small canoe, at the height of land, are by no means of rare occurrence. In the present case we have the Height of Land Lake sending its waters both to the St. Lawrence and to Hudson's Bay; but if we go a little further south, we find that in the territory of the United States, these interlockages are numerous and complex.* The St. Croix Lake, connecting the Mississippi with Lake Superior; the west fork of Bad River and the Nemakagon at Long Lake, establishing the same connection; and the Big Fork, which flows into Rainy River, thence into Hudson's Bay, is connected with the Ondodawanoan River, a tributary of Lake Winibigoshish, through which the Mississippi flows. Savanne Lake is about one mile broad; at its south-westerly termination begins the Great Savanne Portage, as well as its outlet, in the form of a small stream, much encumbered with fallen trees, and connecting with Savanne River; by this small stream canoes pass when the water is high, and thus avoid the troubles of the Great Savanne Portage.\n\nCondition of Savanne Portage.\u2014Remains of old Road. Portage once good.\u2014Can be made good at small cost.\n\n85. This common dread of the voyageurs is one mile and forty-one chains in length; it descends thirty-one and a half to Savanne River, and consists of a wet tamarack swamp, in which moss grows everywhere to the depth of one foot, or eighteen inches; the moss is supported by a retentive buff clay, which is exposed at the western extremity of the portage. The remains of an old road, probably constructed in the time of the North-West Company, passes through it, and is formed of split trees, now in a thorough condition of decay. The same may be said of all the swampy portages along this line of route. In the time of the North-West Company this portage was doubtless one of the best, considering its length and general character; but now a false step from a rotten or half floating log, precipitates the voyageur into eighteen inches of moss, mud, and water. No physical impediment appears to exist which would prevent this portage from being drained at a very small cost, and converted into one of the best on the whole line of route.\n\nSavanne River.\n\n86. Savanne River, to which it leads, is very rapid a little above the landing place; but by wading up the stream for about a quarter of a mile, the occurrence of dead water without froth or bubbles, showed that the feeding swamp or lake was near at hand. Savanne River is about twenty-five feet broad here, and it continues a very meandering and crooked westerly course of about thirteen miles to Mille Lacs, or Lake of the Thousand Islands, as it is sometimes termed.\n\nBanks of the River.\u2014Vegetation.\n\n87. The banks of this river are altogether alluvial, and diminish gradually from ten feet in altitude near its source, to the level of Mille Lacs, at its entrance into that extensive and beautiful sheet of water. The immediate banks of Savanne River are clothed with alder, willow, and dogwood; behind these are seen tamarack, pine, spruce, and aspen. Near its mouth much marshy land prevails, and at its confluence with Mille Lacs is characterised by a large expanse of rushes and other water plants common in such situations.\n\nArea of Mille Lacs.\n\n88. Mille Lacs is described by the Indians as extending in a direction due west much farther than was visible from the canoe route, on account of the numerous islands with which it is everywhere dotted. In the lower portion of the Savanne River many large ponds and reedy lakes, connected together by small watercourses, join with the main river, and indicate the great extension which Mille Lac assumes in an easterly direction during spring freshets. It appears very probable that a length of thirty miles, with an average breadth of six\u2014ten miles may be taken as a fair representation of this remote sheet of water; the canoe route through it is twenty-one miles in length, from the mouth of the Savanne to Keg or Bariil Portage; granitic dome-shaped islands are very numerous, and occasional exposures of clay and sand banks come into view on the points and islands along the line of route.\n\nWhite Quartz, Sail Rocks.\n\n89. The hills here and there bear pine of fair dimensions, while in the narrower and shallower valleys between them there is every indication of hardwood over large areas. Exposures of white quartz are repeatedly seen on the islands and main land at the western extremity of the lake; and not unfrequently\n\n* See Dr. Norwood on this subject, in the Geological Survey of Iowa, Wisconsin, &c., &c.\nare they taken by travellers during their first voyage for the sails of distant boats. The name \"sail rock,\" given to them by the voyageurs, is derived from this erroneous impression. Where the lake narrows on approaching Baril Portage, gneissoid hills and islands about 100 feet high showed a well-defined stratification dipping north, at an angle of about fifteen degrees, and on that side smooth, and sometimes roughly polished on the south side, precipitous and abrupt. The same character was noticed at the Baril Portage, which has a length of sixteen chains eighty-five links, with an altitude of seventy-two and a half feet, and an ascent of 186 feet. The north-eastern exposure of the rocks here was smooth, the southern rugged and often precipitous.\n\nBaril Lake.\u2014Large dead Pines.\u2014Large living Pines.\n\n90. Baril Lake is seven and a half miles long, and is the counterpart of the western extremity of Mille Lacs. It is terminated by the Brul\u00e9 or Side Hill Path Portage, twenty-one chains long, leading to Brul\u00e9 Lake, forty-seven feet below Baril Lake. At Brul\u00e9 Portage I ascended a steep hill bordering a small rapid stream called Brul\u00e9 River, and from an altitude of fully 200 feet, had a fine view of the surrounding country. The vegetation upon the hill side and summit was truly astonishing, and the term Brul\u00e9 Portage received an unexpected interpretation on finding, hidden by a rich profusion of brushwood, the dead trunks of many noble pines. Throughout the day the tall trunks of white pine, branchless and dead, rising in clumps, or in single loneliness far above the forest, had attracted attention; and on the side of the Brul\u00e9 Hill we observed many prostrate half burnt trees of the largest size. One dead trunk was measured and found to have a circumference of twelve feet five inches from the ground. A living tree, tall and clean, and apparently quite sound, measured nearly ten feet in circumference, and many of the prostrate pines were of equal dimensions.\n\nAncient White Pine Forest.\u2014Luxuriant Second Growth.\u2014Scenery of Side Hill Path.\n\n91. There can be little doubt that these were the remains of a magnificent white pine forest, which extended formerly over a vast area in this region, since from the summit of the hill these remains in the form of scattered living trees, or tall, branchless scattered trunks, met the eye in every direction. The second growth indicated a soil not incapable of sustaining pine trees of the largest proportions; black cherry, birch, white and black alder, small clumps of sugar maple, and a thick undergrowth of hazel nut now occupies the domain of the ancient forest. The south-west side of this hill formed a precipitous escarpment 150 feet above the waters of a long clear lake. All around the eye rested upon low dome-shaped hills dipping towards the north-east, and covered with a rich profusion of second growth. The vast wilderness of green being dotted with black islands of burnt pine, with a few detached living remnants, serving by their surprising dimensions to tell of the splendid forest which must have once covered the country.\n\nHeight of Brul\u00e9 Hill above the Sea.\n\n92. The soil, wherever examined, consisted of a red sandy loam, covered with a thin coating of vegetable mound. Occasionally bare rock exposures protruded, and granitic boulders were numerous. The uniform size of the second growth timber on this Brul\u00e9 Hill, seemed to prove that the great fire which devastated this region may have occurred about thirty years since. The hill round which the portage path winds is considerably higher than any observed range on the height of land, and its summit, from which a view of the surrounding country was obtained, is probably about 100 feet above the height of Land Lake, or 1,585 feet above the ocean level; McKay's mountain having an elevation of 1,600 feet above the same level.\n\nImportance of the Region about Mille Lacs, in an agricultural point of view.\n\n93. The impression produced by a survey of the solitudes about the western extremity of Mille Lacs and Baril Lake was rather of a favourable character. If in the course of time mineral wealth should be found to exist in profitable distribution about Mille Lacs, there would be no scarcity of arable soil between the low hill ranges of that beautiful little inland sea to supply the wants of a mining population, or in the event of a line of communication between Thunder Bay and Rainy Lake being established, its western shores and those of Baril and Brul\u00e9 Lakes offer suitable localities for village dep\u00f4ts.\n\nFrench Portage.\n\n94. From Brul\u00e9 Lake to French Portage, a distance of four miles, the canal route lies through a series of lovely lakelets, and short rapid streams fringed with cedar and spruce, and behind these fair-sized red pine, birch, aspen, and large spruce. French Portage bearing due west, is one and three-quarter miles long, and lets us down ninety-nine and three-quarter feet into French Portage or Pickerel Lake. The timber on this portage consists of aspen, red pine, and spruce. On the shores of the lake low hills appear, and are timbered with extensive forest red pine, varied with patches of spruce, aspens, and birch.\n\nAncient Forest near Pickerel Lake.\n\n95. Pickerel Lake, through which in a direction nearly due south-west the canoe route now runs, is a fine sheet of water thirteen miles long by two to four broad; its shores consist of low hills covered with fine forest pine, with spruce, aspens, and birch in the valleys. On the east side of the lake the remains of an ancient pine forest are often visible in the forms of noble detached trees. These occur about six miles from its head, and here, too, may be occasionally noticed small groups of the same trees rising far above the comparatively young growth which now surrounds them. The half-burned standing trunks of huge dimensions, show the extent and character of the earlier forest, and the cause which destroyed their companions. White pine in numbers still remain at the foot of the lake, and were seen at the portage, which is called Portage du Pin, also Portage des Morts. The first name is evidently derived from the prevalence of large red and white pine here; its length is twenty-six chains, and its descent is 6'9 feet, leading into Jack Fish or Dor\u00e9 Lake, a small sheet of water about a mile across, but extending much further in a north-westerly direction.\nFine Vegetation of Portage des Pins.\n\n96. Among the trees observed here, remarkable for their size, cedar, ash, white and red pine, with birch of two kinds, may be enumerated. The cedar is far superior to any before seen. A clay subsoil is found in the valley of a small river running near the portage path, and the upturned roots of trees on the hillside showed fine washed white sand upon which a sandy loam was imposed. The foot of Dor\u00e9 Lake brings us to the Portage des Deux Rivi\u00e8res, which lets us down into Sturgeon Lake 117'21 feet, in a length of thirty-two chains.\n\nScenery and Country about Sturgeon Lake.\n\n97. The whole country seems to sink with the French Portage and the Deux Rivi\u00e8res Portage. The hills about Sturgeon Lake at its upper end are not above 100 feet high, and if the valleys and lakes were filled up between the tract of country south-west of French Portage, it would be nearly a level plain, with a slight south-westerly descent. In Sturgeon River, leading to the lake of that name, we meet with the first marshy place since leaving the mouth of the Savanne River. The canoes here were forced through a profusion of aquatic plants, among which the beautiful white water lily, with its golden-hued companion frequently occurred. Willows, small aspen and alder, grew on the banks, but no hill or elevated table land was visible from the shallow but tortuous river, choked with aquatic plants, through which we forced our way into the main body of Sturgeon Lake. Once on the open lake, hills about 200 feet high rose into view at some distance on the eastern side. The bushy tops of what appeared to be a grove of elms were seen near the head of this large and beautiful sheet of water; again wide tracts of burnt land attract attention, with a few white pines, remains of a forest long since destroyed. The north-eastern termini of hill ranges slope to the water edge, and when bare, are found to be evenly smoothed and ground down. Everywhere on the shores of the first large expansion of the lake remains of an ancient forest lay black and branchless, or still flourished green and erect amidst a vigorous undergrowth of spruce and aspen.\n\nLac la Croix.\n\n98. Sturgeon Lake and River, or rather a succession of lakes and rivers bearing the above names, extend for thirty-six miles from the Portage des Deux Rivi\u00e8res to Island Portage, which leads into Pine Lake, a small sheet of water connected by means of a broad river about three and a half miles long, with the great Nequaquon Lake, or Lac la Croix.\n\n99. Nine miles from its head Sturgeon Lake was found to have forty-five feet depth of water, with a mud bottom. The temperature of the lake was sixty-eight degrees at six p.m.; the pines and balsams growing near the shore were seen to be scraped or barked for about a foot near the ground by Indians, for the purpose of procuring gum or resin.\n\nBeauty of Sturgeon Lake.\n\n100. No lake yet seen on the route can bear comparison for picturesque scenery with Sturgeon Lake. The numerous deep bays, backed by high-wooded hills or rocks, rugged or smooth, according to their aspects, its sudden contraction into a river breadth for a few yards between large islands and the equally abrupt breaking out into open stretches of water, offered a constant and most pleasing variety of scene. The high jutting points of granite rock which here and there confine the channel, offer rare opportunities for beholding on one side an intricate maze of island scenery, and on the other an open expanse of lake, with deep and gloomy bays stretching seemingly into the dark forest as far as the eye can reach.\n\nCascades of Sturgeon River.\n\n101. The fourth large expanse of Sturgeon Lake is limited by low densely-wooded shores, with high hill ranges in the far distance. The first cascades, with a fall of four and a half feet, occur at the foot of this last expansion; these are quickly followed by the second falls of six and a quarter feet descent, then occurs a narrower reach of river for three miles, which is terminated by the third rapids of two and a half feet fall, leading to another expanse with a general direction nearly due west; white cedar now becomes common, and the fourth and fifth rapids occur within four miles of one another, and are followed by Island Portage two miles further on.\n\nIsland Portage.\n\n102. Island Portage lets us down ten feet, and involved a portage of fifty yards. Crossing the small Pine Lake, the river now assumes a course nearly due west, and, within a distance of four miles, brings us to a north-eastern arm of Lac la Croix. The canoe route passes near the north shore of this extensive and beautiful lake. High precipitous rock exposures begin to show themselves, often clothed with dense groves of pine rising above the mass of light green aspen foliage which prevails. Although Lac la Croix is fourteen or fifteen miles long, yet our traverse did not exceed eight, as we entered the Nameaukan river which issues from the north-western coast, and takes a circuitous north-westerly direction, bringing us to the Snake Portage, where the river descends by a beautiful cascade 12'14 feet, involving a portage of 110 yards. Rapids and falls now follow in quick succession on Nameaukan River, which has a circuitous course of about eighteen miles before it debouches into Nameaukan Lake. Following Snake Lake are Crow Portages, with 9'88 feet fall; Grand Falls Portage, sixteen feet; and the great and dangerous Nameaukan Rapids letting the river down by steps, perhaps also sixteen feet. The shores of Nameaukan River show the Bankean pine in abundance with aspen and at its mouth growing elm.\n\nNameaukan Lake. Rainy Lake.\n\n103. The traverse across Nameaukan Lake is six and a half miles in length, the lake itself extending for more than double that distance in a due west direction. At the extremity of the traverse is the new portage, where the descent is eight and a half feet. A circuitous narrow river, without perceptible\ncurrent, passing through a reedy expanse fringed with low willow for about three miles. The canoe route then takes a winding course, whose general direction is nearly due north, for a distance of two and a half miles, when turning due westward we suddenly arrive at the open and beautiful but indescribably barren and desolate region of Rainy Lake.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nRAINY LAKE TO THE MOUTH OF RAINY RIVER.\n\nRainy Lake, surveyed in 1826, 104\u2014Description of Rainy Lake, 105\u2014Shores low and sterile, 106\u2014Height above the Sea, 107\u2014Temperature of, 108\u2014Period of freezing and thawing, 109\u2014Entrance into Rainy River, 110\u2014Description of Rainy River, 111\u2014Farming and Gardening operations at Fort Francis, 112\u2014Depth of Snow, 112\u2014Lac la Pluie Indians, 113\u2014Swamp in the rear of Rainy River, 114\u2014Area of available land, 114\u2014Rich vegetation of Rainy River, 116\u2014Extreme beauty of Rainy River, 117\u2014Indian encampments, 117\u2014Heights of the Banks, 118\u2014Height of the water, 119\u2014Rapids of Rainy River, 120\u2014Water communication between Rainy Lake and the extremity of the Lake of the Woods, 120\u2014Underground houses, 121\u2014Indian Lodges, 122\u2014Character of the Valley of Rainy River, 123\u2014Character of the Valley near the Lake of the Woods, 124.\n\nRainy Lake surveyed in 1826.\n\n104. In 1826 a map of Rainy Lake, as part of the survey under the seventh article of the treaty of Ghent between Great Britain and the United States, was constructed by David Thompson, astronomer and surveyor. Everything relating to its correct delineation and topography was, doubtless, effected by the Commissioners; and that portion of the map accompanying this Report, which includes Rainy Lake, Rainy River, and the Lake of the Woods is reduced from an authorized copy of those parts of the survey. Dr. Bigsby, who accompanied the surveyor as geologist, communicates the chief facts in the following enumeration of the geographical position, &c., of Rainy Lake in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for May 1834.*\n\nDescription of Rainy Lake.\n\n105. Rainy Lake, or Lake la Pluie as it is more frequently called by the voyagers, is 225 miles west of Lake Superior and eighty-five south-east of the Lake of the Woods. It is fifty miles long by thirty-eight and a half broad and is 294 round by canoe route. Its form is that of three equal troughs, the main one running in an east and west direction, the other two northerly from it. It is through the main trough that the canoe route lies from the mouth of Nameaukan River in latitude 48\u00b0 30' N., longitude 92\u00b0 40' W., to the source of Rainy River, thirty-eight miles distant, in a direction a few degrees to the north of west.\n\nShores of Rainy Lake sterile and rocky; Timber poor.\n\n106. The shores of Rainy Lake are generally low, and often consist of naked shapeless masses of rock with marshy intervals, or they rise in ridges which become hills 800 to 500 feet high, half a mile to four miles from the lake. The timber seems to be very small and thin in the marshes, and on the islands, which exceed 500 in number, the largest growth were observed. On the whole the general aspect of the shores of Rainy Lake is very forbidding, and furnishes almost everywhere, on the ridges and hill flanks, a picture of a hopeless sterility and desolate waste. Dr. Bigsby says that there is but little loose debris about Rainy Lake, the earth or gravel banks being few and seldom exceed a few feet in thickness. Whenever this land rises for the most part bleached and naked rocks occur for many square miles together.\n\nHeight of Rainy Lake above the Sea.\n\n107. Colonel Lefroy made Rainy Lake 1,160 feet above the sea by barometrical measurement. Its height deduced from the levels taken at the portages, and the estimated rise and fall in the current of the rivers along the line of route was 1,035 feet (Mr. Dawson). In this estimate the level of Lake Superior is taken at six hundred feet above the ocean. Major Long found it to be 1,200 feet above the same level. The water of the lake is clear, but warm during the summer months; its depth is generally small. The following table shows the temperature six inches below the surface during our traverse on the 19th August.\n\nTemperature of Rainy Lake.\n\n| Time | Temperature |\n|------|-------------|\n| 6 A.M. | - - - 65\u00b75 |\n| 7 A.M. | - - - 65\u00b75 |\n| 8 A.M. | - - - 65\u00b75 |\n| 10 A.M. | - - - 65\u00b725 |\n| 11\u00bd A.M. | - - - 69\u00b75 |\n| 1 P.M. | - - - 70\u00b75 |\n| 3 P.M. | - - - 69\u00b75 |\n| 5 P.M. | - - - 66\u00b70 |\n\nA sudden squall at 3 p.m. rose the waves of the lake with remarkable rapidity into a very boisterous swell, which subsided as rapidly when the wind fell.\n\nPeriod of freezing and thawing of Rainy Lake.\n\n109. Rainy Lake freezes about the 1st December, and is open about the 1st of May, as is usually the case where large rivers issue from spacious lakes the discharging stream is not frozen for a number of miles from its source. The warm waters coming from beneath a shelter of ice in their capacious feeding lake retain their heat so as to enable them to resist the cold of these regions for many miles below the Great Falls.\n\nEntrance of Rainy River, a new Country.\n\n110. At the entrance of Rainy River on the evening of August 19, the delightful odour of the balsam poplar (populus balsamifera) loaded the air, and seemed to welcome our arrival in a region differing\n\n* On the Geology of Rainy Lake, South Hudson's Bay. By Dr. J. J. Bigsby, F.G.S., &c.\naltogether from those through which we had lately passed. Where Rainy River issues from Rainy Lake it is a broad and rapid stream, with low alluvial banks clothed with a rich second growth. The forest with which they were once covered had long since been stripped of its ornaments by the occupants of the old North West and the present Hudson's Bay Company Fort.\n\nDescription of Rainy River. Affluents of Rainy River.\n\n111. The general course of Rainy River is a few degrees to the north of west, for a distance of eighty miles, by the windings of the river, and in an air line sixty miles. The rapids at its source offer no impediment to skilful navigation, nor do the whirlpools which usually accompany the passage of such a large body of water, in consequence of their being distributed over a wide area. Two miles below the source Fort Francis is situated on a high bank, just below the Great Falls. These magnificent cascades let the river down 22-88 feet, and at their fort is a famous fishing ground from which the Lac La Pluie Indians obtain an abundant supply of their staple food. Three miles from Fort Francis the river takes a sudden southerly bend, which it maintains for a distance of four miles; it then again assumes a course due west for about sixteen miles, and receives the Pekan, or Little Fork; the Missatchanbe, or Big Fork; and the Kakmaskatawagan rivers, on the south or United States side; the course then turns abruptly due north, and continues for a distance of six and a half miles, when it again resumes a westerly direction for eighteen miles; its otherwise gentle and uniform current is here broken by the Manitou Rapids and Long Rapids, which let the river down about two and a half feet and three feet respectively; six miles from the Long Rapids a short northerly bend again occurs, after which the river, with slight meanderings, pursues a north-west by west direction until it debouches into the Lake of the Woods. In this part of its course it receives on the British side small sluggish streams, known by the names of Kiskarko, Kahalawakalk, and Kawawakissiniek streams, and from the territory of the United States the Muttontine, the Wishawakepekas, and Kapowenekenow rivers. Its affluents on the British side are insignificant outlets to the swamps which occupy the region north of Rainy River valley; but some of those on the United States side are of important dimensions.\n\nFarming and Gardening Operations at Fort Francis.\u2014Depth of Snow.\n\n112. Fort Francis, two miles from the source of Rainy River, is situated on the right bank, in lat. 48\u00b0 35, and longitude 93\u00b0 40. Mr. Pether, the gentleman then in charge, stated that the river never freezes between the falls and the Little Fork, a distance of twelve miles, nor between the falls and its source in Rainy Lake. Wheat is sown at this establishment of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, from the 20th to the 23rd May; it ripens about 1st September. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, and indeed all common culinary vegetables, succeed well. Potatoes are dug in the first week of October, and barley is ripe by the middle of August. Snow falls here to the depth of four feet.\n\nLac la Pluie Indians.\n\n113. The great enemies to extended cultivation are the Lac la Pluie Indians. They are not only numerous, but very independent; and although diminishing in numbers, they sometimes hold near Fort Francis their grand medicine ceremonies, at which five and six hundred individuals sometimes assemble. The number of Indians visiting this fort for the purpose of trade reaches 1,500. They do not scruple to jump over the fences, and run through the ground crops, if their ball in the game of \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 is driven in that direction.\n\nSwamps in the Rear of the Valley of Rainy River.\u2014Area of available Land.\n\n114. In the immediate neighbourhood of Fort Francis, the swamp or morass bounding the valley of Rainy River on the right bank, is about half a mile in its rear. This swamp, which extends from Rainy Lake to the Lake of the Woods, is described by Mr. Pether, and the Indians who were questioned about it, as consisting of a springy, moveable surface, overlying a vast deposit of peat, through which a pole might frequently be pushed to the depth of thirty feet, without reaching the bottom. The surface sustains low bushes, with here and there islands of small pine. Its borders approach and recede from Rainy River with the windings of that stream; the breadth of the dry wooded and fertile valley varying from half a mile in the rear of Fort Francis, to ten or twelve miles in the direction of the Lake of the Woods. The average breadth of superior land for a distance of seventy miles might perhaps, with propriety, be assumed to be not less than six miles, giving an area of available soil of high fertility, exceeding two hundred and sixty thousand acres; and there can be little doubt, that with the progress of clearing, much that is now included in the area occupied by swamp, would without difficulty or expense be retained.\n\n115. In describing the general aspects of the banks and valley of Rainy River, it will be advantageous to sketch with considerable minuteness the features of the soil and vegetation at the different stopping places, where very excellent opportunities were offered for acquiring information on these particulars, and in this description as well as in delineations of other localities in the valley of this beautiful river, I prefer to embody in this Report the notes made at the time, in preference to a general sketch of the whole.\n\nRich Vegetation of Rainy River.\u2014Elm three feet in diameter.\n\n116. The ground around us at our camp, twelve miles below Fort Francis, is covered with the richest profusion of rose bushes, woodbine, convolvulus in bloom, Jerusalem artichoke (helianthus) just beginning to flower, and vetches of the largest dimensions. Fringing this open interval of perhaps 280 acres, in extent, are elms, balsams, poplar, ash and oak. One elm tree measured three feet in diameter, or nine feet eight inches in circumference; and there is no exaggeration in saying that our temporary camping place is like a rich overgrown and long neglected garden. The golden rod is showing its rich hue in all directions, and gives a distinct yellow tint to an open grassy area on the opposite side of the river.\n\nExtreme beauty of Rainy River.\u2014Soil on Clay.\u2014Lodge Poles on Indian Encampment.\n\n117. Similar intervals to the one on which we are now encamped have been noticed occasionally; and hitherto the banks have maintained an average altitude of about forty feet, bearing a fine\ngrowth of the trees before enumerated. No part of the country through which we have passed from Lake Superior northwards can bear comparison with the rich banks of Rainy River thus far. The river has preserved a very uniform breadth, varying only from about 200 to 300 yards. The soil is a sandy loam at the surface, much mixed with vegetable matter. Occasionally, where the bank has recently fallen away, the clay is seen stratified in layers of about two inches in thickness, following in all respects the contour of what seems to be unstratified drift clay below. Basswood is not uncommon, and sturdy oaks, whose trunks are from eighteen inches to two feet in diameter, are seen in open groves with luxuriant grasses and climbing plants growing beneath them. The lodge poles of an Indian camp of former seasons are covered with convolvulus in bloom, and the honeysuckle is twining its long and tenacious stems around the nearest support, living or dead.\n\nHeight of Banks.\n\n118. The banks of the river maintain for twenty miles an altitude, varying from fifteen to sixty feet. Occasionally, the banks show the abrupt boundaries of two plateaux, the lower boundary having the form of a sloping bank or an abrupt cliff from fifteen to thirty feet in altitude; on the river the upper plateau rising gradually or abruptly from fifteen to twenty feet higher, according to its position with reference to the river. There is every appearance in places of fire having destroyed a former larger growth of trees than those which now occupy these areas.\n\nHeight of the Water at this season of the year very unusual.\n\n119. The extraordinary height of the water at this season of the year is seen by the lodge poles of former Indian encampments at the foot of the bank. They are under water to the depth of one and even two feet. The river does not appear to rise high in the spring, as the trees fringing the banks to the water's edge show no action of ice. The difference between the highest and the lowest water levels may be seven feet, and no record of recent higher levels meet the eye.\n\nRapids of Rainy Lake.\u2014Length of Water Communication from Rainy Lake to Lake of the Woods.\n\n120. The rapids of Rainy River let us down about five and a half feet, and appear to be caused by a belt of rock crossing the river at nearly right angles to its course. On the American side the hill range has an altitude of about eighty feet. On the Canadian side it is much lower, and appears rapidly to subside in gentle undulations. The rapids of Rainy River, two in number, are capable of being ascended by a small steamer of good power without difficulty, and cannot be considered as presenting an obstacle to the navigation of this important stream as long as the water maintains its present altitude, which is about three feet higher than is usual at this season of the year, but often exceeded in the spring and fall. Mr. Dawson informs me that two locks of ten feet lift, with one guard lock, would overcome the falls at the mouth of the river, and thus form a splendid water communication between the head of Rainy Lake and Rat Portage, Lake of the Woods, by the north-west coast, a distance of 190 miles, or between the head of Rainy Lake and the north-west point of the Lake of the Woods, a distance of one hundred and seventy miles. High clay banks are exposed above and below the rapids, and some hundred acres here are very scantily timbered with second growth. Ascending the bank two miles below the rapids, I was much surprised at the number of birds of different kinds chirruping and singing in the light and warmth of a bright morning sun. I heard more birds in ten minutes here than during the whole journey from the Kakabeka Falls on the Kaministiquia.\n\nTumuli or underground Houses on Rainy River. The remarkable Luxuriance of Vegetation.\n\n121. At the second rapids an extensive area destitute of trees presents a very beautiful prairie appearance. Here we landed to examine two immense mounds which appeared to be tumuli. We forced our way to them through a dense growth of grasses, nettles, and Jerusalem artichokes, twisted together by wild convolvulus. On our way to the mounds we passed through a neglected Indian garden, and near it observed the lodge poles of an extensive encampment. The garden was partially fenced, and contained a patch of Jerusalem artichokes, six and seven feet high in the stalk, and just beginning to show their flowers. The wild oat attained an astonishing size, and all the vegetation exhibited the utmost luxuriance. The mound ascended was about forty feet high and one hundred broad at the base. It was composed of a rich black sandy loam, containing a large quantity of vegetable matter. On digging a foot deep no change in the character of the soil was observable. The Indian guide called them underground houses.\n\nIndian Lodges.\n\n122. About three hundred yards below the second rapids twenty-three skeletons of Indian lodges are seen, all clothed with the wild convolvulus, and now serving as records of the love of change which seems to form a leading characteristic in the habits of the barbarous race who possess, without appreciating or enjoying them, the riches of this beautiful and most fertile valley. Limestone fragments and boulders, more or less water worn, with pebbles of the same rock, are found everywhere on the beach, at the foot of the clay or loamy banks.\n\nCharacter of the Valley of Rainy River.\n\n123. When we landed for dinner to-day (the 21st of August), I strolled about half a mile back from the river, and Mr. Dawson went about half a mile farther. We found the vegetation improving fast as we receded from the river. Aspens of very large dimensions, balsam, poplar, basswood, birch, and oak, with some elm, formed the forest. The land rose very gradually, and on inquiry from the Indian how far back the good land stretched before coming to the swamp, he said that here the valley was broadest, and it would take us half a day to reach the swamp, journeying the whole time through land similar to that around us, but with larger trees. The singular topographical knowledge acquired by these Indians, and (as far as we have yet been able to ascertain) the accuracy and fidelity with which they communicate it, assures us of the truth of the Indian statement.\nThe remaining portion of Rainy River exhibited features similar to those already described.\n\nCharacter of the Valley near the Lake of the Woods.\n\n124. As we approached the Lake of the Woods the river increased in breadth, and at each bend a third low plateau was in process of formation, often 200 and 300 acres in area, and elevated above the present high-water level from one to three feet. Coarse grasses grew in great abundance upon many of these rich outlying alluvial deposits, and it appeared very probable that in ordinary seasons they would furnish some thousand acres of rich pasture land, as the grasses they sustain are like those which on the Kaministiquia, the settlers cut for their winter supply of fodder for cattle. Near the mouth of the river the tall tops of a few red and white pine are seen, which rise far above the aspens, occupying the lower plateau, while a vast reedy expanse, probably in ordinary seasons available for grazing purposes, marks the junction of Rainy River with the Lake of the Woods.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nLAKE OF THE WOODS AND THE WINIPEG RIVER.\n\nDimensions and Divisions of the Lake of the Woods, 125\u2014Distance of the North West corner from Red River, 125\u2014Scenery, 126\u2014Effects of refraction, 127\u2014Profuse confervoid growth, 128\u2014Depth of water, 128\u2014Extraordinary temperature of the Lake, due to the \"Weed,\" 129\u2014Grasshoppers seen, 129\u2014Fishing Ground 120 feet deep, 129\u2014Ice five feet thick forms, 129\u2014Refraction, 131\u2014Grasshoppers, 131\u2014Gale on the Lake, 132\u2014Garret Island, Indian Corn cultivated; Potatoes, Pumpkins, Squashes, Raisin Cherry, Passenger Pigeon; History of Grasshoppers; Ravages of Grasshoppers, noise of the jay; Indians indifferent to them, 134\u2014Shoal Lake, 135\u2014Distance of Shoal Lake from Red River, 136\u2014Length of a Degree, 137\u2014Island Scenery, 138\u2014Channels of the Winnipeg, 139\u2014Magnificence of the Caselades, 140\u2014Character of the River, 141\u2014Rat Portage, 141\u2014View from a hill, 142\u2014Character of the country on the Upper Winnipeg, 142\u2014Islington Mission, 143\u2014Cultivable areas on the Winnipeg, 143, 144\u2014Wild Rice Grounds, 145\u2014Game, 145\u2014The Penouwa River, 146\u2014Birds in the rice grounds, 146\u2014Failure of the rice, 147\u2014Failure of the fish, 148\u2014Failure of the rabbits, 149\u2014Fatal consequence of these failures, 149.\n\nDimensions and Divisions of the Lake of the Woods.\u2014Distance from Lake Superior.\u2014North-west corner of the Lake, about ninety miles from Red River in an air line.\n\n125. The Lake of the Woods is about seventy-two miles in length, and the same in breadth. It is 400 miles round by canal route.* It is broken up into three distinct lakes by a long promontory, which in periods of high water becomes an island. The southern part is termed the Lake of the Sand Hills; the eastern portion White Fish Lake, and the northern division the Lake of the Woods. White Fish Lake and Lake of the Woods are separated from Sand Hill Lake by the broad promontory before referred to, respecting which little is known. The name of the latter division is derived from the vast numbers of low sand hills which occupy its south-western coast. The distance of the Lake of the Woods from Lake Superior is, north-west, 340 miles by the Pigeon River route, and 381 by the route from Fort William, followed by the expedition. The north-west corner of the lake is only about ninety miles from Red River, in an air line. Its elevation above Lake Superior is 377 feet, or 977 feet above the sea. Major Long makes it 1,040 feet above the ocean level, a difference of only sixty-three feet.\n\nScenery of the North-west Corner beautiful.\n\n126. The scenery among the islands towards the north-west corner of the lake is of the most lovely descriptions, and presents in constantly recurring succession every variety of bare, precipitous rock, abrupt timbered hills, gentle wooded slopes, and open grassy areas. Some of the islands are large and well timbered, others show much devastation by fire, and often a vigorous young undergrowth of a different kind of tree under the blackened trunks of branchless pines.\n\nEffects of Refraction.\n\n127. The ordinary course of the canoe route to Red River lies in a north-easterly direction, following the trend of the coast towards Turtle Portage, which leads from the Lake of the Sand Hills to White Fish Lake. In pursuance of our intention to endeavour to pass from the west side of the Lake of the Sand Hills across the country, in as direct a line as possible to Red River, we made a traverse in a north-westerly direction towards the south point of Keating Island, a distance of sixteen miles. The surface of the lake was perfectly smooth, reflecting the sun's rays with extraordinary power and brilliancy. As we receded from the shores the low sand dunes to the south-west were refracted into the similitude of distant mountain ranges, and what seemed through a glass to be the rocky coast of the eastern side, into high, precipitous, half wooded cliffs.\n\nProfuse confervoid growth, thirty-five and thirty-six feet deep, four and nine miles from land.\n\n128. About four miles from land the water became tinged with green, deriving its colour from a minute vegetable growth (conferve), which increased as we progressed, until it gave the appearance to the lake of a vast expanse of dirty green mud. On lifting up a quantity of water in a tin cup, or on looking closely over the side of the canoe, the water was seen to be clear, yet sustaining an infinite quantity of the minute tubular needle shaped organisms, sometimes detached, and sometimes clustered together in the form of small spherical stars, varying from a quarter to half an inch in diameter. Five miles from the shore the lead showed thirty-five feet of water, and four miles further on thirty-six feet; the green conferve increased in quantity, and the little aggregations assumed larger dimensions, some of them exceeding one inch in diameter.\n\nExtraordinary Temperature of the Lake of the Woods due to the Weeds.\u2014Grasshoppers seen.\n\n129. The temperature of the lake near the mouth of Rainy River was sixty-seven degrees at half-past eleven, a.m. Yet five miles from land it was found to be seventy-six degrees, six inches below the\n\n* See vol. 8, Geological Journals for an account of the Lake of the Woods, by Dr. Bigsby.\nsurface; an hour afterwards repeated, and careful observations showed the temperature to be seventy-seven and a half degrees. At one, p.m., the temperature two feet below the surface was seventy-one degrees, and at the surface seventy-eight degrees. The depth of water was here thirty-six feet, and the green conferra uniformly abundant, so that it was impossible to obtain a table spoonful of liquid free from their minute forms. The presence of this \"weed,\" as the voyageur termed it, was the probable cause of the unusual temperature of the lake. Occasionally grasshoppers were seen resting on the calm glistening surface of the lake, and as we approached Keating Island they increased in number, all of them preserving, with singular uniformity, a direction towards the south-east. The Indians think the \"weed\" proves destructive to fish. They had seen it on Lake Wimpeg.\n\nFishing Ground, 120 feet deep.\u2014Ice five feet thick forms on Lake of the Woods.\n\n130. After passing the south point of Keating Island we steered for Garden Island, distant from us about nine miles. On the west side of Keating Island the Indian guide pointed out one of their fishing grounds, where he stated the water was thirty fathoms deep, and illustrated the manner in which he arrived at that estimate of the depth by explaining, through the interpreter, the mode of fishing during the winter months, the length of a fathom and the number of these in the lines his people employed to reach with their nets the feeding grounds at that period of the year. He also described the thickness of the ice through which they had to break before they arrived at the water as sometimes exceeding five feet.\n\nRefraction.\u2014Grasshoppers.\n\n131. On approaching and receding from Keatings Island, the effects of refraction were most astonishing, elevating low detached island rocks into huge precipitous promontories, and giving to a shore, a few feet above the level of the water, the appearance of a high rock-bound coast. On nearing a small island about four miles east of Garden or Cornfield Island, the grasshoppers on the surface of the lake became more numerous, the green conferra was visibly less in quantity, and before we landed to dine it had disappeared altogether, but the grasshoppers were found in great numbers on the shore. The island on which we rested for an hour was about three acres in extent, and sustained some fine old oaks and elms, with a profusion of long grass, not much destroyed by the grasshoppers, which had evidently, as was afterwards inferred, only just arrived there, while those which had been observed scattered over the surface of the lake were probably stragglers from a vast flight of these insects, whose main body we afterwards saw on Garden Island.\n\nGale on the Lake.\n\n132. During the morning the sky had been cloudless, the air still, and the sun oppressively hot, but in the afternoon a long gentle swell began to rise upon the lake, and when we put off for our destination a wind arose which gradually increased to a gale before we landed in the evening on a low gravelly beach, at the north-west corner of Garden Island.\n\n133. In my report (No. 2) dated August 30, Islington Mission, Winnipeg River, I briefly described the events which occurred during the night of our arrival at this old camping ground of the Lake of the Wood Indians, the conference with a portion of the tribe the following day, and the reasons which determined us to proceed directly to Rat Portage, at the head of the Lake of the Woods, instead of pushing in a direct line towards Red River. The incidents not enumerated in that report have been duly recorded in my journal, and will appear in their proper place.\n\nGarden Island.\u2014Indian Corn, cultivated in hills.\u2014Potatoes, Pumpkins, Squashes, Sand Cherry.\u2014Passenger Pigeon.\u2014Host of Grasshoppers.\u2014Ravages of the Grasshoppers.\u2014Noise of their Jaws.\u2014Indians quite indifferent to them.\n\n134. Garden Island is about a mile and a half long and a mile broad as its widest part. Its western half is thickly wooded, the greater portion of the eastern half cleared and cultivated. A field containing about five acres was planted with Indian corn, then nearly ripe. The corn was cultivated in hills, and kept very free from weeds. Near the centre of the field were several graves, with neatly constructed birch bark coverings. Only one lodge was seen on the island, and that was placed about 100 yards from the graves. Near the space devoted to Indian corn were several small patches of potatoes, pumpkins, and squashes. An air of great neatness prevailed over the whole of the cultivated portion of the island, and in the part still remaining in its natural state, thickets of raspberry, black currant, and gooseberry bushes grew in the intervals between groves of elm, basswood and oak; and on the sandy beach are abundance of the sand cherry (cerasus pumila), the favourite Nekaiomena of the Indians. Large flocks of passenger pigeons (columba migratoria) flew backwards and forwards over the island, occasionally alighting in dense masses in the small groves. The shores were covered to the depth of two or three inches with countless millions of grasshoppers, which had been washed there during the gale of the preceding night. The greater number of the grasshoppers were alive, and as the rising sun warmed and invigorated them, they spread with much regularity over the fields of Indian corn and the potato patches; their progress across the potato patches was like that of an invading army of insects, eating and destroying every living green thing in their way. Before we left the island they had advanced, here and there, some thirty or forty yards from the beach, in a well defined undulating line, leaving behind them nothing but the bare and blackened stalks of the plants over which they had spread themselves and destroyed. By inclining the head, and seeking shelter from the wind under the lea of a bush, the noise of their jaws could be distinctly perceived; and had it been calm, I have no doubt it would have been heard with the greatest ease for a distance of several hundred yards. The Indians had seen the grasshoppers before, but never in such an alarming numbers; they appeared, however, quite indifferent to their progress, and quietly amused themselves as they squatted or lay on the ground, by jerking the intruders off their arms and legs with a thin piece of wood, bent by the fingers so as to act as a spring.\nShoal Lake, and the Muskeg or Marsh on the Height of Land between Red River and the Lake of the Woods.\n\n135. From Garden Island to the north-west corner of the lakes is about twenty miles, but the westerly limits of navigation are not yet found here. It is possible to proceed without difficulty some miles further on, in a due west direction, into a small lake called Shoal Lake. Although no facts derived from personal observations can be here adduced respecting the general feature of Shoal Lake, yet the importance which it derives from its position requires special mention to be made of it. From our Indian guide, permitted to take us to Rat Portage by the chiefs, to whom reference is made in Report No. 2, I learned that Shoal Lake is a ready expanse of water, eight or ten miles long, connected with the Lake of the Woods by a navigable channel. The north side and west end of Shoal Lake were represented to be blended with a vast marsh or muskeg which stretches from near Rat Portage to far south of the Lake of the Woods, and is the source of numerous rivers which flow from it both eastward and westward. It is this great muskeg or marsh which forms the barrier between Lake of the Woods and Red River valley, and a separate notice of it will be found further on.\n\nApproximate Distance of Shoal Lake from Fort Garry.\n\n136. On part of the south shore of Shoal Lake, and all along that part of the coast of the Lake of the Woods, there is considerable area of dry land timbered with spruce and small pine. Shoal Lake is only about eighty-seven miles in a direct line from Fort Garry, while by the very dangerous and circuitous Winnipeg route it is at least 320 miles. Shoal Lake is in latitude 49\u00b0 23', and the same meridian line cuts Red River at a spot twenty-five miles north of the boundary line and distant from it. The importance of the north-west corner of the Lake of the Woods, and possibly also of Shoal Lake at the terminus of a communication by land with Red River, cannot fail to be duly appreciated.\n\nLength of a Degree of Longitude on different Parallels.\n\n137. The following table shows the number of miles contained in a degree of longitude between the 45th and 55th parallels of latitude, from which the distance between the north-west corner of the lake and Red River was computed.\n\n| Degree of Latitude | Length in Miles |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 45                | 42\u00b0 43          |\n| 46                | 41\u00b0 68          |\n| 47                | 41\u00b0 00          |\n| 48                | 40\u00b0 15          |\n| 49                | 39\u00b0 36          |\n| 50                | 38\u00b0 57          |\n\n| Degree of Latitude | Length in Miles |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 51                | 37\u00b0 73          |\n| 52                | 37\u00b0 00          |\n| 53                | 36\u00b0 18          |\n| 54                | 35\u00b0 26          |\n| 55                | 34\u00b0 41          |\n\nIsland Scenery of the North-west Part of the Lake of the Woods.\u2014Good Timber in the Islands.\n\n138. From near the north-west corner of the lake the route we pursued lay through a labyrinth of islands in a north-east by north direction for a distance of twenty-eight miles. Six miles more nearly due north through scenery of the same description, but of bolder character, brought us to Rat Portage, on one of the numerous mouths of the rocky Winnipeg. Much good pine timber was seen on the larger islands near the northern part of the Lake of the Woods, and if conclusions may be drawn from the accounts which the Indians gave us of their gardens, it is very probable that extensive areas of excellent land exist on the great promontory and on some of the large islands. They spoke of growing Indian corn to a far greater extent than seen by us on Garden Island.\n\nTHE WINIPEG RIVER.\n\nChannels of the Winipeg.\u2014Numerous Windings of the Winipeg.\n\n139. Issuing from the Lake of the Woods through several gaps in the northern rim of the lake, the River Winnipeg flows through numerous tortuous and distinct channels for many miles of its course in a general north-east direction. Some of the channels unite with the main stream from ten to fifteen miles below Rat Portage, and one pursues nearly a straight course for a distance of sixty-five miles and joins the Winnipeg below the Barri\u00e8re Falls. The windings of this immense river are so abrupt and opposite than an enumeration of the successive general directions may not be without interest.\n\nFrom Rat Portage it flows:\n\n- 6 miles north-west.\n- 4 miles a few degrees to the east of north.\n- 24 miles north-west.\n- 8 miles south-west.\n- 24 miles north-west.\n\n- 8 miles a few degrees north of west.\n- 21 miles south-west by south.\n- 12 miles a few degrees south of west.\n- 22 miles due north.\n- 26 miles north-west.\n\nMagnificence of the Cascades on the Winipeg.\n\n140. In its course of 163 miles it descends by a succession of magnificent cataracts 349 feet. Some of the falls and rapids present the wildest and most picturesque scenery, displaying every variety of tumultuous cascades and foaming rapids, with treacherous eddies whitened with foam, and huge swelling waves rising massive and green over hidden rocks. Some of the sketches which accompany this report may succeed in conveying an impression of the beauty and grandeur which belong to the cascades and rapids of the Winipeg; but neither sketch nor language can portray the astonishing variety they present under different aspects; in the grey dawn of morning, or rose-coloured by the setting sun, or flashing in the brightness of noon-day, or silvered by the soft light of the moon.\nCharacter of the River.\u2014Rat Portage.\u2014Short Indian Route.\n\n141. The river frequently expands into large deep lakes, full of islands, bounded by precipitous cliffs or rounded hills of granite. The Fort in the occupation of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company at Rat Portage is very prettily situated at one outlet of the Lake of the Woods. It is surrounded with hills about 200 feet high, and near the Fort some white and red pine are standing amidst a lavigorous second growth. The rock about Rat Portage is chloritic slate, which soon gives place to granite, so that no area capable of cultivation was seen until we arrived at Islington Mission. We did not pursue the usual canoe route, but in the hope of overtaking the other members of the expedition, followed an Indian route for some miles, which was said by our guide to be half a day's journey shorter than that by the Great Winipeg.\n\nView from a Hill on the Winipeg.\u2014Character of the Country about the Upper Winipeg.\n\n142. At our first camp after leaving Rat Portage, I ascended a hill about 250 feet high, and obtained from its summit a very extensive view of the surrounding country. The broad river, with its numerous deep bays, was seen stretching far to the north, and all around dome-shaped hills, similar to the one on which I stood, showed their bare and scantily wooded summits in every direction; generally, they seemed to be thickly covered with small stunted pine, but in the hollows or valleys between them pine and spruce of large dimensions, with fair sized aspens and birch, flourished abundantly. The pine on the granite hill on which I stood grew in little hollows or in crevices of the rock. The general surface was either bare and so smooth and polished as to make walking dangerous, or else thickly covered with cariboo moss and tripe de roche. The aspect of the country was similar in its outline to the region about Mille Lacs, but the vegetation could not be brought into comparison with it. Until we arrived at Islington Mission the general features of the country maintained an appearance of hopeless sterility and inhospitable seclusion.\n\nIslington Mission.\u2014Cultivation of Wheat on the Winipeg.\u2014Cultivable Area on the Winipeg.\n\n143. Islington Mission, or the White Dog, or Chien Blanc, for by these names it is known to the voyageurs, occupies an area of what seems to be drift clay extending over 250 acres, surrounded by granite hills. The soil of this small oasis is very fertile, and all kinds of farm and garden crops succeed well. Wheat sown on the 20th May was reaped 26th August in general; it requires but ninety-three days to mature. Potatoes have never been attacked by spring or fall frosts (five years); Indian corn ripens well; spring opens and vegetation commences about the 10th of May, and winter sets in generally about the 1st of November. These facts are noticed in connexion with the small cultivable area at Islington Mission on account of the occurrence of other available areas, varying from fifty to 300 acres in extent, between the Mission and Silver Falls, about eighteen miles from the mouth of the river. From Silver Falls to where the river flows into Lake Winipeg, poor and rocky land is the exception, alluvial and fertile tracts, bearing groves of heavy aspens and other trees, prevailing.\n\n144. The cultivable areas on the river banks are indicated by dotted lines on the map, as they may possibly acquire importance, for they may be regarded in the light of productive islands in a sterile waste of rock and marsh. From Silver Falls to Fort Alexander alluvial or drift clay prevails, and in the neighbourhood of the Fort many thousand acres are susceptible of cultivation.\n\nWild Rice Grounds on the Winipeg.\u2014Game congregate among the Rice Fields.\n\n145. Below James' Falls the poles of wigwams are numerous, and many Indians were seen at the foot of the different rapids engaged in fishing. The scarcity of animal life of all kinds was very remarkable. Eagles and fish hawks, ducks and rabbits being the only representatives seen. This scarcity is, however, confined to the autumnal months as to the time, and to the Great Winipeg River in respect of area. Some distance from the river there are extensive rice grounds (Zizania aquatica), covering many thousand acres, and continuing for many miles on either bank. Here the game congregates, and revelling in the midst of such an abundant supply of nutritious food, vast flocks of ducks, geese, and all kinds of aquatic birds common in the regions are to be found. The Indians, too, assemble at stated periods and visit the rice grounds, procuring without any difficulty, in favourable seasons, a large supply for winter consumption.\n\nThe Penawa River.\u2014Birds in the Rice Grounds of the Penawa.\n\n146. Instead of following the course of the Great Winipeg after arriving at the Otter Falls, I passed down the Penawa River into Bonnet Lake, thus avoiding the dangerous \"Seven Portages,\" and saving several miles of route. Near the entrance of the Penawa into Bonnet Lake, the little river winds through an immense marshy area covered with wild rice, and I succeeded in collecting a considerable quantity as the Indians paddled through it with undiminished speed. There, too, were seen vast numbers of different species of duck, and many other kinds of birds, such as herons, pigeons, woodpeckers, cedar birds, jays, &c.\n\nFailure of Rice this Year.\n\n147. The Indians lamented the failure of the rice this year; they described the appearance in favourable seasons of the grounds through which we were hurrying as a vast expanse of waving grain, from which they could soon fill their small canoes by beating the rice with a stick. The water of the river and marshes have this year been unusually high, so as to check the growth of the rice to an extent which, when coupled with other deficiencies, threaten them with famine during the coming winter.\n\nFailure or Scarcity of Fish in the Winipeg this Year (1837).\n\n148. The same cause which has originated the partial failure of the wild rice has led to a great scarcity in fish. In general, the Winipeg teems with fish, among which are sturgeon, pike, two kinds\nof white fish, perch, suckers, &c., affording bountiful supply to the Indians, who hunt and line on or near the lower portion of this majestic river. The extraordinary height of its waters during the present season have so extended the feeding grounds of the fish, that they are with difficulty caught in sufficient numbers to provide the Indians with their staple food.\n\nFailure or Disappearance of the Rabbits on the Winipeg this Year (1857).\u2014Probable painful Consequences of these Failures.\n\n149. The unlooked-for short supply of rice and fish have been more severely felt, in consequence of the unaccountable disappearance and death of the rabbits, which are generally found in vast multitudes in the region of the Lake of the Woods and Winipeg River. During the past spring and summer large numbers of rabbits have been found dead in the woods, owing probably to the exhaustion which followed the late severe winter, prolonged this year to an unprecedented length in these regions. With a partial failure in the rice, and great scarcity of fish, and the prospect of a very limited supply of rabbits, the anticipations of the coming winter on the part of those who care to think of the sufferings of the wretched Indians on the River Winipeg are gloomy indeed.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nLAKE WINIPEG AND RED RIVER TO THE INDIAN SETTLEMENT.\n\nAltitude of Lake Winipeg above the Sea, 150.\u2014Its length, breadth, and area, 151.\u2014Lake Manitoba and Winipegoose, 151.\u2014Tributaries received by Lake Winipeg; The Canoe Route, 153.\u2014Mouth of Red River, 153.\u2014Importance of Lake Winipeg, 154.\u2014Agriculture at the mouth of the Winipeg River, 155.\u2014Ancient beach of Lake Winipeg; Boulders on the Cliffs; Virginian Creeper; vast number of wild fowl, 155.\u2014Bar at the mouth of Red River, Nelly Creek, 156.\u2014Fertile character of the country about the Indian Missionary Village; Contract between the Indian Settlers at the Mission and the Savage Tribes of the Lower Winipeg, 157.\u2014Table of distances and heights along the canoe route, 158.\n\nLake Winipeg's Altitude above the Sea.\n\n150. Lake Winipeg is \u2014\u2014\u2014 miles in an air line from Lake Superior, and 616-22 by the canal route. The altitude of this extensive sheet of water above the level of the sea is 628 feet, according to the estimate of this report. Other observers make it a few more or less; others again considerably in excess of what is thought to be a close approximation to its true altitude. A table is given at the close of Part I., in which some of these differences, with their authors' names, are enumerated.\n\nThe Length, Breadth, and Area.\u2014Tributaries received by Lake Winipeg.\n\n151. Lake Winipeg is 264 miles long, by an average of thirty-five wide. It certainly contains an area exceeding 9,000 square miles, and is probably one-half as large again as Lake Ontario. Connected with Lake Winipeg by navigable channels are two other large bodies of water, Lakes Manitoba and Winipegoos, being together nearly as long as Lake Winipeg, and having about half its breadth. The water area of these lakes may, with some small connexions, equal, if it does not exceed, that of Ontario and Erie combined.\n\nTributaries received by Lake Winipeg.\n\n152. Among the numerous tributaries received by Lake Winipeg are Red River, unwatering in part a region which is in some degree tributary to the Mississippi. The Great Winipeg River, 163 miles long, draining the Lake of the Woods region and its tributaries 300 miles to the east. Numerous rivers coming in from the eastern belt of the granitic rock, which separates the valley of Lake Winipeg from Hudson and James' Bay. On the west side it receives the noble Saskatchewan, bearing its tribute from the rocky mountains a thousand miles to the west. Red Deer River and Swan River fall into Winipegoos Lake, besides many other minor streams which drain the prairies to the west of those magnificent lake expansions.\n\nThe Canoe Route through Lake Winipeg.\u2014Mouths of River.\u2014Hayfields at the Mouth of the River.\n\n153. A glance at the map will show that the canoe route merely touches or approaches the southeast coast of Lake Winipeg in the traverses to the mouth of Red River. From the imperfect observations possible to be made under such circumstances, little or nothing can be said of the character of that small portion of the coast which is seen from the canoe route. The mouths of Red River are four in number, and find their connexion with Lake Winipeg through an immense area of rushes and willows, growing upon land at or below the level of the water of the lake. It is not until a point six or seven miles from the lake is reached that land, properly so called, is found. Here, during the summer months, large quantities of hay are made by the people of Red River, which is taken away during the winter; spring freshets laying the whole of this tract under water.\n\nImportance of Lake Winipeg.\u2014Drains a Valley 400,000 square miles in area, and easily accessible.\n\n154. Lake Winipeg once reached, communication with the interior becomes an easy matter. The numerous rivers which unwater the valley of this great lake, with an area of 400,000 square miles, are most of them canoe or boat routes for many hundred miles up their streams. Lake Winipeg is very shallow at its southern extremity, and the marshy shores past which the canoe route to Red River runs abound with fresh water shells, and are the haunts of innumerable aquatic birds, among which are seen many species of duck, two species of geese, pelicans, cranes, bitterns, and plover.\nAgriculture at the Mouth of the Winipeg.\u2014Ancient Beach of Lake Winipeg.\u2014Cliff Boulders of gigantic Dimensions.\u2014Virginian Creeper.\u2014Vast Number of Wild Fowl.\n\n155. Fort Alexander is situated within one mile and three-fourths of the lake at the mouth of the Winipeg, and here I saw wheat in process of being harvested on 3rd of September, and obtained some new potatoes of great size and excellent quality; and I was informed by the gentleman in charge of the Fort that Indian corn succeeded well in many parts of the south-eastern rim of the lake, and that it was very rarely touched by late spring frosts; it is cultivated by the Indians. The west shore of Traverse Bay is high, and shows an excellent soil thickly covered with balsam, poplar, aspens, and birch. The lodges of Indians are very numerous, as it forms one of their most important fishing grounds. The temperature of the Winipeg at its mouth was $66^\\circ$5 at 6 p.m., and that of Traverse Bay at 6 a.m. on the following day, $64^\\circ$5. An optical phenomenon of singular beauty was observed in making the Grand Traverse, nearly due south to the mouth of the Red River. This will be described in its proper place. When we landed to breakfast or dine, opportunities were afforded of examining the precipitous but unstable cliffs which were occasionally exposed. At a point on the east coast of the Grand Traverse, Section No. , was sketched and roughly measured. It shows one feature of interest, which is common to all the great lakes of the St. Lawrence basin. The summit of the cliff, clothed with an inch or two of sandy loam, shows an ancient lake beach, composed of water-worn boulders, pebbles, and stratified sand two feet thick. This is underlaid by sixteen feet of stratified sand, containing limestone fragments and primitive boulders, and flanked by a talus of shingle and boulders, among which bright yellow, cream-coloured, and beautifully variegated limestone slabs are numerous. This talus is the present shore of the lake, and the shingle slabs and boulders have probably been washed out of the unstable cliff. Its breadth may reach sixty feet, and the inclination three to five feet from the level of the lake, giving to the ancient beach, at the summit, an elevation of twenty-one feet above the present level of the waters of the lake. About five miles further south I ascended a cliff fifty feet high, consisting of stratified sand and marl, in which were embedded primitive boulders of most gigantic dimensions, some of them measured twelve to fifteen feet through; they were all water-worn, and distributed throughout the cliff. On the surface walking was exceedingly difficult, on account of their numbers and size. Many of them were covered with the Virginian creeper (ampetopsis quinquefolia). The base of the cliff was well protected by an immense accumulation of these erratics, which had fallen from the loose sand of the cliff. The temperature of the lake six miles beyond this point was $64^\\circ$5. A heavy squall from the north-west compelled us to approach the shore when within three miles of the mouth of the Red River. The waves rose with great rapidity, as usual in large, open, shallow sheets of water, and compelled a hasty retreat among the willows and rushes, where, notwithstanding that we were exposed to the discomfort of the waves washing over our camp during the night, we were compelled to remain in this damp maze of reeds until the winds and waves subsided. There I had an opportunity of observing the vast number of duck, geese, and plover which congregated amongst the rushes during the night. In the morning, flights swept backwards and forwards close to our camp in constant succession.\n\nBar at the Mouth of the Red River.\u2014Netley Creek.\n\n156. Red River enters Lake Winipeg by four distinct channels. Its junction with the lake by the channel through which we entered is marked by a bar, in which there is not more than three feet water close to a pit of sand, which was the only piece of land seen amidst the tall reeds extending far to the south, and beyond the point where the river channel unites some three miles from the mouth of the main channel. Land which is dry during the summer months and at the stage of water in the river on the 5th of September, about two and a half to four feet above its level, begins five miles from the mouth of the main channel. Half a mile above this point Netley Creek comes in from the west, and by means of this small affluent much of the water during floods from the upper country reaches Lake Winipeg. Large numbers of hay stacks were seen here in September last. An immense area flooded during the spring, producing a very rank profusion of those grasses which delight in a rich marshy soil.\n\nFertile Character of the Country above and a little below the Indian Village.\u2014Contrast between Settlers at the Indian Village and Savage Tribes in the Lower Winipeg.\n\n157. A little below the Indian village, fourteen miles from the mouth of the river, the whole country rises; the banks are about twenty feet high, the timber imposing, and in considerable variety, and all the aspects of a level fertile country gradually come into view. The sameness in the general aspect of the banks at this season of the year becomes monotonous after the wild and varying beauties of the Winipeg. But the sight of clearings and the neat white houses of settlers at the Indian missionary village speedily creates another feeling, aroused by such fair comparisons between the humanizing influence of civilization and the degraded brutal condition of a barbarous heathen race, which quickly follow one another in passing from the cascades and rapids of the Winipeg, with half-clad savages fishing at the foot, to the even flow of Red River, with Christian men and women, once heathen and wild, living in security on its banks.\n### Temperature of the Lakes and Rivers, from the Height of Land to Lake

S.\u2014Tributaries of Red River.\u2014Length of Red River within the U. S.\n\n160. The Red River of the North rises in Ottertail Lake, Minnesota territory.* The north-east end of Ottertail Lake is in lat. 46\u00b0 24' 1\". The general course of the river is south-west, through an attractive undulating country, until it makes its great bend to the north, which lies in lat. 46\u00b0 9'. It then meanders through a boundless prairie, destitute of timber, which gradually declines in elevation until it forms a vast level plain, elevated above the water only about one and a half to two feet, at its ordinary stage in June. The distance of this great bend is 110 miles from the source of the river in Ottertail Lake. The vast low prairie through which it flows is level as a floor. Its course through the flat country, in which it has succeeded in cutting a channel, is very tortuous. In latitude 46\u00b0 23' 30\" a belt of timber sets in, and continues with some interruption along the banks of the river on one side or another to Pembina. To latitude 46\u00b0 23' the waters continue comparatively clear: beyond this they become more and more turbid. In latitude 46\u00b0 41' 12\" the level of the prairie above the river is thirty feet, and is probably due to the gradual cutting away of the river channel in soft clay. Red River receives few tributaries south of the forty-ninth parallel: these are, in order, the Psihu river, eight or ten yards wide at its mouth; the Shayenne, double that width; Buffalo River, Elm River; Wild Rice, Goose, and Sand Hill Rivers. The Red Fork, in latitude 47\u00b0 55' from Red Lake, is a tributary of some importance. It is on the line of communication between the Lake of the Woods and Red River with the United States boundary, and joins with the main stream 380 miles from Ottertail Lake. Tentle River, Big Joline and Two Rivers next follow, after which the last affluent, Pembina River, comes in from the west, two miles south of the forty-ninth parallel: the total distance from the mouth of this ascent to Ottertail Lake being 525 miles, by the course of the stream. Dr. Owen remarks of the country through which Red River flows in the United States\u2019 territory, that it possesses features, both geologically and physically, of great sameness and flatness, without the least indication of containing minerals of any value, except salt, which may be crystallized out of saline springs.\n\nI now proceed to describe that portion of the Red River of the North which lies within British territory, and in so doing shall follow the canoe route from Lake Winnipeg against the current.\n\nPHYSICAL FEATURES OF RED RIVER FROM THE INDIAN MISSIONARY VILLAGE TO FORTY-NINTH PARALLEL.\n\nSugar Point.\u2014Limestone Exposures.\u2014Limestone exposed.\n\n161. Three miles below the Honourable Hudson Bay Company\u2019s Lower or Stone Fort, and at about four from the Indian Missionary Village, a remarkable bend in the course of the stream gives rise to a sharp projection of the level plateau of the prairie. Sugar Point, as it is termed from the groves of maple which cover it, is probably preserved from the abrading action of the stream by numerous fragments of limestone which lie at the bottom of the river bank, and continually increase in number and size in its ascending course, as far as the exposed strata of limestone, at and above the lower fort, where their place is supplied in part by exposures of the parent rock.\n\nMaple.\u2014Banks of the River.\n\n162. The maple, which at one time grew in considerable quantities near Sugar Point, is not the true sugar maple (acer saccharinum) so common in Western Canada, but another species, also furnishing an abundance of juice from which sugar is made as far north as the Saskatchewan. It is the ash-leaved maple (negundo flaxinifolium). The common sugar maple is, however, found in the valley of Red River north of the forty-ninth parallel. Near to Sugar Point is an Indian school, in connexion with the Indian Mission below, situated north of the line which divides the Parish of St. Peter from that of St. Andrew, and marking the northern limits of the Red River Settlement. The banks on both sides are very heavily timbered close to the river; and between this point and the Stone or Lower Fort of the settlement there are very few farmhouses. The general direction of the river from Sugar Point to Fort Garry is a few degrees to the west of south. In an air line the distance is twenty miles; by the road on the left or west bank, twenty-one; and by the river itself, twenty-three miles and a half. The scenery and objects which meet the eye in ascending the river between the Lower Fort and the forty-ninth parallel are uniform, but singular and interesting.\n\nPhysical Features of Red River.\u2014Grand Rapids.\u2014Bars of Mud, holding Boulders and Shells.\u2014Forest Timber.\u2014Character of the River Banks.\u2014Extent and Richness of the Prairie.\n\n163. First, with reference to physical features, it is merely necessary to imagine a river from 200 to 350 feet broad, with a moderately rapid current, having in the course of ages excavated a winding\n\n* The description of that part of Red River within the territory of the United States, as given in the text, is abbreviated from Dr. D. D. Owen\u2019s account in his geological survey of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.\ntrench or cut to the depth of from thirty to forty feet, in tenacious clay, through a nearly level country for a distance exceeding 100 miles, and the general physical aspect of Red River within British territory is reproduced. Here and there local diversities occur, which give some appearance of variety. Such are noticed at the Grand Rapids, where the even flow is broken and disturbed by a ledge of limestone, which may occasion a fall of four feet within a mile. A lower plateau has here and there been excavated perhaps ten feet below the general level of the prairie banks. An instance of this kind occurs at Dr. Burn's house, and the section marked No. I shows the relation of the river to the lower plateau and the Great Prairie or Rain Plateau above it. Occasionally sand, mud, and gravel bars are formed at numerous sharp turns in the general course of the stream, similar to those which may be observed upon the chart at Point Douglas, also above Fort Garry, near La Riviere Sal, near Scratching Creek, &c. These projecting bars or points are often covered with fragments of limestone, primitive boulders, and vast numbers of large fresh-water shells (Specimen No. \u2014). The current round them is rapid, and they present a formidable obstacle to the navigation of the river by means of steamers exceeding 100 to 120 feet in length. Often, too, on one side or the other, and sometimes on both sides, a narrow belt of heavy forest timber closes upon the river, and seems suddenly to narrow and darken its abrupt windings. The most uniform character, however, and one which is more frequently found on the west side, is a clean and steep line of bank about thirty feet in altitude, perfectly level to the eye, and forming the boundary of a vast ocean of prairie, whose horizon or intermediate surface is rarely broken by small islands of poplar or willow, and whose long, rank, and luxuriant grasses, show everywhere a uniform distribution, and indicate the character of the soil they cover so profusely. A subsequent closer inspection of the soil never failed to establish its fertility and abundance, as well as its distribution over areas as far as the eye can reach, both eastward and westward, on the banks of this remarkable river.\n\n164. Such are the general physical features of Red River within British territory. I now propose to enumerate the objects which arrest the attention, first in passing up the river to the forty-ninth parallel, and second, in travelling along the road on its western bank. This division is necessary, since any attempt to describe the topography of Red River Valley, from points of view limited to the river level, would be something like an effort to portray the general appearance of a capacious farm-yard from views which might be supposed to be obtained from the bottom of its well.\n\nObjects seen from the River between the Indian Settlement and the Forty-ninth Parallel.\n\nAspect of River between the Indian Village and Forty-ninth Parallel.\u2014Timber on Banks.\u2014Limestone at the Stone Fort.\u2014Whirlpool Point.\u2014Limestone seen in massive Layers above Big Eddy.\u2014Application of the Limestone to Building Purposes.\u2014Houses seen on the Banks of the Grand Rapids.\u2014Stone Church.\u2014Mill Creek.\u2014Swamp sustained by the Dam across Mill Creek.\u2014A large Area, probably exceeding 20,000 acres, never flooded at Red River.\n\n165. The objects which arrest attention in ascending the river between Sugar Point and the Lower or Stone Fort, are limited to precipitous clay banks, fringed with elm, poplar, maple, oak and ash, all of large growth, but not fair representatives of the forest which once occupied its banks, having been subjected to a culling process for twenty years to supply the necessities of the settlement above. Among the underbrush the Virginian creeper and occasionally a wild grape, with a profusion of convolvulus twining round hazel, and rose bushes are most conspicuous. At the Stone Fort, massive layers of limestone crop out, which have been extensively quarried, and their application is seen in the walls and bastions of the fort built upon the bank here, about forty feet in altitude, and forming the abrupt termination of the prairie stretching westward, which for some distance sustains a small but dense growth of aspens. At each turn of the river above this point the houses of the inhabitants of Red River settlement come in sight, and these occupy at short intervals the river bank all the way up to Fort Garry, a distance of twenty-three miles and a half by the windings of the river. When nearly two miles above the Stone Fort, we arrive at Whirlpool Point, and immediately above this at the Big Eddy; these are obstacles to further progress, formidable only in name, and like most other local descriptive titles on this river must be accepted with the mildest interpretation, and only understood to designate marked differences from the general even flow of the waters of the river; a small brook on which a water mill is situated enters the river at the Big Eddy. A short distance above the same locality (the Big Eddy) limestone is seen in heavy layers on the west bank, and detached fragments in great abundance protect the base of the cliff, which in no instance, observed from the mouth to the forty-ninth parallel, rises above forty feet from the water level. Some very substantial illustrations of the adaptation of the limestone for building purposes occur here, and particularly at the Grand Rapids, two miles and a quarter farther up. Among them may be mentioned the house of Mr. Gunn, to whom I am much indebted for a valuable register of meteorological observations, made three times a day during 1855-56. The east side of the river is wooded to a depth varying from a few yards to a mile, and generally this feature prevails along the eastern bank to Fort Garry; the timber is similar to that already described. At the Grand Rapids, which even during the low stage of water in September, offer no formidable obstacle to the Company's and freighters' boats carrying four and five tons, an assemblage of well built stone buildings are grouped, which create a very favourable impression of Red River resources and comfort, not unfrequently repeated as we ascend the stream. There we find a very substantial stone church, capable of seating 500 people, and surrounded with a neat stone wall enclosing an extensive burying ground. About 300 yards south of the church, the parsonage house is seen from the river, and a visit to its interior, to be more fully noticed subsequently, proved that every desirable comfort was enjoyed by the kind and hospitable incumbent, Archdeacon Hunter; adjoining the parsonage is the residence of the curate, Mr. Kirby, and next to that a capacious and well built school-house of wood. Four miles above the Grand Rapids, Mill Creek enters the river, having cut its way through the yielding clay substratum of the prairie, to a depth of twenty-five feet,\nhalf a mile from its mouth. Here the water mill is situated which gives a name to this creek, but which is fed to a great extent by a large but shallow marshy tract called the Big Swamp, occupying some thousand acres as indicated on the chart; as will be shown hereafter, it is mainly sustained by the mill dam holding up its waters, and thus preventing them from draining into the river. Mill Creek and its westerly extension into the swamp form a very important physical feature in the topography of this region; the slight depression in which it flows, continued through the swamp to Mill Creek, forms the passage of water, during floods, from Red River to Lake Winnipeg, whenever the waters accumulate so as to overflow their banks. From this feature, it results that the whole country north of the line drawn on the chart is dry during the highest floods, and affords an area which probably exceeds 20,000 acres, not liable to the destructive but fortunately rare inundations which have occurred since settlements were first formed here.\n\nSection of the River.\n\n166. For two miles and a half above Mill Creek, the river banks break off abruptly from the prairie level, and, on the east side, are well wooded. The houses of the inhabitants occur at regular intervals upon the immediate banks. At a short distance above the very commodious and comfortable residence of Mrs. Bird, a lower plateau, caused by denudation, commences, and its prairie boundary passes in the rear of Dr. Burns' house, where a portion of the expedition are residing for the winter, and comes upon the river again before reaching the Presbyterian church. The section marked No. 6 shows the relation of the lower plateau to the general level of the Great Prairie, the relation of the swamp to the river, and also of the ancient beach or ridge of Lake Winnipeg to the general level of the country. The following table of heights and distances, taken for this purpose, will exhibit these relations in regular order:\n\n| Distance from Water Mark, September 18th | Height above Water Mark, September 17th |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Water mark 0 feet                       | 0 feet                                  |\n| 66 west                                 | 18.48                                   |\n| 109                                     | 11.36                                   |\n| 152                                     | 20.74                                   |\n| 233                                     | 20.06                                   |\n| 830                                     | 16.52                                   |\n| 1230                                    | 19.07                                   |\n| 1330                                    | 25.76                                   |\n| 1833                                    | 27.52                                   |\n| 2431                                    | 25.04                                   |\n| 2482                                    | 23.80                                   |\n| 2667                                    | 27.38                                   |\n| 2988                                    | 27.30                                   |\n| 4212                                    | 26.31                                   |\n\nDr. Burn's house.\n\nKing's Road.\n\nSmall shallow bed of creek.\n\nGrand Prairie level.\n\nCommencement.\n\nJ.

Above Dr. Burns' house the course of the river is gently winding between the high prairie banks, which generally maintain an altitude of about thirty feet; houses and windmills occur at regular intervals, until the steeple of St. John's Church and the peaked roof of St. John's College, the schoolhouse, the bishop's residence, &c., offer the appearance of a large village, which is again re-produced after the sharp turn at Point Douglas, by the imposing Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to St. Boniface, the spacious nunnery and the parish school, with other buildings on the left, and a group of several commodious private dwelling-houses just below Fort Garry, on the right. About half way between these small centres of population, as they may be termed, Point Douglas occurs, and on the east bank of the river, German Creek, a small meandering stream comes in from the south. A quarter of a mile above the Roman Catholic Church, the Assiniboine enters Red River, and a short distance up this stream the summits of Fort Garry come into view. Above the mouth of the Assiniboine the course of the river is exceedingly tortuous. An idea of its meandering may be obtained from the comparison between the river distance from Fort Garry to the mouth of La Riviere Sal, or Stinking Creek, and the relative position of the same places by the road; the former being sixteen and the latter nine miles. The next houses of settlers appear at intervals on the banks for several miles above La Riviere Sal, the last house being situated thirteen miles from Fort Garry, or fifty-seven from the forty-ninth parallel. Above this the river windings are fringed with forest, varying in depth from a few yards to half a mile. Here and there naked bends are exposed to the prairie. The peninsula portion on the opposite side is generally clothed with trees of large dimensions, and this character is preserved far south of the forty-ninth parallel.\nTHE WEST BANK OF RED RIVER, FROM THE INDIAN SETTLEMENT TO THE FORTY-NINTH PARALLEL, A DISTANCE OF 100 MILES BY THE ROAD.\n\n168. From that portion of the Indian village which lies on the west bank of the river to the Lower or Stone Fort, little can be seen of the surrounding country, as the road traverses a forest of small aspens, and the farms are few in number and small in extent.\n\nThe King's Road.\u2014Aspen Woods.\u2014Scene south of Water Mill Creek.\u2014Woods of the Assiniboine.\u2014Rural Beauty of the Scenery.\n\n169. The Lower or Stone Fort covers an area of about four acres, and encloses within it walls numerous buildings, which will be described in another portion of this report. The main or King's Road does not follow the windings of the river, but stretches from point to point, sometimes approaching it at these places within a quarter or half a mile. Where the river windings throw it back to a distance exceeding a mile, inner roads, as they are termed, branch off to the river banks for the convenience of settlers; and there is a bridle-path all the way from the Lower to the Upper Fort, on the immediate bank of the river. Aspen woods continue to shut out the view until we arrive within a mile or two of Water Mill Creek, when a scene opens upon the right, which discloses on the one hand the white houses and cottages of the inhabitants, with their barns, haystacks, and cattle yards grouped at short distances from one another, and stretching away in a thin vanishing line to the south, while on the other hand a boundless, treeless ocean of grass, seemingly a perfect level, meets the horizon on the west. The same kind of scenery, varied only, on the left hand, as the road approaches or recedes from the farmhouses on the river banks, or passes near the neat and substantial churches, which at almost regular distances intervene, prevails without interruption until within four or five miles of Fort Garry. Here stretching away, until lost in the western horizon, the belts of wood on the banks of the Assiniboine rise above the general level, while from the Assiniboine towards the north again is an uninterrupted expanse of long waving prairie grass, dotted with herds of cattle, and in the fall of the year with immense stacks of hay. This is the ordinary aspect of the country comprising that portion of the Red River Settlement which lies between Mill Creek and Fort Garry. Remove the farmhouses and churches, replacing them on the river banks by forest trees of the largest growth, and the country between Fort Garry and the forty-ninth parallel, as seen along the road to Pembina, a distance of seventy miles, is continually reproduced in its ordinary aspect of sameness, immensity, and unclaimed endowments.\n\nExtraordinary Aspects of the Country through which Red River flows in British Territory,\u2014Aspect at Sunrise,\u2014at Noon-day,\u2014at Sunset,\u2014by Moonlight,\u2014at Night, when the distant Prairies are in a blaze.\n\n170. But it must be seen in its extraordinary aspects, before it can be rightly valued and understood, in reference to its future occupation by an energetic and civilized race, able to improve its vast capabilities and appreciate its boundless beauties. It must be seen at sunrise, when the vast plain suddenly flashes with rose-coloured light, as the first rays of the sun sparkle in the dew on the long rich grass, gently stirred by the unfailing morning breeze. It must be seen at noon-day, when refraction swells into the forms of distant hill ranges the ancient beaches and ridges of Lake Winnipeg, which mark its former extension; when each willow bush is magnified into a grove, each far distant clump of aspens, not seen before, into wide forests, and the outline of wooded river banks, far beyond unassisted vision, rise into view. It must be seen at sunset, when, just as the huge ball of fire is dipping below the horizon, he throws a flood of red light, indescribably magnificent, upon the illimitable waving green, the colours blending and separating with the gentle roll of the long grass, seemingly magnified towards the horizon into the distant heaving swell of a parti-coloured sea. It must be seen, too, by moonlight, when the summits of the low green grass waves are tipped with silver, and the stars in the west disappear suddenly as they touch the earth. Finally, it must be seen at night, when the distant prairies are in a blaze, thirty, fifty, or seventy miles away; when the fire reaches clumps of aspen, and the forked tips of the flames, magnified by refraction, flash and quiver in the horizon, and the reflected light from rolling clouds of smoke above tell of the havoc which is raging below.\n\nImmensity of the Prairies of Red River.\n\n171. These are some of the scenes which must be witnessed and felt before the mind forms a true conception of these rich prairie wastes, in the unrelieved immensity which belongs to them, in common with all the ocean, but which, unlike the ever-changing and unstable sea, seem to offer a bountiful recompence, in a secure though distant home, to millions of our fellow-man.\n\nTHE ASSINIBOINE RIVER\u2014FORT GARRY TO PRAIRIE PORTAGE, BY THE RIVER.\n\nThe Assiniboine River.\n\n172. Fort Garry is situated a few hundred yards west of the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red River. The Assiniboine, for a distance of 150 miles by its windings, the farthest point I reached in a westerly direction, may be said to present an exact resemblance in every important physical feature, except size, to Red River. The tortuous sinuosities of the larger stream are reproduced, with curious fidelity, in the magnificent prairies through which its western rival runs.\n\nAncient Lake Beaches.\n\n173. For several miles above Fort Garry the Assiniboine flows in a trench excavated through a level prairie to the same depth as the river it feeds; in other words, from twenty-five to forty feet. Differences due to local variations in the height of the bank are referable to very slight undulations in the level of the prairie, and to the occurrence of ancient lake beaches or ridges, the first of which is cut by the Assiniboine, near St. James's Church. This ridge continues in a direction nearly due north, until it rises apparently above the general level of the prairie, into an elevated ancient beach of Lake Winnipeg. This\napparent rise is really due to the gentle slope of the prairie in the direction of the Great Lake. The ancient beach itself is no doubt perfectly horizontal. It is near this spot that the rapids occur, which, in the summer months, when the water is low, offer a small impediment to the continuous boat navigation of the Assiniboine for many miles.\n\nBreadth of the River at Prairie Portage.\u2014Sturgeon Creek.\n\n174. Some short distance above the rapids the river widens. At its mouth it may be 150 feet in breadth, and four miles from its mouth 200 feet, a breadth which it is reported to preserve with very remarkable uniformity for a distance of 130 miles. I saw the river frequently at the different points where the road approached it, and its breadth, or the volume of water it conveyed, seemed to be in no degree diminished at Prairie Portage, the highest point reached; indeed, the impression produced after a careful examination of the river at Prairie Portage, almost led to a belief that the volume of water was fully as great there as at its confluence with the Red River; the affluent it receives during a course of 130 miles below Prairie Portage not supplying the exhaustion produced by evaporation. About six miles and a half from Fort Garry the Assiniboine receives a small affluent, called Sturgeon Creek, coming from the north-west. The general direction of the river up to this point is nearly due west, and its course comparatively straight. The south bank thus far is heavily timbered to a small depth; the north bank is much occupied by farms, and is destitute of timber.\n\nMeanderings of the Assiniboine.\u2014Height of Banks.\n\n175. From Sturgeon Creek the course against the stream continues still westerly, but with more decided meanderings, and the wooded points on both sides of the river rarely penetrate a quarter of a mile into the vast prairie on either side. The distance from Fort Garry to where it makes its north-westerly bend is twenty-three miles by the river's windings, but by the road through the prairies and settlements only sixteen miles. The river banks are here about eighteen feet high, and their height imperceptibly diminishes until, at Prairie Portage, they were found by measurement not to exceed sixteen feet, during the stage of water, on the 7th of last September 1857.\n\nRemarkable Windings.\n\n176. After making its north-west turn the Assiniboine is so remarkably crooked that a straight line drawn through the tract of country in which it meanders for a distance of twelve miles would be cut eighteen times by the river, and these windings are confined within such a limited breadth that in a strip of the same length, and 1,000 yards broad, the curves of the river would just overlap this boundary four times.\n\nLane's Post.\u2014Section of the River Bank.\n\n177. At this point of river, which is about twenty-three miles from Fort Garry, there is a post of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company in charge of Mr. Lane; the banks here, at the time of my visit, were about eighteen feet above the water, and quite precipitous, so that there was some little difficulty in getting at the water's edge for washing and other purposes. A fresh exposure of the bank, which by the way is continually breaking down in small patches, and changing, during the lapse of many years, the channel of the river, exhibited stratified whitish clay, and dark drab coloured clay from the water's edge to within five feet of the prairie level, which here, as is frequently the case, comes abruptly upon the river. Dark unstratified or alluvial clay succeeds, having an average thickness of about four feet; this is followed by from six to eighteen inches of black prairie mould.*\n\nSettlements cease on the Assiniboine, nine miles west of Lane's Post.\u2014Heavily Timbered Banks.\n\n178. Beyond Mr. Lane's Post the river course is westerly for a few miles, it then makes a bend towards the north-west until Long Lake is reached, after which it turns towards the south-west for about sixteen or eighteen miles, thence westerly, ten miles further to Prairie Portage. Nine miles beyond Mr. Lane's the settlements cease, until they recommence at about thirty miles further up the stream by the road, and although the distance from Mr. Lane's to Prairie Portage is not more than forty-three miles, the course of the winding Assiniboine would probably exceed ninety miles. The river banks are heavily timbered, and sustain trees of very large dimensions. The distances between the top of the bank is variable, but appears generally to be between 600 and 800 feet, but at sharp turns it was often not more 400; whenever it exceeded that distance one side was steep and washed by the water, the other occupied by a sand spit or mud flat at the foot of the opposite bank.\n\nRiver at Prairie Portage.\u2014Sketch of remarkable Mud Flats on this River.\n\n179. During my stay at Prairie Portage I had an excellent opportunity of examining the relation of the sand and mud flats to the river banks, as well as the forest which here, to the depth of half a mile, fringed it. The following sketch shows one of the sand and mud flats (Sept. 4th, 1857) about half a mile below Prairie Portage. The river is here about 180 feet broad, and with a rapid current sweeps under the south bank, which forms the outer arc of a very beautiful curve extending over 120 degrees. The cord of this arc is well defined by the old north bank of the river, under which probably it once swept, but now only touches when the channel is full, as during spring freshets; the length of this cord is perhaps 700 yards, and at each end the river is seen sweeping between steep banks, sixteen feet high, until a little lower down or a little higher up, similar curves, with their accompanying sand and mud flats, recur. These sand and mud flats are arranged in the order of the specific quantities of the materials which compose them, but with such singular regularity and with such curious and interesting admixtures, that I have considered it worth while to describe them with some degree of particularity.\n\nBones of Elk, Buffalo, Deer, and Human Skulls found in the Mud Flats of the Assiniboine.\u2014Arrangement of Mud, Sand, &c. common.\n\n180. A glance at the diagram or sketch may render the following description more intelligible. At the western extremity of the curve, as shown in the diagram, a few rounded boulders were seen,\n\n* See Section No. 8, on the Assiniboine.\nnot exceeding eight inches in diameter; these were followed by gravel spots as the area opened; beyond the gravel tongue, on spits which extended perhaps over a quarter of the segment, flats of coarse sand showed themselves, these were strangely filled and strewed with the decaying and broken horns of the elk, the bones and horns of the elk, buffalo, deer, and just beyond these a human skull, with two or three scattered and water-worn skulls of what seemed to be the buffalo; the sands ceased in curved lines, with a small steep descent of about two feet, and was succeeded by mud partly covered here and there with fine sand, probably drifted by wind. The sanded mud was followed by fine compact mud with numerous deep cracks, partially filled with fine sand. Another fall of about three feet occurred in the form of a bank, and recent mud, smooth and treacherous, occupied the remaining portion of the segment a few inches above the present water level. This arrangement of mud sand and gravelly spits was noticed elsewhere, and probably frequently occurs.\n\nSugar made on the Assiniboine.\u2014Grape Vines grow wild.\n\n181. The timber on the banks of the Assiniboine is perhaps not so heavy as on Red River, nevertheless some very fine oak and elm, with white wood and poplar of extraordinary dimensions, were seen near the Prairie Portage. A fair quantity of sugar is made by the Assiniboine half-breeds, but not in comparison with what might be easily obtained, if systematic habits, and a proper appreciation of the fruits of industry, existed here. A species of grape grows in profusion on the banks of this river. I suppose it to be the Frost Grape (*Vites andifolia*). The fruit when first gathered is not very palatable, but after hanging in the open air for forty-eight hours acquires a sweet taste and a very delicious flavour.\n\n---\n\nTHE PRAIRIES\u2014FROM PRAIRIE PORTAGE TO FORT GARRY BY THE TRAIL.\n\nLake Manitoba.\n\n182. The name of Prairie Portage is derived from the existence of a portage, nine miles long, between this part of the Assiniboine and Lake Manitoba. I have heard it stated by half-breeds at the settlement, that at seasons of extraordinary high water the canoes can approach each other from the Assiniboine and Lake Manitoba so as to leave but a very short distance for the portage.\n\nThe Buffalo Hunter's Trail.\u2014Country beyond Prairie Portage.\u2014Country East of Prairie Portage.\u2014The Big Ridge.\u2014Limestone Fragments.\n\n183. The road from the village of Prairie Portage follows a general north-easterly direction for a distance of twenty-nine miles, before it turns south-westerly in the direction of Fort Garry. This deviation is necessary in order to avoid Long Lake, which is an ancient bed of the river, now converted into a narrow, winding lake of great length. About five miles from the portage, the Buffalo Hunter's Trail, leading to the Great Sage Plains, is struck; it passes on to the crossing place in a nearly due west direction. I was informed by the guide that the Hunter's Trail, referred to above, is the only road north of the Assiniboine by which they pass to the high Prairies and Sage Plains. Its course is continued for half a day's journey about ten miles, through good prairie land, similar to that which has been described. Sand hills then begin to show themselves, sustaining large pine and juniper bushes; it requires two days' journey (forty miles) to cross these sandy ridges. A gradual ascent is then made to the Great Plains. The Sand Hills appear to mark the western limit of the truly fertile or alluvial prairie portion of the valley of the Assiniboine. The crossing place is four days' journey (eighty miles) from the Prairie Portage, and one day (twenty miles) from and below the mouth of the Little Towns or Mouse River. On each side of the road, after leaving the Hunter's Trail, is a very magnificent prairie, bounded on the right by the wooded banks of the Assiniboine, and on the left by the horizon; a few scattered clumps of poplar are seen here and there, but no trees, until the \"Big Ridge\" comes in sight. The ridge is probably an ancient beach of Lake Winnipeg; its elevation does not appear to be more than sixty feet above the prairie level. Where the road touches Long Lake, a spur of the Big Ridge is distant about three miles. I made a diversion from the main track for the purpose of examining the character of the ridge. It rose almost imperceptibly from the prairie, and at its base small limestone fragments appeared in numbers. Ascending the ridge, the limestone increased in quantity until near its summit, slabs were numerous. This ridge extends northwards to Lake Winnipeg, and is probably the flank of the table-land, which stretches far to the north and west. The ridge is wooded as far as can be seen, and my guide told me that it continued so until it became the abrupt limestone coast of Lake Winnipeg, at a distance of forty miles, as he supposed, from our camp. At the foot of the ridge, the prairie is dotted with willow bushes and clumps of poplar, affording an extremely beautiful landscape of vast extent.\n\nRemarkable Richness of the White Horse Prairie.\u2014Grasshoppers.\n\n184. Leaving the Big Ridge, and regaining the main road, well marked by the deep ruts formed by the buffalo hunters' carts, we soon arrived at the White Horse Plain, a vast, slightly undulating prairie, without any boundary but the horizon in any direction but the south, where the distant wooded banks of the Assiniboine afford some relief to the eye. The grass is long and rank, and the soil a black mould of great depth, often exceeding eighteen inches. In many places it is thrown up into conical heaps by moles, and uniformly displays the same rich appearance, truly represented by the bountiful profusion of verdure it sustains. This year the edges of the White Horse Plain unfortunately teem with another kind of life. The grasshoppers appeared in countless millions just before my arrival, and every bare patch of ground in the road was filled with their eggs, the living insects leaping through the tall grass in infinite multitudes, yet notwithstanding, failing to change the appearance of the country in the midst of so great a profusion of food. What the next year's brood may do remains to be seen their progenitors had come in swarming clouds from the south side of the Assiniboine, but no one could tell of their origin, or of the devastations they must have created before they took their flight, and alighted on the White Horse Plain.\nFarmhouses on the Assiniboine.\u2014Open and beautiful Prairies.\u2014Prairies near Fort Garry, marshy.\n\n185. The last house of the settlement, westward of White Horse Plain, is about thirty-three miles from Fort Garry, and between it and the Company's post, in charge of Mr. Lane, there are nine houses and farms. The Prairie Portage road, however, does not pass near them; it touches the river only at those bends which do not necessarily compel much deviation from a straight course. The farmhouses are similar to those on Red River, but the soil appears to be, if possible, of a better description. Leaving Mr. Lane's post, the river is touched again at the Roman Catholic Mission of St. Fran\u00e7ois Xavier. The road now follows the general course of the river, in the rear of the farms, which from this point to Fort Garry are not far apart. The whole country north of the river, between Prairie Portage and Sturgeon Creek, consists of level, open, and beautiful prairies, uniformly fertile, and in a great measure free from wet places or marshes; wherever these occur, there does not appear to be the least difficulty in draining them at a very trifling cost of labour and time. From Sturgeon Creek to Fort Garry, the houses and farms resemble, in all respects, those on Red River. The prairie is dotted with islands of poplar and willow bushes, and within two miles of the fort, decidedly marshy in its present condition. Much marsh and wet land is said to exist in the south of the Assiniboine, about the sources of Stinking River.\n\nTHE ROSEAU RIVER.\u2014THE LITTLE AND BIG RAT RIVERS, AND THE COUNTRY UNWATERED BY THEM.\n\nAffluents of Red River within British Territory.\u2014Channel of Rivulets formed.\u2014The Big Swamp.\n\n186. Between its mouth and the forty-ninth parallel, the Red River of the north receives numerous affluents, only two of which are worthy of a separate notice. Near its junction with Lake Winnipeg, Netty Creek, draining a considerable extent of flat country, comes in from the west. This smaller river acquires some degree of importance from the circumstance that it conveys away the excess of water during high floods from the channel of the Red River, so that an extensive area below Mill Creek has never been known to suffer from an overflow. Several small streams which have excavated their channels since the settlement of Red River, are fed by the Big Swamp delineated on the map. Some of these little rivulets, which by the way are dry during summer, have originated from an attempt to drain King's Road by the people of Red River. A small ditch was made in the first instance, about two feet deep; this was cut away during the melting of the snow in the spring, to a depth of ten to twenty feet, forming deep but not wide gullies, in the very friable clay of the prairies. The Big Swamp, which was filled during the flood of 1852, keeps those rivulets alive in the spring and fall.\n\nAffluents of the Assiniboine.\n\n187. On the east side German Creek comes in just below the Roman Catholic Church; it is a very tortuous and sluggish rivulet, draining some swamps to the east of Red River. The Assiniboine is the chief affluent of Red River. This meandering river has a length of perhaps four hundred miles, and receives in its course some navigable and probably very important streams. The Little Souris or Mouse River comes from the Coteau de Missouri, and on its bank is reported by the half-breeds to expose valuable seams of (lignite) coal, an article of priceless worth in this woodless region. The Calling River, Oak River, and Rapid River, affluents of the Assiniboine, all unwater extensive tracts of country, respecting which little is known.\n\nRat River.\n\n188. Above the Assiniboine, La Riviere Sal, or Stinking River, occurs about nine miles from Fort Garry. Much of the country through which it flows is said to be filled with brackish swamp. Thirty-seven miles from Fort Garry and Scratching Creek is crossed on the route to Pembina. Here a river is seen winding for miles through a boundless prairie, without a tree or shrub on its banks. On the eastern side, about \u2014\u2014 miles from Fort Garry, Rat River, in lat. 49\u00b0 35' 10\", joins its waters to Red River, and ten miles north of the forty-ninth parallel the Roseau River, an important stream, comes in from the region west of the Lake of the Woods. The Roseau River, and the country it drains, deserve a special notice.\n\nTHE ROSEAU OR REED GRASS RIVER.\n\nCourse of Roseau River.\u2014The Long Ridge.\u2014Interesting Character of the Ridge.\n\n189. The general course of this stream, from its confluence with Red River to Roseau Lake, is a few degrees to the south of east. It enters Reed River about ten miles north of the forty-ninth parallel, and it is probable that Roseau Lake is on the boundary line between Rupert's Land and Territory of Minnesota. The course of the Roseau is very tortuous, and for the first twenty miles it meanders through a beautiful prairie, with a belt of heavy forest trees on its banks. Near the mouth of the river, on the south side, there is a considerable quantity of low land, but above that point the banks vary from fifteen to twenty feet in height until at the crossing place the long ridge is reached. Here the banks are from fifty to fifty-five feet above the level of the river. Near the crossing place the ridge has probably an elevation exceeding sixty feet above the level of Red River. It and its offsets form a very singular and most interesting feature in the topography of the whole valley, and will be more fully noticed in the proper place.\n\nTimber of the Roseau beyond the Ridges.\n\n190. The ridge once past the whole face of the country changes. The soil becomes poor and sandy, although still preserving a prairie or plain character. The timber on the banks of the river fast dwindles to small-sized oak, elm, birch, and poplar, until it gives place, about forty-six miles from the mouth and perhaps seventy or eighty by the winding of the stream, to extensive marshes in which islands of small pine are to be seen.\n\n\u2022 Keating (Major Long's Expedition).\nMarshes of Roseau River.\n\n191. At the commencement of these marshes the Roseau River moves sluggishly, and its stream soon becomes dead water, with a vast expanse of flooded land on either side, extending, according to our guide, fifty miles to the right hand and to the left.\n\nCountry of the Roseau beyond the Beginning of the Marshes.\n\n192. Having found it impossible to proceed further on horseback than the beginning of the great marshy tract of the Roseau, and not being provided with a canoe, the following description of the country rests upon the authority of the guide who accompanied us, and who had resided at Roseau Lake for a year and a half when in the service of the Honourable Hudson Bay Company. The river channel can be traced through a marsh ten miles long, nearly on a level with the water in the river. The depth of the marsh does not exceed three feet, and it is quite possible to wade on horseback through it. The Honourable Hudson Bay Company's route to their post on Roseau Lake (in 1851) retired from the river when the waters ceased to flow, and pursued a direction some miles to the south of the channel, probably within the United States' territory. In 1847, a very dry season, it was possible to proceed with carts in a direct line near the banks of the river, from the beginning of the marsh to the post, one mile and a half from Roseau Lake.\n\nWater Fowl on Roseau Lake.\u2014Altitude of Roseau Lake.\u2014Roseau Lake to the Lake of the Woods.\n\n193. An idea of the character of the country about this post may be inferred from the guide's description of his attempts to destroy the monotony of his life when stationed at Roseau Lake. He informed me that when he wished \"to see anything\" beyond the four walls of his log shanty, and the rushes by which it was surrounded, he was in the habit of mounting to the roof, and from the top of the mud chimney enjoying the view, which consisted of reeds to the north, reeds to the south, and reeds to the west, as far as the eye could reach; and to the east Roseau Lake, fifteen miles long by ten broad, with a deep fringe of reeds. On the bosom of this retired sheet of water, in the spring and the fall, he was enabled to watch countless millions of ducks and geese, and the noise of their shrill cries, with the flapping of wings as they would rise to take their morning flight to the north or south, according to the season of the year, were almost the only sounds he heard, saving the sighing of the winds through the reeds, during his dreary abode in the waste of Roseau Lake. The altitude of Roseau Lake above Lake Winnipeg probably does not exceed 150 feet; and as the elevation of the Lake of the Woods is at least 370 feet above the same level, there must still be a rise of 220 feet to be overcome before reaching the height of land. Our guide described the Roseau River, before it enters Roseau Lake, as stretching far to the south in the territories of the United States. He also said that issuing from the Great Muskeg, or swamp, occupying so much of the height of land between Red River and the Lake of the Woods, was a narrow rapid stream of fifty miles long and emptying into Roseau Lake, thus forming a route by means of which the smallest-sized canoes may pass from Roseau Lake through the Great Muskeg to the Lake of the Woods.\n\nIndian from the Lake of the Woods.\u2014Ten Days on the Road.\u2014Breadth of the Muskeg at the Height of Land.\n\n194. At noon on the 26th September, when discussing with the guide the possibility of proceeding further up the banks of the Roseau River on horseback, we heard the sound of a gun, proceeding apparently from the river. Having fired one in return, we were not surprised some time afterwards to see an Indian approach. He had just arrived with his family from the Lake of the Woods by the route proposed to be taken by Mr. Dawson and myself some weeks before. He described the route in the same way as the guide, and in no material respect differing from the accounts we had before received from other Lac la Pluie Indians, who had been engaged to convey us through it, before the intervention of the tribe, narrated in my report from Islington Mission. He had been ten days on the road, but might have accomplished the journey thus far in shorter time, had he not required to hunt by the way for his family, who accompanied him. At my request he drew up a map of the route, which was in almost all particulars similar to that sent in my report from Fort Francis. He ascended a small river, marked on the map Reed River, from the Lake of the Woods, for a distance of thirty miles to the Great Muskeg at the height of land. He was two days dragging his canoe through the Muskeg which is here nine miles broad. He then descended the rapid stream, forty or fifty miles long, before noticed, which is called by the Indians Muskeg River, and found himself among the rushes or reeds of Roseau Lake.\n\nDry Prairie north of the Crossing Place in the Roseau.\u2014Still Water Creek.\u2014Rat River.\u2014Country between Rat River and the Lake of the Woods.\u2014Little Rat River.\u2014Nine Mile Swamp.\u2014Nine Mile Swamp easily drained.\u2014French Settlement.\n\n195. Returning nearly in our steps to the crossing place, we went over to the right bank of the Roseau, and after threading through a forest of fine oaks about one quarter of a mile deep, found ourselves emerging upon an open dry prairie, bounded on the east by the low wooded ridge before noticed as occurring, on the south side of the river. The distant belt of woods fringing Red River might just be seen in the far western horizon, the whole intervening space being a rich and level prairie, without shrubs or willows. Six miles from the Roseau, Still Water Creek occurs. Its waters are deep, and, as its name implies, sluggish or almost stagnating. Between Still Water Creek and Rat River some marshy spots occur, while on the right the ridge, wooded with aspen, continues in the direction of the rapids of Red River, near which spot it is found within four miles of the banks of the main stream. Rat River is an insignificant brook, coming from the Great Muskeg, which occupies the height of land to the east of the valley of Red River. At the crossing place it is fifteen feet broad. It sometimes serves the Indians as a means of communication between the Lake of the Woods and Red River by the following steps: 1st, Rat River east, flowing from the Muskeg at the height of land into the Lake of the Woods. 2. The Great Muskeg, through which the small canoes are\ndragged. 3. A small river flowing into swamps, from which, 4th, Big and Little Rat River issue, which unite below the crossing places on the road to the settlements, as shown in the chart. Four miles from Big Rat River, Little Rat River was crossed, and the tract then led to the point of junction of the two streams, until it came upon a ridge, which is followed for a distance of ten miles, after which the great Nine Mile Swamp occurs, where water lodges in marshy intervals, for the distance which has given its name to this wet prairie. A strong Scotch plough, drawn by a stout team of oxen, would soon effect the drainage of the Nine Mile Swamp. It partly originates from the excessive luxuriosness of the grasses growing upon this level expanse, which, in a humid season, holds up sufficient water to give permanency to the wetness of this portion of the prairie.* Hay in considerable abundance, as exemplified by the stacks which were seen in all directions, is made in the dry intervals of the Nine Mile Swamp. This French settlement commences immediately on the northern extremity of this characteristic illustration of Red River enterprise and energy, as applied to the improvement of the country. A very little well-directed labour would convert these extensive marshy areas into the richest pasture and hay privileges, and drive to more congenial haunts the myriads of snipe and plover we disturbed in our passage through it.\n\nPART III.\n\nGEOLOGICAL SKETCH OF THE CANOE ROUTE FROM FORT WILLIAM, LAKE SUPERIOR, TO THE MOUTH OF RED RIVER, LAKE WINIPEG, AND OF THE VALLEY OF RED RIVER, NORTH OF THE FORTY-NINTH PARALLEL.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nThe Kaministiquia to the height of land.\u2014Mr. Murray, Limestone, on the valley of the Kaministiquia; the country above the Kakabeka Falls belongs to the Laurentian groups; Huronian rocks east of Kakabeka Falls; First exposure of argillaceous schists, granite, and syenite ranges about Dog Lake; Valley of Dog River, 196.\n\nThe height of land to Rainy Lake.\u2014Portage du Baril; Dip and strike; French portage; Mica schist on gneiss; Granite overflows at the head of Dor\u00e9 Lake; Granite hills near Sturgeon Lake; Dip and strike at the fifth rapid; Small anticlinal axis in Pine Lake; Dip of schists; Probable exposure of chloritic slate; Tilted schists at the grand falls of the Nameanuck schists dipping in Curves joints, with quartz and felspathic veins; Rock dotted with beautiful specimens of, 197.\n\nRainy Lake to Rat River.\u2014Lake of the Woods.\u2014Dr. Bigsby, on the geography of Rainy Lake; his observations of Rainy Lake, 198.\n\nRainy River.\u2014D\u00e9bris of silurian limestone in the valley of Rainy River, 199\u2014Hornblendic schists at the rapid; The Lake of the Woods; Dr. Bigsby\u2019s paper on, 200\u2014Polished surface of greenstone; Conglomerate with glacial furrows; Direction of the axis of the enclosed pebbles; Vertical section, 201.\n\nThe Winnipeg River to Red River.\u2014Large areas of intrusive granite on the Upper Winnipeg; The country characterized by great fertility, 202\u2014Mica schists, 203\u2014Granite hills; Conglomerate gneiss, 203\u2014Striped rock, 204\u2014Gneiss, 205\u2014Dykes, 205\u2014Bonnet Lake, needle refuses to act; Cliffs of clay\u2014Mica schist and gneiss, 205\u2014Laurentian group prevails from the height of land to Lake Winnipeg.\n\nLimestone.\u2014First exposure, 206\u2014Limestone; fit for building purposes, 206\u2014Second exposure; Rock highly magnetan, 207\u2014Stony mountain, and quantity of Limestone for building purposes at Stony Mountain, 207.\n\nDrift and Clays.\u2014The Great Dog Portage; Areas of drift; Drift; Clay in Rainy River; Drift in the valley of Red and Assiniaboine rivers; Patches reported to be fit for bricks and pottery, 208.\n\nThe ancient Beaches and Ridges of Lake Winnipeg.\u2014Main beach sixty-seven feet above the prairie; Stony Mountain; Ridge at the Roseau forms a beautiful road for 100 miles; Marks the limit of the good land; The Coteau de Missourii; Pembina Mountain 210 feet high; The ancient beaches of Lake Winnipeg limit the area of good land; far the greater part of the good land is within the limits of British America; Small ridges; Diameter of the small ridges, 209.\n\nCoal (Lignite).\u2014Stated to exist on the Assiniboine and on the Little Souris or Mouse River; the coal tried at the settlement and found useful, 210\u2014Position of the coal or lignite beds; Presence of bands of Sioux Indians on the trail of the buffalo hunters prevented an exploration of the Upper Assiniboine, 211\u2014Small fragments of lignite in the mud and drift of the Assiniboine; Specimens of lignite, common in the settlements, anxiety of the settlers to know the nature and extent of the lignite formation, 212\u2014Necessity of a supply of fuel for increasing settlements, 212.\n\nSalt.\u2014Brine Springs of Manitoba; Salt now made and sells at 10s. a bushel; supply stated to be unlimited, 213.\n\nTHE KAMINISTQUIA TO THE HEIGHT OF LAND.\n\nMr. Murray on the Valley of the Kaministiquia.\n\n196. The valley of the Kaministiquia, with its extension through Dog Lake and River to the height of land, was examined by Mr. Murray, Assistant Provincial Geologist, in 1846. The results of that survey are to be found in his report, addressed to Sir William Logan, and printed in the Report of Progress in the Geological Survey of Canada for 1846-47. The following brief notice of the character and distribution of the rocks of the country drained by the Kaministiquia is in part abbreviated from Mr. Murray\u2019s report.\n\nCountry above the Kakabeka Falls belongs to Laurentian Group.\u2014Huronian Rocks east of Kakabeka Falls.\u2014First Exposure of Argillaceous Slates.\u2014Granite and Syenite Ranges about Dog Lake.\u2014Valley of Dog River.\n\nThe whole of the interior of the country above the Kakabeka or Grand Falls to the height of land belongs to the Laurentian series of rocks, including granite, syenite, gneiss, and the lower slates (micaceous and chloritic schists), and a line drawn from the falls at Thunder Bay would mark nearly the junction of the Upper or Huronian slates, which rest upon them. The upper or black argillaceous slates occur in magnificent mural precipices at the Grand Falls. Sketch No. 6 shows a fine exposure on the right bank of the river. The talus from which the view was taken is composed of thin sheets of hard slate, held together by the roots of grasses and wild mint, and afforded at the best but a very insecure footing. The rock supporting this talus shows many of the spheroidal concretions charged with iron pyrites noticed by Mr. Murray in his report. The first exposure of the black argillaceous slates was seen about five miles from Pointe des Meurons, or fifteen miles from the mouth of the river. A large exposure with a S.S.W. strike occurs at the D\u00e9charge des Paresseux and the junction with the gneiss upon which the formation reposes was seen at the foot of the Portage d\u2019\u00c9cart\u00e9, three-quarters of a mile above the Grand Falls and close to\n\n* See introductory chapter for a probable explanation of the origin of many of the \u201cswamps\u201d in the Red River Valley.\nthe spot indicated by Mr. Murray:\u2014\u201cThe high land around Dog Lake is chiefly granite or syenite, \u201cand the islands on the western side are the same, with mica slate resting on it occasionally.\u201d On \u201cthe west coast, several promontories jet out with deep bays between them. Each point in succession \u201cappears to be the arch of an anticlinal axis bringing up the syenite in the middle, while mica \u201cschist dipping in opposite directions rests upon it.\u201d The valley of Dog River is bounded by low granite ridges as shown on the map, while the height of land, though not exhibiting an exposure of rock in situ on the portage path, probably consists of granitic and syenitic ranges, as described by Dr. D. D. Owen.\n\nTHE HEIGHT OF LAND TO RAINY LAKE.\n\nPortage du Baril, Dip and Strike.\u2014French Portage.\u2014Mica Slate in Gneiss.\u2014Granite Overflow at the head of Dor\u00e9 Lake.\u2014Granite Hills near Sturgeon Lake.\u2014Dip and Strike at the Fifth Rapids.\u2014Small anticlinal Axis in Pine Lake.\u2014Dip of Schist.\u2014Probable persistent Exposures of Chloritic Slate.\u2014Tilted Schist at the Grand Falls of the Nameaukan.\u2014Schist dipping in Curves.\u2014Joints and Quartz and Felspathic Veins.\u2014Rock dotted with beautiful Specimens of Plumose Mica.\n\n197. In Mille Lacs exposures of what was supposed to be white glistening quartz are numerous; they are called by the voyageurs sail rocks. Dome-shaped hills receding from the shores, and having an altitude of about 160 feet, were visible on the south-east side of the lake in making the traverses. At the Portage du Baril, the dip was nearly vertical and strike at N. 70\u00b0 E. At French Portage micaceous schist was seen resting on gneiss, at an angle but slightly inclined from the vertical. The strike was N.E. by E. At the head of Dor\u00e9 Lake, the granite seems to have overflowed the mica schist. The thin edges of the overflow are seen resting on the shore, and beneath the water its undulating boundary can be traced for some distance. On an island in Pickerel Lake, the strata were much twisted and curved, and consisted of mica schist with bands of gneiss, intersected with numerous quartz and felspathic veins. Dip 20\u00b0 N. from vertical strike N.E. by E. At Pickerel Portage boulders begin to be numerous, and are also abundant at Dor\u00e9 Lake. On Sturgeon Lake low granite hills form numerous jutting points or promontories. Near a small expansion of Sturgeon River, above the Second Falls, mica schist, well stratified, is exposed, with a strike N. 60\u00b0 E. and dip 7\u00b0 S. from vertical. The micaceous portion of the rock is separated by divisional planes (quartz) of about one-eighth to half an inch in diameter, and by the weathering of the micaceous portion, these project in the form of abrupt ridges, traceable for many yards, and preserving a remarkable parallelism. At the fifth rapids of this river, the strike is N. 65\u00b0 E., dip 15\u00b0 S. E. from the vert., and about three-quarters of a mile further on the strike was found to be N. 30\u00b0 W., at an angle of 45\u00b0. At the Portage de l\u2019Ile, at the Sixth Falls, the dip is N., at an angle of about 40\u00b0; the rock is a highly stratified micaceous schist, passing into a hornblender schist. Below Portage de l\u2019Ile, the river expands into a lake about three-quarters of a mile broad, and of the same length, with a deep bay to the N.E., and one corresponding, to the S.E. Two islands in Pine Lake, below Portage de l\u2019Ile, appeared to show small anticlinal axis. The schists were seen to repose at a low angle (N. 60\u00b0 W.) on a reddish coloured, unstratified rock below; but no specimen was obtained. It was cracked into huge blocks. On the main land, N.W. of the two islands, the schists were seen to dip N. 60\u00b0 N. at an angle of about 30\u00b0. About five miles below Portage de l\u2019Ile, fragments of chloritic schist occur on the beach; not water worn, or showing abrasion. A few hundred yards further on, a stratified rock cups out in very persistent layers; some of them extended several feet from the cliff, with a varying thickness of from two to six inches. The dip was about 20\u00b0 N., and it may have been an exposure of the chloritic schists, whose fragments were found above it. Not being able to approach, on account of the swift current sweeping the base of the cliff, where the exposure occurred, no specimens were procured. At Snake Falls, the river passes over a schist highly inclined to the N.E., and below them, many fine exposures of the same schist occur on the islands, frequently projecting like the end of boards of unequal lengths leaning against one another, and varying in thickness from two to five inches. Three miles below Snake Falls, the rock passes into gneiss, and numerous veins and dykes of granite are seen to penetrate it nearly at right angles to the strike; the dip is here N.W. Ten miles below Snake Falls mica schist again comes into view, unstratified with quartz, and felspar layers from one to two inches thick. The strike is E. 5\u00b0 N., and the dip nearly vertical. At the Grand Falls of the Nameaukan, the schists are tilted by steps in the form of the segment of a circle. In Lac Nameaukan, dome-shaped granitic islands parallel to one another, and of oval form, present themselves not far from the entrance of Lac la Croix. The direction of the longest axis is N. 60\u00b0 W. A line prolonged through the Granite Islands, in a N.W. direction, touches the schist about three hundred yards further on. Their apparent dip, as seen from the lake was N.W., at an angle of about 45\u00b0. One island, wholly composed of schist, inclined at a high angle, is followed at a distance of about 50 yards by a long flat gneissoid dome. About 600 yards from the island, the schists dip lightly to the S.E. On the north side, the dip could not be seen; but on the west side they were seen to bend round in a curved form, and from a N.W. dip towards the S. E. On the next island, the gneiss was intersected by numerous joints, having a direction N. 70 E., and of quartz, and felspathic veins, N. 25\u00b0 W., or nearly perpendicular to the former. Its surface towards the N.W. by W. was smooth, and inclined at an angle of about 10\u00b0. The rock of the new portage is a granite containing mica in plates, and everywhere dotted with numerous beautiful specimens of plumose mica.\n\nRAINY LAKE TO RAT PORTAGE, LAKE OF THE WOODS.\n\nDr. Bigsby on the Geology of Rainy Lake.\u2014The Division of Rainy Lake.\n\n198. In an article on the Geology of Rainy Lake, South Hudson\u2019s Bay, by Dr. J. J. Bigsby,* the geological conditions of this remote body of water are thus summed up: \u201cChloritic and greenstone\n\n* On the Geology of Rainy Lake, South Hudson\u2019s Bay, by Dr. J. J. Bigsby, F.G.S., &c. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, 1854.\nslates, gneiss and mica slate in proportional quantities, in the order here set down, seem once to have occupied the lake basin, with an E.N.E. strike and a N.N.W. dip, at a high angle usually; but subsequently, a very extensive outburst of granite with some syenite has taken place, to the great disturbance of the stratified rocks, and penetrating them both in intercalations and crosswise; these intrusive rocks occupy a very large portion of the lake.\" Dr. Bigsby, who accompanied the surveyors of the Canadian Boundary Commission in 1826, had excellent opportunities of forming a correct acquaintance with the geology of Rainy Lake. He divides its region, for convenience of description and reference, into six distinct parts, each having its own geological characteristic. The west shore of the lake is mainly occupied by granite, which at the northern portion is finely granular and porphyritic in equal quantities. On the east coast of the north-westerly extension of Rainy Lake are chloritic and greenstone slates; on the eastern arm of Rainy Lake pale red granite is the prevailing rock, and near the northern extremity of this arm naked ridges, white as porcelain, and 500 feet high, occur.\n\nRAINY RIVER.\n\nD\u00e9bris of Silurian Limestone in the Valley of Rainy River.\u2014Hornblendic Schist.\n\n199. Dr. Bigsby says, \"At the commencement of Rainy River, on both banks, and for two miles of the south shore of the lake, there is a large quantity of untravelled d\u00e9bris of an upper silurian limestone, which is always sharp edged and slaty, and now and then is planted into the earth in such great square masses, that I am constrained to consider it living rock split into fragments by the intense cold of these regions, containing the same fossils as the limestone of the Lake of the Woods; I believe it to be of the same age; it is browner and coarser in texture. There is not much doubt but that it underlies most of the bed of the Rainy River, and is continued into the plains about the Red River Settlement.\" Throughout the valley of the Rainy River no rock exposures were seen, with the exception of two ranges of hornblendic schist, which cross the river at the Manitou and Grand Rapids, causing those deviations from the overflow of Rainy River. A few hundred yards up one of the rivers on the United States side, fine exposures of a very compact schist occur, which, from their supposed similarity to limestone, have led the voyageurs to call the affluent on which it is found \"Limestone Creek.\"\n\nThe Lake of the Woods: Dr. Bigsby's Paper on.\n\n200. The canoe route through the Lake of the Woods affords scarcely any opportunity of procuring specimens of the rock formations which are characteristic of this beautiful, and, in some respects, promising region. Dr. Bigsby's paper and map, published in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, supplies much valuable information.\n\nPolished Surface of Greenstone Conglomerate, with Glacial Furrows.\u2014Directions of the Axis of the enclosed Pebble.\u2014Vertical Sections.\n\n201. On a small island, about twenty-five miles north of Garden Island, a remarkable exposure of \"greenstone conglomerate\" was seen, nearly at a level with the water of the lake. The surface of the rock was nearly horizontal, beautifully polished, and strongly marked with ice (glacial) furrows and scratches. The directions of the furrows was N. 25\u00b0 E., they were all parallel to one and another, some of them half an inch in depth, and nearly double that measure in width. They continued to pursue a uniform direction for many yards until concealed by the bushes which fringed the bare rock some forty or fifty feet from the water's edge. The conglomerate presented the appearance of an immense table of mosaic work. The pebbles and small boulders enclosed in the matrix were often water worn, some of them, however, showed no lateral abrasion, preserving their angle sharp and well defined. They were all ground down to one uniform polished surface. The direction of the largest axis was N. 64\u00b0 E. and S. 64\u00b0 W. The imbedded boulders and pebbles vary from half an inch to eighteen inches in diameter, and appeared generally to lie with their flatted side facing the south-west. The colour of the matrix was a pale green, and of the embedded pebbles grey with a tint of green. A vertical section of the rock exhibited the pebbles and boulders as if resting upon the extremity of the longest axis with a slight inclination to the east. Sketch No. 13 shows the appearance of this conglomerate with the glacial grooves.\n\nTHE WINIPEG TO RED RIVER.\n\nLarge Area of intrusive Granite in the Upper Winnipeg.\u2014The Country characterized by great Sterility.\n\n202. The country between the sources of the Winnipeg and a few miles south of Islington Mission, a distance of nearly thirty miles, appears to be largely occupied by a vast range of intrusive granite and syenite, in the form of dome-shaped hills, varying from 150 to 200 feet high. A view from the summit of one of the highest of these, about fifteen miles due north from Rat Portage, offered an unvarying appearance of their rounded summits as far as the eye could reach in a westerly direction. The canoe route we pursued was a short Indian path from Rat Portage to the Great Winnipeg, in a nearly straight north-westerly direction. The country traversed was characterized by great sterility, and an unusual proportion of bare rock. High precipitous mural cliffs, without a trace of stratification observable in them, often formed the boundaries of this branch of the Great Winnipeg.\n\nMica Schists show themselves.\u2014Granite Hills.\u2014Conglomerate.\u2014Gneiss.\n\n203. Near De l'Isle Rapids indications of mica schist were apparent, and below the portage the rock was much twisted and involved, and intersected with numerous granite veins. Further stratification was occasionally seen, the inclination being at a low angle, towards the N.E. At James Falls is a very hard, dark green coloured rock, without any distinct stratification. It is traversed by numerous broad granite veins, and also intersected by dunal planes. Abrupt hills of granite appear on the opposite side of the river, and on an island just above the falls a beautiful section of conglomerate\nforms the precipitous river bank. In it are seen huge masses of this dark green rock before noticed. Two miles below the falls gneiss is exposed, with a nearly E. and W. strike and a dip of about 40\u00b0 N.\n\n**Striped Rock.**\n\n204. At the Portage du Bois the gneiss passes into a hornblende schist, traversed by numerous quartz veins. The whole is very much twisted and intersected by large and small granite dykes running in a different direction to the quartz veins, but so curved and meandering as not to appear to have a general direction at the spot where the observation was made, the rock in some places might well receive the name of a \"striped rock.\" The general direction of the strike was due west, the dip nearly vertical, and about 5 to 10\u00b0 N. The Falls of Portage du Bois are singularly beautiful; the river is very broad, not less than 500 yards, and its current is broken by three small wooded islands, between which the water rushes before it makes its final leap.\n\n**Gneiss.\u2014Dykes.\u2014Bonnet Lake.\u2014Needle refuses to act.\u2014Cliffs of Clay.\u2014Mica Schist and Gneiss.**\n\n\u2014Laurentian Group prevails from the Height of Land to Lake Winnipeg.\n\n205. Near the mouth of the Pennawa the gneiss is finely stratified, although much twisted in places. The strike is N. 55\u00b0 E.; the dip at a high angle east. Numerous felspathic and granite dykes and veins intersect the rock, the first-named are often six inches broad, running N. 5\u00b0 E.; the second pursue various directions, but are most numerous in a direction 10\u00b0 east of the felspathic. Ten miles down the Pennawa, the strike is N. 75\u00b0 E., and dip S. 25\u00b0, E. 10\u00b0 from the vertical. The rock is gneiss, beautifully stratified. A short distance from the mouth of the Pennawa, the river glides over a smooth exposure, having an inclination of about 30\u00b0 in the plane of stratification, and strike E. 45\u00b0 S. A lake about six miles long forms the termination of the Pennawa, and is connected with Bonnet Lake by a narrow passage between high and rugged rock exposures, which form the termination of a range of dome-shaped hills, of which sketch No. 12 affords a rough outline. The island is gneiss, with distinct micaceous layers; the strike W. 10\u00b0 S., and the direction of the range is about north and south, curving slightly to the south-east. The summits of the hill range are bare, and appear to be polished or smooth on the eastern exposures. Unworn greenstone fragments and boulders are numerous on the S.W. shore of the island. The dip seen on the main land was at an angle of nearly 45\u00b0, half a mile from the island before noticed. Mica schist is seen reposing on the gneiss, apparently conformable. The needle here refused to act; and on passing close to a high exposure of the schist, it vibrated between 50\u00b0 W. to 50\u00b0 E. of north, as roughly estimated by the sun. The schist was seen dipping south at a higher angle than the gneiss. Low cliffs of clay begin to come upon the river soon after passing the first falls below Bonnet Lake, and conceal the rocks below. At the first falls below the Bonnet a highly micaceous gneiss shows a strike E. 25\u00b0 N., dip about 40\u00b0, but variable numerous flexures being visible. Patches of mica schist come through the gneiss, which is intersected by large coarse veins and dykes of granite. Between this point and Fort Alexander exposures occur at the different falls and rapids, showing rocks which apparently belong to the same group as those which have been already described, but favourable opportunities of procuring specimens, or of ascertaining their precise character did not occur. All rock exposures alluded to in the foregoing sketch, with the possible exception of the Valley of Rainy River, may be classed with the members of the Laurentian group.\n\n---\n\n**LIMESTONE.**\n\nFirst Exposure.\u2014Limestone fit for Building Purposes.\n\n206. The first exposure of Limestone of silurian age was seen just below the Stone Fort, Red River. It here crops out in massive layers, as shown in section No. 3, the colour of its weathered surface is a pale yellowish grey, and of fresh surfaces, a grey more inclined to white; it is hard, but its fresh fractures are not clean. It makes a good building material, and is extensively used for that purpose. The lower or Stone Fort is constructed from the bed, which crops out on the river bank beneath it. The rock is highly fossiliferous; specimens of its fossils have been sent to Sir William Logan, who has kindly consented to examine them.\n\nSecond Exposure.\u2014Rock highly magnesian.\u2014Stony Mountain.\u2014Any quantity of Limestone for Building Purposes at Stony Mountain.\n\n207. The second exposure was seen about two miles below the Grand Rapids (Section No. 4). In both instances the surface was irregularly inclined, and so nearly horizontal that it was found impossible to ascertain the dip. The most general inclination appeared to be very slightly towards the south-west by west, but other exposures, not far removed, showed it was thought a perceptible inclination in the opposite direction. Wherever seen on the Red River the rock is highly magnesian, and often contains small imbedded masses which appear to hold magnesia in greater proportion than lime. About nine miles west of the Middle Church, Red River Settlement, at a place locally designated Stony Mountain, cliffs of limestone show a bold front facing the west, with an altitude of about sixty feet above the prairie. Section No. 7 shows a rough approximation of these cliffs. It will be seen that the ancient lake beach, shown in the section, has an altitude which may probably correspond with the old lake ridge on the opposite side of the river, ascertained by measurement to have an altitude of sixty-seven feet above the prairie. The layers of rock are nearly horizontal, very massive, and building materials to any extent are here easily accessible.\n\n---\n\n**DRIFT AND CLAYS.**\n\nThe Great Dog Portage.\u2014Areas of Drift.\u2014Drift Clay over the Valley of Red River.\u2014Bricks and Pottery.\n\n208. The Great Dog Portage has already been described as formed, in part, of an immense bed of sand reposing upon clay. A section (No. 1.) of this singular and interesting barrier, which accompanies\nthe topographical description of the country, shows the relation of the sand clay to one another, and to the rock upon which they rest. Small areas of drift occur at the different portages, and also on the islands on Mille Lacs, but in no instance, until we arrived at Rainy River, were they seen of sufficient extent as to warrant especial notice. In Rainy River buff-coloured clay, unstratified and sustaining stratified clay, was seen repeatedly. In it were numerous limestone boulders, some of which were not destitute of fossils. On the Winnipeg areas of drift begin at the Islington Mission, and continue to increase in dimensions, though far apart from one another, until we arrive at the Manitou Rapids, where a drift clay covers the country on the banks of the river. In the Valley of the Red River and the Assiniboine the unstratified clay, with boulders from Laurentian rocks and limestone, rises from the water's edge to within four feet of the surface, after which its colour changes, shows stratification, and is evidently lacustrine and alluvial. The unstratified clay of these river valleys contains a more than usually large percentage of magnesia. The alluvial portion is reported to be well fitted for the manufacture of brick and common pottery, in patches, but these I did not see.\n\n---\n\nTHE ANCIENT BEACHES AND RIDGES OF LAKE WINNIPEG.\n\nMean Beach sixty-seven feet and a half above the Prairie.\u2014Stony Mountain.\u2014Ridge at the Roseau.\n\n\u2014Forms a beautiful Road for 100 miles.\u2014Marks the Limit of good Land east of Red River.\u2014The Big Ridge on the Assiniboine marks the Limit of good Land.\u2014The Coteau du Missouri.\u2014Pembina Mountain 210 feet high.\u2014The ancient Beaches and Valleys of Lake Winnipeg limit the Area of good Land; by far the greater Portion of good Land lies within the Limits of British Territory.\u2014Small Ridges.\u2014Diameter of the small Ridges.\n\n209. These will be best understood by an inspection of the map. They evidently may be divided into several groups; but the opportunities of unravelling their relations were extended over too short a time to admit of general conclusions being drawn. The most prominent ridge, and in fact the one which limits the fertile portion of Red River and the Assiniboine, as far as seen on the north and east sides, approaches Red River within four miles of the middle settlement, and was there found to be sixty-seven feet and a half above the prairie level; on the opposite side of the river Stony Mountain corresponds perhaps in altitude with this ridge. Three or four miles west of Stony Mountain the Big Ridge of the Assiniboine is seen sweeping round from the north towards the west, in the direction of the valley of that river; it probably forms the northern limit of the fertile prairies of the Assiniboine. On the east side of Red River, the ridge before noticed can be traced from the middle settlement to the Roseau, which it crosses about forty-six miles from the mouth of that stream; at the crossing place on the Roseau, its height was estimated to be the same as at the middle settlement; it forms a beautiful dry gravel road wherever traversed, and suffers only from the drawback of being the favourite haunt of numerous badgers, whose holes on the flank, and also sometimes on the summit, are dangerous to horses; it is perfectly level for a hundred miles, and everywhere, as far as my observation enabled me to judge, shows the same even rounded summit; it may yet form an admirable means of communication through the country; it marks the limit of the good land on the east of Red River. The Big Ridge of the Assiniboine is apparently a counterpart, on the west side of Red River and north of the Assiniboine, of the one just described, and probably it was produced at the same epoch and by the same agent. It forms the flank of a Rateau, which was stated by my guide to extend north to the shores of Lake Winnipeg. Between this ridge and the Assiniboine the land is eminently rich and fertile; beyond the ridge north, it is described by the half-breeds as wooded, sandy, and poor. About half a day's journey west of Prairie Portage, the Big Ridge was said to close upon the Assiniboine, and give place to sand hills clothed with pine, which form the east flank of the high prairies beyond. On the south bank of the Assiniboine, and crossing the Pembina River and forty-ninth parallel, within a day's journey of Pembina, the north-eastern flank of the Coteau de Missouri limits the valley in that direction, and is known by the name of Pembina Mountain, and still further west, by the designation of Turtle Mountain. Dr. Owen measured the altitude of Pembina Mountain, and found it to be 210 feet above the plain: it is, says Dr. Owen, a terrace of table-land, the ancient shore of a great body of water that once filled the whole of Red River Valley. On its summit it is quite level, and extends so for about five miles westward to another terrace, the summit of which is supposed to be level with the great buffalo plains that stretch away towards the Missouri. Pembina Mountain is composed of incoherent sand, gravel, and shingle. We could see this great boundary of Red River Valley to the south-west looming in the horizon during both journeys from Fort Garry to Pembina. The ancient beaches and ridges of Lake Winnipeg acquire great interest from the fact that as far as my observation extended, and in exact accordance with all information derived from the natives, they form the limits of the good land in the Valley of Red River and the Assiniboine, and by far the greater part of this land lies within the British territory or north of the forty-ninth parallel. South of that national boundary the ridges begin to close upon Red River, and contract its valley, a physical confirmation which would be at once deduced from an inspection of the map of Minnesota, showing the position of the Coteau de Missouri. Striking off from the main ridge on the east side of the Red River, numerous smaller ridges pass into the prairies, and sometimes appear to die away; occasionally they intersect one another at different altitudes. Near Rat River, three of these ridges occur which have a difference in elevation of three, five, and ten feet above the level prairies; they run into one another, and are not traceable on both sides of the highest. In form they are similar to the main ridge, and also composed of gravel; they likewise abound in badger holes; their diameter varied from eighty to 100 feet. In every instance they formed excellent level and dry roads. Their position is shown on the large map.\nCOAL (LIGNITE).\n\n210. Many of the half-breeds with whom I conversed at Pemrie Portage stated that they had seen coal in the Assiniboine, below the mouth of the Little Souris River, or Mouse River and on the Little Souris or Mouse River itself. Mr. John Spence, of Prairie Portage, drew a small chart, No. \u2014, for me, showing the position of what he called \u201ccoal\u201d on the Assiniboine. I saw and conversed with a half-breed who had brought \u201ca few bushels\u201d of this coal to the settlement, for the purpose of ascertaining its fitness for the forge; he stated that he was a blacksmith, and had used the coal, and found it answer, but it required a strong draft; I procured from another half-breed several specimens, which accompany this report, and are designated \u201cLignite from the Little Souris, Assiniboine Valley.\u201d On this tributary of the Assiniboine, the lignite was described as crossing out in bands exceeding a foot in thickness, and occupying a large area on the Little Souris.\n\nPosition of the Coal on Lignite Beds.\u2014Presence of Bands of Sioux on the Trail of the Buffalo Hunters prevented an Exploration of the Assiniboine, with a view to ascertain the Truth of the Statements about \u201cCoal.\u201d\u2014Small Fragments of Lignite in the Drift or Mud of the Assiniboine.\n\n211. The distance of the crossing place of the Souris, where the buffalo hunters\u2019 trail passes on to the high prairies, about the Coteau de Missouri, was represented to be three days journey by land, with a winding navigable river communication to and far beyond the crossing place, where the bands of \u201ccoal\u201d are said to be exposed. I endeavoured to induce John Spence to go with me, and point out the locality where the lignite dropped out in the Assiniboine; he expressed perfect willingness to do so, if I could procure for the trip ten men in all, so that watches might be established by night, in consequence of the presence of several bands of Sioux Indians on the trail of the buffalo hunters, who were then coming in from the Great Prairies after their summer hunt. The Sioux had succeeded in driving off ten horses from the tail of the caravan, about half a day\u2019s journey from Prairie Portage the night preceding my arrival there; and this incident led John Spence and others to decline going with me, unless the number of the party amounted to ten in all. This large addition I found it impossible to procure at Prairie Portage, and after my return to the settlement, the time at my disposal was too short to admit of the exploration. In carefully searching the recent mud flats of the Assiniboine, at and a little above Prairie Portage, I found numerous small fragments of lignite, from which it might be inferred that an exposure of the parent rock was situated some distance up the river, but beyond this, and the reiterated statements of many who had been up the river before named, I found no proof of the existence of lignite in available quantities.\n\nSpecimens of Lignite common in the Settlements.\u2014Necessity of a Supply of Fuel for increasing Settlements.\n\n212. In the settlements on Red River and the Assiniboine small specimens of lignite were frequently shown to me by different people, who stated that they procured them from the crossing place on the Little Souris, and an Indian had a bag containing about half a bushel of the same material, together with specimens of silver mica, carefully treasured up in many folds of dressed buffalo skin. Many intelligent people in the settlements appeared to be much impressed with the importance of ascertaining the true nature and extent of the lignite beds on the Little Souris. The great scarcity of wood in the prairie country, and all through the valleys of Red River and the Assiniboine, making the question of a permanently increasing settlement in a measure dependent upon the supply of fuel which may be obtained from other sources than those offered by the aspen covered ridges, or the thin stripes of timber on the immediate banks of the rivers.\n\nSALT.\n\nBrine Springs of Manitoba.\u2014Salt even now made, and sells at 10s. sterling a bushel.\u2014Supply stated to be unlimited.\n\n213. The shores of Lake Manitoba have long been celebrated for their brine springs. At the present time, a considerable quantity is manufactured by the half-breeds for their own use, and for the supply of the settlements, where it commands ten shillings a bushel. Specimen No. \u2014 is from Lake Manitoba. A half-breed of Scotch descent, who had made salt for many years at the springs, told me that if a market existed for it, the springs would supply any quantity that might be required.\n\nPART IV.\n\nTHE SETTLEMENTS ON THE RED AND ASSINIBOINE RIVERS, IN THE DISTRICT OF ASSINIBOIA, RUPERT\u2019S LAND, WITH A SKETCH OF THE CLIMATE OF ASSINIBOIA, AND THE APPROACHES TO THE VALLEY OF LAKE WIINIEG.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nNumbers and Origin of the Population of Red River Settlement.\u2014The census, 214.\u2014Increase of Population slow; Cause of this; Foreign element diminishing, 215.\u2014Decrease of Europeans and Canadians; Increase of Half-breeds; Effect of this, 216.\u2014Population according to origin, increase or decrease in fifteen years, 217.\u2014Increase of poverty; Diminution of males; Reason of this; Young men go to the United States, 218.\u2014Natives desire Nationality, 219.\n\nIndustrial Occupations\u2014The Farms and Farmhouses of Red River.\u2014Appearance of; Swamps susceptible of drainage, 220.\u2014Appearance of the settlements at the first sight pleasing; Indifference to the future which characterizes the people, 221.\u2014Homesteads of Hunters indicate slow decay, 222.\u2014Farming, slovenly; Cause of the negligence of the Natives to be sought for apart from the climate, etc., 223.\u2014Gowler\u2019s farm an object of exclusive attention; Mr. Gowler\u2019s farm; Stables; Barns; Root-houses, 226.\u2014Want of a market; Gowler\u2019s farming practices; Turnips, potatoes; Period of planting; Indian corn, onions, melons; Gowler\u2019s cheese and tobacco; Old Associations; Gowler\u2019s opinion of the Assiniboine, 227.\u2014Gowler\u2019s\nNUMBERS AND ORIGIN OF THE POPULATION OF RED RIVER SETTLEMENT.\n\nThe Census of Red River Settlement.\n\n214. The census upon which the statements contained in the following pages are founded was taken in the years 1843, 1849, and 1856, and the copies which appear in the Report were kindly furnished me by Mr. W. R. Smith, the clerk to the Council of Assiniboina.\n\nPopulation, Increase very slow.\u2014Cause of this.\u2014Foreign Element diminishing.\n\n215. The total population at the settlements on Red River and the Assiniboine amounted to 6,523 in 1856, 5,291 in 1849, and 5,143 in 1843, showing an increase in the first six years of only 148, and in the last seven years of 1,282 souls. This great difference in the apparent rates of increase is one which may be easily explained, by enumerating the offsets from Red River Settlement, which have occurred since the periods when the census was taken. These consist of a number of families, embracing 120 persons, forming a settlement at Prairie Portage. St. Joseph's at Turtle Mountain has absorbed a very considerable number, exceeding 500 persons, and many families have left the settlement to seek a home in other localities. At the same time the population of Red River has received very few accessions from distant countries; indeed, the foreign element, as it may be termed, shows a very decided diminution in one important source of supply.\n\nDecrease of Europeans and Canadians.\u2014Increase in Half-breeds.\u2014Unfavourable Effects of the Diminution of the Foreign Element.\n\n216. During the seven years which elapsed between 1849 and 1856, a decrease in the numbers of Europeans or Canadians, that is, of people not born in Rupert's Land, although British subjects and originally coming from England, Scotland, Ireland, or Canada, has taken place to the extent of 102 families. The increase in native or half-breed families during the same period was 132. Between the periods of the census taken in 1843 and 1849, there was an increase in the European and Canadian element to the extent of seventy-four families, and of the half-breed of 113 families. The diminution in the number of European settlers has already worked a change for the worse in the habits and customs of the half-breeds or natives. For reasons which will be enumerated further on, the tendency of the native population is gradually to throw off the humanities of civilization, and approach nearer to the savage wildness of Indian life. An influx of European or Canadian blood had a very good effect in arresting this tendency, which circumstances, far more than disposition, have induced and fostered.\n\nPopulation according to Origin.\u2014Increase or Decrease during Thirteen Years.\n\n217. According to origin, the population of Red River now stands as follows:\n\n| Families | Families | Families | Period of Comparison, 13 Years |\n|----------|----------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| Rupert's Land | Half-breeds | Natives | 1856 | 1849 | 1843 | Increase in half-bred families | 245 |\n| Scotland | - | - | 116 | 129 | 110 | \" Scotch \" | 6 |\n| Canada | - | - | 92 | 161 | 152 | Decrease of Canadian | 60 |\n| England | - | - | 40 | 46 | 29 | Increase of English | 18 |\n| Ireland | - | - | 18 | 27 | 5 | \" Irish \" | 8 |\n| Switzerland | - | - | 2 | 2 | 2 | \" Swiss \" | - |\n| Norway | - | - | 1 | 3 | - | \" Norwegian \" | 1 |\n\nI had a long conversation with the single Norwegian who now remains at Red River; he is a very old man, between 90 and 100 years; he came to Rupert's Land more than forty years ago, and he described Red River as being \"a very good country for a poor man.\"\n\nNumbers of European and Canadian Families have left the Settlements. Increase of Poverty in the Settlements. Diminution of Males in the Settlements. Reason of this. Young Men go to the United States.\n\n218. In 1843, or thirteen years before the census of 1856, there were twenty-seven more European or Canadian families than there were at Red River in May 1856. These numbers show, that in place of an introduction of emigrants of a character likely to refine and elevate the rough natures of the natives, endowed as they are with many peculiar and valuable qualities, those who have been from their youth familiar with the advantages and blessings of civilization, have gradually left the settlement and sought a home elsewhere. The increase of poverty, or incapability of supporting families, is seen by the average number of individuals belonging to each family.\n\nIn 1849 the average of each family was \\( \\frac{5}{1} \\)\n\nIn 1856 the average of each family was \\( \\frac{6}{1} \\)\nThe difference in the whole population of 1856 and 1849 being 1,232 souls, while the difference in the number of families is given at thirty only. This very extraordinary discrepancy was stated by Mr. Smith, under whose direction the census was taken, to arise from the general depressed circumstances in which many families found themselves. Numbers were unable to live in separate houses, and it now happens that two and sometimes three families, formerly occupying distinct houses, and cultivating distinct farms, are crowded together in one house for the sake of economy. In 1849 there were 137 more males than females in the settlement; in 1856 there were 78 more females than males. The reason of this remarkable change in the relative numbers of males and females in so small a community and in such a short period of time was stated to arise from the circumstance, that during the past five or six years many young men have gone to seek recompense for industry in the United States, which the district of Assiniboia has not yet offered to them.\n\nNatives or Half-breeds desire Nationality.\n\n219. The term \"native,\" distinguishing the half-breeds from the European and Canadian element on the one hand, and the Indian on the other, appears to be desired by many of the better class, who naturally look upon the term as applied to a race of Christian men scarcely appropriate. There is evidently a strong and growing feeling among the few who have turned their attention to such matters, that in the event of an organic change occurring in the Government of the country, the \"native\" or half-breed population should not be neglected or thrust on one side.\n\nINDUSTRIAL OCCUPATIONS.\u2014THE FARMS AND FARMHOUSES OF RED RIVER.\n\nAppearance of the Farms and Farmhouses.\u2014Swamps susceptible of Drainage.\n\n220. It will be gathered from what has been said, that the appearance of the settlement between the Upper and Lower Fort, is remarkably attractive and pleasing at the first sight. On the river bank, and extending from it to a distance of about a third of a mile, farms are laid out in narrow strips, the houses are generally close to the edge of the level table-land of the prairie, where it is abruptly cut by the channel of the river, and is thought to be high enough to protect them from occasional floods; but where the boundaries of the prairie retire from the present river channel, they are sometimes placed near the road, and rarely in the depression formed by the ancient course of the stream. Above Mill Creek there does not appear to be any rise of land sufficient to afford security against extraordinary floods, such as those of 1826 and 1852, when the waters rose above the road, or more than thirty feet above the present river level. On the west of the road, as already remarked, is a boundless prairie, here and there enclosed, and offering to the eye perfectly level fields of waving grain or luxuriant pasture. Where no enclosures west of the road have been made, the prairie often passes in what are locally termed swamps or marshes; but which are so susceptible of drainage, and conversion into the richest pasture lands, that they do not deserve the title which has been assigned to them.\n\nAppearance of the Settlement at the first sight pleasing.\u2014Indifference to the Future characterizes the People.\n\n221. A closer acquaintance with the settlements dispel the favourable impression with which a stranger at first regards them. At a distance, the neat white-washed houses, with their gardens and farmyards, continuing without interruption for twenty miles between the forts, the herds of cattle, horses, and sheep feeding on the plains, the vast expanse of what seems to be meadow of the richest description, lead one to suppose that universal prosperity and contentment would here be won without anxiety or trouble. Nevertheless, no one can fail to be struck with the indifference to the future, which seems habitually to characterize the people, especially the French portion of the population, and to show itself everywhere in their unfinished dwellings, neglected farms, and extravagant indulgence in dress or in articles they covet. Many of the apparent efforts of industry which, seen from a distance, excite admiration, shrink upon a nearer approach into sluggish and irregular attempts at improvement abandoned before completion. The farms and farm buildings in the occupation of the majority afford no sign of recent amelioration, and in general, it may be said, that the buildings, which in Canada would be considered good, roomy country houses, are exclusively possessed and occupied by the retired officers of the Hudson's Bay Company, the traders or merchants of the settlement, and the clergy.\n\nAppearance of the Homesteads of the Hunters indicate slow Decay.\n\n222. The farmers' homesteads and the hunters' and trappers' cottages, if these classes here can with propriety be separated, bear rather the appearance of slow decay and a decline in fortune, than a healthy hopeful condition. It would be out of place to discuss the causes which may have led to this prevailing complexion, which, it is to be hoped but temporarily distinguishes the future bone and sinew of the Red River country.\n\nFarming Operations conducted in a slovenly Manner.\u2014Causes of the Negligence of the \"Natives\" to be sought for apart from Soil and Climate or Indisposition to labour on the Farm.\n\n223. With few exceptions, and these are chiefly among the Scotch, farming operations are conducted in a very slovenly manner. Weeds abound in most of the fields appropriated to grain; some fields are seen here and there to be altogether abandoned, and the outhouses wear a neglected aspect, or one of ruinous decay. As might be supposed in this primitive part of the world, manure is commonly allowed to accumulate in the front of the stables and cattle sheds, or sometimes thrown into the river, or heaped in such a position that it may be swept away by spring freshets. All these drawbacks and indications of negligence and imprudence are not uncommon, within certain limits, in every new country, indeed in any locality remote from markets, and wherever ignorance universally prevails; but where such a marked neglect and seeming dulness abounds, in the midst of very general in-\ntelligence and acuteness, besides means to disseminate elementary knowledge (to be noticed hereafter), and where, too, that depression is limited to the so-called agricultural class, in possession of a soil of unsurpassed excellence, the enjoyment of an admirable summer climate for agricultural purposes, and no greater share of periodical contingencies than those to which every other country is liable, the causes which induce these evils must be sought for in other directions than those which may be said to spring from a dislike for agricultural operations, or a characteristic inability to take advantage of the boundless appliances for promoting happiness and comfort which lie within their reach.\n\nFARMING AND ITS RESULTS.\n\nCapabilities of the Country not to be judged of by Results obtained under present circumstances.\n\n224. The description which has been given of the general aspect of the farms and farmhouses in the settlements is not such as to create a favourable impression of the condition of husbandry in this remote region, but it would be very unfair to form an opinion of the agricultural capabilities of the country from the results obtained by the majority, under its present state of isolation, and the direction of the best efforts of the inhabitants to objects the reverse of those which belong to a pastoral life.\n\nFarm not Object of exclusive Attention.\n\n225. The farm, as an object of industry and attention, is recognised by very few of the people of Red River. I had an opportunity of examining two or three farms to which the owner devoted both attention, industry, and some degree of skill. I shall attempt to describe what I saw, and this description may be received as applicable to many hundred thousand acres on the banks of Red River and the Assiniboine, in respect of the returns they would yield to industry.\n\nMr. Gowler's Farm, Stackyards, and Barns.\u2014Root-houses.\n\n226. One of the farms which I visited was occupied by Mr. Gowler; it is situated on the Assiniboine nine miles from Fort Garry, and it is marked on the map which accompanies this report. On the 16th September, the day I visited Mr. Gowler's house and farm, nearly all farming operations were over. A small stackyard was filled with stacks of wheat and hay; his barn, which was very roomy, was crammed with wheat, barley, potatoes, pumpkins, turnips, and carrots. His roots were shortly to be transferred to root-houses, which he had constructed by excavating chambers near the high bank of the Assiniboine, and draining them into the river. The drain was supplied with a close and tightly fitting trap, which was closed when the water rose during the spring above its mouth, which at that time might be eight feet above the level of the river. The chambers where about nine feet high, and their ceilings three feet below the prairie level. Access was obtained through a hole in the ceiling, which was covered with a neat little moveable roof. There were three of these cellars or root-houses before the dwelling-house, and between it and the river. Frost never entered them, and he found no difficulty in preserving any quantity of potatoes and turnips through the severe winters of this region.\n\nWant of a Market for Produce.\u2014Gowler's Farming Practice.\u2014Extraordinary Turnips.\u2014Excellent Potatoe Crop.\u2014Period of planting Potatoes.\u2014Indian Corn, Onions, Melons.\u2014Melons at Fort Garry and elsewhere.\u2014Gowler's Cheese and Tobacco.\u2014Old Associations long retained by the Europeans at Red River.\u2014Mr. Gowler's Opinion of the Assiniboine.\n\n227. Mr. Gowler farmed fifty acres in white and green crops, hay and pasture being furnished by the prairie. He owned much more land, but found it useless to crop it, as no market for surplus produce existed. Last year he had sold many bushels of potatoes at sixteen per bushel, and had carted them nine miles. I had been previously informed of the extraordinary success of Mr. Gowler in growing wheat, but I found upon inquiry that the practice he employed was simply not to grow wheat after wheat; he had grown fifty-six measured bushels to the acre. The price of wheat at the time of my departure was 4s. 5d. sterling a bushel, but last year at the same time it had been 3s. 6d. sterling. His turnips (Swedes) were magnificent; four of them weighed seventy pounds, two weighed thirty-nine pounds, and two others thirty-one. Whatever manure his yard and stables supplied he gave to green crops and the garden. A portion of the potatoe crop was still in the ground; they far surpassed in quantity, quality, and size any I had ever seen before. Mr. Gowler very kindly turned them up out of the soil wherever I pointed out. I counted thirteen, fourteen, and sixteen potatoes, averaging three inches and a half in diameter, at each root. They were a round white-skinned variety, and seemed to be like those known in Canada as the \"English White.\" The potatoes were planted on the 1st June, and were ready for eating on the 16th or 18th August. The winter supply was rarely taken out of the ground before the beginning of October. The greatest enemy to the turnip crop is the cut-worm (the grub of an elater). Indian corn succeeds well on Mr. Gowler's farm, and onions of rare dimensions were growing in his garden. He had had this year a splendid crop of melons, the seed being sown in the open air at the end of May, and the fruit gathered about the 1st September. At the time of my visit the melons had all been consumed, but I had several opportunities of tasting and enjoying this fruit at Fort Garry and elsewhere on the Assiniboine and Red River. In every instance they were grown in the open air, without any artificial aid beyond weeding, from the time the seed was planted to the maturation of the fruit. Mr. Gowler insisted on my tasting his wife's cheese and smoking his tobacco, before I departed. The cheese was tolerable; the tobacco, which was grown in the neighbourhood and highly prized by Mr. Gowler, was dreadfully strong, and would involve, I should think, long training, in order to acquire a taste for its qualities. Nevertheless Mr. Gowler preferred it to some excellent fig-leaf which I offered him; he remarked that he had grown and prepared it himself, and knew what it was. I may here relate, with a view to show how long old associations linger in the recollections of the European portion of the population in this remote region, that when I sat down to table Mr. Gowler turned inquiringly to his wife, saying, \"And where is my son plate?\" \"Oh, John! you would not think of sitting at table with gentlemen?\" Mr. John seemed puzzled for a moment; his son-in-law and children were looking in silence from different\ncorners of the room. He cast a hasty glance around, and the true feelings of independence and manly right showed themselves, as he exclaimed, \"Give me a chair and a plate; am I not a gentleman too? Is not this my house, my farm, and these my victuals? Give me a plate.\" Mr. Gowler had been in Rupert's Land for, I think, twenty-three years. His native county was Cambridgeshire. He considered the Assiniboine River to be a \"Paradise of fertility,\" and all that was wanted, in his opinion, to make it a region which, if known, would soon attract a large emigration, found expression in the words \"market\" and \"labour.\" I venture to introduce here some remarks which Mr. Gowler made, as he accompanied me to the gate of his farm-yard, where my horse was tied. \"Look at that prairie; 10,000 head of cattle might feed and fatten there for nothing. If I found it worth my while, I could inclose 50, 100, or 500 acres, and from every acre get thirty-six to forty bushels of wheat, year after year. I could grow Indian corn, barley, oats, flax, hemp, hops, turnips, tobacco, anything you wish, and to any amount, but what would be the use? There are no markets; it's a chance if my wheat is taken; and my potatoes I may have to give to the pigs. If we had only a market, you'd have to travel long before you would see the like of these prairies about the Assiniboine.\"\n\nGowler's Stable, Piggeries, &c.\u2014Grasshoppers appeared.\n\n228. The substantial character of the barn, stables, and piggeries, all constructed of wood, their neatness and cleanliness, the admirable arrangement of the hammocks for cattle, and the sheds for sheep, all showed how far a little energy and determination, instructed by the experience of earlier years, would go in re-producing amidst the boundless prairies of Assiniboia, the comforts and enjoyments which are by no means the rule among the small farmers of Great Britain. I have brought specimens of Mr. Gowler's barley, wheat, prairie hay, and caraway seed, which I took at random from the stacks in the yards, or from the garden, where the last-named fragrant herb was growing largely. I regret to say that a few days before my visit the grasshoppers had arrived from the southwest, and consumed in a single day every green leaf in the garden which remained exposed to their attacks.\n\nThe Indian Missionary Village.\u2014The Rev. Mr. Cowley's Garden.\n\n229. On the 3rd of October I visited the Indian Missionary Village, about seven miles below the Stone or Lower Fort, and fourteen from the mouth of the river. Here I had an opportunity of acquiring trustworthy information from the Rev. Mr. Cowley, the very hospitable and excellent missionary at this station. In the garden around the house some flowering shrubs and annuals were still in bloom. The air was fragrant with the perfume of mignonette, and the bright orange yellow extroltzia shone pre-eminent among asters and sweet peas, which had escaped the autumn frosts.\n\nThe Mission Farm.\u2014Wheat.\u2014Period of the growth of Wheat, Barley, &c.\u2014Magnificent Potato Crops.\u2014Culinary Vegetables in the Garden.\u2014The Farmyards.\u2014Wild Fruits.\n\n230. The farm attached to the mission was cultivated with more than ordinary care, as it is not only intended to serve for a model for the Christian Indians settled in the vicinity, but also to provide them with seed and supplies in the event of their own stock failing, a contingency by no means improbable, since habits of forethought or economy are rarely acquired by these people until the second generation. In part of the garden allotted to vegetables a small area was devoted to wheat for the purpose of raising seed from an early variety, which Mr. Cowley had procured from Scotland the year before. The \"Scotch wheat\" was sown on the 16th and 18th of May. It was ready for the sickle and reaped on the 24th of August, having been ninety-seven days in arriving at maturity. The common wheat of the country was sown May 5th, and harvested August 18th, having required 105 days to grow and ripen. Barley was sown May 28th, and reaped August 18th. Indian corn is planted about the 25th May, and ripens every year. Potatoes are planted from the 22nd to the 26th of May. The potato crop is here truly magnificent. I was favoured with an inspection of the produce of a small field, afterwards visited, and certainly no finer or more plentiful returns could be desired. All perfectly clean and sound, and of very unusual size and weight. With the permission of Mr. Cowley I took four potatoes which lay close at hand, on the top of a large heap, containing very many equalling in size those I had taken without special selection; when carefully weighed they were found to average ten ounces each (10\u00bd ounces), a practical experiment proved them to be an excellent table variety. I may here mention that in the garden I noticed asparagus growing luxuriantly, beet, cabbages, broccoli, shallots, and indeed most culinary vegetables. In the farmyard were ducks, fowls, turkeys, pigs, sheep, with some excellent milking cows, and through the politeness of Mrs. Cowley, I was enabled to form a very favourable opinion of several varieties of preserve from the wild strawberry, cranberries, and plums, which grew in profusion not far from the village. Among many kinds of wild fruits common here, and much sought after by the Indians, are red and black currants, high and low bush cranberries, two kinds of raspberries, gooseberry, two kinds, mossberries, blueberries, summer berries, choke cherry, stone cherry, &c.; these are the common names by which they are known in the settlements. In the appendix will be found a list, with their scientific names attached.\n\nCrops at Prairie Portage.\u2014Area to which these observations extend.\n\n231. An enumeration of the cultivated crops at Prairie Portage, on the Assiniboine, sixty miles due west of Fort Garry, will complete a brief view of the agricultural productions raised without difficulty within the limits of settlement in the district of Assiniboia, and a glance at the map will show that while the Indian village is its most northerly settled limit, Prairie Portage is the most westerly, and Mr. Gowler's farm lies between these two extreme points. From the observations I was enabled to make, I believe that whatever is stated with respect to these points will apply to the whole of the area occupied by settlements between them, and may be justly said, with slight exceptions, to be noticed in the absence of any known reason to the contrary, to extend over many hundred thousand acres on the north bank of Assiniboine, and on the east and west bank of Red River, from the Indian Village to the\nforty-ninth parallel. Respecting the south bank of the Assiniboine, I cannot speak from personal observation, but I was informed by very credible and competent persons, that it differed in no material physical features from the country I saw on the north bank.\n\nIndian Corn grown by Mr. John Spence, of Prairie Portage.\u2014Mandan Corn.\u2014Ripens well.\n\n232. At Prairie Portage, I visited Mr. John Spence, with a view to learn from him the accuracy of some reports I had heard of the existence of a kind of coal on the banks of the Assiniboine, to be noticed under its proper heading. In order to reach Mr. Spence's house, I had to pass through a field of Indian corn, and from the proprietor I obtained the following statement: the kind of Indian corn which is most common in the settlement, is called the horse-teeth corn, and it does not always ripen. The variety sown by Mr. Spence (specimen No. 10) he termed the mandril corn, the seed was procured from the Indians, near the head waters of the Missouri; probably the \"mandan corn\" would be the correct name. He had cultivated it for two years, it ripened well both years. One of his neighbours, a Cree Indian, had cultivated it for four years, and had not met with any failure. Mr. Spence sowed his corn on the 1st June, and gathered it September 10, or after a period of 102 days. In dry seasons it ripens earlier, and is planted about the 20th of May. The wet spring of the present year retarded all agricultural operations. I visited a small house adjoining the one in which Mr. Spence resided, and found it filled with a portion of his corn crop.\n\n233. Since all facts bearing upon the cultivation of Indian corn in this region are valuable, as tending to afford trustworthy evidence respecting the adaptation of the summer climate to agricultural purposes, I venture to submit a few additional particulars, bearing upon the culture of this important plant, and other kinds of farm produce.\n\nMr. Lane's (of the Hudson's Bay Company) Opinion respecting Indian Corn.\n\n234. Mr. Lane, the gentleman in charge of the Honourable the Hudson's Bay Company's Post on the Assiniboine, twenty-two miles west of Fort Garry, in speaking of the horse-teeth corn, stated that it did not always ripen on that part of the river. Spring frosts rarely affect it, but autumn frosts sometimes cut it off. Mr. Lane thought that careless cultivation was the reason why it did not progress fast enough to escape the early autumnal frosts. Indian corn sown on dry land arrived at maturity much sooner than that which was sown on rich and moist prairie mould.\n\nMr. Flett's Statements.\u2014Cultivation of Potatoes.\u2014Wheat on the White Horse Plain.\n\n235. On the night of the 15th September, I stayed at the house of Mr. Geo. Flett, fifteen miles west of Fort Garry: Mr. Flett's turnips have been altogether consumed by the grasshoppers; his wheat is safe and good; he says that Indian corn succeeds well, and almost always ripens; it is his opinion that it may always be relied upon when care is taken; it does not progress quick enough on the open prairie to escape every season the early autumnal frosts; on the points of the river where the soil is lighter and dryer than in the open prairie, and where some shelter may be obtained from the neighbouring timber, he has never known it to fail. Mr. Flett finds the cut worm the great enemy to his turnips; his potatoes for the summer crop are planted 1st June, and ready for eating from the 10th to the 15th August; the winter supply he does not lift until October. Over the whole of the White Horse Plain District, thirty bushels to the acre is an average crop of wheat, but on New Island, forty bushels is not only common, but generally expected.\n\nMr. P. Gladieux's Farm.\u2014An immense Liard, four feet ten inches in diameter.\u2014Cultivation of Peas.\n\n236. Mr. Pierre Gladieux, a French \"native,\" residing on the right bank of the Red River, five miles south of Port Garry, at whose house I was kindly entertained on the night of 29th September, under circumstances which will be related in the proper place, showed me his farmyard, barns, &c.; four pea stacks, several wheat stacks, and five or six hay stacks, all of fair dimensions, were neatly arranged in the stack yard, while the cattle yard was tenanted by a number of cows, pigs, horses and poultry. Before Mr. Gladieux's house, the trunk of an immense liard (populus*) lay ready for splitting into firewood; the size appeared to be so unusual that I measured it carefully, and found it to be four feet ten inches in diameter six feet from the base, and four feet eight inches in diameter ten feet from the base; at the base it measured 16.5 feet in circumference, and showed 150 well-defined rings. Mr. Gladieux's peas were sown on the 7th May, and reaped on the 25th September.\n\n237. Among facts which at the first blush may seem too trifling to record, I have noted the following, which appear to possess some value in their bearings upon the summer or agricultural climate of this region.\n\nTomatoes.\n\n238. At the hospitable home of the Rev. Archdeacon Hunter I saw tomatoes ripening in the house; they had been gathered before maturity, in anticipation of frost, and were laid upon a shelf in the same way as we are accustomed to dispose of them in Canada under similar circumstances. Tomatoes, well known to be very susceptible of frost, can be grown in the open air at Red River, under the lee of fences or the side of a house, but unless the maturity of the fruit is accelerated by careful cultivation, the autumnal frosts generally arrive before it ripens thoroughly in the open air.\n\nMignionette.\n\n239. So late as the 7th October, the day before my departure from Red River, I gathered mignionette and several other annuals in Mrs. Bird's garden, near the middle settlement, and saw similar garden flowers still in bloom and untouched by frost, in Mr. Logan's garden, and also in Mr. McDermott's garden.\n\nGardens at the Upper and Lower Forts.\u2014Melons.\u2014Enormous Crop of Melons.\u2014Thirty Melons from One Seed.\u2014Importance of the Cultivation of the Melon in relation to Climate.\n\n240. In the large and well ordered gardens attached to the Upper and Lower Forts, every variety of vegetable, commonly grown in Canada, was flourishing in the greatest luxuriance.\u2014Cauliflower,\nWindsor beans, celery, beets, several varieties of cabbages, in fact every desirable vegetable was seen in profusion, and of excellent growth. Lastly, and certainly not the least important in its relation to summer climate, melons of many varieties I had the good fortune to see and eat in several parts of the settlement. In every case I inquired into they were grown in the open air, without any assistance beyond throwing up the soil into the form of a little hill. The seed was planted in the earth in May, and the fruit gathered towards the end of August. From a small patch in the garden belonging to the very hospitable and generous Recorder and Governor of Assiniboia, James Johnston, Esq., no less than 108 melons were produced. At the time when I had the opportunity of seeing this feat of horticulture, fifty-six melons (a green flesh variety) had been gathered, and fifty-seven still remained, all of which had nearly reached maturity. I did not measure the bed, but to the best of my recollection it did not exceed twenty-five feet in length by ten or twelve in breadth. Having been accustomed to cultivate melons myself, near Toronto, the surprise I felt at the remarkable yield of a delicate fruit, which does not always ripen in the open air at Toronto, could scarcely be attributed to a want of familiarity with the requirement of soil and climate necessary to produce this result. In other parts of the settlement I saw melons in great profusion, but, perhaps, in no instance in such rich abundance and of such excellent flavour as in Mr. Johnston's garden. I find in my notes, however, the following memorandum:\u2014\u201cSeptember 10th, saw in Mr. Logan's house several melons which \u201cwere grown in the open air without any protection. Mr. Mackenzie informed me that this year \u201che raised from one seed thirty melons. On the 10th of August, one melon weighed, by actual \u201cmeasurement six pounds.\u201d I look upon the cultivation of the melon in the open air, without any kind of assistance beyond weeding, as second to the production of Indian corn, in its relation to the climatic adaptation of a country for agricultural purposes; and in view of this connection, I have ventured to introduce the foregoing facts relating to its cultivation and growth in Assiniboia.\n\n241. Not considering it necessary to advance any further particular illustrations of farming and its results in Assiniboia, I propose, in the succeeding chapter, to enumerate the general conclusions at which I arrive respecting the adaptation of the climate and soil of that country to the cultivation of different kinds of farm and garden produce.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCultivated crops and forest productions.\u2014Indian corn, 242\u2014Specimens of Horseteeth and Mandan Corn, 243\u2014Wheat forty bushels to the acre common on new land, 244\u2014Reason why a Half-breed would not cultivate wheat, 245\u2014Diseases of wheat uncommon here, The Hessian or wheaty disease, 246\u2014Barley and oats, 247\u2014Hay, 248\u2014Hops, 249\u2014Peas, 250\u2014Tobacco, 251\u2014Potatoes, 252\u2014Turnips, Beets, &c., 253\u2014Sugar, 254\u2014Flax and hemp, 255\u2014Lumber; Timber found only in narrow strips on the river; Ridges afford aspen; The Winnipeg; Fuel necessary; Settlers anxious to find coal, 256\u2014Live stock, sheep diminishing; loss of animals during the winter, 257.\n\nAgricultural Implements, &c., 258\u2014Red River carts, 258\u2014The prairies offer facilities for rearing stock; No market for beef, mutton, butter, hides, &c., 258\u2014Reasons for the neglect of stock raising; Habits of the half-breeds; The introduction of Europeans required\u2014Opinion of many at Red River; Red River will become a great grazing country when the fur trade relinquishes its influence, 259.\n\nCULTIVATED CROPS AND FOREST PRODUCTIONS.\n\nI. INDIAN CORN.\n\nIndian Corn may be always expected to ripen in Assiniboia.\n\n242. Varieties of Indian corn exist, which may always be expected to ripen in Assiniboia. In order to secure this result, the rich and moist prairie soil requires draining, which may be accomplished without difficulty or expense, by running deep furrows with a common plough, at certain distances apart, through the flat vegetable mould in the field devoted to Indian corn. This grain is a sure crop on the dry points of the Assiniboine and Red River, where the absence of superabundant moisture permits it to ripen within a certain period, so as to be secure against the early autumnal frosts. No doubt varieties of Indian corn are to be found in New England and in Lower Canada, which would ripen several days earlier in Assiniboia than the horse-teeth or even the mandan corn, which are cultivated there.\n\nSpecimens of Indian Corn.\n\n243. The localities where this crop was seen growing and ripe specimens produced, were as follows:\n\n1. At numerous places on the Assiniboine from Fort Garry to Prairie Portage.\n2. Numerous localities on Red River, from fifteen miles above Fort Garry, to seven miles below the Lower or Stone Fort.\n3. Near the mouth of the Winnipeg River.\n4. On islands in the Lake of the woods.\n\nThe localities where it was said by reliable authority to grow and ripen well:\n\n1. On many parts of the Winnipeg River.\n2. On the shores of Manitoba Lake.\n3. Near the shores of many parts of the southern river of Lake Winnipeg.\n\nSpecimens.\n\nNo. 10. Indian corn (Mandan corn) from Prairie Portage, Assiniboine River; an eight-rowed variety; average number of grains in each ear, 340; Sept. 1857; plaited June 1st; reaped August 20th.\n\nNo. 11. Indian corn from the middle settlement, Red River. (Horse-teeth corn.) Sept. 1857.\n\nNo. 12. Indian corn from near Fort Garry, Red River. (Horse-teeth corn.) Sept. 1857.\n\nNo. 13. Indian corn from Indian Missionary Village, Red River. Sept. 1857.\nIn examining these specimens it should be borne in mind, that the spring was very backward and wet in Assiniboia, and I was repeatedly informed by all who saw my specimens that they were not favourable illustrations of the production of the Red River country.\n\nII. WHEAT.\n\n244. This is the staple crop of Red River; its cultivation is so general, and the good quality of the grain so well and widely known, that very little need be said on that head. In favourable years, that is in years which have not been distinguished by so wet and backward a spring for farming operations as that of the present year, wheat ripens and is ready for the sickle in three months from the day of sowing. I think it is very probable that new varieties from Canada, or the New England States, would ripen in less than three months, and this is the opinion of several of the best farmers in Red River. The mean summer temperature there is $67^\\circ 76'$, or $3^\\circ 78'$ above that of Toronto, while the corresponding period shows a mean of $63^\\circ 98'$. No fact, however, is more satisfactorily determined than the admirable adaptation of the climate and soil of Assiniboia to the culture of wheat. Forty bushels to the acre is a common return on new land, and I have already stated that Mr. Gowler has obtained fifty-six bushels to the acre, without the introduction of any artifice beyond deep land furrows to keep the rich vegetable mould of the prairie dry.\n\nReason why a Half-breed would not cultivate Wheat.\n\n245. The great drawback to the cultivation of wheat is the want of a market. On enquiry of a native, where was his wheat field, he said that he had grown enough the year before to last for two years, and the chances of his being able to dispose of any surplus were so small that he determined not to trouble himself this year with growing wheat. As it happened he would have been well repaid for any surplus, the expected arrival of the troops, and other circumstances, created a temporary market for wheat, which, however, could not have been foreseen by the easy going half-breed.\n\nDiseases in Wheat uncommon.\u2014The Hessian or Wheat Fly.\u2014Grasshoppers destructive in 1817 to 1820.\n\n246. None of those diseases, with the exception of smut or insect, enemies to which the wheat crops in Canada and the United States are subject, occur, it is said, at Red River. Of this fact I cannot speak from personal experience; all I can say is that I heard no complaints of rust, nor did I see a single instance of its presence; yet it would be very unwise to infer from so short an experience that rust is not an enemy to the wheat crops there; the character of rust leads to the supposition that it will be found wherever wheat is grown, if the climate be favourable to its production. The absence of rust is probably more a question of summer climate than of peculiarities in the soil which prevent its attacks. Although I made numerous inquiries respecting destructive insects, yet I could hear of none similar to the Hessian fly or wheat fly, as having been observed there. The grasshoppers from 1817 to 1820 were the most destructive enemies known, and it is unfortunately probable that next year their ravages will have again to be lamented.\n\nThe specimens to which the following list refers will show the character of Red River wheat in its unmanufactured and manufactured states:\n\nSpecimens.\n\nSpecimens of Wheat both manufactured and unmanufactured.\n\nNo. 13. Wheat in the ear, from Mrs. Bird, Middle Settlement, Red River. September, 1857.\nNo. 14. Wheat from Mr. Gowler's farm, Assiniboine river. September, 1857.\nNo. 15. One quart wheat from Red River.

Barley from Gowler's farm.\n\" 23. Crop of 1857.\n\" 24. Crop of 1856.\n\nIV. HAY.\n\n248. Quantity unlimited, and quality excellent. The prairies for hundreds of miles, through which Red River, Assiniboine River, Rat, and Roseau rivers flow, offer everywhere a bountiful supply of grass and hay. Hay ground privileges have been established in both of the larger rivers, and the right of making hay within particular limits is recognized by the inhabitants.\n\nSpecimen No. 18, shows hay drawn from Mr. Gowler's stacks in the Assiniboine.\nV. HOPS.\n\n249. These grow everywhere wild, and with the greatest luxuriance in Assiniboia. Specimen No. 19, shows hops from the banks of Assiniboine.\n\n\" 20, \" hops from Red River crop of 1856.\n\n\" 25, \" hops from Red River crop of 1857.\n\nVI. PEAS.\n\n250. Grow well, and yield abundantly. Specimen No. 32 was taken from one bushel which was supplied for household use. October 2nd, 1857.\n\nVII. TOBACCO.\n\n251. Is cultivated to a small extent, but from trial of the qualities, I infer that it is susceptible of great improvement in the manufacturing process to which it is subjected. The season is, perhaps, too short for it to acquire maturity, and produce a good article.\n\nVIII. POTATOES.\n\n252. Assiniboia is particularly distinguished for the abundance, size, and quality of its potatoes.\n\nIX. TURNIPS, BEETS, ETC.\n\n253. All kinds of root crops grow well, and attain large dimensions. All common garden vegetables, which are cultivated in Canada, are equalled, if not surpassed, by the productions of the rich prairie soil of Assiniboia.\n\nX. SUGAR.\n\n254. Considerable quantities of sugar are made from the ash-leaved maple on the Assiniboine. As no care is taken of the trees furnishing this useful article, it is probable that the supply from this source will soon cease. In cutting wood for fuel, the \u201cnatives\u201d do not seem to have any special regard for the valuable trees.\n\nXI. FLAX AND HEMP.\n\nFormerly much cultivated.\u2014Reason for neglect of Flax and Hemp.\n\n255. Some years since, at the instance, it is stated, of Sir Geo. Simpson, flax and hemp were cultivated to a considerable extent by the settlers at Red River. The product was of excellent quality, and gave every promise of furnishing very valuable commodities for home manufacture, and for exportation. The cultivation of these important crops was stimulated for a few years by premiums given by the Hon. Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, but when the premiums were withdrawn the cultivation soon ceased. Many settlers with whom I conversed had grown both of these vegetables, but that universal complaint, the want of a market, or of machinery to work up the raw product, led them to discontinue this very important and profitable branch of husbandry.\n\nXII. LUMBER.\n\nTimber found only in narrow strips on the rivers.\u2014Bridges afford aspen.\u2014The Winnipeg might furnish lumber.\u2014Fuel necessary.\u2014Settlers anxious to find coal.\u2014A supply of fuel necessary for the progress of the settlements.\n\n256. Timber fit for lumbering purposes is only found in narrow strips on the Red and Assiniboine rivers, and in still less quantities on the Roseau and Rat rivers; the timber consists of elm, oak, maple, and poplar of very large growth, as is recorded elsewhere. Poplar, exceeding four feet in diameter, elm, exceeding three feet, and oak of very large dimensions, are the prevailing forest trees; but if the settlements progress, and why should they not? these supplies will soon be consumed. The ridges afford small aspen and pine; it is stated, too, that back of the great ridge, on the east side of the Red River, good pine is to be found towards the Lake of the Woods; the Winnipeg would doubtless furnish some good pine, but the difficulty would lie in bringing it up Red River in its unmanufactured state. Sawmills are unknown in the settlement, but the rapids of the Winnipeg could afford any required power there. The question of a supply of timber for building purposes is not so important as the requirements of the same material for fuel; hence it is that those who interest themselves in the future of Red River are anxiously turning their inquiries in the direction of the upper Assiniboine and the little Souris, to those beds of lignite or tertiary coal which are so often spoken of by the buffalo hunters, who have occasion to cross these rivers in their progress to the high prairies. Fuel of some description, whether obtained from the Assiniboine, the little Souris, or the Saskatchewan, is absolutely essential to the progress of settlement in Assiniboia; the wooded ranges on the shores of Lake Winnipeg and on the ridges might afford a supply for some years; but, without a more hopeful prospect of obtaining fuel on the banks of some of the rivers enumerated, the future of Red River settlements can never acquire that prominence and importance which may otherwise belong to them.\n\nLive Stock.\n\nLive stock.\u2014Sheep diminishing.\u2014Loss of animals during the winter.\n\n257. The live stock of the settlement are represented by 2,799 horses, 2,726 oxen, 3,883 cattle, 2,644 calves, 4,674 pigs, and 2,429 sheep. Since the census of 1849 an increase has taken place in all the foregoing items, with the exception of sheep: this useful animal appears to be fast diminish-\ning at Red River, and little wonder, when only one carding mill, and that not in operation, as I was informed, exists in the settlement. In 1856, there were 667 fewer sheep in Assiniboia than in 1849, and 1,130 less than in 1843. This decrease is very much to be lamented; it is said to arise from the want of a market for the wool, or means to manufacture it in the settlement. During the winter of 1855-6, the number of animals lost will be seen by an inspection of Table No. 2, at the close of this chapter. The entire number amounted to 184.\n\nAgricultural Implements.\n\nAgricultural Implements.\u2014Red River Carts.\u2014Admirable fitness of these Carts.\n\n258. The agricultural implements are English and American ploughs, of which 585 are now to be found in the settlement. These are valued at 4l. 10s. sterling each; 730 harrows, eight thrashing machines, two reaping machines, and six winnowing machines. Produce is hauled in the celebrated Red River carts, which are admirably constructed throughout of wood; no iron is employed, but sometimes buffalo-hide is made to serve as a tire; these carts will last for several years; and one which conveyed some heavy boxes of mineralogical specimens from Red River to Crow Wing, last autumn, had previously been twice to near the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and was still in good condition.\n\nThe prairies offer great advantages for rearing stock.\u2014No market for beef, mutton, tallow, hides, &c.\u2014Cattle might supply the place of buffalo.\u2014Reasons for the neglect of stock raising.\u2014Buffalo meat, pemican, robes, &c., always a cash article; beef, &c., drugs.\u2014Habits of the half-breeds.\u2014The introduction of the European and Canadian element would soon change the state of things.\u2014Opinion of many at Red River.\u2014Red River will become a great grazing country when the fur trade relinquishes its influence.\n\n259. The vast prairies of Red River and the Assiniboine, clothed with a rich profusion of most nutritious grasses, offer unrivalled advantages for rearing stock. The introduction of mowing machines would enable the settlers to lay in any required quantity of hay for winter consumption. Few of the better class of farmers keep more than thirty or forty head of cattle, in consequence of the want of a market for beef, tallow, hides, &c. The answer I received on all hands to the question, \u201cWhy do you not raise more cattle?\u201d was always the same in substance: \u201cFind us a market for beef, tallow, and hides, and we will soon furnish any quantity of cattle you may require.\u201d There does not appear to be any good reason why sheep and cattle should not supply the place of the buffalo; the experience of many years shows that no physical impediment arising from climate or soil exist to prevent the prairies of Red River from becoming one of the greatest grazing countries in the world. Two reasons for the neglect of this important branch of industry are soon apparent, even to a stranger, at Red River. Buffalo meat, pemican made from buffalo meat, together with the robes and fine feet, are always a cash article at the Hon. Company\u2019s stores; whereas beef, mutton, hides, tallow, and wool, are a mere drug in the market; again, the habits of the half-breeds, who have long been trained to the hunt, are opposed to the quiet monotony of a pastoral life. Introduce the European or Canadian element into the settlement with the simple machinery they have been accustomed to employ in the manufacture of homespun, and in a very few years the beautiful prairies of Red River and the Assiniboine would be white with flocks and herds, and the cattle trade, already springing into importance between the settlements and St. Paul\u2019s, either largely increase, or without much difficulty be diverted into an easterly channel; such are the ideas of many with whom I discussed the subject when in the settlements, and my own observations lead me to the opinion that no real difficulty exists in the least degree likely to hinder Red River from becoming a grazing country of the first class, when other interests shall be permitted to exist in the presence of that all-absorbing, all-controlling service, the fur trade.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nReligion and Education.\u2014Religious demonstrations in Red River; Families and churches, 260\u2014Statistics and enumeration of schools, 261\u2014Statistics and enumeration of churches, congregations, ministers, stipends and means of support, 262.\n\nOne Church of England, two Presbyterian, three Roman Catholic, 262\u2014St. John\u2019s Church, St. Andrew\u2019s Church, the Parsonage House, St. Andrews Parochial school, 263\u2014The Indian church, Indian school, 264\u2014The Rev. Mr. Cowley\u2019s\u2014Indians night here, 265\u2014Indian boys now Christianized Indians and the heathens; Dog feasts within a mile and a half of Christian congregations, 266\u2014Peguis, 267\u2014Baptisms at the mission, 268\u2014Prairie Portage, 269\u2014Mixed congregation at Prairie Portage, how clothed, 269\u2014Congregations at Red River; Indications of wealth among the congregations, 270\u2014The Presbyterian church and mansi, 271\u2014The Roman Catholic church at St. Boniface; sweet toned bells, 272\u2014Convent and garden, 273\u2014Roman Catholic and Protestant parishes, 274\u2014Admiration felt at the extent of the Home charities; Nineteen clergymen of the Church of England sustained in Rupert\u2019s Land by the Home Society; high duties by the inhabitants for the support of clergy, &c.; Difficulty of the situation of the services conducted in the English tongue; Missionaries should be independent, 275\u2014Charges to missionaries for freight in 1854 and in 1856, 276.\n\nRELIGION AND EDUCATION.\n\nReligious denominations in Red River.\n\n260. There are three religious denominations in Assiniboia, Church of England, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic. In the census of 1843 and 1849 two divisions only were recognized, Protestant and Roman Catholic, and the numbers of members were stated to be 2,798 Roman Catholics and 2,345 Protestants. In 1849 the Episcopal families were stated to number 539, and the Roman Catholic families 513. In 1856, a division in the enumeration of the Protestant element was made, probably on account of the advent of a Presbyterian minister, who responded to the call of a numerous body\nbelonging to that denomination, yet in the absence of a minister formerly enumerated with the Episcopalians. Last year the census, according to religion, stood thus:\n\nFamilies and Churches.\n\nRoman Catholics, 534 families, with 3 churches.\nEpiscopalian, 488 \"\nPresbyterian, 60 \"\n\nThe settlement at Prairie Portage and the Indian Missionary Village are not included in this enumeration. In addition to the churches enumerated, services are performed in two or three school houses, which, on that account, are classed with churches in the census tables, but which ought evidently to be preserved separate.\n\n261. There are seventeen schools in the settlement, generally under the supervision of the ministers of the denomination to which they belong. The following enumeration is nearly accurate:\n\nStatistics and enumeration of Schools.\n\n1. St. John's College, including a boarding school for boys and girls, under the immediate supervision of the Bishop of Rupert's Land.\n2. Archdeacon Hunter's parochial school, conducted by Mr. Mayhew, recently from the normal school, Dublin.\n3. Mr. Gunn's commercial boarding school, more particularly in connection with Presbyterians.\n4. The Rev. Mr. Taylor's parochial school, on the Assiniboine.\n5. The Rev. Mr. Chapman's school, near the middle settlement.\n6. The Presbyterian school, under the superintendence of the Rev. Mr. Black.\n7. Three minor schools, under the supervision of the Episcopal ministers in different parishes.\n8. The Roman Catholic seminaries, two in number, one of them occupying a very spacious and imposing building near the church of St. Boniface, and providing ample accommodation for female boarders. At the Indian Missionary Village, an excellent school is under the control of the Rev. Mr. Cowley. All of the foregoing establishments are independent of the Sunday schools in connection with the different churches.\n\nStatistics and enumeration of Churches, Congregations, Ministers, Stipends, and means of support.\n\n262. The following is a table of the Missionaries, Stations, Congregations, Income and sources of Income belonging to the Church of England, in Assiniboia.\n\n| Missionaries | Stations | Congregations | Income | Sources of Income | Remarks |\n|--------------|----------|---------------|--------|------------------|---------|\n| 1 The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Rupert's Land. | Red River.

St. John's church is in a very unstable condition, the walls being supported with wooden props. A large quantity of stone is now lying near it for the construction of a cathedral, which is estimated to cost \u00a35,000 sterling. St. Andrew's church, called also the Rapid's church, is a new and very substantial structure of stone, well buttressed, and very conveniently and neatly furnished; all its interior arrangements are attractive and substantial. It is surrounded by a thick stone wall enclosing a capacious churchyard. The parsonage house, also recently completed, is in every respect fitted for the severities of the winter climate of the country. The size is fifty feet by thirty, and two stories high; the walls, of limestone, are two feet eight inches thick, the rooms lofty and capacious, and in its internal arrangements it leaves nothing to be desired. The Rev. Mr. Kirkby's house is also roomy, and no doubt very comfortable, but its architectural points are far from being attractive. The school house of Word is admirably arranged, and in it I saw sixty children pursuing their studies under the instruction of Mr. Mayhew, lately from Dublin, with a decorum and attention very rarely to be found in the primary schools of this or the European continent.\n\nIndian Church.\u2014Indian School.\n\n264. The church at the Indian settlement is also a new and spacious building of stone, with a wall of the same material enclosing the church yard, in which is a wooden school house. Here also I saw about fifty Ojibway Indian young men, young women, and children receiving instructions from the Rev. Mr. Cowley, Mrs. Cowley, and a native schoolmaster. The young Indian women read the Testament in soft low voices, but with ease and intelligence. During service (Sunday, October 4th,) the church was about three-fourths full. The congregation appeared to be exclusively Indian; in their behaviour they were most decorous and attentive. The singing was very sweet, and all the forms of the service appeared to be understood, and practised quietly and in order by the dusky worshippers. A seraphino, played by Mrs. Cowley, accompanied the singers; the responses were well and exactly made, and the utmost attention was given to the sermon. The prayers were read in English, the lessons in Ojibway, and the sermon in Cree. After service an Indian child, neatly dressed in white, was baptised. A few of the women and girls wore bonnets, but the greater number drew their shawls over their heads.\n\nRev. Mr. Cowley.\u2014Novel Indian Night Bell.\n\n265. The minister and congregation suffer under the mutual disadvantage of being in great part separated by the river. The settlement is chiefly on the left, the church, school, and parsonage on the right bank of the river. A good scow, which will probably soon be procured, would enable the congregation to cross with ease. The Rev. Mr. Cowley enjoys no sinecure,\u2014he is not only missionary, but the doctor, magistrate, and arbitrator of the settlement. During my short visit of a day and a half, he was sent for three times to visit sick children, and he says that when the Indians require his services during the night, they come into the parsonage, the door of which is never locked, and tap gently at the stove-pipe, which passes from the sitting room into his bedroom above, to arouse him. They agreed among themselves that they would adopt this novel kind of night bell, and he has never known them to endeavour to call him after retiring to rest in any other way. They open the outer door and steal without the slightest noise, in the darkest night, to the well-known stove-pipe, give two or three low Indian taps, and quietly await the result.\n\nContrast between the Christianized Indians and the Heathens.\u2014Dog feasts within a mile and a half of Christian Congregations.\n\n266. A wonderful contrast do the subdued Indian worshippers in this missionary village furnish on Sunday, to the fiendish revellers on the open prairie, who perform their disgusting heathen ceremonies within a mile and a half of some of the Christian altars of Red River. On two Sundays during my stay, at the time when Divine service was being celebrated in all the churches of the settlement, the heathen Indians held their dog feasts and medicine dances on the open plain. In one instance five dogs were slaughtered, cooked, and devoured: in another instance three,\u2014the evil spirit was invoked, the conjuror's arts used to inspire his savage spectators with awe, and all the revolting ceremonies belonging to the most degraded heathen superstition practised within a mile and a half of the spot where the stones are now gathered for the Bishop of Rupert Land Cathedral, and about the same distance from two capacious churches, Protestant and Roman Catholic, where Divine service was at the same time being solemnized to orderly resident congregations.\n\nPeguis.\n\n267. I was introduced to Peguis, the great Salteaux chief, who at one time commanded three hundred warriors. He is now a quiet old man, a good Christian, and happy as he states in this belief.\n\nBaptisms at the Mission.\n\n268. Up to the day of my visit, October 4th, there had been fifty-one baptisms, exclusively Indian, in Mr. Cowley's mission, during 1857; and in the same period twenty-six deaths, six of whom were adults. The population of the mission in 1855 was 473 baptized Indians, and 208 heathens; four adult baptisms were celebrated in 1855.\n\nPrairie Portage.\u2014Mixed Congregations at Prairie Portage.\u2014How clothed.\n\n269. We now proceed to the Rev. Archdeacon Cochrane's church at Prairie Portage. It is constructed of wood, and contains twenty or thirty very substantial family seats, but capable of holding two or three times that number, each of which is manufactured by the owner, according to a pattern supplied by the Archdeacon. The congregation (Sunday 13th) was composed of Plain and Swampy Cree Indians and half-breeds. One Plain Cree woman's home was 300 miles to the west;\nshe was a fine specimen of the race, and neatly habited in the dress or the half breeds. Near the door of the church, inside the building, a number of heathen Indians from the prairies stationed themselves to indulge their curiosity; they remained quiet and grave, squatted on the floor, and conducted themselves with the utmost propriety during the service; they were Plain Crees, followers of the Buffalo hunters, with whom they had lately arrived from the high prairies; some were clothed in dressed skins, others robed in blankets, with neck and head decorations, and one young heathen girl, wild, and almost beautiful, triumphed in the splendour of a robe of scarlet military cloth. Who can say what benign influence the sight of Christian worshippers may have upon many of these savage children of the prairies, who saunter in during the services of the church, and with characteristic decorum always maintain a respectful demeanour, and grave and earnest look?\n\nCongregations at Red River.\u2014Indications of wealth among the Congregation.\n\n270. The churches in the settlement which I attended were St. John's and St. Paul's. The congregations consisted of resident and retired officers of the company, some merchants, farmers, and the natives or half breeds of the respective parishes. The services were conducted in strict accordance with the customary forms, and the demeanour of the congregation was most attentive and decorous. I remarked that a fair proportion of the congregation came to and went from church in neat carriages, or on horseback, and the external appearance of the assemblage, taken on a whole, in relation to dress, was superior to what we are accustomed to see in Canada, or in the country parishes of Great Britain. The young men wore handsome blue cloth frock coats, with brass buttons, and round their waist a long scarlet woollen sash.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church and Manse.\n\n271. The Upper Presbyterian Church is a neat building of stone, situated in the middle of the settlement. The cost of its erection exceeded 1,000L sterling, and it has sittings for 500. The manse is delightfully placed on the river bank, which here slopes uniformly to the water's edge from the great prairie level, some thirty feet above the river at the time of my visit. The Rev. Mr. Black has also a service in the lower settlement, in a church which I had not the opportunity of visiting.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of St. Boniface.\u2014Sweet toned bells of St. Boniface.\n\n272. By far the most imposing ecclesiastical building in the settlement is the Roman Catholic Church of St. Boniface, near Fort Garry. The external appearance is neither pleasing nor tasteful, although at a distance the two tinned spires glittering in the sunlight give an imposing appearance to the building. They can be seen from a great distance, and with the spire of St. James' Church on the Assiniboine, are well known landmarks. The internal decorations of St. Boniface, for so remote a region, are very striking, and must necessarily exercise a potent influence upon the large and singular congregation who worship every Sunday within its walls. Two or three very sweet toned bells ring at matins and vespers, and to a stranger just arrived from a long journey through unpeopled wastes, no sight or sound in Red River creates such surprise and melancholy pleasure as the sweet tones of the bells of St. Boniface, breaking the stillness of the morning or evening air.\n\nConvent and Garden.\n\n273. Near the church is a very spacious convent, having in front an extensive and well-cultivated garden, stocked with all kinds of culinary vegetables.\n\nRoman Catholic and Protestant Parishes.\n\n274. There is a distinct and well preserved difference in faith between the population of the different parishes into which the settlements are divided. Some are almost exclusively Protestant, others equally Roman Catholic. In the Parish of St. Norbert de la Rivi\u00e8re Sal, there is not one Protestant family, but 101 Roman Catholic families. In the Parish St. Boniface, there are 178 Roman Catholic families against five Protestant; so also in the parish of St. Fran\u00e7ois Xavier, on the Assiniboine, there are 175 Roman Catholics to three Protestant families. On the other hand, in the Parish of St. Peter's, there are 116 Protestant against two Roman Catholic families, and in the Parishes of Upper and Lower St. Andrew's, there are 206 Protestant against eight Roman Catholic families.\n\nAdmiration felt at the extent of the Home Charities.\u2014Nineteen Clergymen, Church of England, sustained in the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company's Territory by Home Societies.\u2014Little done by the Inhabitants for the support of the Clergy and the maintenance of Schools, or to the Christianizing of the Indians.\u2014Difficulty of the question.\u2014English Church services all conducted in the English tongue.\u2014Means of Communication with the Indians exist only to a very small extent.\u2014The reception of Stipends from Hudson's Bay Company necessarily cramps the action of the Missionaries.\u2014Missionaries should be independent.\n\n275. A very short stay in Red River is sufficient to create both admiration and surprise at what may not be amply termed the condition of religion in Assiniboina. Admiration is aroused by the extent and design of the charities of the different societies in England, who sustain such a large ecclesiastical corps in connexion with the Church of England as resident missionaries in the settlement, and who have contributed very munificently to the erection of the excellent churches which are now constructed; and in addition to these demands upon their liability, give large sums towards the maintenance of missions in different parts of Rupert's Land, so that at the present time there are scattered over this immense country nineteen clergymen of the Church of England, costing between 6,000L and 7,000L sterling annually. The Church Missionary Society have expended up to the date of their last report very nearly the sum of 50,000L sterling upon missionary operations in Rupert's Land. But surprise is created that while so much is done by those in England for charity's\nsake, so little is contributed by the wealthy residents of Red River (the retired factors of the Hudson's Bay Company, the merchants, traders, and better class of farmers) towards the maintenance of the clergy, the support and extension of schools, and to the Christianizing of the heathen Indians, whose medicine drum, accompanying the monstrous song of the conjuror, can almost always be heard in summer during the hours of service. Two-thirds of the salary of the Presbyterian minister is paid by his congregation, and the outward appearance of the congregations of the Episcopal churches, coming and going, as many of them do, in neat little carriages, or on horseback, from comfortable, well-furnished homes, would enforce the expectation that in proportion to their means they should at least endeavour to prepare the way for the spread of Christianity among the thousands of heathens who, in the course of a year, frequent the settlement. In the present condition of the country, with the interest of the fur trade to be upheld, this question is full of difficulty. The Indians must be accustomed to settle in one place for a few months of the year at least; schools must be founded and young children taught the truths of Christianity; missionaries must learn the Indian language; and then the spread of Christianity among the heathens may be in some degree commensurate with the charity which animates the different supporting societies in Great Britain and Ireland. In the settlements at Red River, and on the Assinibome, all the services are conducted in the English tongue, and among the clergy of the Church of England at Red River, but one only speaks one Indian language with the fluency and ease necessary to make himself understood by the natives. Of course the Indian mission below the settlements is not included in this enumeration. The Honourable Hudson's Bay Company continue to be very liberal in their support of missionaries as far as money is concerned: their contributions will be seen in the foregoing table; but the impression was irresistibly forced upon me, and I found it strongly felt by some residents in Red River, that the progress of Christianity among the Indians would be rather aided than otherwise if missionaries were not to receive any assistance in the form of an annual stipend from the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nPerfect freedom of action in inducing Indians to settle; in the education of Indian orphan children; and in teaching them and adults the blessings of a settled, civilized Christian home, as opposed to a savage heathen hunter's life, are essentially necessary before satisfactory progress can be made. Can the ministrations of the Church in the English tongue to orderly resident congregations of European, Canadian, or half-breed origin, be missionary labour in the sense in which that highest of all duties is understood by those who seek to spread the truths of Christianity among a most degraded and barbarous heathen race?\n\n276. The following extracts will show that the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company have lately increased their charges to missionaries for freight to the different ports:\n\nEXTRACT FROM NORTHERN DEPARTMENT\u2014MINUTES OF COUNCIL.\n\nWhereas the great increase in the number of missions dependent on the company for supplies renders it necessary to establish a special tariff for such supplies, which, while it protects the Company from actual loss, shall be as little burden to the mission as possible; it is resolved:\n\n277. That commencing with outfit 1855, the following prices to be chargeable on imported goods supplied to missions in the various districts of this department. The prices at the inland districts covering freight and charges from the depot, the advance being calculated in the net English prices, after deducting all charged, viz.:\u2014\n\nCharges to Missionaries for freight in 1854.\n\nAt York - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 75\nNorway House and Cumberland District - - - - - - - - - - - 80\nLac La Pluie, Swan River, Saskatchewan, and English River - - 90\nArthabasca and McKenzie's River - - - - - - - - - - - - 100\n\n278. That missionaries at inland districts who require supplies hand a list thereof to the officer in charge of the district in autumn, in sufficient time for him to make arrangements for, procuring them from the depot, and providing the necessary freight inland the following season.\n\nCOPY OF THE RESOLUTION OF COUNCIL FOR THE NORTHERN DEPARTMENT OUTFIT FOR 1856.\n\nCharges to Missionaries for freight in 1856.\n\nThat the 74th Minute of Council of 1855 be rescinded, and that commencing with October 1856, the following tariff be employed for sales to Missionaries:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\text{Ironworks, sugar, shot, and gunpowder on net prime cost} & \\text{75} & \\text{90} & \\text{100} \\\\\n\\text{Country made articles in depot cost} & 25 & 33\\frac{1}{3} & 50 \\\\\n\\text{All other goods on net prime cost} & 75 & 80 & 85\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nExceptions:\u2014Tobacco, liquors, and other articles at fixed prices to remain as at present.\nTRADE AND OCCUPATIONS.\n\nNo distinct branch of trade exists in the settlement.\u2014Grindstones imported.\n\n276. I inquired of Mr. Smith, under whose superintendence the census was taken, why no enumeration of trades and occupations was introduced into the census roll, and I was informed that no kind of industry or a distinct trade or occupation existed in the settlement. Almost every man was his own wheelwright, carpenter, or mason; carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, &c., could be found, but they were also engaged in other occupations, either as small farmers or hunters. Mr. Smith did not think that one man could be found in Assiniboia who pursued any particular trade or limited his industry to one special branch. The present condition of the settlements would not, it was thought, afford a living to any distinct class of artificers. A horseshoe imported from England could be purchased as cheap as the unmanufactured iron required to make one; every article, no matter of what description, was imported in its manufactured condition. Even the ponderous and unwieldy grindstone was conveyed across the portages from Hudson's Bay, although material well adapted for grindstones existed on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, not one hundred miles from Red River. Grindstones had, I was informed upon authority I could not doubt, been made from the rock in question, and brought to the settlement, but they could not compete commercially with those imported by the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, which, for a time, were sold little above cost, even after their long and expensive journey.\n\nWindmills and Watermills.\u2014Articles of Pottery imported.\u2014Growing trade between the settlements and St. Paul's.\u2014Caravans on the road to St. Paul's.\n\n277. Sixteen windmills and nine watermills represent the mechanical force employed in preparing food. I did not see, nor did I hear of a saw mill, boards being prepared by hand; even articles of pottery, notwithstanding their fragile nature, are imported. I did not hear of any articles of that description being manufactured in the settlement. In a word it may be said that trades and occupations as representing special branches of industry do not exist in Assiniboia. Under the head of merchant shops, we find no less than fifty-six enumerated in the last census, a heading which it will be observed is not represented in the census of 1849. In fact, the class of merchants, including petty traders, has almost sprung into existence during the last ten years. They obtained their goods chiefly from the States at St. Paul's on the Mississippi, and purchase them in exchange for gold or peltries. As this trade with the United States is fast growing into importance, and from the immense extent of frontier not easily checked by fiscal regulations, and as its continuance must affect to a most serious extent the position of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company in the valley of Lake Winnipeg, I thought it worth while to pay especial attention to the caravans, which were met upon the road from St. Paul's to Red River, and to note, when possible, the character of the supplies they were conveying.\n\nCaravan of Carts.\u2014Alcohol and Whiskey imported.\n\n278. Near Turtle Creek, in Minnesota, on Friday, October 16th, met a caravan of nine carts going to Red River settlement from St. Paul's. Their freight consisted of one large box of books for the Roman Catholic mission, a moving machine, a fifty gallon barrel of alcohol, numerous kegs of whiskey, some kegs of gunpowder, a cooking stove, some hardware and dry goods in boxes and cases for trading purposes. The cask containing alcohol was branded as such, with the maker's name, as also were the whiskey kegs.\n\nSix Carts.\n\n279. Saturday, October 17th, met a caravan of six carts from St. Paul's, bound for Red River Settlement; they were the property of the drivers, who belonged to the class of petty traders. Their goods consisted of ploughs, stoves, whiskey, dry goods, scythes, &c. This was their second trip this summer.\n\nCaravan of sixteen Carts.\n\nTuesday, October the 20th, met a caravan of sixteen carts, from St. Paul's, bound to St. Joseph's on the 49th parallel, laden with sugar, powder, and dry goods, for trading purposes.\n\nCaravan of thirty Carts.\n\nBetween Crow Wing and St. Paul's, met two caravans, containing in all thirty carts, bound for the Red River. Their contents could not be seen. They were covered with buffalo robes or oil cloth.\n\nMerchants import from England.\n\n280. Some of the merchants at Red River import largely from England by the Company's vessels, and almost any article of common necessity or ornament can be procured at the stores, which, by the way, are of the rudest description, without the least pretension to display the wares, but rather showing an endeavour to conceal from outward view whatever goods they may contain.\nFreighters.\n\n281. Besides being merchant or trader, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, some of them are freighters, conveying goods between Hudson's Bay and the Valley of Lake Winnipeg. They employ Indians and half breeds to row their boat of three to five tons burden, and haul them and their freights over the portages. Fifty-five of these boats are enumerated in the census as belonging to Red River, but whether the Hudson's Bay Company's fleet is included in the number is not stated. The employment of Indians by the freighters has, at times, given rise to some little difficulty between them and the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, as introducing a species of industry not compatible with a hunter's pursuit, and likely to divert attention from the great objects of the fur trade.\n\n282. Among numerous documents, which are in the possession of many of the most respectable people of Red River, treasured up, perhaps, as memorials of bygone but not forgotten difficulties in gaining a livelihood by pursuits not connected with the fur trade or its interests, the following brief note may or may not possess some little historic interest, and if rightly understood and interpreted, offer a clue to the present condition of the Red River settlements, and of the Indian missionary stations.\n\nSir G. Simpson on the employment of Indians by freighters, in 1844.\n\nSir,\n\nFort Garry, June 5, 1844.\n\nI am informed that private freighters from Red River frequently employ and afford passages to Indians along the line of communication to York Factory in their boats, which is highly objectionable in many points of view. I have therefore to desire you will not in future receive as passengers, or employ Indians in your craft, on the line of communication between York and Red River.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) G. SIMPSON.\n\nMr. Edward Mowat.\n\n&c. &c.\n\nCopied, July 30, 1844.\n\n(Signed) A.\n\nTENURE OF LAND.\n\nLand sometimes sold.\u2014Title given in the form of a lease.\u2014Conditions of sale.\u2014Cannot sell or let their land without the permission of the Company.\n\n283. Land in Assiniboia is sometimes sold to purchasers at the rate of 7s. 6d. sterling per acre. The title is conveyed under the form of a lease for 999 years. The conditions in the lease are, 1st. That one-tenth of the land is to be brought into cultivation within five years; 2nd. That trading or dealing with Indians or others so as to violate the chartered privileges of the Company, be forsworn; 3rd. Obedience to all laws of the Company; 4th. Contributions to expenses of public establishments in due proportion; 5th. All trade or traffic in any kind of skins, furs, peltry, or dressed leather, except under licence of the Company, forbidden; 6th. Land not to be disposed of or let, or assigned without the consent of the Company. These are the main features of the lease, the document is long, otherwise it would have been inserted in full.\n\nMany settlers do not possess a lease.\u2014Many settlers in occupation of land have no title to show.\n\n284. It is necessary here to remark that I did not see this lease in the hands of any one of the settlers of whom I made inquiries respecting their tenure. I heard of its existence, and saw a copy, through one of the resident clergy, but in no single instance could I find any half-breed, in possession of a farm, acquainted with its existence. In very many instances the settlers did not know the number of their lots, and had no paper or document of any kind to show that they held possession of their land from the Company, or any other authority. These inquiries were necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the exact position of a line of section across the valley of Red River, which I caused to be made for the purpose of ascertaining the level of the swamps, &c. The required information was obtained through Mr. Smith, the Clerk of the Council, but from the people themselves no information of the kind could be obtained. They knew that they had paid a certain sum for their land, or it had been given them in return for services, or that they had squatted upon it, and that they were now in possession, but of title-deeds or receipts they knew nothing. These remarks refer only to those from whom the information was sought for the purposes mentioned above.\n\nCompany's register.\u2014Curious Titles to Farms.\n\n285. I had an opportunity of seeing and examining the Company's record of land sales, and presents of land to different individuals for services performed, being in fact the register of the settlements on Red River and the Assiniboine. In general the price per acre was attached to each record of sale or transfer, but in some instances rather curious titles to farms were recorded, two of which I have thought it might be interesting to re-produce.\n\n| On Plat. | Prairie | Acres.

When passing from Fort Garry towards the 49th parallel with a view to explore the Roseau River, our guide pointed out a number of hay stacks occupying a delightful bend on the west side of Red River, about twenty-five miles from the settlements; he informed us that the hay stacks were made by himself and some friends, a few weeks ago, and that they intended to \"move there\" during\nthe winter and form a new settlement. I inquired how much he had paid for his land; the reply was \"Nothing; we are not required to pay anything for land beyond the present limits of settlements on the river.\" I may add that many hundred thousand acres of land, which cannot be surpassed for fertility, rich prairie mould from eighteen inches to two feet deep, lie free and unoccupied on the banks of Red River and its tributaries, inviting settlement.\n\n### Table No. 1.\u2014A Statistical Account of Red River Colony, taken on the 20th to the 24th May, 1856.\n\n| Year | Number of Families | Age | Religion | Country | Population | Total |\n|------|-------------------|-----|----------|---------|------------|-------|\n|      |                   |     |          |         |            |       |\n| 1856 |                   |     |          |         |            |       |\n| 1856 | 1,082             | 5   | 243      | 276     | 220        | 153   |\n|      |                   |     | 83       | 38      | 15         | 4     |\n|      |                   |     | 488      | 60      | 534        | 4012  |\n|      |                   |     | 116      | 92      | 1          | 316   |\n|      |                   |     | 2         | 2       | 237        | 292   |\n|      |                   |     | 208      | 261     | 1,451      | 1,557 |\n|      |                   |     | 3,225    | 3,298   | 6,323      |       |\n| 1849 | 1,062             | 5   | 240      | 253     | 227        | 170   |\n|      |                   |     | 92       | 37      | 14         | 530   |\n|      |                   |     | 161      | 684     | 2           | 873   |\n|      |                   |     | 145      | 877     | 135        | 1,352 |\n|      |                   |     | 1,316    | 1,373   | 2,691      |       |\n| Increase | 30 | 5   | 3        | 24      | 7         | 17    |\n| Decrease | -   | 7   | 17       | 7       | 1          | 51    |\n| *1843 | 870              |     |          |         |            |       |\n| R.

These hardy and fearless children of the prairie constitute a race to which much interest may reasonably be attached. They are endowed with remarkable qualities, which they derive in great part from their Indian descent, softened and improved by the admixture of the European element. It is, however, much to be regretted that from the singular necessities of their position, many of them are fast subsiding into the primitive Indian state; naturally improvident, and perhaps indolent, they prefer the wild life of the prairies to the tamer duties of a settled home; this is the character of the majority, and belongs more to those of French descent than of Scotch or English origin.\n\nThe Summer Hunt of the Buffalo.\n\n288. About the 15th of June they start for their summer hunt of the buffalo. There are now two distinct bands of buffalo hunters, one being those of Red River, the other of the White Horse Plain, on the Assiniboine. Formerly these bands were united, but, owing to a difference which sprung up between them, they now maintain a separate organization, and proceed to different hunting grounds. The Red River hunters go to the Yellow Stone and Coteau de Missouri; the White Horse Plain settlers generally hunt between the branches of the Saskatchewan, but also over the same grounds as their Red River brethren.\n\nImprovidence of the Half-breeds.\n\n289. The improvidence of many of the French half-breeds is remarkable. During the winter before the last, those of the White Horse Plain camped out on the distant prairies, and killed thousands upon thousands of buffalo, in wanton revelry, taking only their skins and tongues, little caring that the reckless destruction of these animals must probably exercise a very important change for the worse in their own condition. As the buffalo diminish and go farther away towards the Rocky Mountains, the half-breeds are compelled to travel much greater distances in search of them, and consume more time in the hunt; it necessarily follows that they have less time to devote to farming, and many of them can be regarded in no other light than men slowly subjecting themselves to a process of degradation by which they approach nearer and nearer to Indian habits and character, relinquishing the civilized but to them unrequited pursuit of agriculture, for the wild excitement and precarious independence of a hunter's life. The fascination of a camp in the high prairies, compared with the hitherto almost hopeless monotony of the farms of Red River, can easily be understood by those who have tasted the careless freedom of prairie life. I was often told that the half-breeds are always sighing for the hunting season when in the settlements, and form but a feeble attachment to a settled home, which to the great majority can never offer, it is said, under present circumstances, a comfortable living, and much less a reasonable maintenance, or the consciousness of possessing a free and manly spirit, with rational aspirations and hopes.\n\nPoliteness of the French Half-breeds.\n\n290. The politeness of the French half-breeds is quite delightful in these distant regions. On meeting, they shake hands and immediately raise the cap. Mr. Pierre Gladieux, before referred to, is an excellent example of the better class of French half-breeds in Red River. A brief description of the manner in which I was treated by this gentleman may serve to show the genuine character of the hospitality and politeness with which strangers are received by the half-breeds of French extraction. I arrived at his house with Mr. Fleming, a guide, and two men from an exploration of the Roseau River, some hours after sunset, on the evening of September the 29th. We were provided with an excellent supper, and our horses, seven in number, well supplied with hay in the yard. Before starting next morning an almost sumptuous breakfast was given to us, and while the horses were being saddled, I begged permission to see the farm-yard, &c. Under a small shed there was a neat, light, four-wheeled buggy, which as we passed Mr. Gladieux very politely and kindly placed at my disposal during the remaining period of my stay at Red River. He remarked that on the morrow he was going to the plains to hunt buffalo, and should not require the buggy for several weeks after my proposed departure. I requested the guide to ask what I had to pay for the entertainment of the party. The polite answer returned was as follows:\u2014Nothing; it is not the custom of the people of this country to charge strangers who may honour them with a visit.\n\nKind of aid required to ameliorate the condition of the Half-breed Hunters.\u2014Savings Bank.\n\n291. But few simple aids are required at Red River to ameliorate and vastly improve the condition of the more improvident and careless half-breeds. They frequently bring in a large quantity of buffalo meat or robes to the trading posts, and receive a large sum of money in exchange, or if they insist upon it, a certain quantity of rum. The money is spent at once in simple necessaries, dress, and ornaments. The establishment of a savings bank would have an excellent effect, and doubtless become the source of much permanent good, with other objects in view than those incident to the exclusive prosecution of the fur trade.\nTHE BUFFALO HUNTERS IN THE FIELD.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Belcourt's description of the condition of some of the Half-breed Hunters.\n\n292. I introduce the following description of the organization of the buffalo hunters when in the field, with a brief extract from a communication to Mr. Schoolcroft, by the Rev. Mr. Belcourt, a Roman Catholic clergyman, then resident at Red River, but now I believe living at the new settlement of St. Joseph's, about 100 miles south-west of Fort Garry. This extract contains a simple statement, from which a fair knowledge of the present condition of some half-breeds, and probable future condition of many, may be easily gleaned. \"I should first remark that the autumnal hunt engages the attention of comparatively few men, for the following reasons: a portion of the half-breeds, who have not the means of passing the winter in the settlement, spread over that part of the country where they can subsist themselves and families during the cold weather by the chase of the elk, the moose, and the bear. Others, hoping to reap more profit by trapping the fur-bearing animals, seek the haunts of the marten, the fisher, the otter, the beaver, in the wooded regions and along the water-courses and lakes, so that ordinarily not more than one-third assemble for the fall hunt of the buffalo.\"\n\nThe Buffalo Hunters.\u2014Their organization.\u2014Laws and regulations.\n\n293. The following information was given me by Mr. Flett, who resides on the Assiniboine River, and at whose house I was very hospitably entertained. The start is made from the settlement about the 15th of June for the summer hunt, and the hunters remain in the prairie till the 20th August or 1st of September. One division (the White Horse Plain) goes by the Assiniboine River to the rapids, crossing, and then proceed in a south-westerly direction. The other, or Red River division, pass on to Pembina, and then also proceed in a southerly direction. The two divisions sometimes meet, but not intentionally. In Mr. Flett's division, in 1849, there were, according to a census taken near the Chiefs' Mountain, not far from the Strayenne River, Dacotah territory, 603 carts, 700 half-breeds, 200 Indians, 600 horses, 200 oxen, 400 dogs, and one cat. After the start from the settlement had been well made, and all stragglers or tardy hunters were thought to have arrived, a great council was held, and a president elected. A number of captains were nominated by the president and people jointly. The captains then proceeded to appoint their own policemen, the number assigned to each not exceeding ten. Their duty is to see that the laws of the hunt are strictly carried out. In 1849, if a man ran a buffalo without permission before the general hunt began, his saddle and bridle were cut to pieces for the first offence; for the second offence of the same description, his clothes were cut off his back. At the present day these punishments are changed to a fine of 20s. for the first offence. No gun is permitted to be fired when in the buffalo country before the \"race\" begins. A priest sometimes goes with the hunt, and mass is then celebrated in the open prairies. At night the carts are placed in the form of a circle, with the horses and cattle inside the ring, and it is the duty of the captains and their policemen to see that this is rightly done. All laws are proclaimed in camp, and relate to the hunt alone. All camping orders are given by signals, a flag being carried by the guides, who are appointed by election. Each guide has his turn of one day, and no man can pass a guide on duty without subjecting himself to a fine of 5s. No hunter can leave the camp to return home without permission, and no one is permitted to stir until any animal or property of value supposed to be lost is recovered. The policemen, at the order of the captains, can seize any cart at night-fall and place it where they choose for the public safety, but on the following morning they are compelled to bring it back from the spot from which they moved it the evening previous. This power is very necessary, in order that the horses may not be stampeded by night attacks of the Sioux or other Indian tribes at war with the half-breeds. A heavy fine is imposed in case of neglect in extinguishing fires when the camp is broken up in the morning. In sight of buffaloes, all the hunters are drawn up in line, the president, captains, and police being a few yards in advance, restraining the impatient hunters. Not yet! not yet! is the cry of the president; the approach to the herd is cautiously made. Now! and as the word leaves the lips of the president, the charge is made, and in a few minutes the excited half-breeds are among the bewildered buffalo.\n\nPower of the Half-breed Hunters.\u2014Their Independence.\n\n294. The half-breed hunters, with their splendid organization when on the prairies, their matchless power of providing themselves with all necessary wants for many months together, and now since a trade with the Americans has sprung up, if they should choose, for years, their perfect knowledge of the country, and their full appreciation and enjoyment of a home in the prairie wilds, winter or summer, would render them a very formidable enemy in case of disturbance or open rebellion against constituted authorities. The half-breed hunters of Red River could pass into the open prairies at a day's notice, and find themselves perfectly at home and secure, where white men, not accustomed to such a life, would soon become powerless against them, and exposed to continued peril.\n\nWhat is the cause of the decline of the Half-breeds.\n\n295. The causes which have led to the present condition and prospects of this people are truly a painful subject. It is one which cannot escape the attention and care of philanthropists. Men will inquire how it is that a race, giving evidence of admirable discipline, self-government, and courage, when in the open prairies, should subside into indifferent and indolent husbandmen when in the settlements. Considered as the native population of Red River, how is it, will it be asked, that so few among the many have succeeded in the course of years in acquiring comfortable homesteads, and well-stocked granaries and farmyards? and why has the European and Canadian element disappeared? The chances of nearly all have been equal, land of admirable fertility everywhere surrounds them, with unsurpassed advantages for rearing horses, cattle, and sheep, yet little or no progress has been made; and in respect of sheep, which might soon in a measure supply the place of the buffalo, a serious diminution in numbers has taken place. It is true, that within the last few years many hundred head of cattle have been driven across the prairies of Minnesota to St. Paul's, and sold well there. But this new export trade should have given encouragement to raising stock, yet stock with unlimited pasture\nis diminishing. The distant hunt consumes the time which might be given to far more profitable home industry, and those who really enjoy a settled life, and know the advantages which industry confers, from experience gained in Canada or Europe, leave the country and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\n\nNo Signs of Improvement visible.\n\n296. Every stranger is struck with surprise that the houses of half-breed hunters show no signs of recent improvement, show no signs of care and attention devoted to gardens, or the cultivation of fruit. Plums grow wild in the forest, but none are seen in the settlements. Apple trees are only now beginning to be tried at the Stone Fort. No effort of manufacturing industry is visible, beyond the windmills for grinding wheat.\n\nThis Decline observed by the Half-breeds.\n\n297. It must not be supposed that this stationary, or rather retrograde condition, is unnoticed by the mass of the people; they see the comfort by which the retired factors, the clergy, and the traders of the settlement are surrounded, and the comparative luxury which exists at the forts; but they do not rightly understand how their own condition might be remedied, for the majority cannot discover in what way the reward of industry may be won, or where a market for labour is to be found, except that kind of wild labour in the distant prairie, or in the woods, which they love instinctively, and which they have always been taught to consider most profitable, and alone capable of securing their comfort and happiness. Under such circumstances it cannot cause surprise that discontent prevails in the settlements. Much disappointment and dissatisfaction is everywhere seen, and wrongs, real or imaginary, for which they have no redress, form the constant subject of complaint in daily conversation. In these repinings, all who are not in the service of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company, or in some way connected with them, as far as my experience enabled me to judge, uniformly agreed.\n\nCondition of the Half-breeds no Criterion of the Fitness of the Country to support a prosperous People.\n\n298. Let the condition of the half-breed hunters generally be contrasted with the present prosperity of Mr. Gowler, Mr. Gladieux, Mr. Flett, the McCays, and several others that might be named, who farm with industry and economy, and the capabilities of Red River and the Assiniboine will not be overlooked in surveying the paralyzed efforts of those who are taught to rely chiefly upon the hunter's precarious gains.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nThe Climate of the Valley of the Red River.\u2014Climate \"excessive;\" spring and summer frosts rare; the melon and Indian corn excellent recorders, 299\u2014Summer at Red River nearly 4\u00b0 warmer than at Toronto, 300\u2014Explanation of the richness of the prairies, 300\u2014Mean temperature and summer months nearly one degree higher at Red River than at Toronto, 301\u2014Table of comparison of the meteorology of Red River with Toronto for corresponding months, 309\u2014Natural division of the seasons at Red River, 303\u2014Comparison between the annual mean at Red River and places in Europe, Quebec, and Red River, 304\u2014Summer temperatures, 305\u2014Summer climate at Red River admirably fitted for agricultural purposes, 306\u2014Winter climate, cold intense and of long duration, 307\u2014Salubrity of the climate, 308\u2014Meteorological Register.\u2014Daily register, monthly means, annual mean, monthly fall of rain and snow.\u2014Progress of the seasons.\n\nTHE CLIMATE OF THE VALLEY OF THE RED RIVER.\n\nClimate \"excessive.\"\u2014Early Spring and Autumn Frosts rare.\u2014The Melon and Indian Corn excellent Recorders.\n\n299. The climate of the valley of Red River exhibits the extremes of many characteristics which belong to the interior of continents in corresponding latitudes. High summer temperatures, with winter cold of extraordinary severity appear to prevail in Assiniboia, as in the interior of North-eastern Europe and Asia. It cannot fail to be noticed, however, that the general absence of late spring and early autumn frosts, with an abundant fall of rain during the agricultural months, are the distinguishing features of the climate of the valley of Red River. The melon growing in the open air, and arriving at perfect maturity in August and September, Indian corn succeeding invariably, when due precautions are used to ensure ripening before the middle of September, are strong proofs of the almost uniform absence of summer frosts.\n\nSummer at Red River nearly 4\u00b0 warmer than at Toronto.\u2014Explanation of the Richness of the Prairies.\n\n300. A comparison with the climate of Toronto for corresponding months of the years 1855 and 1856 reveals some very curious and interesting facts, which may possess considerable importance. Limiting our attention at present to the summer months, we find from inspection of the following table of comparison, that the summer of Red River is nearly four degrees warmer than the summer at Toronto, and with this remarkable excess of temperature we find the unexpected difference of 21.74 inches of rain in favour of Red River. These meteorological facts explain the wonderful richness of the prairie vegetation, and the vast accumulation of vegetable matter which is now found there.\n\nMean of Spring and Summer Months nearly 1\u00b0 higher at Red River than at Toronto.\n\n301. The small difference between the temperature of the spring at Toronto and Red River is another interesting fact. While the summer shows an excess of 3.78, the spring gives a deficiency of 2.83, so that the mean of the spring and summer months at Red River is nearly one degree higher than the corresponding months of Toronto. No feature in the meteorology of this distant region is likely to excite so much interest as the extraordinary fall of rain during the agricultural months. It is well known that the cause of the sterility of a vast region on the east of the Rocky Mountains, within the limits of the United States, is traced to extreme aridity. The great American desert, which places so vast a barrier between the Mississippi valley and the west flank of the Rocky Mountains, derives its barrenness from the absence of rain during the summer months. A fall of thirty inches in\nthe valley of Red River during the summer of 1855, with a corresponding fall of 8.76 at Toronto, shows the remarkable difference in the humidity of the two places, and one which report states is generally maintained in other years.\n\nComparison of the Meteorology of Red River with Toronto for corresponding Months.\n\n302.

In the foregoing table the seasons are composed of the months which long custom has assigned to these arbitrary divisions of the year, but certainly the natural division of the seasons for the climate of the Red River would appear to be as follows:\n\n- Summer - June, July, August.\n- Autumn - September, October.\n- Winter - November, December, January, February and March.\n- Spring - April and May.\n\nComparison between the Annual Mean at Red River and Places in Europe.\u2014Quebec and Red River.\n\n304. Assuming that the annual mean of 34\u00b0 38', deduced from the following tables, is within one or two degrees of what would be the results of several years' observation, we find upon inspection of Dove Tables that there is not one locality within the limits of the United States where so low an annual mean attains. At Kasaw (Russia) lat. 55\u00b0 48' long. 47\u00b0 7', the mean of ten years was 35\u00b0 45', and the difference between the hottest and coldest months 61\u00b0 33', while at Red River the difference was 82\u00b0 15'. The difference between summer and winter at Kasaw was 56\u00b0 0'; at Red River 74\u00b0 61'. At Ozenburg lat. 50\u00b0 46', or in nearly the same latitude as that part of Red River Settlement where these observations were made, and in long. 55\u00b0 6' the annual mean is 35\u00b0 6'; the difference between the hottest and coldest months 66\u00b0 38', and the difference between winter and summer 59\u00b0 66'. The following table will exhibit this relation at a glance:\n\n| Latitude | Longitude | Annual Mean | Difference between Hottest and Coldest Months | Difference between Summer and Winter |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Red River Settlement | 50.15 | \u2014 | 34\u00b0 38 | 82\u00b0 15 | 74\u00b0 61 |\n| Kasaw | 55.48 | 47.7 E. | 35\u00b0 45 | 61\u00b0 33 | 56\u00b0 00 |\n| Ozenburg | 50.46 | 55.6 E. | 35\u00b0 06 | 66\u00b0 38 | 59\u00b0 66 |\nAt Quebec the difference between the hottest and coldest month is $60^\\circ 75'$; at Red River Settlement $82^\\circ 15'$, or $21^\\circ 40'$ in excess. At Port Snelling the difference is $61^\\circ 89'$, or about one degree more than Quebec.\n\nAt Quebec the difference between the mean temperature of summer and winter is $53^\\circ 93'$, at Fort Snelling $56^\\circ 81'$, and at Red River Settlement $74^\\circ 61'$.\n\n**Summer Temperature at Red River.**\u2014Comparison between the Summer Temperature at Red River with Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto.\n\n305. The summer temperature of Red River, and the absence of frosts during that season, determine its fitness for agricultural purposes. The following table exhibits a comparison between the summer temperature of the settlement and various other well known places in Canada:\n\n| Summer temperature at Red River Settlement | - | - | - | 67.76 |\n|--------------------------------------------|---|---|---|-------|\n| Montreal, Canada                           | - | - | - | 66.62 |\n| Quebec                                     | - | - | - | 62.91 |\n| Toronto                                    | - | - | - | 63.98 |\n\nSummer Climate of Red River admirably fitted for Agricultural Purposes.\n\n306. The adaptation of the climate of the valley of Red River to the ordinary purposes of husbandry, during the agricultural season, scarcely requires further notice. It is sufficient to state that the conditions of temperature and humidity appear to be as favourable as those enjoyed in many parts of Canada or the north-eastern States of the Union.\n\n**Winter Climate.**\u2014Cold intense and of long Duration.\n\n307. The prevailing characters of the winter months are long continued intense cold, with a clear dry atmosphere. Mercury often freezes, and remains congealed for many days together. In calm weather exposure to such intense cold is not described as producing inconvenience or suffering, and when the wind is blowing the cold is rarely so intense. The half-breeds, and of course the Indians, camp out in the open plain during the whole winter, and the only protection they enjoy consists of a buffalo skin tent and an abundance of buffalo robes.\n\nSalubrity of the Climate.\u2014Preceding Comparisons refer to corresponding Observations.\n\n308. The salubrity of the climate of Red River is indicated by the extent of professional services in the settlements. One medical man, not overburdened with work, to a population nearly reaching 7,000, may be accepted as a fair standard by which to estimate their sanitary condition. It will be understood that the foregoing comparisons refer to corresponding months of the same years, and are of course liable to those annual fluctuations to which the climatic elements of all countries are subject. It is very probable that more extended observations will reduce the extremes.\n\n**Meteorological Register** for the Year beginning on 1st June, 1855 and ending on 31st May 1856.\n\nBy Donald Gunn, Red River Settlement, Rupert's Land.\n\n**Meteorgical Register, Red River Settlement.**\n\n**June 1855.**\n\n| Day of the Month | Thermometer | Remarks |\n|------------------|-------------|---------|\n|                  | 7 A.M.      | 2 P.M.  | 9 P.M. | Average |         |\n| 1                | 58          | 64      | 72     | 64\u00bd     | No clouds. |\n| 2                | 57          | 68      | 58     | 61      | Wind light; a few scattered white clouds. |\n| 3                | 59          | 72      | 58     | 63      | Clear and calm. |\n| 4                | 60          | 72      | 58     | 63\u00bd     | Sky overcast; light variable wind. |\n| 5                | 58          | 63      | 59     | 60      | Few drops of rain. |\n| 6                | 63          | 68      | 58     | 63      | A fringe of clouds round horizon; clear towards zenith. |\n| 7                | 58          | 78      | 58     | 64\u00bd     | Light and few clouds. |\n| 8                | 56          | 76      | 74     | 63\u00bd     | Blew pretty strongly in the height of the day. |\n| 9                | 54          | 70      | 62     | 62      | The wind rose about 10 A.M., and blew a stiff breeze; a few clouds in the height of the day. |\n| 10               | 66          | 76      | 48     | 63\u00bd     | Blowing freshly from 8 A.M. to 7 P.M.; very few clouds. |\n| 11               | 58          | 68      | 54     | 60      | Light breeze. |\n| 12               | 68          | 82      | 76     | 75\u00bd     | Clear and calm day. |\n| 13               | 76          | 82      | 76     | 76\u00bd     | In the morning light clouds; in the afternoon overcast. |\n| 14               | 72          | 88      | 71     | 77      | In the morning overcast; evening clear. |\n| 15               | 66          | 92      | 71     | 76\u00bd     | Calm and without clouds all day. |\n| 16               | 71          | 82      | 68     | 73\u00bd     | Fire in the forests on east side of the lake; few clouds. |\n| 17               | 70          | 86      | 74     | 76\u00bd     | Calm, thick clouds near the horizon; one inch of rain fell to-day. |\n| 18               | 66          | 82      | 72     | 73\u00bd     | Wind light and variable; the air very sultry; thunder.

Wheat sown in the beginning of May was in the ear on the 13th July, and ripe on the 20th August. The wheat sown on the 29th April was ripe on the 14th August. The hottest day this last summer was the 20th of July. Barley harvest commenced in July; finished cutting wheat on the 28th August; slight frost on the 30th of the same month; potatoes taken up first week of October.\n\n6th September. Flocks of grey geese flying to the south. Premus Americana ripe and very plentiful in the first part of this month, or rather before this month. Flocks of passenger pigeons are in from the north, and leave from the 20th to the last of the month. On the night of the 7th whip-poor-will gave us his parting song. Corogonus Lucidus enter the river to spawn. The corogonus albus in Lake Winnipeg commence spawning about the 10th of October, and end about the 1st November.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE APPROACHES TO THE VALLEY OF LAKE WINIPEG.\u2014THE ROUTE VIA ST. PAUL, CROW WING, AND PEMBINA.\n\nKind of Attention the Valley of Lake Winnipeg will attract.\n\n309. The valley of Lake Winnipeg is separated from the valleys of Mississippi and St. Lawrence by extensive barriers, which have hitherto been instrumental in preserving it from the approach and\nintrusion of civilized races. The time has now arrived when this secluded region is likely to attract a wide spread attention, and inquiry will naturally be turned not only to its own resources, but to its relations in point of geographical position, means of communication with the commercial world, and the opportunities it may supply for establishing a direct line of communication across the continent of America between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nDimensions of the Valley of the Saskatchewan.\n\n310. The Saskatchewan and the Red Rivers of the north drain an area exceeding 400,000 square miles, and that part of it included within the British Territory lies between the 49th and 55th parallels of latitude, and the 93rd and 115\u00b0 of longitude west of Greenwich, a European area similarly situated east of the 10th degree of longitude would comprehend very nearly the whole of England and Ireland, part of the German Ocean, the English channel, the north-eastern corner of France, the whole of Belgium and Holland, and the greater part of the valley of the Rhine, together with the Kingdom of Hanover.*\n\n311. The routes by which access is obtained to this great valley lie in the courses of three different water sheds. First: the Hudson Bay routes from the Ocean, inaccessible on account of ice during nine and sometimes ten months in the year. Second: the Lake Superior route, via Rainy Lake. Third: the Mississippi valley route, from St. Paul's to Red River. As it is not at all probable that the Hudson Bay routes will ever be selected as permanent means of communication between the great valley and Canada or the United States, further reference to them is unnecessary. The Lake Superior route is described in the foregoing report, and it now remains to glance at the communication with the United States via Crow Wing and St. Paul's. This will best be accomplished by a short descriptive narrative in the form of a daily journal of the journey from Fort Garry to Crow Wing.\n\nPembina.\u2014Village of St. Joseph.\n\n312. On the 19th of October we camped at Pembina, near the mouth of the river of the same name. Whatever may have been the former condition of this village, it is now only a small and scattered collection of log houses situated on the right bank of Red River, in the new territory of Dacotah. The ruins of several good houses, formerly occupied by the Roman Catholic mission, are still to be seen, but in all other respects the town or village and port of Pembina exist only on paper. The few log houses which have given a name and a certain reputation to this village, derived probably from its being a frontier post of far more pretensions than at the present time, still serve for an excuse to attract public attention to the fancied progress of the Americans on this part of the Red River valley. In the late returns for the election of officers in the new State of Minnesota (October 1857), the names of many resident voters are recorded, but it would be a matter of great difficulty to discover their abode now. Some United States dragoons, forming part of an exploring party camped near Pembina two years ago, gave rise to a report which has often appeared in print and on maps, that Pembina is a post garrisoned by United States troops, instead of being a small village containing about a dozen scattered log houses. About a day's journey west of Pembina, the village of St. Joseph is situated, in the territory of Dacotah, and close to the boundary line. It was founded by the Red River half-breeds, who, as I was informed, were induced to settle there to escape the floods of Red River, from which they had suffered or anticipated severe losses. The village has already acquired considerable importance as a depot for the articles of trade, which are brought by the citizens of the United States from St. Paul's.\n\nCountry about Pembina.\u2014Character of the Prairies.\u2014Fires in the West.\n\n313. The country about Pembina is very fertile and beautiful. On the west the flanks of the Coteau de Missouri, before noticed, are seen about thirty miles distant, and limit the valley of the river in that direction. On the east side of the river our course lay through a beautiful level prairie dotted with willow bushes for about nineteen miles in a south-east direction, when we struck the first of the \"Deux Rivi\u00e8res;\" at sunset crossed the river and camped, having travelled twenty-two miles. A very perceptible change in the character of the prairie was observed the next day, on approaching Pine River; the soil consisted of a light vegetable mould; and wherever rain had fallen and collected in little hollows, sand showed itself. Hummocks of aspen and willow relieved the sameness of the scenery; and a distinct rise by ridges, at the base of which the river flowed, was easily recognized. Pine River at the crossing place is about twenty-five\u2020 broad; the current rapid. Between Pine River and Rock River the soil preserves its light character, the trail runs for many miles on ancient lake ridges or beaches which are similar in every respect to those observed between the Roseau and Fort Garry. Last night, 13th October, was cold and fine; a few grasshoppers still lingered on the prairies, and their eggs in many places lay in vast numbers on the surface of the ground. The day was beautiful and warm, and, as night approached, the sky in the north-west began to assume a ruddy tinge, and finally a lurid red, produced by the fires in the rich prairies beyond Stony Mountains, at least ninety miles in an air line from Pine River, where we camped.\n\n314. Wednesday, 14th. During the morning we travelled along an ancient lake ridge, doubtless a continuation of one of those which appear some miles east of the settlements on Red River. The ridge is cut by Rock and Serpent Rivers. Prairie hens were seen in great abundance, and numerous flocks of wild geese passed over head. Near Pine River we met the mail borne on the back of a half-breed, who was accompanied by a boy, fifteen or sixteen years old, carrying the blankets and cooking utensils. The mail bearer was ill, and had had no food for two days, having been longer on his journey than he expected, and without a gun to kill the prairie hens which were so abundant on the trail. He carried the mail in a large leather bag by means of a strap passing round his head. He was poorly clothed, wet, and miserable; he had been fifteen days coming from Crow Wing. We gave him some\n\n* See a short paper on the \"Great North-West,\" by the author of this Report.\nbuffalo meat and pemican, on the strength of which he hoped to reach Pembina in two days. Serpent River flows between steep sand banks and hills. The soil continues light, and often passing Serpent River is scarcely fitted for arable farms, but might furnish very extensive and excellent sheep pasture.\n\nThe prairies here are altogether destitute of timber, so that this day we were compelled to carry our fuel for cooking purposes from Serpent River to the middle of the plain where we camped for the night.\n\nRed Lake River.\u2014Mode of Crossing.\n\n315. Thursday, 15th. In the morning ice was found in the kettles, but the coolness of the night was not unpleasant. The trail ran for many miles on a perfect level and rounded Lake Ridge, and then descended into a low, rich, wet prairie, towards Red Lake River, 186 miles from Fort Garry by our estimate. Across this fine stream the baggage was passed in two small canoes, the horses swam across, and the carts were hauled with ropes. The valley of Red Lake River is heavily timbered, and will probably become an important stream as the settlement begins to descend Red River north of Graham's Point. The valley of Red Lake River is the war-path of the Sioux and Ojibways, and our half-breeds asked us not unnecessarily to fire off any guns or pistols as long as we were within ten or twelve miles of Red Lake River, that we might not attract the attention of any stray parties of Sioux who might possibly be within hearing.\n\nAbsence of Wood.\u2014Smoke of distant Fires.\n\n316. Friday, 16th. Passed over a high prairie, rising at long intervals in steps, and its summit marshy. The breadth of this prairie is about twenty-three miles, and it is terminated by Turtle Creek. No trees are visible; the soil is generally light, and the higher portions gravelly, but in the depression the soil is of the first quality. Boulders of the primary unfossiliferous rocks were observed in great numbers on the north flanks of the ancient lake ridges; met here a caravan of nine carts containing merchandise, which the owners had purchased at St. Paul; they had been twenty-one days coming a distance of 320 miles; their goods are enumerated elsewhere. In the afternoon we arrived at a part of the prairie where the fire had been; as far as the eye could see westward the country looked brown, black, and desolate. The strong north-westerly wind, which had been blowing during the day, drove the smoke from the burning prairies beyond Red River, in the form of a massive wall, towards us; a sight more marvellously grand, and at the same time desolate, could scarcely be conceived than that approaching wall of smoke over the burnt expanse of prairie stretching far away to the west. The upper edge was fringed with rose colour by the rays of the sun it had just obscured, and, as it swept slowly on, the rich rose tints faded with a burnt sienna hue, which gradually died away as the obscuration became more complete, until, though early in the afternoon, and with a cloudless sky towards the east, a twilight gloom began to settle around us, and the rolling folds of smoke swept over the prairie, rapidly enveloping all things in a thin but impenetrable haze; although the sun was still some degrees above the horizon, the light was that of a dim twilight. The prairie hens flew across the trail wildly, and without, as is usual with them, any determined direction: our horses appeared to be uneasy or alarmed, and the whole scene wore an aspect of singular solemnity and gloom. Night came on suddenly, and with a darkness which might be \"felt\" as we reached the valley of Sand Hill River; here, trusting to the sagacity of our horses, we let them find their way to the stream, on the banks of which we encamped. During the night the horses were very restless, often galloping suddenly among the carts and tents, and at no time appearing to venture far from the camp.\n\n317. Saturday, 17th. The wind had changed during the night, and morning brought a bright and brilliant sky, with a sharp frost; met this day a caravan of six carts, nineteen days from St. Paul; they were private Red River speculators, and were laden with ploughs, whiskey, stoves, scythes, &c. Ice was observed in the ponds, and at our camp it was found about a quarter of an inch thick in the kettles which were exposed. Numerous pelicans were seen flying south, besides wild geese. The trail this day lay through a fertile rolling prairie, intersected by sandy ridges; the slopes were very rich; the valleys wet. Here we saw the Height of Land Hills, about twenty-five miles off: arrived at Rice Creek, and camped on a hill near it.\n\nThe Height of Land.\n\n318. Sunday, 18th. Rose half an hour before daybreak: ice in the kettles; wind from the north, and a slight snowstorm at 9 a.m. Passed Rice River, and crossed an undulating prairie about twenty miles broad, to the foot of the low range of hills constituting the height of land; vast flocks of wild geese and ducks flying southward; reached the height of land at 4 p.m., and camped three miles on the undulating plateau which forms the dividing ridge. Monday, 19th. A heavy snowstorm during the night; wind strong and very cold; ice half an inch thick in the kettles, two yards from the fire; the trail continued through a very beautiful rolling plateau, with clumps of wood here and there, and lakelets between the hills. Camped at noon near the edge of the southern slope; the wind continued cold, and running on foot, driving the horses before us, was found to be far preferable to riding on horseback. Even up the summit of the southern slope the aspect of the country begins to change, and prettily wooded lakes become numerous, affording in summer most delightful variety of scenery. The soil, however, is light, and not favourable for cultivation. Camped at Forty-fourth Lake, about 110 miles from Crow Wing.\n\nTuesday, 20th. The country passed though to-day is extremely beautiful, the soil good, timber and prairie being about in equal quantities. The grackle in countless numbers were seen passing south; the lakes were alive with ducks, geese, and several other kinds of water fowl, recalling to mind the appearance of the ponds in Red River and the Assiniboine. In the woods we met sixteen carts from St. Paul, bound to St. Joseph's, and laden with tea, sugar, powder, and dry goods. We descended the successive steps of the southern slopes rapidly, and soon reached a warmer climate; passed little Red River at noon; camped in the middle of the prairie, and heard during the night the barking of dogs, indicating our approach to settlements. The prevailing character of the soil hitherto is light; the country is beautiful.\n319. Wednesday, 21st. A hard frost during the night; at 2 p.m. we arrived at a house near Leaf River, called by its occupants Leaf City, and so represented on the country map; it is within a few miles of Ottertail City, on Ottertail Lake. Ottertail City contains half-a-dozen log houses, and is intended by its present proprietors to become a town of importance. Leaf River connects the waters which flow into Red River with those which seek the Mississippi basin, and during seasons of high water a canoe can pass from one waterlick to the other without difficulty. South of Leaf River the country becomes rolling with deep valleys and extensive swamps between the hills. Leaf River is fringed with a magnificent forest; smoke from the west begins again to be visible.\n\n320. Thursday, 22nd. Camped seven miles from Crow Wing River, and during the day met some French Canadian emigrants (two families) bound to Red River from near Montreal. On the next day, after passing through a poor country, we arrived at Crow Wing River, where we found a store well stocked with goods, which the enterprising owner said he had brought there for the benefit of the Red River people; he thinks he will be able to drive a very profitable trade with them. Our road lay now through pine woods and swamps, which continue for eight miles, until within twenty-five miles of Crow Wing. The communication through these swamps is wretched, but there is every prospect of the State constructing a new road next year. Reached Crow Wing at sunset, Saturday, the 24th October, having been sixteen days out from Fort Garry. The subjoined table of distances affords a close approximation to each day's journey. Crow Wing is a small new town, depending chiefly upon the pineries in its neighbourhood for support, as well as upon the prospect of a road between it and Superior City. Its position in relation to Lake Superior and the valley of Red River is thought to be very favourable, and all seem to think that a plank road from Superior City to Crow Wing, not exceeding 120 miles in length, would secure the trade of the valley of Lake Winnipeg. The distance between Fort Garry and Superior City, via Crow Wing, is 522 miles, and from Fort Garry to Fort William, by the route of a winter road, 456.\n\n| TABLE OF ESTIMATED DISTANCES. |\n|--------------------------------|\n| Fort Garry                     | 0   |\n| Stinking River                | 9\u00bd  |\n| Scratching River               | 37\u00bd |\n| Plum River                    | 51  |\n| Pembina                        | 70  |\n| First of the two rivers to the upper crossing | 95  |\n| Little Bridge Creek           | 104 |\n| Middle River                  | 110 |\n| Second of the two rivers      | 114 |\n| Pine River                    | 136 |\n| Rock River                    | 142 |\n| Serpent River                 | 147 |\n| Middle of Prairie             | 160 |\n| Red Lake River                | 186 |\n| Turtle Creek                  | 212 |\n| Sand Hill River               | 216 |\n| Rice Creek                    | 242 |\n| Rice River                    | 247 |\n| Plateau of dividing ridge     | 270 |\n| Buffalo Creek                 | 279 |\n| Forty-fourth Lake             | 310 |\n| Little Red River              | 320 |\n| 109th mile stone from Fort Rupley | 329 |\n| Rush Lake                     | 338 |\n| Seventy-seventh-mile Lake     | 361 |\n| Seven miles east of Leaf River, 62\u00bd miles from Crow Wing | 376 |\n| Twenty-four miles from Crow Wing | 403 |\n| Crow Wing                     | 428 |\n| St. Paul's                    | 558 |\n\nCHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTH OF THE GREAT MISSOURI ROAD.\n\n321. Very erroneous impressions respecting available areas of cultivable land west of the Mississippi have been widely promulgated, and now find a firmly seated place in the popular mind. No fact, however, has been better established by the admirable surveys made under the auspices of the Government of the United States than the one which limits, humanly speaking, the future westward invasion of the wilderness by the pioneers of farming industry.\n\n322. \"The progress of settlement, a few miles west of the Upper Missouri River and west of the Mississippi, beyond the 98th degree of longitude, is rendered impossible by the conditions of climate and soil which prevail there.\" \"The rocky mountain region, and the sterile belt east of it, occupies an area about equal to one-third of the whole surface of the United States, which, with our present knowledge of the laws of nature, and their application to economical purposes, must ever remain of little value to the husbandman.\"* The progress of settlement must necessarily be up the valley of the Mississippi, and on and up the banks of the Missouri. The explorations for the Pacific railroad, and the meteorological investigations carried on under the direction of the surgeon-general of the United States army, show conclusively that no settlement of any importance can be established over a vast extent of country, many hundred miles broad, on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, and south of the great bend of the Missouri. Owing to the absence of rain, the apparently great rivers, the Platte, the Canadian, the Arkansas, &c., are often converted into long detached reaches or ponds during the summer months, and forbid extensive settlements, even on their immediate banks. This great and important physical fact is contrary to popular opinion, which is mainly based upon an inspection of a map, and guided by the glowing but utterly erroneous descriptions which are periodically circulated about the wonderful fertility of the far west, and its capability of sustaining a dense population.\n\n323. The arid districts of the Upper Missouri are barren tracts, wholly uncultivable from various causes.\u2020 The arid plains between the Platte and Canadian Rivers are in great part sand deserts. The sage plains, or dry districts, with little vegetable growth, except varieties of artemesia, begin in the western border of the plains of the eastern rocky mountain slope, and cover much the larger\n\n* Dr. Henry (Smithsonian Institution).\n\u2020 From a short paper on the Great North-West by the Author of this Report.\nportion of the whole country westward.* The sterile region on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains begins about 500 or 600 miles west of the Mississippi, and its breadth varies from 200 to 400 miles; and it is then succeeded by the Rocky Mountain range, which, rising from an altitude of 5,200 in lat. 32\u00b0, reaches 10,000 feet in lat. 38\u00b0, and declines to 7,490 feet in lat. 42\u00b0 24'; and about 6,000 feet in lat. 47\u00b0. Along this range isolated peaks and ridges rise into the limits of perpetual snow, in some instances attaining an elevation of 17,900 feet. The breadth of the Rocky Mountain range varies from 560 to 900 miles. The soil of the greater part of the sterile region is necessarily so from its composition, and, were well constituted for fertility, from the absence of rain at certain seasons. The general character of extreme sterility likewise belongs to the country embraced in the mountain region.\u2020\n\nThe table subjoined is capable of conveying a very good idea of the great barrier to the westward progress of settlement, which lies between the Mississippi valley and the Pacific slope of the Rocky Mountains. It is extracted from a table, showing the lengths, sums of ascents and descents, &c., of the several routes surveyed for a railroad from the Mississippi to the Pacific, and published in the Explorations and Surveys before quoted.\n\n324. This table shows that the least distance of uncultivable land, through which a railway from the Mississippi to the Pacific must pass in the United States' territory, exceeds 1,200 miles in length, a barrier sufficient to arrest the general progress of settlement for very many years to come, in a course due west of the Mississippi:\n\n| Length of Railway | Number of miles of route through arable land | Number of miles of route through lands generally uncultivable, arable soil being found in small areas | Number of square miles of sums of areas of largest bodies of arable land in uncultivable regions |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Route near the 47th and 49th parallel | - | 1,864 | 374 | 1,490 | 1,000 |\n| \" 41st and 42nd \" | - | 2,032 | 632 | 1,400 | 1,100 |\n| \" 38th and 39th \" | - | 2,080 | 620 | 1,460 | 1,100 |\n| \" 35th \" | - | 1,892 | 416 | 1,476 | 2,300 |\n| \" 32nd \" | - | 1,618 | 408 | 1,210 | 2,300 |\n\n325. The only direction which remains for an extensive free soil settlement, in and near the United States, is northwards, partially along the immediate banks of the Missouri, about the head waters of the Mississippi, and towards the valley of the Red River and the Saskatchewan. The popular impression that immense areas of land available for the purposes of agriculture lie between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountain chain has, as before stated, been completely refuted by the explorations and surveys for the Pacific railroad. The now well-ascertained aridity of the climate, and its natural consequence, sterility of soil, both continue to confirm the title of \u201cThe Great American Desert,\u201d given by the early explorers of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains to that extensive region of country. This important fact cannot fail to exercise a powerful influence upon the occupation of British territory. North of the 49th parallel of latitude, and on the sources from which that occupation will flow, a considerable part of the region lying between the Skayenne River (a tributary of Red River), and Mouse River (a distance of 150 miles), is, moreover, scarcely fitted for continuous settlement, owing to the absence of wood, and the constant occurrence of brackish or salt water lakelets. In the event of the construction of the Pacific railroad near the 49th parallel, along the line surveyed by Governor Stevens, wood for building and fuel on the proposed line of road for a distance of 400 miles would have been obtained from the only sources of supply on Red River and Mouse River.\u00a7\n\n326. In an article on meteorology in its connexion with agriculture, by Prof. Joseph Henry, Secretary to the Smithsonian Institution, published in the Patent Office Report for 1856, the following statement relating to the states and territories bordering the Mississippi is introduced:\u2014\u201cThe time is at hand when scientific agriculture can no longer be neglected by us; for however large our domain really is, and however inexhaustible it may have been represented to be, a sober deduction from the facts which have accumulated during the last few years will show that we are nearer the confines of the healthy expansion of our agricultural operations over new ground, than those who have not paid definite attention to the subject could readily imagine. We think it will be found a wiser policy to develope more fully the agricultural resources of the states and territories bordering on the Mississippi, than to attempt the further invasion of the sterile waste that lies beyond.\u201d And, again, in the same article, the subjoined passage occurs:\u2014\u201cWe have stated that the entire region west of the 98th degree of west longitude, with the exception of a small portion of western Texas, and the narrow border along the Pacific, is a country of comparatively little value to the agriculturist; and perhaps it will astonish the reader if we direct his attention to the fact, that the line which passes southward from Lake Winnipeg to the Gulf of Mexico will divide the whole surface of the United States into nearly two equal parts. This statement, when fully appreciated, will serve to dissipate some of the dreams which have been considered realities, as to the destiny of the western part of the North American continent. Truth, however, transcends even the laudable feelings of pride of country, and in order properly to direct the policy of this great confederacy, it is necessary to be well acquainted with the theatre on which its future history is to be enacted, and by whose characters it will be mainly shaped.\u201d\n\n327. The climate of the valley of the Saskatchewan is repeatedly referred to in the lately issued work by Lorin Blodget, on the climatology of the United States and of the temperate latitudes of the\n\n* Page 684, Army Meteorological Register, U.S.\n\u2020 Explorations and Surveys for a Railway Route from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, page 6.\n\u00a7 Explorations and Surveys, page 40.\nNorth American continent.* This distinguished meteorologist, although advancing peculiar theoretical views in relation to the causes which determine particular climates, appears to be much impressed with the great importance of the north-western portion of this continent. The following extracts will show the light in which the vast British possessions west of Lake Superior are regarded by this author, and the manner in which the attention of the American people is called to their importance:\u2014\n\nNext is the \"area east of the Rocky Mountains, not less remarkable than the first for the absence of attention heretofore given to its intrinsic value as a productive and cultivable region, within easy reach of emigration. This is a wedge-shaped tract, ten degrees of longitude in width at its base along the forty-seventh parallel, inclined north-westward to conform to the bend of the Rocky Mountains, and terminating not far from the sixty-first parallel in a narrow line, which still extends along the Mackenzie for three or four degrees of latitude, in a climate barely tolerable. Lord Selkirk begins his efforts at colonization here as early as 1805, and from personal knowledge he then claimed for this tract a capacity to support thirty millions of inhabitants.\n\n328. \"All the grains of the cool temperate latitudes are produced abundantly. Indian corn may be grown on both branches of the Saskatchewan, and the grass of the plains is singularly abundant and rich; not only in the earliest period of exploration of these plains, but now, they are the great resort for buffalo herds, which, with the domestic herds and the horses of the Indians and the colonists, remain on them and their woodland borders through the year. The simple fact of the presence of these vast herds of wild cattle on plains so high a latitude is ample proof of the climatological and productive capacity of the country. Of these plains and their woodland borders the valuable surface measures fully five hundred thousand square miles.\"\n\nIn various parts of the present work, references have been made to the leading incidents of natural capacity and of actual growth in the north-western districts; it is not necessary to repeat these here, and the present purpose is only to direct attention to the development in that quarter, as one offering clearly the greatest field in which natural advantages await the use of civilized nations. The reason for most of the previous and present neglect of this region lies in mistaken views of its climate, and the peculiarities of much of the Lake Superior district are such as to perpetuate the mistake. . . .\n\nIn every condition forming the basis of national wealth, the continental mass lying westward and north-westward from Lake Superior is far more valuable then the interior in lower latitudes, of which Salt Lake and Upper New Mexico are the prominent known districts.\"\n\n329. \"The history of this north-western district has an unusual interest also, though its details are meagre. French traders ranged the fertile plains of the Red River and Saskatchewan nearly two centuries since, and the rich trade in furs and peltries has for so many years been constantly gathered from the surrounding tracts, though that as a central area. This occupation was coeval with the Spanish occupation of New Mexico and California, and but for the pernicious views entailed by the fur traffic as to the necessity of preserving it in a wilderness, it would long since have been open to colonization. The Hudson's Bay and North-west Companies had a gigantic contest for possession after the French had given way to British dominion in Canada, and both these companies at last concentrated their strength on efforts to preserve this wilderness and to crush the infant colony of Lord Selkirk. The whole space designated here the north-west is, however, the joint possession of the United States and Great Britain, not only in territorial title, but in all the incidents of development. Its commercial and industrial capacity is gigantic, and one which it is the highest interest of both Governments to bring out at the earliest moment.\"\n\nThe well-established facts in relation to the sterility of the Far West beyond the Mississippi have a most important bearing upon Red River and the whole valley of Lake Winnipeg. The northern slope of the American continent acquires a new and greatly enhanced political importance in view of the limits which nature has established to the formation of new states and territories west of the Mississippi; and no one who dispassionately considers the question of the march and progress of settlement can fail to appreciate the importance which properly belongs to the region drained by the rivers flowing into Lake Winnipeg.\n\n---\n\n**CONTENTS\u2014APPENDIX.**\n\n1.

The sable skins next in repute to the Russian are those imported by the Hudson's Bay Company, of which no less than 120,000 are annually brought into this country; as the natural colour of the skins is much lighter than the prevailing taste, it is the practice to dye many of them a darker colour, and the furs thus treated are scarcely inferior to the natural sable.\n\nFisher. There are about 11,000 of these skins annually brought to this country from North America; they are larger than the sables, and the fur is longer and fuller; the tail is long, round, and full, gradually tapering to a point, and quite black; a few years since it formed the common ornament to a national cap worn by the Jew merchants of Poland, and at that time was worth 6s. to 9s., but its present value does not exceed 6d. to 9d.\n\nMink (Mustela mison). There were 245,000 skins of this little animal brought to this country last year from the possessions of the Hudson's Bay Company and North America; the fur resembles the sable in colour, but is considerably shorter and more glossy; it is a very desirable and useful fur, and is exported in large quantities to the continent.\n\nNorth American Skunk (Mephitis Americanus). The skins known under this name are imported by the Hudson's Bay Company; the animal from which they are taken is allied to the polecat of Europe, and from the f\u00e6tor it emits when attacked, which has been known to affect persons with sickness at a hundred yards' distance, has received the sobriquet of \"enfant du diable;\" it has a soft black fur, with two white stripes running from the head to the tail, which is short and bushy; the skins, though imported into England, are usually re-exported to the continent of Europe.\n\nMusquash or muskrat (Fiber zebethicus). The animal known under this name is found in great numbers in North America, frequenting swamps and rivers, and like the beaver, building its habitations of mud with great ingenuity. Dr. Richardson states that it has three litters of young in the course of the summer, producing from three to seven at a litter. The animal has a peculiar smell similar to that of musk; but it must not be mistaken for the animal from which the musk of commerce is procured, which is a native of Thibet. About one million skins are brought to this country annually; the fur resembles that of the beaver, and is used by hat manufacturers; the skins are also dyed by the furrier, and manufactured into many cheap and useful articles.\n\nBeaver (Castor Americanus). Beaver skins are imported by the Hudson's Bay Company in less quantities than formerly. The use of the fur in our hat manufactories has greatly diminished since the introduction of silk hats, and a considerable depreciation has taken place in their value. This beautiful fur is sometimes used for articles of dress. In order to prepare the skins for this appropriation, the coarse hairs are removed and the surface is very evenly cut by an ingenious machine, somewhat similar to that used in dressing cloth. The fur thus prepared has a beautiful appearance, not unlike the costly South Sea otter, and has the advantage of lightness, with durability and cheapness.\n\nOtter (Lutra vulgaris, Lutra Canadensis). The large supply of otter skins used by the Russians and Chinese is derived principally from North America. The quality of the fur is in most respects similar to the otter of the British Isles, of which there are about 500 skins collected annually. This animal has frequently been tamed, and from its extreme agility in the water, has been rendered serviceable in catching fish for the use of its owner. The American otter is much larger in size than the\n\n* From the Report of the Jurors, Exhibition of all Nations, 1851.\nEuropean, being about five feet from the nose to the tip of its tail; a smaller variety abounds in the West Indies, the fur of which is very short.\n\nFox.\u2014Of fox skins brought to this country there are many varieties; the black and silver foxes (Vulpes fulvus, var. argentatus) from the Arctic regions are the most valuable. Many of the skins in the exhibition are worth from ten to forty guineas. They are purchased for the Russian market, being highly prized in that country. The cross and red foxes (Vulpes fulvus) are used in this and other countries for ladies' dresses.\n\nWolverine (Gulo luscus).\u2014This animal, which is only met with in North America, Norway, and Sweden, is now generally considered by zoologists as identical with the glutton of old writers. It is extremely mischievous to the fur trader, and will follow the marten hunter's path round a line of traps, extending forty or fifty miles, merely to come at the baits. The fur is generally dark nut brown passing in the depth of winter almost into black, and is chiefly used in Germany and other northern countries for cloak linings.\n\nBear (Ursus).\u2014There are several descriptions of bear skins used by the furrier. The skin of the black bear of North America (Ursus Americanus) is used in this country for military purposes, for rugs, and carriage hammer-cloths. In Russia it is frequently manufactured for sleigh coverings, and the skin of the cub bear is highly valued for trimmings and coat linings. That of the grey bear (Ursus ferox) is applied to similar uses. That of the white Polar bear, of which the supply is very limited, is frequently made into rugs, bordered with the black and grey bear skins. The fur of the brown or Isabella bear (Ursus Isabellinus) has frequently been very fashionable in this country, where its value has been tenfold the present price. It is still considerably used in America for various articles of ladies' dress.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay rabbit is beautiful in the length and texture of its fur, but the skin is so fragile, and the fur so liable to fall off with slight wear, that it has little value as an article of dress. The white Polish rabbit is a breed peculiar to that country; its skin is often made into linings for ladies' cloaks, and being the cheapest and most useful fur for that purpose, the animal is imported in great numbers.\n\nRaccoon (Procyon lotor).\u2014The racoon is an inhabitant of North America; the skins are imported into this country in immense numbers, but meeting with no demand for our home trade, are re-exported by merchants, who purchase them at the periodical sales. They are used throughout Germany and Russia for lining shubes and coats, and being of a durable nature, and moderate in price, are esteemed as one of the most useful furs.\n\nCommon Badger (Meles vulgaris), American badger (Meles Labradorica).\u2014The skin of the European badger, from the wiry nature of its hair, is generally used for the manufacture of superior kinds of shaving brushes, but the skins exported from North America have a soft fine fur, which renders them suitable for many purposes for which the larger furs are used.\n\nCanada Lynx (Felis Canadensis), Lynx cat (Felis rufa).\u2014The fur of the lynx is long, soft, and of a greyish colour, sometimes, as in the Norway lynx, covered with brown spots; the belly is white, silky, and not unfrequently spotted with black. The change of fashion has for some time discarded it from this country, but it is dyed, prepared, and exported in considerable quantities for the American market, where it is much valued and admired. It is generally used for cloaks, linings, and facings, for which purposes it is very appropriate, being exceedingly soft and light.\n\nNo. 3.\n\n| TABLE OF THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS (ENGLAND) OF SKINS ADAPTED FOR FURS. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | Total Importations into England | Exported | Consumed in England | Total Importations into England | Exported | Consumed in England |\n| Raccoon | 525,000 | 525,000 | None | Otter | 17,000 | 17,500 | None |\n| Beaver | 60,000 | 12,000 | 48,000 | Fur Seal | 15,000 | 12,500 | 2,500 |\n| Chinchilla | 85,000 | 30,000 | 55,000 | Wolf | 15,000 | 15,000 | None |\n| Bear | 9,500 | 8,000 | 1,500 | Marten, Stone and Brown | 120,000 | 5,000 | 115,000 |\n| Fisher | 11,000 | 11,000 | None | Squirrel | 3,000,000 | 100,000 | 2,900,000 |\n| Fox\u2014Red | 50,000 | 50,000 | \" | Fitch | 65,091 | 28,276 | 36,815 |\n| \" Cross | 4,500 | 4,500 | \" | Kolinski | 53,410 | 250 | 53,210 |\n| \" Silver | 1,000 | 1,000 | \" | Ermine | 187,104 | None | 187,104 |\n| \" White | 1,500 | 200 | 1,000 | Rabbit | 120,000 | \" | 120,000 |\n| \" Grey | 20,000 | 18,000 | 2,000 | Wolverine | 1,200 | 1,200 | None |\n| Lynx | 55,000 | 50,000 | 5,000 | Skunk | 1,200 | 1,200 | \" |\n| Marten | 120,000 | 15,000 | 105,000 | Sea Otter | 100 | 100 | \" |\n| Mink | 245,000 | 75,000 | 170,000 | Musquash | 1,000,000 | 150,000 | 850,000 |\n\nNo. 4.\n\nCATALOGUE OF THE QUADRUPEDS OF RUPERT'S LAND.*\n\n1.

Baird, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\"The herd of buffaloes I now possess have descended from one or two cows that I purchased from a man who brought them from the country called the Upper Missouri. I have had them for about thirty years; but from giving them away, and the occasional killing of them by mischievous persons, as well as other causes, my whole stock at this time does not exceed ten or twelve. I have sometimes confined them in separate parks, from other cattle, but generally they herd and feed with my stock of farm cattle; they graze in company with them as gently as the others. The buffalo cow, I think, go with young about the same time the common cow does, and produce once a year. None of mine ever had more than one at a birth. The approach of the sexes is similar to that of the common bull and cow, under all circumstances and at all times, when the cow is in heat, a period which seems, as with the common cow, confined to neither day nor night, nor any particular season; and the cows bring forth their young, of course, at different times and seasons of the year, the same as our domestic cattle. I do not find my buffaloes more furious or wild than the common cattle of the same age that graze with them.\n\n* Patent Office Report.\n\"Although the buffalo, like the domestic cow, brings forth its young at different seasons of the year, this I attribute to domestication, as it is different with all animals in a state of nature, I have always heard their time for calving in our latitude was from March until July, and it is very obviously the season which nature assigns for the increase of both races, as most of my calves were from the buffaloes and the common cows at this season. On getting possession of the tame buffaloes I endeavoured to cross them as much as I could with my common cows, to which experiment I found the tame or common bull unwilling to accede, and he was always shy of a buffalo cow; but the buffalo bull was willing to breed with the common cow.\n\n\"From the common cow I had several half-breeds, one of which was a heifer. This I put with a domestic bull, and it produced a bull-calf. This I castrated, and it made a fine steer, and when killed produced very fine beef. I bred from this same heifer several calves, and then, that the experiment might be perfect, I put one of them to the buffalo bull, and she brought me a bull-calf, which I raised to be a very fine large animal, perhaps the only one to be met with in the world of this blood, viz.: a three-quarter, half-quarter, and half-quarter of common blood. After making these experiments, I have left them to propagate their blood themselves, so that I have only had a few half-breeds, and they always prove the same, even by a buffalo bull. The full blood is not as large as the imported stock, but as large as the ordinary stock of the country. The crossed, or half-blooded, are larger than either the buffalo or common cow. The hump, brisket, ribs, and tongue of the full and half-blooded are preferable to those of the common beef; but the round and other parts are much inferior. The udder or bag of the buffalo is smaller than that of the common cow; but I have allowed the calves of both to run with their dams upon the same pasture, and those of the buffalo were always the fattest; and old hunters have told me, that when a young buffalo calf is taken, it requires the milk of two common cows to raise it. Of this I have no doubt, having received the same information from hunters of the greatest veracity. The bag or udder of the half-breed is larger than that of the full-blooded animals, and they would, I have no doubt, make good milkers.\n\n\"The wool of the wild buffalo grows on their descendants when domesticated, but I think they have less wool than their progenitors. The domesticated buffalo still retains the grunt of the wild animal, and it is incapable of making any other noise; and they still observe the habit of having select places within their feeding grounds to wallow in.\n\n\"The buffalo has a much deeper shoulder than the tame ox, but it is lighter behind. He walks more actively than the latter, and I think has more strength than a common ox of the same weight. I have broken them to the yoke, and found them capable of making excellent oxen, and for drawing wagons, carts, or other heavily laden vehicles, on long journeys, they would, I think, be greatly preferable to the common ox. I have as yet had no opportunity of testing the longevity of the buffalo, as all mine that have died did so from accident, or were killed because they became aged. I have some cows that are nearly twenty years old, that are healthy and vigorous, and one of them has now a sucking calf. The young buffalo calf is of a sandy red or rusus colour, and commences changing to a dark brown at about six months old, which last colour it always retains. The mixed breeds are of various colours; I have had them striped with black on a grey ground, like the zebra; some of them brindled red; some pure red, with white faces; and others red, without any markings of white. The mixed breeds have not only produced in my stock from the tame and buffalo bull, but I have seen the half bloods re-producing, viz., those that were the product of the common cow and wild buffalo bull. I was informed that, at the first settlement of the country, cows that were considered best for milking, were the half-blood down to the quarter, and even eighth, of the buffalo blood. But my experiments have not satisfied me that the half buffalo bull will produce again. That the half-breed heifer will be productive from either race, as I have before stated, I have tested beyond the possibility of doubt.\n\n\"The domesticated buffalo retains the same haughty bearing that distinguishes him in his natural state. He will, however, feed or fatten on whatever suits the tame cow, and requires about the same amount of food. I have never milked either the full blood or mixed breed, but have no doubt they might be made good milkers, although their bags or udders are less than those of the common cow; yet, from the strength of the calf, the dam must yield as much, or even more milk, than the common cow.\"\n\n---\n\nNo. 6.\n\nTABLE SHOWING THE PRICES OF PROVISIONS, ETC.

For the sake of peace, I, as the representative of my tribe, allowed them to remain on our lands on their promising that we should be well paid for them by a great chief who was to follow them. This great chief, whom we call the silver chief (the Earl of Selkirk), arrived in the spring, after the war between the North-West and Hudson's Bay Companies (1817). He told us that he wanted our land for some of his countrymen, who were very poor in their own country, and I consented, on the condition that he paid well for my tribe's land; he could have from the confluence of the Assiniboine to near Maple Sugar Point, on the Red River, (a distance of twenty or twenty-four miles), following the course of the river, and as far back on each side of the river as a horse could be seen under (easily distinguished). The silver chief told us he had little with which to pay us for our lands, when he made this arrangement, in consequence of the troubles with the North-West Company. He, however, asked us what we most required for the present, and we told him we would be content till the following year, when he promised again to return, to take only ammunition and tobacco. The silver chief never returned, and either his son or the Hudson's Bay Company have ever since paid us annually for our lands only the small quantity of ammunition and tobacco, which, in the first instance, we took as preliminary to a final bargain about our lands. This surely was repaying me very poorly for having saved the silver chief's life, for the year he came here, Guthbert Grant with 116 warriors had assembled at White Horse Plain, intending to waylay him somewhere on the Red River. I no sooner heard of this than I went to Guthbert Grant, and told him if he came out of the White Horse Plain where his warriors were assembled, I should meet him at Sturgeon Creek with my entire tribe, who were then much more numerous than they are now, and stand or fall between him and the silver chief. This had the desired effect, and Mr. Grant did not make the attempt to harm the silver chief, who came as he went, in peace and safety. Those who have since held our lands, not only pay us only the same small quantity of ammunition and tobacco, which was first paid to us as a preliminary to a final bargain, but they now claim all the lands between the Assiniboine and Lake Winnipeg, a quantity of land nearly double of what was first asked from us. We hope our Great Mother will not allow us to be treated so unjustly as to allow our lands to be taken from us in that way.\n\n---\n\nNo. 8.\n\nTable showing the Number of Indians frequenting the following Establishments of the Hon.

Your letter from St. Paul's, of 29th October, only reached me by the December mails, and this is my first opportunity of replying to it. It is unfortunate, as it has happened, that the queries had not been left behind when you visited the Red River, so that I might have answered them immediately on my return. In the hope, however, that the information may be of use, although too late for your official report, I now send a short reply to each of the questions submitted to me.\n\n1. We may perhaps take the limits of the settlement as extending from Portage la Prairie to the Indian settlement. Within these boundaries the schools connected with the Church of England are thirteen. They are necessarily more numerous than would under any other circumstances be required by the population, from the houses of the settlers lying along the banks of the two rivers; and not being in the form of a town or village, the children cannot go to school above a certain distance, and the schools have been in consequence multiplied to suit the convenience of the inhabitants. The thirteen are exclusive of the two higher academies for young ladies and boys.\n\n2. The subjects taught must vary considerably from the great difference of capacity in the pupils. The two leading schools would be \u201cSt. John\u2019s Parochial School,\u201d in the upper part of the settlement, and the \u201cModel Training School,\u201d connected with St. Andrew\u2019s Church. In the former, in addition, to the usual branches, the upper pupils have the opportunity of studying Latin, French, and mathe-\nmatics. In the Model School, which is taught by a certificated master from Highbury, the senior pupils have also the advantage of instruction in Latin, Euclid, and Algebra. They are thus an approach to the Grammar Schools in Canada. In the other schools, of which St. Paul's is the best example, there is an excellent education afforded in British history, grammar, geography, arithmetic, with the elements of general history. Of course we must be content with much less where the pupils are the children of Indian parents. With them it is difficult to go beyond reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\nIn the Collegiate School many of the pupils make very great progress both in classics and mathematics. Soon after my arrival in the country I was induced to found some scholarships as an incentive to study; and an approximation to what takes place in other countries. To the scholars elected from year to year was assigned a free board and the sum of 10l. a year, or in all about 30l. per annum. Of these so elected some have done well elsewhere, and reflected credit on their early training. I would only specify among these Mr. Colin C. M'Kenzie, B.A., of St. Peter's College, Cambridge; Mr. Jas. Ross, B.A., who has distinguished himself very highly at the University of Toronto; the Rev. Peter Jacobs, ordained by the Bishop of Toronto, to labour among the Indians on Lake Huron; and the Rev. Robert M'Donald, ordained by myself, to the Missionary Station of Islington, on the Winnipeg River. With more advanced pupils the higher classics have been read, such as \u00c6schylus, Herodotus, and Thucydides. The turn of the native mind is, however, more towards mathematics. All attain to excellence in algebra, and acquire it with great ease. All, too, have nationally imitative power, and write and draw well. While I have had great pleasure in carrying on these branches of education, my one feeling of disappointment has been that there is comparatively little opening for those who distinguish themselves in this country in after-life. Yet I have felt that the duty is ours, the event was with God. In the young ladies' school the want of adequate motive to excite to study is felt more in the Collegiate School. They have the opportunity of learning every branch usually taught in such establishments elsewhere, such as French and music, and there is a very great change perceptible in the seven years. Their education is all-important with a view to the training of the next generation, and although the progress may not be visible in their case, the effects will I trust be fully acknowledged when they are settled in life.\n\n3. In the thirteen schools there may be about six hundred, from that to seven hundred. In one or two there may be above fifty in attendance in winter, but the average will not exceed forty. The students at the Collegiate School have been as many as twenty-four; but as the standard of education rises in the Parochial Schools, the Collegiate School, as such, will be comparatively unnecessary, and it will ultimately be limited to those who may be under preparation for holy orders. For such, and for the clergy generally, there is a library, possessing now 1,000 books of standard divinity, as well as other useful subjects.\n\n4. The sources of income vary much; ten out of the thirteen schools are connected with the Church Missionary Society. The masters of such schools have all a salary from the society. The model training master is entirely paid by them, and also the masters of the pure Indian schools. In the other schools about one-half may be paid by the Society, sometimes less, and the rest made up by the parents of the children. In the three parochial schools, unconnected with the Church Missionary Society in St. John's Parochial School, a portion of the salary is paid by my own college, Exeter College, Oxford; in St. James's by some Christian friends in Edinburgh, and at Headingly by the congregation of the Rev. T. M. M'Donald, Trinity Church, Nottingham.\n\n5. This question is included in the preceding. I only add that the sum paid by parents is 15s. a year; where Latin is taught, 1l. In some parishes they prefer to pay the pound or thirty shillings a family, and to send as many as they choose for the sum.\n\n6. We want much, school apparatus, books, and maps. A very large quantity of books have been imported, and the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge has given many valuable sets of maps to several parishes, but scattered over thirteen schools, they are still insufficient. Could we have a grant at half price of books, grammars, geographies, arithmetic books, and also some maps from Toronto, or any other quarter of Canada, we shall be glad to pay for their carriage to St. Paul's, from which place they would be brought hither by our own people. I saw with much pleasure, I must not say with envy, the stock at the Normal school; if judged to be within the limits of a grant, and the Educational Board will allow us to purchase at half price, I hope you will give me immediate notice of this, so as not to lose the present summer.\n\n7. Here, too, apparatus and machinery are requisite. I ordered myself, last year, four ploughs, and these I intend for new stations and settlements, to be used by the Indians in common; now we want a large number of them to bring additional land under cultivation. After all our grand want is division of labour. We have no separate trade, all are engaged in everything, farmers and carpenters at the same time, and so on. At a meeting held two years ago, for the promotion of social improvement, I endeavoured to press this upon them, but they are slow in understanding the \"philosophy of improvement.\" We want one skilful in tanning, for the hides of the domestic animals are wasted at present. We want one to instruct them in making soap, to save the importation of this bulky and necessary article from Britain. We want, too, improvement in the fulling of cloth to bring the wool into use, and provide clothing cheaper than what is imported. We have country cloth now, but the fabric is imperfectly fulled, and therefore not sufficiently warm. Young men coming among us, who could guide and instruct the people in any of these branches, would be a great gain.\n\n8. My own opinion is much in favour of Red River as a place for settlement. From Britain the difficulty is to get out, but once out the industrious need not want for aught. As compared with the position of the farm-labourers in England, their condition here is infinitely superior. I speak from actual knowledge of those who have come out from the counties of Kent, Cambridge, and Rutland. If the British Government could send out some free of expense every year, they might be settled advantageously, and become useful additions to our population. We want producers at this time in greater numbers, and not consumers. As compared with Canada, as far as by other* but limited goes, our advantage is in the ease with which prairie land is brought under. The clearance in Canada seemed to me to be effected with difficulty; here it is easy, and in a very few years the farm can be in good order.\nOn the ground of education, let none fear to make trial of the country. The parochial school connected with my own church, is equal to most parochial schools which I have known in England, in range of subjects, superior to most, though in method and in the apparatus of the school necessarily a little inferior.\n\nI look forward with much hope to the effect of the new road which your Commissioners are opening from Red River to the Lake of the Woods. It is thought to be about 96 or 100 miles in length. I should much like that we should have a station on the lake. If I could find some of our young men willing to go out and take up land there, I should be willing to promise them a clergyman, a church and school, and it would soon grow into a town. If you could at the same time plant some Canada settlers at Fort William, or at some other spot on the northern shore of Lake Superior, the communication would virtually be opened. Until this is done, all the traffic will be through the United States, via St. Paul's.\n\nI shall hope to have a few lines from you acknowledging the receipt of this letter, and if you can persuade the Educational Department to admit us, as a special and peculiar case, as purchasers of books and apparatus on the same terms as their own schools, or on some modification of the terms, it would tend, I am sure, to cement that union between the two countries which is now, in the providence of God, advancing slowly but securely from year to year.\n\nAny other detail connected with the land I shall be happy to give at any time. Would you have the goodness to give my kind and christian regards to the Provost, and with every good wish,\n\nBelieve me, &c.\n\nProfessor H. Y. Hind, Trinity College.\n\n(Signed) DAVID RUPERT'S LAND.\n\nNo. 10.\n\nCOPY OF A LETTER FROM THE REV. JOHN BLACK, PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER, RED RIVER.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nThe Manse, Red River, January 6, 1858.\n\nI am sorry that your note, dated St. Paul's, October 29, did not come to hand till December, I think the 17th, and consequently I have not had an opportunity of answering it till now; I am afraid therefore it will be too late for your purposes. I willingly, however, comply with your request; the labour is not great if it is lost. First, then, as to the school: This is entirely supported by the people of the district, or rather by those of them who send their children to it. There is no endowment, no public money, nor any allowance by any missionary or other society. The salaries of the different teachers have varied from \u00a32l. to \u00a340l. sterling a year. The branches taught are English reading, writing and grammar, geography, arithmetic, and the elements of algebra and geometry. In the last two branches I think there are no pupils at present. The average attendance will be from thirty-five to forty. The school is kept open for the whole year, excepting a month in harvest, and the usual holidays. The school is not exclusively composed of the children of Presbyterian families, neither do all the children of such families attend it; some of these, residing at the extremities of the parish, attend the Church of England schools at the upper and middle churches, whilst some of the Church of England people who reside amongst us send their children here. You are aware that we have no public school system in this colony, and this, like the rest, is therefore essentially a denominational school. We would like to raise its character, but, owing to other burdens lying upon them, and to their being left without assistance, the people are not able to hold out sufficient inducement in the way of salary to secure the services of an able teacher, at least permanently. Will annexation give us the Canada school system? As to church matters, we have here two congregations, or rather a congregation and a mission station belonging to this congregation. In the one where I live there are about sixty families; to the other (situated at Mr. Gunn's, New Stone Fort) there are ten or eleven in all. There are somewhat upwards of 120 members in full communion. The people are mostly Scotch or of Scotch parentage. There are a few Orkney men, whom our Highlanders scarcely recognise as Scotch, a few half-breeds, one Englishman, and one Swiss. We have sabbath schools at both places: here the attendance may just now average eighty-five; below about thirty. Here we have divine service every sabbath forenoon, and in the afternoon alternately here and below. We have also week lectures on Thursdays, and prayer-meetings on Tuesday evenings. In regard to temporalities, the congregation below have no property but their small meeting-house; that here has about 300 acres of good land, a stone church which cost about \u00a31,000l., and the cottage in which I live. My stipend is \u00a3150l. sterling a year, 100l. of which is raised by voluntary contributions, and 50l. is allowed me by the Hudson's Bay Company. My people are mostly all farmers in comfortable circumstances, but none rich. They are, however, allowed to be the most steady and industrious portion of our population. As to suggestions of an industrial kind, I am not a very competent person to make such. There is one thing, however, which I did think of great consequence, especially in view of an increased population, and that is to afford facilities for domestic manufactures. The climate requires large quantities of heavy woollen goods, and these might just as well be manufactured here as imported from England. You saw what a splendid country it is for sheep pasture; and were there means of making wool into cloths, blankets, &c., greater attention would be given to the rearing of sheep; great quantities of such goods are also required for the fur trade, and it would be an advantage to have them manufactured here. Among the emigrants coming up to take possession of the land, it would be a great advantage, were there somebody to establish machinery for carding, fulling and dyeing, perhaps spinning and weaving also.\n\nI do not know that my letter will be of any use to you, but I am glad, and ever will be so, to meet your wishes in anything that I can.\n\nWith much respect, yours, &c.\n\n(Signed) JOHN BLACK.\n\nProfessor H.

Sir E. B. Lytton, Bart. (Signed) EDMUND HEAD.\n\n&c. &c. &c.\n\nEnclosure 1 in No. 2.\n\nTo the Honourable the Provincial Secretary.\n\nSir,\n\nRed River, September 10, 1858.\n\nOn the 18th July, or nine days after the date of the report which I had the honour to address to you from Fort Ellice, we arrived at the Quapelle Mission, recently established on one of the lakes which distinguish that part of the Quapelle or Calling River Valley.\n\nFrom the 19th of June to the 18th of July it was necessary or advantageous to preserve the party composing this expedition united, but having arrived in the Cree country, to the north of the prairies, generally occupied by bands of Sioux and Assiniboine Indians, I found it desirable to form three divisions, with a view to traverse and examine the country hereafter described. The mission of the Quapelle Lakes is situated about half-way between Fort Ellice and the south branch of the Saskatchewan. From this point Mr. Dickinson, with two men, proceeded in a small canoe down the Quapelle River to its junction with the Assiniboine; thence on horseback to Fort Pelly, where he met Mr. Hime, with four men, who, after having examined Long Lake, some fifty miles west of the Quapelle mission, travelled across the country to Fort Pelly with Mr. Dickinson's carts and supplies.\n\nThe third division of the party, comprising myself, Mr. Fleming, and two men, sailed or tracked up the Quapelle Lakes and River to the Grand Forks, a distance of fifty miles, where three men, with our supplies, met us at the appointed time. We then followed the valley to the Quapelle River, to its source, and passed on through a continuation of the same valley to the south branch of the Saskatchewan, by the \"River that turns,\" flowing westerly. We struck the south branch at the elbow, and launched our three-fathom canoe on that magnificent river, down which Mr. Fleming and I drifted for 240 miles, until we came to the junction of the north and south branches of the Saskatchewan. The supplies, with four men and a Cree guide, were sent across the country to Fort \u00e0 la Corne, opposite the Nepoween mission, about eighteen miles below the Forks. Two days were occupied in examining part of the Coal Falls, on the north branch above the Forks, after which we joined the carts on the 9th of August, at Fort \u00e0 la Corne. Here I made another division, sending Mr. Fleming with two men in a canoe to Cumberland, thence to proceed down the Saskatchewan, and by the west coast of Lake Winnipeg to Red River. Taking the carts and four men I followed the course of Long Creek against the current, running parallel to the south branch for a distance of fifty miles; then turning in a south-easterly direction, travelled across the country to the Touchwood Hills, and thence to Fort Ellice, where, after an absence of forty-three days, I met Mr. Dickinson and his party, within three miles of our appointed rendezvous.\nAfter Mr. Dickinson's arrival at Fort Pelly he proceeded with Mr. Hime to examine the flanks of the Dolphin Mountain from Swan River to Rapid River, on the Little Saskatchewan, a tract of country comprehending the greater portions of the north-eastern watershed of the Assiniboine. After our union at Fort Ellice we proceeded to Red River, via the White Mud River, which flows into Lake Manitobah, and arrived at the settlement on the 4th of September, nearly three months from the date of our departure. Mr. Fleming has not yet returned, and I am now preparing to go in a canoe, with a supply of provisions, to meet him, in case the southern winds should prevent him from advancing.\n\nThe importance of ascertaining the true character of the Quapelle Valley became more evident as we proceeded westward, and met with Indians and a few half-breeds, whose accounts and descriptions seemed to agree in the general statement; \"that a great valley a mile or a mile and a half broad, and \"from 100 to 300 feet deep, did exist, running in a course nearly due east and west, between the \"south branch of the Saskatchewan and the Assiniboine.\n\nThe Quapelle River rises within sixteen miles of the Saskatchewan, as shown in the accompanying map. Its course is first northerly for several miles through a narrow gully, which widens into a deep valley before it reaches the Quapelle Valley proper. About four miles west of the Quapelle, and running in a direction nearly parallel to it, a river, called by the Crees of the Sandy Hills \"The River that turns,\" flows into the same great valley, and pursues for twelve miles a westerly course, when it falls into the south branch at the elbow; this is evidently the Heart River of Thompson's map. By the united action of these rivers and other agents, to be described in full in my general report, a great valley stretching from the Saskatchewan to the Assiniboine has been excavated. This valley has a greatest breadth of about one and a half, and a least breadth of about half a mile at the Sandy Hills. Its greatest depth below the prairie is between 300 and 400 feet; its least depth 140 feet. Between the Quapelle River and \"The River that turns\" there is a space of about four miles, occupied by ponds, in the valley which unite into a shallow lake in the spring, and send their waters at the same time to the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan. With a view to determine the height of the Quapelle, where it enters the great valley above the south branch, we levelled from one river to the other, and found a difference in sixteen miles of eighty-six feet. The Quapelle is here about ten feet broad and one and a half deep; \"The River that turns\" nearly of the same dimensions, and the south branch of the Saskatchewan about half a mile broad, with a channel seven feet deep. These altitudes and distances are given in round numbers, but they will be accurately expressed in accordance with repeated measurements, in my general report. In order that the waters of the Saskatchewan might flow down the Quapelle Valley into the Assiniboine, a rise of eighty-six feet in twelve miles would have to be overcome, and I am persuaded from indubitable evidence, that this has not occurred during modern times, if ever. During very wet seasons in the early spring months, the whole valley of the Quapelle, from within fourteen miles of the south branch of the Saskatchewan, is a narrow shallow lake all the way to the Assiniboine, a distance exceeding 230 miles, with a current of perhaps one mile per hour; and from \"The River that turns\" to the south branch, a distance of twelve miles, an impetuous torrent occupies the valley, leaving along its course many indications of its violence and force. In the spring of 1852, ever remarkable in this country for its extreme humidity, a canoe might have passed from the Saskatchewan to the Assiniboine by rising eighty feet in twelve miles, thence descending about two hundred feet in a distance of perhaps two hundred miles to the Assiniboine. The Quapelle lakes east of the Mission are briefly described in the accompanying report from Mr. Dickinson; the lakes west of the Mission are four in number; the depth of three of them is about fifty feet, the last or Salt Lake, near the height of land, is very shallow, and does not contain in the summer months drinkable water. From the first Forks (vide accompanying map) another great valley, similar in all respects to that of the Quapelle River, stretches in a north-westerly direction, and for forty or fifty miles is occupied by water forming a long narrow lake, varying from three-quarters of a mile to two miles in breadth; this is called, by the Crees, the Long Lake, also, the Last Mountain Lake, it is connected with the Saskatchewan by a broad excavated channel, similar to that occupied by the River-that-turns. Long Lake abounds in fish; but there is very little timber to be found on its steep cliff-like banks. The south branch of the Saskatchewan is a noble river, varying in width from half a mile to 300 yards for a distance of 100 miles from the elbow, it then gradually contracts its channel, and changes its character from a river full of sand-bars and mud-flats, pursuing a comparatively straight course, to a rapid and uniform torrent of water, sweeping down the narrow but deep valley it has excavated from one bank to the other in magnificent curves, until it joins the north branch. The country on the south side of the south branch as far as the Moose woods is a light prairie; there is very little timber to be seen, and all of small dimensions; the same may be said of the Quapelle, level tralee prairie on either side, or prairies covered with clumps of aspen. In the numerous gullies which give variety to the steep banks of both the Quapelle and Saskatchewan valleys, small timber is invariably found. The main Saskatchewan is a river of very imposing magnitude, like the South Branch, it occupies a narrow deep valley, varying in width from one and a half to three miles, as far as the Nepoween Mission; it flows in grand curves from side to side, and its general level is about 300 feet below the country through which it has excavated its channel. We have made many sections of the South Branch, Main, Saskatchewan, and Quapelle, &c., and numerous trigonometrical measurements of their valleys, and noticed continually the rate of currents, volume of water, character of banks, &c., all of which will be embodied in the general report.\n\nIn the large expanse of country over which our explorations have extended, the area of land of the first quality, namely, of black vegetable mould reposing on gravel or clay, is far more extensive and important than we anticipated; it is distributed as follows: On the south branch of the Saskatchewan from the Moose Woods to the Nepoween Mission; and, according to the description of half-breeds familiar with the country, a soil of equal excellence extends to the valley of Swan River. The immediate banks of the Saskatchewan are of a poor sandy or gravelly soil; but on the Prairie Plateau, three miles from the river, the rich soil commences, and in the part over which I passed has a breadth of sixty miles. The Touchwood Hill range, having an area exceeding 1,000,000 acres, for beauty of scenery, richness of soil, and adaptation for settlement, is by far the most attractive west of the Assini-\nboine; the soil is also of first quality in the valley of Swan River, and over the whole of the east watershed of the Assiniboine, with the exception of the country near its banks.\n\nThe valley of White Mud River is generally fertile and inviting, but until the maps which will accompany the general report are prepared, it is impossible to give an approximate calculation of the area of available arable land; but I may here say, that the ratio which land of excellent quality bears to land of indifferent or worthless quality is largely in favour of the former.\n\nThe Riding Mountain, as described in Mr. Dickinson's report, is timbered with large aspen.\n\nOn the level country, drained by the Saskatchewan from the Moose Woods to the Nepoween Mission, the timber is small; but on the Touchwood Hill range there are some fine aspen forests. I have succeeded in finding numerous rock exposures on the Quapelle and south branch of the Saskatchewan, which will enable me to produce a geological map of a large portion of the country briefly described.\n\nI start immediately to meet Mr. Fleming, and then propose to visit the east flank of Dauphin Mountain and the salt springs on Dauphin River and Lake. Mr. Dickinson will examine the country south of the Assiniboine, with a view to ascertain the extent and character of the forest to which allusion was made in my report from Port Ellice.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY Y. HIND,\nIn charge of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition.\n\nI am happy to say that Mr. Fleming has arrived this afternoon. September 16th, 1858.\n\nH. Y. H.\n\nSub-enclosure in Enclosure 1 in No. 2.\n\nTo Professor Hind, in charge of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition.\n\nSir,\n\nRed River, September 6, 1858.\n\nThe following report contains a short description of those parts of the country which I have examined, according to your letter of instructions dated Fort Ellice, July 12th, 1858, together with a brief notice of some of my operations from July 20th, the day we parted at the Church of England Mission, Quapelle Lakes, till we met at Fort Ellice on August 23rd.\n\nAfter our separation at the head of the river issuing from the lake at the mission, I took a section of the bed of the river and ascertained the rate of the current, and then proceeded down it to the next lake, which is the second of those called the \"fishing lakes,\" as fish are much more abundant in them than in those lakes further down the Quapelle Valley.\n\nThe character of this portion of the river which connects these two lakes together, being exactly similar to that of all other parts of it, one general description will suffice, together with special descriptions of a few places where there are differences.\n\nThe river varies in width from one to one and a half chains, and in depth from two to five feet, the average rate of current, taken from several trials, being one mile and a quarter per hour. The river is most wonderfully tortuous throughout its entire length, for ever being deflected from one side of the valley to the other, so that it is much more than double the length of the valley. Several, indeed most of the bends are so very sharp, that it was with much difficulty that the small canoe, only two fathoms long, could be steered safely round them, and prevented from running in on the banks, the current at some of them being two miles per hour.\n\nThe second of the \"Fishing Lakes,\" the one which I first came to, is about three miles and a half long, and three-quarters of a mile broad; it is more than seven fathoms deep everywhere. I tried it even within a few yards of the shore.\n\nThe river flowing from this to the next lake is but half a mile long.\n\nThe name of this Lake in Cree is Pa-tah-wi-wi-win; in English, \"The Fishing Lake,\" called so par excellence from the great quantities of fish it contains at some periods of the year.\n\nIt is about six miles long and three-quarters mile wide, which is about the average width of the valley.\n\nI tried the depth of it in several places along the course I took, which was down the middle of it, and found it to vary from five to eleven fathoms.\n\nHaving made a section of the river and ascertained the rate of current, I proceeded down it to the next lake called the \"Crooked Lake,\" or in Cree Ka-wa-wa-ki-mac, where I arrived in the forenoon of the 23rd. The general character of this portion of the river is the same as I have given before, but at some places here and there it varies from it. In two places, each about a quarter of a mile long, the river is full of sand and gravel bars, the depth of water over them being only about nine inches. In another place the current exceeds three miles an hour, to ascend which would indeed be a tedious and difficult task. Half way between these two lakes I took measurements for calculating trigonometrically the width and depth of the valley.\n\nThe result of these and other measurements and observations I hope to give in my final report. In round numbers I may say, however, that the valley appears to be from 250 to 350 feet deep and from half a mile to one in width.\n\nThe average height of the immediate banks of the river over the present level of the water was about six feet, the high-water mark being eight feet over the same level, the greater portion of the valley is therefore always liable to be flooded, which I believe is the case every spring.\n\nThe middle of the valley between the bends of the river is mostly covered with willows, with here and there a few young sugar maples. The south slope of the valley is thickly covered throughout with small aspens, the balsam poplar also growing well in some places, while the north slope is quite bare of trees, which I found to be caused by the fires which almost every year sweep along this side\nof the valley; for I saw in several places the remains of burnt trees, and in the hollows and deep recesses of the slope the young oak-shoots springing up from the half burnt roots.\n\nOn this side of the whole way there is a track along which the Indians travel constantly during the year, which accounts for the numerous fires.\n\n\"Crooked Lake\" the most beautiful of the Quapelle Lakes which I have seen, is upwards of eight miles in length and is from half a mile to one mile in width. There are several long points running out from the shores on which grow oak, elm, ash, and poplars, none of them very large however, but which would be useful for various purposes. There was no place where I sounded less than four fathoms deep. The water in this lake as well as in the others was at this time rendered very disagreeable by the great quantity of coniferous covering nearly the whole surface, and to some depth, now decaying and rotting under the hot sun.\n\nAt the commencement of the next portion of the river flowing out of this lake there is a very rapid current or rather a series of small rapids for two miles and a half, and the river is if possible more winding than ever, and is at some places only forty feet wide. The rest of it, cross sections of which I took at different points, as far as the next lake resembles in its character the general description of the river.\n\nIn the evening of 24th July I reached the Lake called \"Round Lake\" the Indian name of which is \"Kah-wah-wi-ya-ka-mac,\" it is the last of the chain of lakes in descending the river.\n\nIt is four miles and a half in length and is about one mile broad in the widest part. Owing to a long point of land running out from the south side of the valley about one mile and a half from the head of the lake, part of it looks nearly round, from which it derives its name.\n\nIt is in all places where I sounded it more than four fathoms deep, except at the mouth of the river and 100 yards from it, where it was only two feet.\n\nThe south slope of the valley is here as densely covered as before with young poplars and with patches of young oak, elm, and ash, and the north slope is bared as usual by the devastating fires.\n\nTwo miles down the river from the lake, the bed is thickly strewed with boulders for about 100 yards, and where the current is very strong, making the navigation even for a small canoe rather intricate; the Indians call this place the \"strong barrier,\" or, as it is in the Cree language, a-si-ne-pi-che-pu-ya-kan.\n\nBetween this point of the Quapelle River and its confluence with the Assiniboine there were two places, one on each side of the valley, where the slopes were exposed; on examining them, I found shale in position, but very much decomposed. These places will be marked on the map hereafter. After a long search I found but one fossil shell, which I enclose to you, together with specimens of the rock.\n\nAt many places I ascended the sides of the valley to see the country on both sides, and found it to be generally level prairie of light sandy loam with scattered clumps of willows and small poplars.\n\nSeveral small creeks, the principal of which are the Big and Little Cut arms and the Scissors Creek, flowing in from both sides, gradually increase the depth of the river, but not its width, six feet being now the average depth.\n\nThe river, twisting and turning about in every direction, is continually cutting out new channels, forming sometimes a most intricate maze as it approaches the Assiniboine, the Quapelle Valley gets wider, and the slopes flatter, on which grow more and better timber; on the south side particularly, elm, ash, aspen, and balsam, poplar, maple, all mingled together, with an underbrush of willows, dogwood, hazel, and roses.\n\nI arrived at the mouth of the river (a section of which I took) at six o'clock p.m. July 27th.\n\nHaving left one man in charge of the baggage at the landing place, I hastened to Fort Ellice with the other, and sent him back with a cart, which Mr. MacKay kindly lent me, to fetch it. The next day I was delayed several hours trying to procure a guide who knew the track on the west side of the river from this to Fort Pelly, and in consequence was not able to start till late in the afternoon. Mr. MacKay kindly sent men to assist us in crossing the Quapelle River, which was accomplished without any loss, and with but one accident, my horse receiving rather a bad cut when getting up the bank of the river, which was very soft, and covered with broken trees.\n\nWe camped for the night on the north side of the valley; this side is composed of fine loose sand intermixed with small boulders.\n\nFrom this to the Wolverine Creek, a distance of about fifteen miles, the land is light sandy clay, in many places pure sand, covered principally with a low growing creeper, bearing berries like the juniper; the grass is very short and scanty, and the aspens, which are the only trees, are very small.\n\nFurther on, the country improves in its aspect as to its soil and vegetation, but it abounds with marshes, swamps, and ponds of various sizes, round which grow willows and young aspens; this is for about sixty miles. From thence to Fort Pelly the country is densely covered with aspens from five to fifteen feet high, and willows of different kinds; there are open spaces to be seen now and then, where the wonderful luxuriance of the vegetation is beyond description; lakes and ponds are very numerous throughout, around which grow large aspen and balsam poplars. There are several rivers and creeks flowing into the Assiniboine, into which many of these marshes and swamps might be easily drained. White Mud River, which is the largest of them, is seventy feet wide, four feet deep, and very rapid, so rapid that it was with much difficulty we crossed it.\n\nI arrived at Fort Pelly on August 1st, where I found Mr. Hime and the others of my party. Next day I took observations for latitude and variation of compass, and in the afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Macdonald, who was in temporary charge of the fort, inspected the farm which the Company has here.\n\nThe crops had been beautiful at the beginning of the season, but have been all, except the potatoes, completely devoured by the grasshoppers.\n\nThe next day I rode to Swan River by the valley of \"Snake Creek\" with Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Hime. This beautiful valley contains all the requirements necessary for a settlement. The timber is very plentiful and of a good size; there is no pine, however, but the balsam spruce, which the\npeople here mistook for it, is abundant, and average two feet in diameter at five feet from the ground.\n\nThere is some tamarack also, tall and straight, from one foot six inches to two feet in diameter. The balsam and aspen poplars grow to a large size, and are everywhere to be had. The land for the most part is good sandy loam, and is traversed by numerous creeks. Snake Creek is about twelve feet wide, and one foot six inches deep, it yields plenty of fish, as also does one or two of those running into it.\n\nSwan River is from 90 to 100 feet wide and four feet deep; its current is very rapid, being about three miles an hour. It is very winding here where the Snake Creek joins it, and I believe is so all along.\n\nThe valley, which is about one mile and a quarter wide, and from 80 to 100 feet below the general level of the country, is most rich and fertile, but almost altogether filled up with trees, such as poplars, balsam spruce, and willows.\n\nThe next day, August 4th, we left Fort Pelly and proceeded along the base of the Duck Mountain, a part of the chain of mountains called the Dauphine; properly speaking, it is a high ridge between the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitobah.\n\nThe ground rises gradually from the river towards the summit of the so-called mountain, which appeared about three miles distant, and is thickly covered with poplars, so thick that the forest is nearly impenetrable.\n\nThe land for a few miles is rather light, but then becomes much better, and for the whole way to the \"Little Saskatchewan\" or Oak River, the eastern limit, according to your letter of instruction, to this line of exploration, the land may be said to be good sandy loam.\n\nIn a short report, as this must necessarily be, I cannot give descriptions of the different portions into which this side of the valley of the Assiniboine may be divided, but taking it as a whole, I may say, that in fertility of soil, timber, and water power, it surpasses any other part of the country that I have seen.\n\nI made several attempts to reach the summit of the mountain, particularly that part called the Riding Mountain, but was baffled each time by the extraordinary thickness of the woods of young poplars, among which there were lying the half-burnt remains of older trees, concealed by the long grass, vetches, convolvulus, and innumerable other plants.\n\nI cannot pass by, however, the valley of the Little Saskatchewan without making a special note of it.\n\nWe reached it on August 11th, and the next day I was able fortunately to take observations for latitude, &c., for early in the afternoon the sky became cloudy and a thunder-storm came on.\n\nNext morning, accompanied by Mr. Hime, who has been giving me great assistance in making the survey, I rode on horseback up the valley; we could only go, however fifteen miles, as the trees and underwood became then so marvellously dense as to make it quite impassable for horses.\n\nThe valley is about eighty feet below the general level of the country, the bottom of it is from half a mile to one mile wide, through which the river winds its way, flowing rapidly and uniformly; it is about forty feet wide, and at this time was five feet deep. There is no appearance of the valley ever being flooded, the willows which grow along its banks being green and luxuriant down to the ground.\n\nThere are large open flats occurring frequently on both sides of the river, when the richness of the grass and beauty of the many various flowers prove the great fertility of the soil, places marked out by nature to be cultivated and inhabited by man. There is abundance of good-sized poplars and balsam spruce sufficiently large for building and farming purposes.\n\nI followed the course of the valley down to its junction with the valley of the Assiniboine; for the greater part of the way it is rich and fertile, as is also the land adjoining. Within a few miles of the Assiniboine the country changes considerably, the soil is much lighter, and the trees fewer and smaller, and at the junction of the valleys the country is very poor indeed, being sandy and gravelly clay abounding with granite boulders of various sizes. I returned then by the same way to the track called \"the lower road from Red River to Fort Ellice,\" to where it crosses the Little Saskatchewan, and where I had left the greatest number of my party.\n\nFrom thence I proceeded by this track to Fort Ellice, stopping one day at Shoal Lake in order to make a survey of it. As this track joins the White Mud River road about eighteen miles from the Little Saskatchewan, which we travelled back on together from Fort Ellice to Red River, I need not give you any description of the country through which it passes.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) JAMES A. DICKINSON.\n\nEnclosure 2 in No. 2.\n\nFrom the \"Toronto Leader,\" October 28, 1858.\n\nSTEAM NAVIGATION UPON THE SASKATCHEWAN RIVER.\n\nTo the Editor of the New York Evening Post.\n\nThe river Saskatchewan, flowing from the Rocky Mountains eastwardly into Lake Winnipeg, is ascertained to embrace within its sources and tributaries an area of more than 300,000 square miles, as habitable as the adjacent state of Minnesota. This stream, if navigable for steamers, may bear an important relation to the development of British America. In a late article you quote the testimony of Sir George Simpson before the Parliamentary Committee, which implies rather than asserts, the unnavigability of the Saskatchewan. He lays stress upon the swift current and occasional rapids. A hasty inference from similar facts would pronounce the Missouri unnavigable.\nSir George Simpson is the author of a book \"Overland Journal around the World.\" Allow me to quote from this volume. A portion of his route was north-westwardly from the Selkirk Settlements on the Red River of the North. After twelve days' travel he crossed the Bow River or the south branch of the Saskatchewan, \"which,\" using his own words, \"takes its rise in the Rocky Mountains near the international frontier, and is of considerable size, without any impediment of any moment. At the crossing place the Bow River was about a third of a mile in width, with a strong current, and some twenty miles below falls into the main Saskatchewan, whence the two streams flow towards Lake Winnipeg, forming at their mouth the Grand Rapids of about three miles in length.\"\n\nIn latitude 35\u00b0; longitude 108\u00b0, the north of the Saskatchewan was crossed (these portages were in batteaux, drawing about four feet of water) by Governor Simpson's party. \"The Saskatchewan,\" he remarks, \"is here upwards of a quarter of a mile wide, presenting, as its name implies, a swift current. It is navigable for boats (this term means a Mackinac boat, of about four feet draught) from the Rocky Mountain House, in longitude 116\u00b0 to Lake Winnipeg, upwards of 700 miles in a direct line; but by the actual course of the stream nearly double that distance. Though above Edmonton the river is much obstructed by rapids, yet from that fort to Lake Winnipeg, it is descended without a portage, while even on the upward voyage, the only break in the navigation is the Grand Rapids already mentioned.\"\n\nAs a resident of St. Paul, I will add to the foregoing description the personal testimony of a Mr. James M'Kay, an intelligent partner of the Hudson Bay Company, who is in charge of Fort Ellice, a trading post, situated about five days' journey beyond the Minnesota frontier. He insists that both arms of the Saskatchewan are as navigable as the Mississippi at Saint Paul, quite to the vicinity of the mountains. He accompanied Captain Palliser (a gentleman who has led an exploring party to the Rocky Mountains, under the auspices of the London Geographical Society, assisted by the English Government,) far up the Bow or South Saskatchewan, and he fully confirms Governor Simpson's original statement, adding that he has even passed the rapids, near Lake Winnipeg, with loaded batteaux. To the same effect are the assurances of many residents of the Red River settlement.\n\nIn this connexion permit me to reproduce, in the columns of the \"Evening Post,\" the statements of a committee of the Minnesota Legislature in support of the proposition that the western districts of Minnesota may be connected by continuous steamboat navigation with a point at the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, which is only eight days' journey from the gold districts of British Columbia:\n\n\"The head of steamboat navigation on the Red River of the North is in about 46\u00b0 23'. The river flowing from south to north is, according to Captain John Pope, five feet deep at the mouth of Sioux Wood River; six feet twenty miles north, at the site of a military post proposed by Major S. Woods, 6th infantry, in 1849, and now occupied as Fort Abercrombie; thence to Shyenne River, six feet; from Shyenne to Goose River, nine feet, but with an intervening rapid one mile long, with five feet upon it; from Goose River to Pembina and Lake Winnipeg, sixteen feet deep.\n\n\"Lake Winnipeg is 250 miles long, navigable by a propeller or any class of vessels. From its northern extremity the Saskatchewan is navigable 700 miles west, on an air line, (much further by the windings of the stream,) with no material obstacle except the rapids at the mouth of the river.\n\n\"The traveller may ascend the north and south branch of the Saskatchewan by either route, reaching the immediate vicinity of favourable passes through the Rocky Mountains. If at this moment these links of international navigation were connected by vessels, the overland journey to the head-quarters of Fraser River could be made in twenty-four days. The volume and depth of the Saskatchewan is fully equal to the Mississippi above Cairo.\"\n\nThese facts are important with reference to an emigration route from Minnesota to British Columbia; but the events of the last ninety days clearly indicate that Great Britain has no more favourite measure under consideration, alike by government, press, and people, than a railroad and telegraph from Lake Superior to Puget Sound on or near the latitude of fifty degrees north. Waggon and steamboats will constitute the first stage of such an enterprise, but the interest of the future confederation of British America demand powerful provinces and a populous naval and commercial station on the North Pacific. And to secure these objects speedily, within the next five years, a continental railroad, constructed with the aid of liberal land donations and a guarantee of a fixed income by the Imperial Treasury, is inevitable.\n\nBut while this vital measure is maturing, the capacity of the Minnesota and Saskatchewan areas for internal communications should be made familiar to the world. I think the readers of the \"Evening Post\" may be assured that early next spring a steamboat will be running from a point of the Red River of the North, 200 miles north-west of Saint Paul, into Lake Winnipeg, and if certain arrangements by Galena and Toronto parties are consummated during the coming winter, the remainder of the journey to the Fraser River mines, except the last 200 miles, will also be accomplished by steam navigation.\n\nJ.

Government House, Toronto, December 14, 1858.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honour to enclose for your information,\u2014\n1. A copy of a report from Professor Hind, on the subject of the Red River and Saskatchewan country.\n2. Extract from a Chicago paper. This is important, as showing the interest taken in the subject in the United States.\n\nRight Hon. Sir E. B. Lytton, Bart., &c., &c., &c.\n\n(Signed) EDMUND HEAD.\n\nEnclosure 1 in No. 3.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the result of an exploration of the salt region on Winnipegoosis Lake, and of the country traversed since the 18th of September, the day of my departure from Red River, to October 31st.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Fleming, I skirted the west coast of Lake Winnipeg in a Red River freighter's boat, with a crew of seven men, as far as the mouth of the Little Saskatchewan River. Our progress through the southern half of Lake Winnipeg was delayed by contrary winds, which, however, afforded me time and opportunity to collect numerous specimens in illustration of the rocks exposed on the islands and coast, and to accumulate materials for a geological map of the country.\n\nNumerous rock exposures, showing sandstones, limestones, and shale of Silurian age, are met with some sixty miles north of the mouth of Red River. On some of the islands the exposures are, geologically, of great interest; but with the exception of sandstone, fit for building purposes or the manufacture of grindstones, and of yellow ochre of a fine quality in a siliceous limestone rock, no economic materials of particular interest or value were seen. The west coast of Lake Winnipeg, after passing Grindstone point, is very deeply indented with bays, whose extremities cannot always be seen from the traverse between the points at their outlets. Frequent soundings showed sixty feet to be the greatest depth in the part of the lake we visited; twelve to twenty-four feet being the general depth within two miles of the shores. In no point seen do the rocky escarpments exceed sixty feet in altitude, but when they are found having that elevation, they present a succession of wild, picturesque, and rugged scenes. The lowest rock, often at the water's edge, is a sandstone, very friable, and easily disintegrated by waves and atmospheric agents. Above this a limestone, beautifully stratified and of a very hard and compact character, occasionally projects for many feet, the beech below being strewed with large masses which have fallen off from time to time. In the shaly portion numerous nodules of iron pyrites occur, assimilating the forms of shells, spheroids, disks, &c. Both the limestone and sandstone are nearly destitute of fossils, but the shale contains certain forms in great abundance, in a very fragile condition. The rocks on the west coast of Lake Winnipeg, and on many of the islands, are fossiliferous, while the east side is wholly azoic. The azoic and fossiliferous rocks often approach one another, but I was not fortunate enough to find on the east side the fossiliferous rocks reposing on the \"azoic.\"\n\nOur course to the salt region lay up the Little Saskatchewan, a fine broad river leading from Lake Manitobah into Lake Winnipeg, and forming the chief outlet by which the drainage water of a very large tract of country finds its way to the sea. The Little Saskatchewan flows for sixteen to eighteen miles through a flat country with clay banks, which never exceed thirty feet in altitude. The river is rapid, and in some parts shallow, its channel being often obstructed by boulders, although it nowhere opposes an obstacle to the passage of craft drawing less than two and a half feet of water. This river issues from St. Martin's Lake, a sheet of water about sixteen miles long, and of the same breadth. The rocks in St. Martin's Lake possess some remarkable geological relations. Near the narrows, at its eastern extremity, are two gneissoid islands, and close to them one of metamorphosed sandstone, with the tilted strata of sandstone inclined at an angle but a few degrees from the vertical. West of these gneissoid islands and about half a mile distant from them, Sugar island discloses cliffs of metamorphosed sandstone, inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0, and dipping N. 70\u00b0 W. This sandstone contains some very obscure fossil remains, in which the stems of conifers were thought to have been recognized.\n\nThe occurrence of metamorphosed Silurian strata, even on a small scale, is of very great interest. The gneissoid rocks were traversed by quartz and felspathic veins; but although a careful search was made for the precious metal, none was found.\n\nSugar Island is named from the ash-leaved maple which grows there, and furnishes a supply of sugar to the Indians who inhabit this part of the country. About six miles west of Sugar Island, horizontal and undisturbed limestone, highly fossiliferous, is seen exposed in cliffs about 16 feet high, on Thunder Island, so named in remembrance of a thunderstorm of great violence, accompanied by hail and rain, which detained us on the afternoon of September 28th. St. Martin's Lake is very shallow, and, in many places, thickly set with weeds. By the action of ice, long semicircular accumulations of boulders have been driven up in shallow places, forming reefs, which soon become islands, or connecting with the main land, cut off large portions of the lake, and give rise to the formation of marshes and swamps in their rear; the effect of this is gradually to diminish the size of the lake on one side, and probably to increase it, though not to the same extent, in another direction. These constant changes were observed on a larger scale some weeks later in Winnipegoosis and Dauphin Lakes, and will be fully discussed in my general report. Their relation to the past history and probable future of an extensive portion\nof the country included within the Salt region is very instructive and curious. St. Martin's Lake receives the waters of Partridge Crop River, which flows for the most part through a flat limestone country, not ten feet above the present level of the lake, and often not five feet above the river, many parts, indeed, being even now nothing more than extensive wide-spread marshes through which the river meanders.\n\nAt the upper end of Partridge Crop River the mission of Fairford is established, where I was very hospitably entertained by the Rev. Mr. Stagg. The present prospects of this mission are, at first sight, encouraging; but, when the number of years during which missionary labour has been directed to the Indians frequenting Partridge Crop River, and the neighbouring country is considered, perhaps no more hopeful results have been obtained than can be discerned at other stations of by-gone reputation and worn-out resources.\n\nWe entered Lake Manitobah on the 29th September, and fortunately found some fine rock exposures on the east coast, which will enable me to carry on the succession of rocks in their order of occurrence. A few days' sailing and pulling brought us to the mouth of Water Hen River, which we ascended, and entered Water Hen Lake; then passing on to Winnipegoosis Lake, we arrived at the salt springs about six miles N.W. of Moss River, on the 5th October. We spent two days at this place, occupying the time in making a plan of the works and springs, and examining the surrounding country. It may be sufficient here to state, in relation to the manufacture of salt, that the method employed is of the rudest and most primitive description; nevertheless, the salt obtained is abundant in quantity, and excellent in quality. Wells, to a depth of five feet, are sunk near a spot where a little bubbling brine spring is found. I saw several of these springs at some distance from the wells, which, to the number of 26 had already been opened. The brine is carried in buckets to the evaporating pans, which are of iron, about five feet long, two feet broad and sixteen inches deep, placed on rough stones so arranged as to form the sides of a rude furnace below the kettles. The salt is removed by wooden shovels from the pans as fast as it accumulates, and is stored for transmission to Red River without further purification. From each pan about four bushels of salt on an average can be procured daily during the long days of summer. Wood for fuel is close at hand, and of brine an unlimited quantity could doubtless be procured by boring. When a well does not yield brine freely enough, another is dug near to it; none of them, however, are more than five or six feet deep, and no attempt at boring or deep sinking has been made, the supply of brine being sufficiently abundant for all present purposes. The rock exposures are found at or near the springs. The soil in which the wells are dug is a stiff yellow clay, very retentive and holding drift boulders of limestone, with a few of the non-fossiliferous rocks. From the general aspect of the country, there can be little doubt that boring would bring an abundance of brine to the surface. Large areas of, so called, salt ground, that is, of ground absolutely barren, and often covered with efflorescent salts, are plentifully distributed over the country bordering Winnipegoosis Lake, and the existence of various brine springs is well known to Indians and half-breeds from Swan River to beyond the Assiniboine, a distance exceeding 250 miles in an air line. At several places salt has been and is now manufactured, or is known to occur as a thick coat on the ground, north and south of the salt springs just described. These are the salt springs of Swan River, and of Duck River at the foot of Duck Mountain, the springs at Salt point, Winnipegoosis Lake, at Crane River, Manitobah Lake, and at the Scratching River south of the Assiniboine. It will be shown in my general report that the salt bearing rocks probably extend from near the Saskatchewan to beyond the 49th parallel in a general north and south direction, and it is extremely probable that, with boring, brine would be found in workable quantities over a very extensive area of country in the direction indicated above.\n\nLeaving the salt springs, we ascended Moss River, and after some delay, owing to the shallowness of the water and the occurrence of rapids involving portages, we reached Dauphin Lake. The elevation of this extensive sheet of water above the sea is about 660 feet. Its length may reach twenty miles, but its breadth does not exceed ten. It receives several tributaries which rise in the Duck or in the Riding Mountain, none of them capable of receiving a freighter's boat for more than seven miles from the Lake. To the west of Dauphin Lake lies the imposing range of the Riding Mountains, the nearest point of its summit being about seventeen miles distant from the shores of the Lake.\n\nNorth-east of Dauphin Lake is the Duck Mountain, a high range of table-land, similar in its external aspect to the Riding Mountain. From the imposing appearance which the Riding Mountain presents from Dauphin Lake, and the singular relation it bears to the level marshy plain from which it rises, I thought it would be highly advisable, if possible, to reach the summit. Several difficulties were urged by the Indians we met against the ascent, chiefly on account of the swampy and boggy character of the level country at its foot. They stated that no difficulty would be found in passing through the valley between the Riding Mountain and Duck Mountain by an Indian \"pitching\" track. It appeared, however, important that an ascent should be made in as direct a line as possible from Dauphin Lake to the nearest and highest point; and with this object I set out with Mr. Fleming, four men, and an Indian on the 8th October. The statement of the Indians respecting the existence of formidable swamps and bogs was quite true, and it was with some difficulty we got through them. On the evening of the first day we encamped at the foot of the mountain, having accomplished a distance of twelve miles and a half. In the afternoon of the second day we reached the summit. The latter part of the ascent was very steep, through a forest containing very fine white spruce, aspen, poplar, and birch. The Riding Mountain at its eastern exposure forms the abrupt termination of a series of elevated table-lands, which rise one above another from the south and west by distinct steps, commencing within thirty miles of the Assiniboine. Its breadth is consequently about forty miles; its altitude above Lake Dauphin fully exceeds 1,000 feet, which makes it nearly 1,700 feet above the sea. The whole of its rise above Dauphin Lake is embraced within five miles and a half, but its greatest rise is included within a mile and a half. The eastern escarpment of the Riding Mountain bears the aspect of an ancient sea-coast once abrupt, afterwards by atmospheric influence rounded, abraded, and sloped. The last rise is very steep, showing a cliff bank of drift clay with boulders, about 250 feet high, terminating in a sharp well-defined margin at its summit, from which the country slopes very gently westward.\nOnly one rock exposure was met with during the ascent; this occurred at an elevation of about 600 feet above Dauphin Lake, and I was at once enabled to identify the formation with its extension on the Little Souris, the Assiniboine below Fort Ellice and the Qu'appelle, or Calling River.\n\nThe result I obtained by the ascent of the Riding Mountain has been of great interest in a geological point of view, since it has unlocked in a great measure the geology of this region of country. Such bold eminences as the Riding and Duck Mountains uprearing their eastern flanks to an altitude exceeding 1,000 feet above the surrounding country naturally gave rise to many conjectures as to their origin and composition. They are probably nothing more than the remains of vast table lands, stretching from the Saskatchewan Valley to the Laurentine Mountains, which have escaped denudation, and the uniform dip of the strata wherever seen appears to show that no disturbance has taken place since the Silurian period.\n\nThe forest on the summit of the Riding Mountain is very fine, vindicating the soil and climate of Rupert's land from the sweeping detractions which have been urged against them. I beg to subjoin the circumference, five feet from the ground, of a few trees within fifty yards of our camp on the Riding Mountain:\u2014Aspen, 4ft., 6in.; 4ft., 6in.; 4ft., 1in.; 3ft., 9in.; 5ft.; white spruce, 7ft., 3in.; 5ft., 6in.; 6ft., 6in.; birch, 3ft., 6in.; 3ft.; poplar, 4ft., 9in.; 4ft., 6in. These trees represent, as far as observations permitted, the general character of the forest on the summit plateau of the Riding Mountain.\n\nDuring the night of our encampment a snow-storm came on, and in the morning six inches of snow warned us to hasten to lower and more genial regions. We accomplished the return to the boat on Dauphin Lake on the afternoon of the fourth day, but I regret to say that the constant wading through ice-cold water for many hours together, in crossing swamps, disabled two of the men, who suffered much pain in the head and limbs until partially relieved by bleeding, vomiting, and warm applications.\n\nThe character of the region between Manitoba Lake and the Riding Mountain remained to be ascertained in order to complete a general outline of a topographical sketch of the country. With some difficulty I prevailed upon an Indian to guide me from Dauphin Lake in as straight a line as possible to the Hudson's Bay Company's Post on Lake Manitoba, a distance of seventy miles from our camp. I then placed the boat in charge of Mr. Fleming, instructing him to meet me at the Manitoba Post as soon as possible. With a half-breed and an Indian as guide I proceeded across the country, fortunately without knowing its character beforehand, or I should scarcely have ventured on such a fatiguing journey at so late a season of the year. For thirty miles we had to wade through marshes and bogs, separated by low ridges; in fact the distance named may be said to be made up of marsh, bog, ridge; marsh, bog, ridge in most wearisome succession. We had horses to carry our provisions and bedding, but the bogs were so bad that, in order to get the horses through, we were compelled to carry the load ourselves. A thin crust of ice a quarter of an inch thick, was formed over the surface the night after our start, which added in no slight degree to the fatigue of the journey. Upon our arrival at the post I was very hospitably received by Mr. McKenzie, the gentleman in charge.\n\nThe greater part of the country lying between Manitoba Lake and Dauphin Lake, between Dauphin Lake and the Riding Mountain, and between the southern part of Winnipegoos Lake and the Duck Mountain, may be considered as having recently emerged from the former extension of the Lakes just named. This emergence has resulted from the lowering of the waters of the Lakes by drainage, and not by a rising of the land. The Little Saskatchewan is not the only outlet from Manitoba Lake into Lake Winnipeg, and before these outlets were eroded to their present depth, the waters in Lakes Dauphin and Manitoba were evidently about fifteen or twenty feet above their present level. This is shown by the lowest beach round Lake Dauphin, which on the west side is well preserved about seven miles distant from the present shores. Between Dauphin Lake and Lake Manitoba, the ancient coast of the latter for a long period of time is about twenty miles due west from the Hudson's Bay post, and it follows the shores of the lake until lost in the general rise of the prairie near White Mud River. I find the impression prevailing among Indians and half-breeds, familiar with the general outline of this region of country, that the lakes are fast lowering their level, and although they agree in the popular error of supposing here, as elsewhere, that there is a rise and fall every seven years, yet the fall is considered to be greater than the rise. If the drainage of many thousand of square miles of swamp and marsh in this part of the country should ever become a question of national interest, I know of no enterprise of the kind which could be executed with so little cost of time and labor, and promise at the same time such wide-spread beneficial results.\n\nCommencing about fifteen or twenty miles south of my track, as shown on the map which accompanies this report, the country is represented to be dry, and to contain large areas of land fit for agricultural purposes. This statement, received from persons familiar with its general character, is partly confirmed by the observations we were able to make when on White Mud River, in September. Our course will be seen on the map which accompanied the last report I had the honour to address to you.\n\nFrom the 17th to the 28th October, while awaiting Mr. Fleming's arrival, I was employed in examining the country in the neighbourhood of the Manitoba Post, and as far as Manitoba Island, from which the lake takes its name. I spent four days on this island, which has acquired celebrity from the superstitious belief of the Indians, that it is the abode of a kind of \"Manitou\" or fairies. Limestone is here exposed in cliffs 15 feet high on the north side, it contains but few fossils, is extremely hard, and produces when struck with the hammer a distinct ring, so that when the waves beat on the shore and strike on the shingle or base of the cliffs a loud musical sound, not unlike the ringing of a large number of distant church bells, is produced. Limestone of a very compact and fine grained description occurs in massive layers a few feet from the ground, and many small pieces well adapted for lithographic purposes can be procured, but I fear in an economic point of view the value of the rock, as a source of lithographic stone in large slabs, is inconsiderable, on account of the occurrence of the forms of shells which have been replaced by crystalline carbonate of lime of a softer description than the matrix.\n\nFrom Manitoba Post we proceeded by the east coast of Lake Manitoba to Oak point, where we exchanged our boat for horses and carts, and started for Red River, via Shoal Lake, where we arrived on the 31st October.\nOn the 18th September Mr. Dickinson started to explore the country between the Assiniboine and the 49th parallel, in accordance with instructions, of which a copy is herewith transmitted. I beg to refer you to Mr. Dickinson's report for an account of the results of his exploration. The examination of the country east of Red River was undertaken with a view to place you in possession of a summer reconnaissance of that important district, Mr. Dawson's explanation having been made during the winter months when the swamps and bogs were frozen.\n\nThe map which accompanies this report is based upon Thompson's map, with such alterations as the time at our disposal enables us to make. It is only intended to illustrate, for the present, the general features of the country, as well as to show our several tracks and the area traversed. The dotted red line indicates the general direction of the tracks followed, but the traverses made from time to time are not represented, these with the soundings (upwards of 350 by the lead) are necessarily reserved for the general report, and its accompanying maps and charts.\n\nMr. Hine occupied the period of his stay on Red River in executing a large number of photographs of scenery, churches, buildings, Indians, &c. which will form an interesting and valuable collection.\n\nI am glad to be able to state that during this last exploration, as in the summer expedition to the south branch of the Saskatchewan, no accident or untoward event of any description has occurred to interfere with our progress or lessen its results.\n\nIn inspecting the accompanying map I beg to refer you to the one which accompanies the report dated September 10th, from which the connection between the two explorations will be apparent.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(Signed) HENRY Y. HIND,\nIn charge of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition.\n\nThe Hon. the Provincial Secretary,\n&c. &c. &c.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRed River Settlement, Sept. 16, 1858.\n\nOne of the alleged drawbacks to the settlement of the valley of Red River and the Assiniboine is the scarcity of timber fit for building purposes. You will remember that during our journey up the Assiniboine in June last we frequently saw an extensive forest stretching for many miles in a southerly direction on the right or south bank of the river. It is very desirable that the nature and extent of the forest should be determined, and the character of the timber composing it ascertained. As soon, therefore, as you can complete your preparations I would wish you to determine the limits or boundaries of the forest referred to, and by making frequent traverses or intersections ascertain the general character of its timber.\n\nAs far as it is consistent with the safety of your party you will also examine the country between the Assiniboine River and the 49th parallel west of Red River; and, if time permits, the country east of Red River, and between German Creek and the 49th parallel.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nJames A. Dickinson, Esq.,\n&c. &c.\n\n(Signed) H. Y. HIND.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRed River Settlement, November 2, 1858.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of instruction, dated September 16; I proceeded with my party on the 18th to examine those various portions of the country therein specified.\n\nAs the country east of Red River, extending to the Lake of the Woods is quite unknown, except for a few miles back from the river, to any but to those Indians who have there their hunting grounds, I was anxious to procure one of them as a guide. Having succeeded in doing so, after some little delay, I was obliged to examine this part of the country first, as the Indian guide was about to leave the settlement in a few days, for his winter-quarters, and if I had not secured his services immediately, would have failed in doing so afterwards.\n\nConsidering that one of the objects of this exploration should be that of seeing where a summer road could be most easily made from Red River to the Lake of the Woods; that being now a subject of great interest among the settlers, who were about sending a party out for that special purpose. I thought it advisable first to go along the straight picket line made by Mr. Dawson last winter\u2014in which direction I understood, he reports that a road can be made for some miles\u2014in order that I might be able to institute a comparison between this and any other portion of the adjacent country through which the Indian might guide me.\n\nThe first day I was able only to go about fourteen miles, two-thirds of this distance at least being through marsh and wet prairie. My general course was along the picket line, from which I was obliged to diverge frequently, sometimes a mile or more, but always keeping it in view, in order to avoid when possible, the wide and many marshes through which it passes. The next day, I continued in the same direction, and having reached a point opposite the twenty-second mile post on the picket line, I could go no further, being stopped by a swamp or quagmire, impassable for horses or even men, extending in front for many miles, and on both sides as far as the eye could reach. Though taking advantage of all the dry places within reach, ten miles of the course I took lay through marsh and wet land, and five miles at least through swamp. There are a few small clumps of young aspens along the line, and low willows in some of the marshes; but far away towards the north may be seen some clumps of larger trees.\n\nThe land is for the most part a rich loam with a sub-soil of sandy clay, but the difficulty, or rather the impossibility of draining the numerous swamps and marshes, and the want of timber, render this tract of country unfit for settlement; and for the same reasons, the difficulty of constructing a suitable road through it would be very considerable and the expenses enormous.\n\nJudging then that I had seen enough of this part of the country for my purposes, I retraced my steps to the settlement, from which I set out again, under the guidance of the Indian, who promised to con-\nduct me by the only dry path towards the Lake of the Woods, as far as the boundary of his hunting grounds.\n\nOn the morning of the 23rd, I proceeded along the south side of \"La Rivi\u00e8re Seine,\" or German Creek, which flows into the Red River, a little below its junction with the Assiniboine. There are farm houses and good road along it for a distance of five miles, when the Indian track then begins, which keeps close to the valleys of the creek for eight miles, between it and the marsh which is shown on the map.\n\nThis dry space varies from half a mile to a quarter of a mile wide, crossed by two small sluggish creeks, which, if widened and deepened, would effectually drain the marsh. There is plenty of good timber along the valley, consisting of poplars, elm, and black ash, with small oaks. Leaving the German creek here on our left, we went along a low ridge about one foot above the level of the marsh, and varying in width from fifty to one hundred yards. It runs in a south-east direction for about three miles, and then widens out on the left as far as I could see, and on the right to half a mile. At this point we were about three miles from German Creek, which we lose sight of now for some time. Continuing in the same direction for three miles more, through beautiful rich grass, with clumps of aspen on the left and high willows on the right, we came to a creek called Oak Creek, which is about two chains wide, but so still and sluggish that it rather resembles a long lake. Our course then lay along it nearly due east for two miles and a half, when the creek then turns to the south. This would be an admirable place for a settlement, the land being as rich as any in the whole country, and there being a large supply of oaks, averaging one foot six inches in diameter, and poplars suitable for fencing. On the south side of Oak Creek the open prairie stretches away to the horizon, the greater part of that which was within view being dry, there being only a few patches of wet land.\n\nLeaving Oak Creek we went through a country of this character for about nine miles in a south-east direction, our track winding, however, a little to avoid the wet places, a few of which we had to cross, none of them, however, being more than seven or eight chains wide, and easy of crossing. There are numerous clumps of small aspens and willows in every direction. We then proceeded nearly due east for about seven miles, German Creek being from one mile and a half to two miles and a half on the north, a beautiful and rich prairie lying between us and it, and on the south, one mile distant, runs a well-wooded ridge parallel with our course. Then turning to south-east we wound round numerous and large clumps of aspens, from five to thirty feet high, and willows for seven miles, when we came to a rising ground so densely covered with young aspens and fallen timber that it was impossible for carts to go further. We therefore left them here, and made packs of a few things for the horses to carry. Here the land becomes of a lighter description, being of light sandy and clay loam. The timber has been all burnt. The ground was so thickly strewed with the fallen logs that it was with much difficulty the horses could travel. Two miles further on we came to the banks of German Creek. Its valley here is from fifteen to twenty chains wide, and about forty feet deep. It is full of excellent timber, elm, oak, poplar, and black ash, all large enough for building purposes. The creek, which is here very rapid, is thirty feet wide and about one foot six inches deep. We follow its course now for twenty-seven miles, never being more than half a mile away from it. The country through which we passed is for the most part covered with trees of various kinds, growing in large clumps, balsam poplar, aspen, tamarack, balsam spruce, cedar, and oak. The whole country has been burnt some years ago; the remains of the timber everywhere to be found indicate that there was once a vast forest of large trees.\n\nThe Indian guide now said he had come to the boundary of his own country, and could not bring me further; and though I tried to induce him, by every means, he remained firm to his resolution.\n\nHe was unwilling for some time even to give me a description of the country beyond, but finally I procured from him the following account:\n\nAt half a day's journey on snow shoes, or a distance of fifteen miles from where we were, there is a mountain or ridge, thickly covered with trees, stretching towards the Lake of the Woods. A part of this intervening space is a swamp, in which grow tamarack, cedar, and spruce; the remainder is dry ground, covered with small aspen and willow. Passing along the \"mountain,\" you come to a marsh which extends to the Lake of the Woods, but through it there flows a river, up which large canoes could come within the hearing of a gun shot, or about two miles from the mountain. The entire length of the way I had come was seventy miles, fifty miles at least of this distance being fit for settlement, and throughout the whole of it a road could be made without the slightest difficulty, and at little cost. If time and means had permitted I would have pushed through to the lake, but under the circumstances I considered it better not to attempt it.\n\nFrom the description given by the Indian of the country, and which I think may be relied on as correct, I am of the opinion that a road can be easily made through it.\n\nI returned by the same track as I came by for some distance, when I crossed German Creek at a place about thirty-five miles from its mouth, and then continued along the north side of it.\n\nAt this crossing place there are two or three houses, the commencement of a settlement, which is likely to be quickly extended.\n\nOn the 1st of October I set out again to examine the country between the Assiniboine, on the forty-ninth parallel; and more particularly the forest which was said to extend for so many miles to the south from the river at Prairier Portage.\n\nProceeding along the road to St. Paul, I turned off from it where it crosses \"La Rivi\u00e8re Sale\" (or Stinking River), and went by the hunter's track on the south side of the river, along which it goes for thirty miles, cutting across the large bends of the valley, which is very winding, and through which the river meanders in a remarkable manner.\n\nThe country lying between it and the Assiniboine is very marshy, and is covered with willows and clumps of small aspens. In the valley, and along both sides, grow oak and elm, and some few ash. Many trees two feet in diameter; they extend the whole way up the river. On the south side there is a prairie, apparently as level and boundless as the ocean; the grass on it is most beautiful and luxuriant, indicating the richness of the soil.\nThe valley is about twenty chains wide, and forty feet deep; there are many salt springs in it, which make the water in the river quite brackish, from which it derives its name. The river higher up opens out into small lakes, and rises from a marsh which is very extensive.\n\nThe track here joins the hunter's track from the White Horse plains; it turns to the south, in which direction it goes for about twelve miles, when it then turns nearly due south for fifteen miles, where it crosses \"La Rivi\u00e8re des Isle de Bois,\" a river fifteen feet wide, and two feet deep; it flows into the Scratchy River. This portion of the country is all a level prairie, the greater part of it wet and marshy, except near this river, when it is quite dry for five miles; the land is a rich sandy loam, yielding most luxuriant grasses. On both sides of the river there is a skirting of trees, oaks chiefly, averaging one foot six inches in diameter.\n\nThe buffalo hunters, when they have crossed this little river, begin to keep a sharp look out for the Sioux, and to take their usual precautions.\n\nThe track, continuing in the same direction, crosses a prairie twenty miles wide.\n\nThis prairie is of light sandy soil, with clumps of aspens and willows growing here and there. It is intersected by many small valleys, in all of which, with one exception, the creeks that formed them are now dried up. The Valley of \"La Rivi\u00e8re Tabac\" is seven chains wide, and twenty feet deep. There was but very little water at this time in the creek, but in spring there is a rapid flow.\n\nThe prairie on the south and west is bounded by what is generally called the \"Pembina Mountain,\" which is rather a series of steps rising up from the prairie below to one above. There are three steps, from ten to fifteen feet high, together with a gradual ascent for two miles; the whole of it is thickly strewed with boulders of granite. This \"mountain,\" which consists of clay, gravel, and sand, runs in a south-easterly direction from a little above Prairie Portage to Pembina. Where we crossed there is no timber, but on both sides it is well covered, particularly on the south, where the trees seemed large and good. Here the forest is said to begin which reaches to the Assiniboine, but with the exception of some oaks on the mountain, there is no good timber, nothing but young aspens from twenty to thirty feet high, growing very close together, forming a dense thicket. On reaching the summit of the \"mountain,\" the track turns to the west, across a prairie called the \"Round Prairie.\" It is perfectly level and open for six miles; on the north and south it is bounded by woods of poplars. On its western limit, within a few hundred yards of the track, there is a conical hill about 200 feet high, called the \"Calf's Tent,\" rather a remarkable looking object, rising as it does so abruptly from out the level plain, and alone.\n\nWe then crossed an undulating prairie ten miles wide, covered with willow and clumps of aspen from twenty to forty feet high; the soil is a rich sandy loam. This part of the country is quite destitute of water; there are no creeks, and the ponds, which are said to be generally full of water, were now quite dry. From twelve o'clock one day till two o'clock next we could find none.\n\nHere commences the hilly district. Its highest hills, which can be seen so well from the banks of the Assiniboine, are called the \"Blue Hills.\" The general direction of its eastern boundary is nearly south-west and north-east. The track now turns towards the north-west; the country it traverses for thirteen miles may be described generally to be an undulating rolling prairie, studded with numerous conical and dome-shaped hills, from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet high, some covered with willows and aspen, and some quite bare. They are all composed of sand and gravel, mixed with clay, and having on their flanks many granite boulders.\n\nRunning parallel with our track for some miles is a valley ten chains wide and twenty-five feet deep, called \"Le Grand Coule,\" in which there is no water, and we crossed many smaller ones, also dry, connecting with it.\n\nHere I left the track, and went in a northerly direction to the thick poplar woods, the \"Le Grand Bois\" of the French half-breeds, which seemed six or seven miles away, but on arriving there I found it to consist only of large clumps of aspens and balsam poplar, which at a distance looked like a dense and continuous wood, as it is commonly supposed to be by the buffalo hunters. The trees, though high, only average about nine inches in diameter.\n\nI made several traverses hereabouts and found that at a distance from one to three miles back from the open prairie the wood becomes densely thick, quite impenetrable in many places.\n\nThe trees are all small, none greater than one foot in diameter; they are of the poplar species, with here and there a young oak or a sugar maple.\n\nOn my return to the hunters' track we passed by a pretty lake, about three miles long and half a mile broad, surrounded by a close mass of poplars and willows. We came upon the track at a point about four miles to the west of where we had left it, and followed its winding through the hills, still going to the north-west. There are here many isolated hills as well as chains of hills running in every direction.\n\nThe low ground is generally marshy, through which gently flow several small creeks, all emptying themselves into a stream on our left, which we cross seven miles further on.\n\nThis stream is six feet wide and two feet deep: it flows in a valley fifty feet deep and about twelve chains wide. The ground here is much covered with granite boulders and fragments of shale.\n\nObserving this broken shale throughout the whole of the hilly district to be lying about in every direction on the surface, and often turned up by the badger. I searched on the hill side and along the valley for solid rock, but could find none. I suppose, therefore, from its similarity in appearance, to be drift from the rocks on the Little Souris and other places towards the north where it was found to exist. The country now becomes more hilly than before, and is completely covered with low willows, oaks, and poplars, single and in clumps, grow plentifully on all sides. There are several small lakes on several of which were flocks of beautiful white swans.\n\nThe main woods on the right are here from five to six miles distant. This whole region was once upon a time an extensive forest of oaks, for everywhere the remains of them are to be found. On the left there are large clumps of balsam poplar, forming for several miles almost a continuous forest. We crossed another of those valleys, here so numerous, called \"Le grand coute de la gros butte,\" deriving its name from a large conical hill about 200 feet high. The valley varies in width from twenty to thirty chains and is about eighty feet deep, but appearing much deeper in many places by reason of the\nhills adjoining it. The sides are very precipitous, and the bottom quite level and all covered with beautiful grass; there is no creek flowing through it, or even the appearance of any recent one. Two miles up in it, towards the north, there is a small lake and another valley branching off from it, which we crossed four miles further on; in it there is a small creek, six feet wide, and one foot six inches deep. The track turning to the north soon comes close to \"Le grand coute de la gros butte,\" and continues along it for nine miles.\n\nThe scenery is now very wild and beautiful; the valley, the bottom of which is eighty feet below the general level of the country, cuts through ranges of hills, many of them 150 feet high, and winds round the base of others, some bare and rugged and some covered with poplars. There are many lakes of various sizes which add considerably to the picturesque beauty of this peculiar region, the favourite haunt of the moose and red deer.\n\nTravelling on five miles more we reached the top of a hill, where suddenly burst on our view a vast undulating prairie, stretching away to the Assiniboine and Little Souris. The track, which had been very faint for some time, here became quite invisible; it was thought advisable therefore to return to where another one had been seen branching off some six or seven miles back. Having regained it, we followed it for eighteen miles, still among the \"Blue Hills,\" crossing the low ridges and winding through the valleys between the high hills, several of them 300 feet high, and around many pretty lakes, when we then came upon the open prairie.\n\nFrom this across to the Assiniboine is thirteen miles. The prairie is thickly spread over with low willows, and is swampy in many places; there are but a few clumps of young aspens to relieve its bleak and dreary aspect.\n\nThe valley of the Assiniboine, where we crossed it, forty miles above Prairie Portage, is about one mile and a quarter wide; its sides are much broken and indented. The poplar and oaks, which it is full of, are all young, none exceeding fifteen feet in height, and there are no trees of any kind along either side for many miles. The river is at this point ten chains wide and three feet deep, and has a hard gravelly bottom, so that we forded it very easily. On the north side of the river are the sand hills through which we passed last June. The forest, whose southern limits I have ascertained, extends twenty miles above Prairie Portage along the river where, where it then dies away. I remained at Prairie Portage three days making explorations of the forest, and obtaining information concerning it from some people who were well acquainted with it. I found that the good timber grows merely along the river in width from half a mile to three miles; beyond that the wood is exactly similar to what it is on the south side. Here and there among the young poplars are solitary oaks at long intervals, many of them two feet in diameter, the remnants doubtless of a fine forest. About eight miles back from the river there is a large clump of balsam spruce, but which are all small. The following is a list of the different trees and their dimensions, which form the band of good timber along the river. Oak, 2 ft. in diameter; aspens, 2 ft.; balsam poplar, 2 ft. 9 in.; elm, 1 ft. 3 in.; bass wood, 2 ft. 6 in.; ash (very few) 1 ft. There is an abundant supply of oaks straight and tall, 1 ft. 6 in. in diameter; and of balsam poplar, 2 ft. On the \"Pembina Mountain\" there is some good timber, including tamarack, not found elsewhere, which only averages, I am told, 9 in. in diameter.\n\nIn my final report I hope to give a more detailed and specific account of the country that has been examined.\n\nYours, &c.\n\nProfessor H. Y. Hind,\n\n&c. &c. &c.\n\n(Signed) JAMES A. DICKENSON.\n\nEnclosure 2 in No. 3.\n\nExtract from Toronto \"Leader,\" Dec. 14, 1858.\n\nSTEAMBOATS ON THE RED RIVER, THE SASKATCHEWAN, AND LAKE WINIPEG.\n\n(From the Chicago Press.)\n\nWe had the pleasure of an interview a day or two since with Captain Blakely, the well-known pioneer of steamboating on the Upper Mississippi. During the past season Captain Blakely visited Red River of the north, to ascertain by personal examination whether that stream may be successfully navigated by steamboats. The result of his observations was highly satisfactory, there being in his opinion sufficient depth of water for easy navigation throughout the season from Lake Winnipeg to the mouth of the Cheyenne River, a distance of about 350 miles.\n\nWe have observed a statement in some of the newspapers, representing that Captain Blakely will put a steamer upon Red River next season. At present we think he entertains no such purpose. Should the Hudson Bay Company be expelled from the country watered by the Red, the Assiniboine, and the Saskatchewan Rivers, a provincial government be organized, and that whole region be thrown open by the British Government to immigration\u2014and all this within the next three months\u2014then it would not surprise us at all if Captain Blakely's steamers should be ploughing the Red River next season. But such speedy action is not to be expected from that government. Downing Street has just begun to learn something of the real character of the British Possessions lying west of Canada; and possibly Downing Street interests are not unrepresented in the Hudson Bay Company. But whether so represented or not, the circumlocution office must take its time. Then, there is another matter to be adjusted before American steamers will be placed upon Red River. The provisions of the Reciprocity Treaty must be extended thither, and this will require more time.\n\nWe had supposed that steamers designed to navigate Red River would have to be built upon its banks, but Captain Blakely informs us that they may be taken across the Minnesota River. The portage is only about half a mile, and the expenditure of one or two thousand dollars will open a channel across sufficient deep to float a steamer in times of high water. In 1823, the crops having been destroyed in the Selkirk settlement by high water, three Mackinaw boats loaded with grain, were\ntaken from \"Prairie du Chien\" by this route, passing from the Minnesota to the Red River with but very slight difficulty; whenever the time does come, therefore, for placing steamers upon the latter river it will be comparatively an easy matter to transfer them from the Minnesota River.\n\nShould the gold discoveries on the Fraser, Bridge, and Thompson Rivers prove to be of much value, the movement of the British Government will doubtless be accelerated with respect to organizing governments for its north-western possessions. The easiest and, if improved, the cheapest route to that region, either from Great Britain or from Canada and the United States, lies directly through British territory. The Red River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Saskatchewan River furnish a navigable water line of about 1,400 miles of the distance. If the gold of Fraser River proves abundant the immigration for some years will be large, and it only requires the organisation of a provincial government over the valleys of the Red and Saskatchewan Rivers, the presence of a sufficient force to hold the Indians in subordination, and the planting of settlements along the course of these streams, to make the route indicated the great thoroughfare of travel.\n\nWhile on Red River Captain Blakely had repeated opportunities to make inquiries touching the navigability of the Saskatchewan, of those who had for years been familiar with it, and he is entirely satisfied that steamers may ply upon it a distance of 700 miles above Lake Winnipeg. He says the reports which he obtained upon this subject are not half so discouraging as those he received from the trappers and traders respecting the navigability of the Upper Mississippi before he took the first boat up the latter river. It is expected, however, that an experienced steamboat man will pass over the entire length of the river, from the lake to the Rocky Mountain House, next season, with the view of testing the matter thoroughly. We have the utmost confidence that the result will be in the highest degree satisfactory. If the British Government should pursue a wise and comprehensive policy in the management of her north-western possessions, within less than ten years this will become a great trans-continental thoroughfare, along which will collect prosperous and populous communities, and a new world be made to subservce the purposes of humanity and of civilization.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added":
