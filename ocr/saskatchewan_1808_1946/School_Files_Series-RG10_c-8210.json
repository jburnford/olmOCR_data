Chief Michano said to close\nschool on account of having no wood\nand to put in that month later as\nthe children would be here then, where\nnow I would have had only three pupils\nat the most and when I mentioned\nit to Povance the other day he also\nagreed that it would be better. They\ntell me one thing and go and write\nyou another. I have reopened school\nand the cold does not affect me if\nthe children can put up with it.\nI can and from now on I will report\nall to you! They have stolen money.\nfrom me and broken open my trunk\nand I never troubled you about that\nbut friends here in H/Bay has told\nSt. Belanger about it so I suppose that\nwon't happen again. I have lost three\nweeks, but I don't mind as long as\nI can make it up while the children\nare here. From now on no matter\nwhat they say or what kind of a\nday it is I will be at my desk\nand if they don't send their children\nI will report to you. Chief Michano\nhas given me to understand more\nthan once that I was to take orders\nfrom him for the school, but its the\nlast I'll take from men who have\nno more word than they, and\nabout my board money I asked\nMichano when I received my cheque\nin March if he wanted his money\nthen, and he had just got back from\nhunting so had made quite a lot on his furs and he said \"No better pay me in June when I am broke?\" Now Mr Brown those are the very words he spoke. And then I paid Mr Bege for I was bashing myself and have been only boarding a little while then I sent home the remainder and then when I had sent away my money he had a case sent him C.C.D. and it was in the express and then he came asking me for it money which of course I had not and I suppose he thought I did not want to give it to him just then but it was not my fault he should have taken it when I offered it to him hoping to receive a reply by Friday and let me know all you wish me to do.\n\nI remain, Yours truly,\n\nCeline Lottier\nSir,\n\nRe Pic River School:\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from Miss Bottler which will explain itself.\n\nShe certainly made a mistake in not informing me that the school was closed but probably her intentions were alright.\n\nIn a previous letter she asked for an advance of $50.00 so that she could buy some money to Chief Michans for board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R.

When this school was in operation in the past the work accomplished was, owing to the poor attendance, very unsatisfactory.

Belanger, S.J.,\nNepigon,\nOnt.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFebruary 15th, 1926.\n\nMr. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, has discussed the day school situation at Pic, Sand Point, Mobert and Gull Bay. At one time or another schools were in operation at all four of these Reserves. Mr. Burk is of the opinion that there will be an agitation for the reopening of these schools. He considers it advisable to experiment with one Reserve, and suggests Pic as the most promising. A summer school might be granted here, as there is an old schoolhouse. Desks would be required and, if the work was continued during the winter months, arrangements would have to be made to put the building in good shape.\n\nI have not suggested to Mr. Burk that he advocate commencing a school at Pic, but if the demand is strong enough we might favourably consider the matter.\nPort Arthur, Ontario\n\nApril 29th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to our conversation of Feb 18th last regarding the re-opening of the Day school on the Pic Reserve, I beg to advise that I have made an inspection of the old log school-house on the Reserve and find that it is possible to be used as a temporary summer school and I would suggest re-opening it as such, until such times as the Department feel assured of the need of a permanent school. The cost of the necessary repairs at present time on the above mentioned school would be approximately about $100 or $150.00.\n\nWhereas the old desks are beyond repair, it would be necessary that new ones be furnished, to accommodate from 30 to 35 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.

I have been in correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Burk for some time, in connection with the re-opening of the Pic Indian Day School. We have practically decided to give it a trial as a summer school only. The present building could be utilized with but minor repairs. The school might be conducted from May first to September 30th.

This means that the children receive no education.\n\nAs the Indians of this Reserve are gradually abandoning the Indian mode of life and taking up farming seriously, the children will not be taken away from the Reserve as in former years. Consequently the Indians are most anxious to have a permanent school established on their Reserve, and have been making frequent enquiries regarding this matter. I would strongly recommend that a school be opened on this Reserve at once.\n\nThe old school building which has not been used for years is in very poor repair, but could be fixed up temporarily.\n\nNo doubt if this school was reopened for the summer months we could ascertain by the attendance if it would be advisable to build a permanent school on this Reserve.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the opening of a school for the coming summer months on the Pic Reserve. As the Indians are anxious that this school be reopened, you may arrange to have the old school building fitted up temporarily to carry on the work. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to complete arrangements for the carrying on of the classroom work in this old building.\n\nRelative to the engagement of a teacher, I shall be pleased if you will take this matter up with the Rev. Joseph Couture, Mipigon, who is interested in the establishment of a school at this point and the nomination of the services of a teacher who would be suitable to carry on the work. The salary allowed would depend on the qualifications which the teacher obtained possesses. You have not stated whether living accommodation can be obtained by a teacher, but it is hoped that there will be no difficulty in doing so for the brief period the school will be in operation. The Department would like, if possible, to have work commence at this point by the 1st of June, next.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear at an early date as to the arrangements you have made for the carrying on of the classroom work, also what accommodation can be provided for a teacher, and full particulars regarding the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you for this summer school. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

I beg to offer myself for your consideration for the vacancy above advertised.\n\nI have not a Canadian Cert., but I have been employed by the British Government as a Teacher in British Guiana, South America for over 30 years. My Certificate is from the B. Guiana Gov't & is Class I. I have taught there Elementary, Secondary High Schools & finally a Boys' College.\n\nI have had experience also while here amongst the aboriginal Indians of the Colony & have always had a first-class record for results amongst all classes.\nI resigned my appointment here less than a year ago mainly to get a change of climate. Since that time I have been on holiday in U.S.\n\nI hold excellent references from the Commissioner of Education - Major Wm Gray & the Acting Gov. Lee - The Hon. T. Hampden - King both of Georgetown, Brit. Guiana.\n\nThese references of course take time if you think well to inquire, but meantime Mr. Wm L. Ryan, Farmers Bank Bldg., Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\na U.S. gentleman of high standing, who knows me well in B.C. will vouch for my credentials.\n\nAny further inquiry I shall reply to immediately, but I should like to hear early as I have a post under consideration but prefer Indian work if I can get it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Thos.) Louis Kennedy.\n\nI forget -\n\nI am R.C. Irish - age 40\nThe Elmo Hotel\n457 Ledyard St.\nDetroit, Mich., U.S.A.\n27th April, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI do not think I am persistent\u2014or perhaps a nuisance. I do not mean to be so.\n\nThis morning I posted an application to you for the vacancy referred to in your ad.\n\nI must confess that I did not greatly enter into the question of locality. I just concluded that as it was Indian it was in some remote spot. Since writing I located the spot from a map, and thought\u2014struck me that if a man has previously held the post, you might consider it too lonely a spot for a woman.\n\nIf you give favorable consideration to\nmy application the question of loneliness be tried not trouble you. I am never lonely anywhere, though always alone. Also I have lived among the aboriginal Indians of British Guiana as well as the East Indians (from India) & taught them for years.\n\nWe found there also that women had far greater influence with the aborigines than men, with the exception perhaps of a P.C. priest. I am urging my application quite on my own because I have nobody else to urge it\u2014 at least, near enough to be of use.\n\nI like Indians & would gladly be with them, though your Indians are a different type. Still, I know I would get on with them. Could you not give me a trial?\n\nMy Certificate is Class 5 from the Govt. of British Guiana, & I was trained as a Teacher in Dublin, Ireland before going to B. Guiana.\n\nI had also in B. G. for four years the Training of Teachers for the work in\nThe Junior department of the Elementary School. I enclose for you a copy of the permit to give the heads of the B.C. Gov't Service as reference.\n\nI have applied for another school, but if I could have the Indian School it appeals to me more than any other.\n\nI mentioned that I am P.C. & have taught in P.C. schools always except when transferred to the College.\n\nI have worked with Sisters in Convents often, & was educated by them.\n\nI can say no more for myself. I must leave the result to you & God.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Tris) Lois Kennedy.\n\nIt is essential for me to get some employment at once, so if you consider the place let me know early.\nMiss Lois Rosemary Kennedy while in the Service of the British Government in British Guiana as an Assistant Teacher at Queen's College for Boys also performed the duties set out in the schedule hereto, for the periods therein stated.\n\nFor information as to her character & qualifications she is permitted to invite reference to either of the undersigned.\n\nW.

R. track and seven miles from the station at Heron Bay, I fear it will be rather difficult to keep a paid teacher at this Reserve. Consequently I would suggest appointing Miss Lois Kennedy, if Father Couture is not successful in obtaining a teacher.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Miss Kennedy's application for your approval.\n\nTrust this arrangement meets with the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection it is noted that you will proceed to Pic and make the necessary arrangements to have the old school building repaired and for accommodation for the teacher.\n\nIf Father Couture is not successful in obtaining the services of a suitable teacher, the Department would approve of the appointment of Miss Kennedy. We note that she has had a number of years' experience in teaching, although not a qualified teacher for the province of Ontario. Her services would, no doubt, be satisfactory at this school in the event of Father Couture not being able to secure a teacher. If Miss Kennedy is appointed, we would allow her salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month. Please inform the Department later as to the arrangements you were able to make in having the old building fixed up and accommodation provided for a teacher, and also whether Father Couture has nominated the services of a teacher, and if not, if Miss Kennedy has accepted. Should Father Couture nominate the services of a teacher, the name, qualifications and experience of the person secured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nIt is hoped that the services of a teacher can be secured and the school placed in a suitable condition to commence work at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I beg to advise I have communicated with the Rev. Joseph Couture, Nipigon, Ont. who is interested in the establishment of a school at this point, but so far I have received no reply to my letter.\n\nConsequently, I thought it advisable to wire an acceptance of Miss Kennedy's application for this vacancy, as she has had several years' experience with Indian schools in British Guiana, South America, and would not object to this reserve being so isolated.\n\nI have just received an answer to my wire asking me if it would not be possible for the Department to pay her travelling expenses amounting to $33.55. With your approval, I would recommend that her request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. BURK,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, -Ont.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department that you have arranged with Miss Lois Kennedy to take up duties as teacher for the summer months at the school which it is proposed to reopen on the Pic Reserve. As you were informed, the Department approves of the appointment of Miss Kennedy.\n\nRelative to your request that her travelling expenses be paid, I have to say that the Department does not pay the expenses of teachers in travelling to and from schools to which they are appointed. When we are definitely assured that Miss Kennedy has taken up duties, we would be prepared, upon receipt of a request, to make an advance on her salary. As you were informed, the salary allowed her would be at the rate of $80 per teaching month, but the Department would be prepared to consider an increase of $5 per month in this amount provided her services proved satisfactory, which increase, if allowed, would assist in recouping her for the cost of her travelling expenses. Please inform the department later as to the date she begins duties and whether she requires an advance on her salary or not.\n\nIt is hoped that you have been able to complete the necessary arrangements to have the old school building in which the classroom activity will be conducted fitted up and ready for the teacher to begin duties when she arrives.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I note what you say regarding the teacher's travelling expenses, and will immediately communicate with Miss Kennedy.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter I wish to advise I have just returned from the Pic Reserve, and find that the old school building is in a very dilapidated condition, and I would not consider the building worth repairing as the roof and the rafters are beyond repair. Consequently I have communicated with Father Couture to ascertain if it would not be possible to rent the Church and his living quarters for the summer months.\n\nIf the Father does not approve of this idea I will be able to rent a small building which will be suitable for a class-room, and will make the necessary arrangements for the teacher's living quarters.\n\nA further report regarding the above will be mailed to the Department in the very near future.\n\nTrusting this is satisfactory,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRE: Indian Day School, Pic Indian Reserve.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 11th ultimo, your file number 9-7-1, relative to reopening the Indian Day School on the Pic Reserve, I beg to report I did not think it advisable to reopen the old school, as the roof was rather dilapidated, and, therefore, I made arrangements with the Reverend Brother Couture to rent the church for the schoolroom, and also the priest's quarters at the back of the church for the teacher's quarters.\n\nAs there is no road from the Pic Reserve to Heron Bay the furniture had to be taken down on a speeder from Heron Bay to the river, and from there I managed to have it transferred in a small gasoline boat.\n\nThe teacher is quite pleased with her surroundings and I am thoroughly convinced that the Indian parents will, no doubt, take advantage of the school and see that their children attend regularly. I presume the Department will erect a new school and teacher's residence this Fall on the Pic Reserve if the attendance is good during the summer months.\n\nAs the only mode of transportation from the Pic Reserve to Heron Bay\u2014a distance of approximately seven miles\u2014five miles by river and two miles by rail\u2014is by river I would recommend purchasing a small, light rowboat for the teacher, as she is entirely isolated and has no means of getting off the Reserve.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We note that there is an enrolment of 26 pupils. It is hoped that there will be a regular attendance and that the Indians will see that their children take advantage of the opportunity offered them to attend school.\n\nYou have not stated the rental that you have arranged with Father Couture for the church and priest's quarters. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as to the rental to be paid.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a small, light rowboat for the teacher's use. It is thought that it might be possible to obtain a second hand boat at a reasonable cost. It is not intended that any large expenditure be incurred. The department will leave this matter in your hands to obtain the boat as cheaply as possible. Please forward certified vouchers in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYou have already been authorized by official letter of the 10th instant to purchase the quantity of material you consider necessary for sewing classes.\n\nWe are placing an order here and will have forwarded to the teacher a football and a softball outfit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kennedy, who is teaching at the Pic Indian Day School, Heron Bay, Ont. As you will note all the school children have left with their parents to pick berries.\n\nDuring the summer months the Indians on this Reserve and other Reserves in this Agency depend on the berry picking for their living. Consequently at this season of the year all Indians leave their Reserve and all go berry picking.\n\nMiss Kennedy advised it would be useless to continue the school at this season of the year, and suggested that she close school, and proceed to Toronto where she would teach summer school for a few weeks. Consequently I advised her to close the school immediately, as I did not consider it advisable to keep the school open when all the children had left.\n\nNo doubt we will be able to reopen this school on September 15th or 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc. 1.\nCOPY OF LETTER\n\nHeron Bay, Ont.,\nAugust 3, 1927.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour telegram reached me today. I was pretty certain the Department intended no holidays this year, as the school was only opened temporarily during the summer months. I explained this to the Indians, but they are terribly thick-headed and could not see this.\n\nThey are glad to have the school and have kept the children steadily in attendance. The good lecture you gave them certainly had its effect, and as you can see by the report our attendance has been very good. The Indians are very pleased to see the children making good progress but argue that they have no hunting in the summer. Consequently they must take their children and go berry picking\u2014where they average between $10.00 and $20.00 per day for each family\u2014if the season is good and the berries are high.\n\nFor a time I thought it advisable to keep a sufficient number to keep open during August. In fact a fair number promised to stay, but their word is worth nothing. As soon as the berries began to ripen they went away, tent, baggage, and all, not even letting me know when they were going. I knew that since last week that the rest of the Indians were only waiting until the Bishop arrived\u2014he was expect early this week. This morning a telegram came postponing the Bishop's visit to next year. Immediately all\nthe Indians left the Reserve for their berry picking grounds.\n\nThere are two or three very young children here. I could make a pretense of keeping the school open and draw my salary, but my conscience would not allow me to do this. Therefore, I thought it advisable to close school.\n\nI could teach summer school in Toronto for a few weeks. Please advise me by wire if I have your permission to close school immediately.\n\nI communicated with you before, and advised that the Indians would leave the Reserve during the berry season, but was advised by your stenographer that you had left for your Treaty Trip.\n\nI have your wire and will close school tomorrow afternoon.\n\nI am sure the Department will be very pleased when they realize that so many children are attending school, and you remarked during your last visit the children are making such good progress.\n\nI wish to thank you very kindly for your trouble in hunting up the old baseball and basketball which you sent down. The children certainly enjoyed playing with them during their recess time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Miss L. Kennedy.\nOttawa, August 11th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 210-C of the 6th instant, with enclosure, relative to the closing for a few weeks of the Pic Indian Day School.

This combined with the fact that very few white people ever visited the Reserve, were the principal reasons for her resigning the position.\n\nI have communicated with the Chief at Heron Bay regarding the furniture, etc. and have been advised that the clothing, etc. has been very carefully packed away in a safe place.\n\nTrusting that this information is satisfactory,\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You have been written in separate communications regarding the schools at Sand Point and Gull Bay.\n\nRelative to the Pic Reserve, I beg to say that the Department would be prepared to approve of the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence at this point next summer and to provide the funds required for the purpose. I have to request, however, that you will inform the Department as to whether you could arrange to have the building erected under the charge of a competent foreman who would engage local labour so far as possible - you to purchase and forward all lumber and other material. The Department would furnish a plan of the building and you and the foreman could make an estimate of the quantity of building material required, together with an estimate of the cost. Please state whether you could arrange for the erection of this building under the arrangements above mentioned. Could you also arrange for the transportation and delivery on the ground of the building material required? You might also state whether a suitable site is available or whether it would be necessary to purchase same.\n\nWe note that the Indians at this point do not take their families to their trapping grounds and that they are most anxious to have a permanent school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She applied for the position as teacher at the Sand Point School, but had accepted another position, when I advised her, her application had been accepted. Miss O'Hara advised me she would be very pleased to consider the vacancy as teacher when the Pic Indian Day School opens. From information received I daresay this school will be completed at the end of June or very shortly afterwards.\n\nI would, therefore, be very pleased if the Department would advise me by return mail if Miss O'Hara could be appointed for that school.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection, it is noted that the new building at this point will likely be completed at the end of the present month. The Department will approve of the appointment of Miss O'Hara to begin duties on or about September 1st next, the date on which the Indian schools re-open after the summer holidays. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85. per teaching month.\n\nIt is presumed that, as this school will be in operation during the whole of the school year, it is not intended that the teacher will begin duties until the date mentioned above. However, if you consider that the school should be kept in operation during the usual summer vacation period and the holidays taken during the winter months, you should forward a recommendation in the matter.

I was informed that I was the only teacher that is at present teaching in an Indian School that has special certificates in these two subjects. I feel it is really unnecessary for me to resign my position here unless you can arrange to pay me my grant for teaching each\nof these subjects. My grant for Agriculture should be fifty dollars and also for Botanical science it is fifty. I am only getting $85 a month here, so unless I receive this $100 a year extra in grants, it is impossible to live here. It is lonely and very expensive. I have an average attendance of 31 (thirty-one) pupils. Some days as many as forty or you see I need at least $200 extra money in grants. I have a Part II certificate in Agriculture also a Part II certificate in Botanical Science. I wrote Mr. Burke (Indian Agent) and asked him to see if they could be obtained. If not I will resign here for I can get a school where I can teach these subjects and obtain these special grants. I see no reason why the Dominion Government would not pay these grants, for\nIf the subject of Agriculture should be taught in any school it is among the Indians. They surely like teaching of Domestic Science is essential for the poor Indians.\n\nPlease inform me at once if the Indian Dept. will agree to pay me these grants for the teaching of these two subjects my total grant only amount to $100 and if I am the only teacher with special certificate in these two subjects, the amount I am asking is not very much.\n\nAwaiting an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) Kathleen J.

In cases where teachers are performing faithful service and making progress in their work, this Department grants increases in their regular salaries. We have had no report regarding your work since you began duties, neither has a return been received for the quarter ended September 30th, last, showing the attendance and days taught. This return you should prepare as soon as possible on the form for that purpose, and send to Mr. Agent Burk, in order that payment of the salary due you for the period you taught during the month of September, last, can be made.\n\nWe are requesting Mr. Agent Burke, Port Arthur, to report whether he would advise that the subjects of agriculture and domestic science be taught at this school.

O'Hara, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase of $100 per teaching year in her salary. She states that she is qualified to teach agriculture and domestic science, and requests that a salary of $50 per year for each be allowed.\n\nWe do not pay special grants for these subjects, but in cases where teachers show they are doing good work in the classroom, we would favourably consider the granting of an increase in salary. I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to the success which Miss O'Hara is making in her work at the Pic School, and whether you would advise that she teach the two subjects above mentioned. The Department would furnish any reasonable number of textbooks or other equipment required for the purpose.\n\nI may say that no return for the quarter ended September 30th, last, showing the attendance and days taught by Miss O'Hara has yet reached the Department. You should arrange with her to prepare this report and forward same to the Department through your office, in order that the salary due her for the month of September can be paid.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your early reply regarding Miss O'Hara's services and whether you would recommend that she take up the two above mentioned subjects, and, if so, if she should be granted an increase of $10 per teaching month in her salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

O'Hara, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, for an increase in salary I beg to advise that I visited the school recently and found conditions most satisfactory.\n\nThe teacher holds a certificate in Domestic Science, Agriculture, and Part 2 Manual Training. I inspected several useful articles constructed by the Indian children under Miss O'Hara's supervision and was agreeably surprised with the workmanship. The teacher informed me she will be willing to carry on with this work and also to teach agriculture and domestic science if she receives additional salary for same.\n\nWith reference to your second paragraph regarding the domestic science and agriculture I would strongly recommend that these subjects be taught, as this work will eventually be reflected in the homes, and owing to the fact that Miss O'Hara is well qualified and willing to teach these subjects and also the extreme loneliness of this school and the difficulty of retaining a teacher in this District I would strongly urge that an increase in salary be granted.\n\nReferring to your third paragraph regarding the September School Report I wish to advise that same was forwarded to the Department recently.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nI may say it is expected that teachers will give instruction to the pupils in domestic science and a knowledge of agriculture insofar as the time and facilities at their disposal permit. This is part of the usual school curriculum.\n\nShould Miss O'Hara require any supplies for the teaching of domestic science, the Department will supply same upon receipt from her of a requisition for the materials required.

We have received no communication from her, and had no knowledge, until your letter was received, that this school was not in operation. It is noted from the letter which you forwarded from the C.P.R. Agent at Heron Bay that Miss O'Hara intends opening the school today. Please inform the Department as soon as possible whether she has resumed duties, the reason for her absence during the month of January, and if she intends to continue as teacher for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst., file No. 9-7-1, regarding the long delay in reopening the Pic Indian Day School after the Christmas holidays, I beg to advise I personally interviewed the teacher, Miss Kathleen G. O'Hara, and severely criticised her for not reopening the school on time.\n\nThe teacher advised me she had received several communications from various Indians advising her not to return, as the children were all sick with influenza. Under the circumstances she considered it unwise to return. I informed her, in future, she should always communicate with this office as the Department would not tolerate such actions.\n\nMiss O'Hara informed me she expects to teach for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Bunk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to request to see if my salary will be increased to one hundred dollars a month for the coming year. The Inspector visited this school recently, so you have a report of the work I am doing here.\n\nI hold a permanent Second Class certificate and have over ten years teaching experience and I also hold an Agriculture Certificate and a Domestic Science Certificate. I feel my services here are well worth at least one hundred dollars, so I wish you would let me know at an early date if my requested increase will be granted.\n\nOtherwise I feel that it will be necessary for me to hand in a resignation, for living expenses are high here, and I am so far isolated from the railway that carriage of provisions etc amount to a great sum.\n\nI have a school in view so would appreciate an early reply, so that I can hand in a resignation here before Aug. 1st for this school, if the department does not consider an increase in my salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKathleen S. O'Hara\nTeacher at Pie Indian School\nHeron Bay, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6153, File 419-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 18th, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Pic River Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of the Inspector's reports and also those of the Indian Agent as to the satisfactory service you are performing, the Department will grant you an increase of $10 per teaching month in your salary from September 1st, 1929, the beginning of the next school year. This will make your salary from that date at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Mr. Agent Burk is being informed of the increase in salary allowed you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Kathleen G. O'Hara,\nTeacher, Pic School,\nHeron Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, July 18th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is granting Miss Kathleen G. O'Hara, teacher of the Pic River Indian Day School, an increase of $10 per teaching month in her salary from the last of September, 1929, the beginning of the next school year. This will make the total salary allowed her from that date at the rate of $100 per teaching month. Miss O'Hara is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJuly 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise I have just received a communication from Miss O'Hara, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, asking me to communicate with the Department to ascertain if it would be possible to keep the school open until August 15th, as the blueberry season this year is very late, and the Indian will not be leaving the Reserve until that date.\n\nAn early reply regarding the above matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the request of Miss Kathleen G. O'Hara, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, that permission be granted for her to keep the school open until August 15th, next. While the Department prefers that summer holidays be taken at the regular period, approval is granted in this case provided you consider that there would be a sufficient number of Indian children in attendance to warrant the school being kept open until the date mentioned. If Miss O'Hara teaches until the 15th proximo, the usual two month's holidays should be allowed from that date and she should return and resume duties on October 15th, next. You should ascertain from her definitely whether or not she intends to return and take charge of the work at this school when it reopens after the holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6153, File 419-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThis school was opened for six days in the first week of October and then closed until the present teacher re-opened it on the 18th November. As Mrs. McDonnell has only had the children less than two weeks too much could not be demanded of her. Coupled with a maturity of age and experience, this teacher has those two qualities so absolutely essential in Indian teachers, energy and enthusiasm. I was impressing upon her the great value the Department of Indian Affairs places upon the work its teachers can do outside of regular classroom hours, when I discovered that Mrs. McDonnell had already provided each of her scholars with a pocket handkerchief, was teaching the older boys to read at nights (they are working in the bush all day) and was taking the older girls for sewing lessons in the evenings. There was, therefore, no need for my making any further representations in this connection.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nDec., 18th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Miss K. G. O'Hara, teacher of the Pic Indian School, was compelled to leave school on October 9th owing to her mother's severe illness. As her mother's condition did not improve Miss O'Hara sent in her resignation.\n\nFortunately I was able to secure the services of Mrs. McDonnell who holds a second class certificate, and is highly recommended by our Inspector, Mr. Greening. The teacher opened school on November 18th.\n\nMrs. McDonnell was employed as a temporary teacher, but I just received a letter from her advising she would be very pleased to continue. As this teacher is highly recommended by Mr. Greening I would suggest that she be paid $85.00 or $90.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 23, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the appointment of Mrs. McDonnell as teacher of the Pic Indian Day School to succeed Mrs. K. G. O'Hara, who resigned from October 9th, last.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the qualifications which Mrs. McDonnell possesses have been noted, and the Department will approve of her permanent appointment, with salary at the rate of $55 per teaching month. The report of the Separate School Inspector, who recently visited this school, states that her services are satisfactory and that although she had only been in charge for about two weeks he found her to be doing good work. Please inform Mrs. McDonnell of the approval granted for her appointment and the salary allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Inspector Greening, dated May 1st, 1931, on his Inspection of the PIC INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 9-7-6.\n\nMrs. McDonnell has been able to effect some improvement in this school, which was in rather bad shape when I visited it last December.\n\nShe teaches the girls to sew and does not hesitate to take the older ones after school hours.\n\nSo far as I could see, there is but one way in which she might fall down. Her husband works at some distance from the Pic Reserve and she goes home every Friday afternoon, returning to the reserve on Monday mornings. She is, therefore, not available in case of emergency.\nHipigon, Ont. July 31st\n\nTo the School Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI doubt you have received from our school inspector the reports of the teaching ability of the four teachers in any divisions respectively, Fort William, Hipigon, Heron Bay and Hubert. As the reports, I am told, are satisfactory, I hope that the same four teachers will be reengaged.\n\nMr. J. Burke says he has his doubts concerning Miss Macdonald, Heron Bay school occupant. His reasons are that he received a few letters from families who had neighbor feuds with the lady and are asking for her discharge. But this has nothing to do with her school work.\n\nIn such place as Heron Bay, a woman of some age, when all else is satisfactory, is the ideal teacher. Experience has proved that a man teacher on an Indian reserve is rarely a success. A young girl in such places causes anxiety.\n\nI beg that Miss Macdonald be continued in her teaching work, where she has acquired valuable experience.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nT. A. Desautels, S.I. Missionary\nOttawa, August 4, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, relative to teaching services for the coming school year at the Mission School, Fort William, Nipigon (Lake Helen), Pic (Heron Bay), and Hobert Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, insofar as the Department is aware, it is the intention of the former teachers to resume duties when the schools reopen after the present summer holidays. It is considered that the services of Mrs. McDonnell at the Pic School will be satisfactory. The Separate School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of this school in May, last, stated that Mrs. McDonnell had been able to effect some improvement in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It seems that this lady's husband is employed by one of the railway companies, and there has been considerable criticism of her holding a job as a teacher with so much distress prevalent.\n\nAt the time, I quite agreed with Mr. Burke, and told him that I was opposed, on general principles, to married women being employed in schools. But when I visited the Pic school, I came to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of Lake Helen, the best work of any school (day school, of course) in Mr. Burk's agency has been done at this very school.\n\nSuch a discovery naturally makes a difference, for, after all, the progress of the children is the main thing, and, to secure such progress, I should be inclined to overlook many things.\n\nMrs. McDonnell, however, is worrying about her position. I wish I knew whether you will be keeping her again next year. In discussing the matter the other day with Mr. Burk, I said that I would take the responsibility of recommending her retention, on the grounds of the work done, if the Department wished to keep her.\n\nIf she is to be retained, I think it would have a beneficial effect upon her work, if I could tell her that her being married will not be allowed to prejudicially affect her chances of reappointment.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW.J. Greening\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nP.S. If you so wish, I have not the slightest objection to your communicating the contents of this letter to the agent. I have already told him all that is in it, except that I did not say that I was communicating with you.\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the continuing of the services of Mrs. McDonnell as teacher of the Pic Indian Day School in view of the fact that she is a married woman and her husband is employed by one of the railway companies.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you have already discussed the question of continuing Mrs. McDonnell's services with Mr. Agent Burk. The Department is taking up the matter with Mr. Agent Burk, and he will be requested to state as to whether he would recommend that a change in teacher be made or that the services of Mrs. McDonnell be continued. It is noted from your letter that she is performing excellent services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. J. Greening, Esq., B.A., B. Paed.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n438 Robinson St.,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a communication received from Mr. Greening, Inspector of Separate Schools, he draws attention to the criticism being made in regard to Mrs. McDonnell, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, retaining the position in view of the fact that her husband is employed by one of the railway companies. The Inspector states that he discussed this matter with you. He reports that Mrs. McDonnell is performing excellent services.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of November 19th, last, regarding this matter. I shall be pleased if you will state as to whether you would advise that a change in teacher be made or that the services of Mrs. McDonnell be continued. The interests of the children and their progress in the classroom should be the first consideration, and you should bear this in mind when giving consideration to a change in the teaching services at this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The pulp wood was situated 5 miles from the Reserves, and owing to deep snow and a poor cut, the Indians were barely able to make a living. I was informed of the absentees and at once investigated. I found that unless the Department would ration the Indian families, it would be necessary for the Indians to move to the pulp wood location in order to derive a living.\n\nI may say a similar case developed at Nipigon several years ago and I was informed it was in order to allow the families to move so that they would be able to provide food for the family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

S. Downey, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School (Pic River Res. No. 50 - Electoral District of Port Arthur - Thunder Bay). The Indian Agent at Port Arthur recommends the transfer of Mr. A. T. Haines, teacher of the Grand Bay Indian Day School for the past two years, to the Pic Indian Day School. I should appreciate your concurrence in this transfer.\n\nA new teacher will be required for the Grand Bay Indian Day School (McIntyre Bay Res. No. 54 - Electoral District of Port Arthur - Thunder Bay). As the children at this school are Catholics, it will be necessary to secure a Roman Catholic teacher holding at least a second class certificate.\n\nOwing to local conditions, the schools in the Port Arthur Agency remained open until July 15th, and, therefore, will not reopen until September 15th. The teacher for the Grand Bay School will be required by the latter date.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th inst., No. 9-7-1, regarding letter received from Mr. C. S. Downey from Chapleau, Ontario, stating he has resigned as teacher of the Pic Indian Day School and requisitioning for payment for the month of July. In reply I may say Mr. Downey was told to teach until the 15th, and I am quite certain he did not teach until the end of the month. Consequently he is only entitled to 2 weeks wages.\n\nWith reference to your second paragraph regarding your official letter of the 16th, I may say that this letter was received during my absence on Lake Nipigon. I would refer you, however, to my letter of August 15th, No. 210-6C, as follows:\n\n\"I have just received a communication from Mr. Downey, teacher of the Pic School, advising that owing to the isolation of the school he had resigned and had accepted a school at Michipicoten. Under the circumstances I would be pleased if the Department would send Mr. Downey's cheque for July as he taught until the 15th.\"\n\nI presume if the Department has not received this letter that same has gone astray.\n\nWith reference to your last paragraph, I would refer you to official letter of August 27th, No. 210-8A.B., stating as there was considerable friction with the teacher and the missionary on the McIntyre Reserve, it was considered advisable to transfer Mr. Haines to the Pic Indian School. I communicated with the missionary on the Pic Reserve to ascertain if he would be agreeable to the transfer and will advise the Department as soon as possible. In the meantime I have communicated with Mr. Haines at Callander, Ont., asking him not to proceed to Heron Bay until I had received further word from our Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nThe Department has received the resignation of Mr. C. S. Downey, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School (Pic River Res. No. 50 - Electoral District of Port Arthur - Thunder Bay). The Indian Agent at Port Arthur recommends the transfer of Mr. A. T. Haines, teacher of the Grand Bay Indian Day School for the past two years, to the Pic Indian Day School. I should appreciate your concurrence in this transfer.\n\nA new teacher will be required for the Grand Bay Indian Day School (McIntyre Bay Res. No. 54 - Electoral District of Port Arthur - Thunder Bay). As the children at this school are Catholics, it will be necessary to secure a Roman Catholic teacher holding at least a second class certificate.\n\nOwing to local conditions, the schools in the Port Arthur Agency remained open until July 15th, and, therefore, will not reopen until September 15th. The teacher for the Grand Bay School will be required by the latter date.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSeptember 6, 1934\n\nDR.

Indians are said to leave Pic Entyre Bay on his account.\n\nThe missionary object\nTo his presence & curtailing\nhis visits on that account.\nConsequently I am sure\nMr. Harries' coming to Pie\nRiver would cause a\ndeal of trouble.\n\nApart from the irregularity which is said\nto exist regarding his\nmarriage, I think\nMr. Harries, a recent\nconvert, is incapable of\ngiving children the\npractical moral & spiritual\ntraining to which as\nCatholics they have a right.\nOther objections might\nbe noted but the above I\nthink suffice to show the wisdom\nof not sending Mr. Harries to Pie River.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ.

I may say I have communicated with Mr. Haines advising that both Mr. Greening and myself consider he would be using discretion if he did not accept a school in the Port Arthur Agency, as the missionaries are opposed to his teaching in any of our schools.

The latter Settlement was established over 20 years ago by the Indians themselves, when the Hudson's Bay Company moved their Post from the mouth of the Pic River. The land at the Mobert Reserve was purchased by the Indians and is very poor sandy soil.\n\nBefore the hunting was exhausted the Mobert Indians were able to derive a very good living, but at the present time the hunting in this area is exhausted, and it is impossible for them to obtain work.\n\nOver 90% of the families have moved back to the Pic Reserve, and are now engaged in cutting pulpwood. From information just received from the foreman, I have been told that the Pic group are doing exceptionally good work. The first week the Band only cut approximately $200.00, but the week ending August 28th, they cut $767.00 worth of wood, which is very encouraging.\n\nThere are two large companies operating on the Black River, which passes through the Pic Reserve. Both these companies are willing to co-operate with the Indians, and have assured me that they would give the Indians permanent work. At the present time I have secured a contract for the Band for 7000 cords. When this contract has been completed we will be able to secure a further contract.\n\nAt the present time the school teacher on the Mobert Reserve has been assisting with the organization of the pulpwood unit. I would strongly recommend that we make temporary arrangements to accommodate the children from the Mobert Reserve, who have moved to the Pic, and would suggest that Mrs. Reed, teacher of the Pic School, teach the girls in the forenoon and Mr. Douglas teach the boys in the afternoon. On the afternoons that Mrs. Reed is not teaching instructions will be given to certain Indians' homes on sewing, knitting, etc. The half days that Mr. Douglas does not teach will be spent organizing boys' classes, manual training, and also looking after camp supplies.\n\nThe two pulp companies expect to erect a hospital, and have agreed to get in touch with this office at some future date to discuss the possibility of erecting the hospital on the Reserve, and taking care of the Indians. This will eliminate a great deal of extra cost of Indians going from Reserves to hospitals, and will also save doctors' fees.\n\nReferring to the school on the Mobert Reserve I would suggest that the school be taken down and rebuilt on the Pic Reserve. At the present time & I have not been able to secure cost prices, but a very reliable carpenter informed me the school could be cut into strips, 13 X 40, placed on flat cars, and removed to Heron Bay, and transferred there to the Reserve by our tractor.\n\nA further report regarding the cost of removing the school will be sent at a later date. In the meantime I would be pleased if the Department would advise if the above mentioned plan will be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 23, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has a vacancy for a teacher at the Pic Reserve. This Reserve is approximately 240 miles from Port Arthur, Ont. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $650.00 a year. As all Indian Day Schools are re-opening on September 1 I would appreciate your advising me as soon as possible if you are able to nominate a teacher. If so, you might let me know the name, age and qualifications of the person nominated by you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. R. H.

I would strongly recommend that this transfer be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Timothy\nGull Bay - 900 - Mrs. Reid\nPic 850 - Mrs. Van Hatten\nJ. G. Burk, Agent,\nIndian Office,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nI have just returned from summer study at the University of Toronto, and it is with regard to my future studies that I am writing this letter.\n\nI am working towards my degree of Bachelor of Arts by correspondence study during the winter, and by attendance at the University during the summer. The winter study necessitates good mail facilities, for essays and exercises must be sent to the University at regular periods.\nIn my present position as teacher on the McIntyre Bay Reserve I am so far away from the railroad and from a post-office that it is quite impossible to send or receive mail regularly. This condition makes winter study very difficult. Two years ago I was taking a University course, but, after being able to carry on for two-thirds of the work, I was forced to discontinue because of the spring break-up. The resulting loss of time and money was rather discouraging; I had to take the same course again during the summer.\n\nIt would help me a great deal to be near the railroad, where mail is regular. I should like to continue teaching for the Department. Both these factors\nprompt me to ask for an exchange to one of the Indian schools near the railroad, if such an exchange is possible. Dependable mail service would make it possible for me to keep on with my studies, and I must do.\n\nI sincerely hope that you find it possible to secure the transfer; and I wish to express my appreciation now for any consideration you give to the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNorman Van Hatten.\nOttawa, August 29th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant with reference to transferring Mr. Norman Van Hatten to the Pic School.\n\nAs you were advised in official letter of today's date, Mr. A. W. Murphy has been appointed teacher of the Pic School. Under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to approve Mr. Van Hatten's transfer. He should return to the McIntyre Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G.

Mr. Murphy, my nominee, apparently was not allowed to take possession of the Pic River School by the local Indian Agent. It seems strange that the agent should override the department and necessitate this young man journeying to Port Arthur under false pretences.\n\nHowever, I am referring the matter to you, to settle any misunderstanding. I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n+ R. H. D. [signature]\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie\nDear Bishop Dignan:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing telegram which you received in connection with the Pic School.\n\nWhile Mr. Murphy whom you nominated was appointed as teacher of the Pic School the Indian Agent suggested before Mr. Murphy reached Port Arthur that he would like to transfer to the Pic School one of the teachers who had been in our employ for several years and send Mr. Murphy to McIntyre Bay School. Living conditions at both schools are equal and consequently the Department did not feel that Mr. Murphy would mind accepting the McIntyre Bay School even though he had first been appointed to the Pic School and we, therefore, authorized Indian Agent Burk to send him to McIntyre Bay. You will, therefore, note that Mr. Murphy is employed and the only difference is that he is at a different school from the one to which he was first appointed.\n\nThe teacher whom it was intended to place at Pic decided at the latter part of last week to resign and consequently there is still a vacancy at the Pic School. This is the reason why you received a telegram requesting you to nominate a teacher for that school.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your nominating a teacher for the Pic School on the understanding that the teacher selected comes from the vicinity of Pic or the Port Arthur district. Our\n\nRt. Rev. R. H. Dignan, D.D.,\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\nreason for limiting you in this regard is due to the fact that we have received representations to the effect that qualified Catholic teachers are available in the Fort Arthur district and our correspondents feel that they should receive the preference.\n\nThe teacher whom you nominate should report to Indian Agent Burk at the earliest possible date in order that the school may be re-opened.\n\nIf possible, we would prefer your nominating two or three persons who might be qualified to take charge of the school and have them report to Mr. Burk. He could then take his choice as he is well aware of local conditions and is probably in a better position to decide which nominee would be most suitable.\n\nI enclose the telegram which you forwarded with your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDiocese of Sault Ste. Marie\n\nNorth Bay, Ont., Sept 13th 1938\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey -\n\nI have forwarded your letter to Rev. P.J. McGinn, 209 South Archibald St., Ft. William, Ont., requesting him to contact a teacher if possible.\n\nResiding in North Bay this is the only way that I can help out in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n+ A.H. Dignan\nBishop of Sault Ste. Marie\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSept. 8, 1938\n\nAttention-Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nSir:\n\nConfirming your wire of today's date which read as follows:\n- Transfer of Mr. VanHatten to Pic school and\n- appointment Mr. Murphy to McIntyre Bay School\n- approved stop salaries eight hundred and fifty dollars in each case stop letter following.\"\n\nI beg to report that Mr. A. W. Murphy is proceeding the McIntyre Bay reservation.\n\nWhen Mr. Murphy arrived in Port Arthur he was informed of the transfer and an explanation was made to him, why Mr. VanHatten was being given the Pic School. Mr. Murphy is rather young and apparently was unwisely advised to see Mr. C. W. Cox. I was immediately phoned regarding the appointment and considerable friction was caused as the teacher had not been selected from this District.\n\nA copy of Mr. VanHatten's resignation is attached hereto, which leaves a vacancy at the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Burk,\nIndian Office,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Burk:\n\nThis letter tenders my resignation as teacher in the service of the Indian Department, and explains the reasons for such a step.\n\nI have been employed in Indian Schools for three years. Those schools at which I worked were in the bush\u2014so isolated that I was unable to do any extra-mural work at University. I was quite satisfied with such conditions, however, as I had the assurance of yourself and of the school Inspector that should an opening in a better location present itself, I should be given the opportunity to make an exchange. Such an opportunity soon occurred, but the preferable position was given to a new teacher imported from another District. I considered this an oversight, and remained with the Department. On returning from Summer School this year, I heard of a vacancy at the Heron Bay School. I applied to Ottawa for an exchange, but to my surprise, word came that the position had been filled by a teacher from the East. After a phone call to Mr. Phelan at Ottawa, I was assured that an exchange would be made, and that I would be teaching at the desired location on the Pic Reserve. I decided to accompany the new teacher to the McIntyre Bay Reserve and give him all possible assistance in getting settled. To this end I bought transportation to Orient Bay, and I met the train on which Mr. Murphy, the new teacher arrived. He refused, however, to accompany me to the McIntyre Bay Reserve, even though I repeated that word had come from the Department of the exchange.\n\nIn closing, I wish to express my sincere appreciation of the kind co-operation you have given me as a teacher in one of the Indian schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Norman C. Van Hatten.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant the resignation of Mr. Norman VanHatten is accepted. I note your remarks regarding Mr. Murphy. I might add that our telegram of September 8 confirmed the telephone conversation which I had with you. However, as Mr. VanHatten has decided to resign there is nothing to do but accept it as mentioned above.\n\nWe are endeavouring to obtain a teacher for the Pic School and you will be advised as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

I believe Mr. Burk had someone in mind for the McIntyre Bay school, although nothing definite had been decided on when he left for his holidays.

This school is situated three miles from Heron Bay, which is on the Canadian Pacific Railway east of Port Arthur. The enrolment is approximately 20. Salary will be allowed at the same rate; namely, $85.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. A teacher's residence is provided. The Indian Agent is extremely anxious to have the Pic School re-opened at the earliest possible date and I should, therefore, appreciate your proceeding to Heron Bay immediately. Please advise J.G.

Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 9th instant that you recommend that Miss Cox be placed at the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Dionio was in charge of this school until June 30th, 1947, and we have no official word from your office that she gave up duties at that time and does not intend to return.\n\nPlease let me know if Mrs. Dionio has resigned. If so, we will then notify Miss Cox that she is to take charge of this school on September 1st.\n\nBernard F.

As this school is in tip-top shape, and the pupils have made good progress, it would be regrettable indeed if no teacher is available.\n\nI have communicated with Mr. J. Sharette, the teacher of our Gull Bay School for this term, and have advised her I will meet her at Orient Bay and escort her on to Gull Bay on our Boat the Keego.\n\nJ.G.

Burk, Indian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nReverend Father Labelle has written us with reference to the under-mentioned schools:\n\n(1) Moberg - He states that Miss Cox started teaching at this school but is being moved to Lake Helen because there was no wood for the kitchen stove. We have no communication from you regarding this matter and we cannot understand why she was transferred without the Department's approval. In addition, it is difficult to know why there was no wood. We have never refused any reasonable request from you for wood for any of the schools in your Agency but our file indicates that you have made no application this year for authority to purchase wood for any school in the Port Arthur Agency.\n\n(2) Pic - We are advised that you were offered in August the names of six qualified teachers who were looking for schools. We do not appear to have received any communication from you regarding any of them. You are of course aware that while we had hoped to secure a teacher here, there was no reason why you should not advise us of any teachers that you knew were available.\n\n(3) Lake Helen - As stated above, we are informed that Miss Cox is now at Lake Helen. In this regard I would refer you to your letter of July 15th in which you stated that you would advise us again regarding the situation at this point immediately following treaty payment on July 16th. We have not\nhad any communication from you since that time in connection with the Lake Helen School.\n\nHave the repairs been completed and is the school now in satisfactory condition?\n\nAre you aware of any teachers that could be secured for the schools in your Agency that are still vacant?\n\nPlease let me have an immediate reply to this letter commenting on each of the above matters fully.\n\nBernard F.

She is a good girl and very capable also clever. She wants to go on for teaching, but just at present can not afford it. She plans on teaching in an Indian school and at same time studying for certificate through summer courses. Girl's name is Gladys Creese and comes from Macdiarmid on Fr. Rolland's mission. Of course, a school around this district would be better for her. But she is willing to take one anywhere. I don't think we would have a great deal of difficulty getting a permit for her.\nIf you should have a school, I would like know in the near future, in order to prepare her for the after Xmas work. We could find out the grades she would have to teach and get to books to prepare. I am sure she will be able to make a success of the teaching.\n\nMr Clark called and I had him out to the site. He took several pictures. I hope he makes a favorable report. We are very anxious to get the school going for next year.\n\nMy very best regards to all the family, I remain\n\nYours sincerely\n\nM.J. Hawkins\nOttawa, December 1st, 1947.\n\nDear Father Hawkins:\n\nI was pleased to receive your letter of the 25th ultimo and note that you recommend that Gladys Creese be given a chance to teach one of the Indian schools.\n\nWe have no teacher at the Pic School and possibly there might be some other school in the Port Arthur Agency.\n\nI suggest that you get in touch at once with Indian Agent Burk and if you decide on the Pic School or any other school, we will be prepared to approve her appointment effective January 1st, 1948. I enclose a copy of one of our regular application forms which she should complete and return.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Burk.\n\nWith kind personal regards\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

She was in very poor health on coming down from her home in Manitoba and contracted pneumonia. She therefore feels she requires a long rest before assuming any duties. The effective date of her resignation was September 7th, 1948.\n\nWe have attempted to contact Mr. Schruder of Sudbury whose application was forwarded to this office by you on September 1st (File 1-1-1 X (E)). However, he has left the address given on his application and he cannot be located.\n\nWe do not have any other names to contact, and would appreciate very much if you would advise of any available teachers for this school.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the Eganville Leader I notice your advertisement for Catholic teachers for Indian day schools in Ontario and Western provinces. I wish to make application for one of the schools.\n\nI am not a qualified teacher but I know of several people who were teaching in different schools during the past term without as much education as I have. I would be very grateful towards you if you would give me kind consideration.\n\nI am twenty-one years of age and have my full junior Matriculation and part of my senior Matriculation including two subjects in English, two in French and one in Latin. Other papers should have written if was only a few marks below the standard required for my complete degree. After graduating from the R.C.C.S. Eganville, I spent a year in a Catholic College in Montreal. My present employment is only temporary and lack\nsufficient funds to complete my education. I am desirous of advancing my education and if obtained a school, I would have an opportunity to better myself while teaching.\n\nI have lived in rural areas most of my life and am then quite accustomed to some of the hardships which may be present in the districts where your Indian Schools are.\n\nCharacter references may be obtained from:\nRev. A. A. Lynn\nGanville.\nSister St. Dorothy\nPrincipal P.C.C.S.\nGanville\n\nI thank you for your kind consideration very much and would appreciate any further details and application forms you might send me.\n\nYours truly,\nD.

Burk,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nPlease find attached application form received here from Mr. D. J. Schruder, 427 Bessie Street, Sudbury, Ontario. I have checked over your list of schools and note that most of your positions are filled. However, I am drawing Mr. Schruder's application to your attention, in the event that you have a vacancy.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F.

No salary should be paid to her after that date.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nEWE/EM\nSeptember 23, 1948.\n\nDear Father Flynn:\n\nDuring the month of August I had some correspondence with Mr. D. J. Schruder, who was then living at 427 Bessie Street, Sudbury, Ontario. At that time we did not have a vacancy in one of our Indian schools at which we required a Catholic teacher.\n\nHowever, one of our teachers in a day school in the Port Arthur Agency has suddenly resigned and we have been vainly trying to contact Mr. Schruder at his former address.\n\nIn one of his letters he mentioned your name as a character reference. Would it be possible for you to find out his present address and ask him to write immediately to Mr. J. G. Burk, Superintendent, Indian Agency, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nI will be out of town for the next 10 days or two weeks. I am sending Mr. Burk a copy of this letter so that he will expect to hear from Mr. Schruder with regard to a vacancy in the Pic Indian Day School, Heron Bay, Ontario.\n\nYou will recall our conversation of this summer during the Homemakers' Convention at Golden Lake. I hope you noticed our advertisement in the Eganville Leader directly resulting from our conversation.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

In any event, I would be glad to hear from you if you are interested in either of these two positions.\n\nI regret that we could not classify you as a Grade 2 teacher unless you produced evidence of holding a Teaching Certificate.

If you have no teacher appointed yet, would you tell me about the grades to be taught, number of pupils, etc. Is the school far from the railway - are there first Indians living in the village?

O'Hara for the position as teacher at the Pic Indian Day School and stating the qualifications which she possesses. In this connection, it is noted that the new building at this point will likely be completed at the end of the present month. The Department will approve of the appointment of Miss O'Hara to begin duties on or about September 1st next, the date on which the Indian schools re-open after the summer holidays. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85. per teaching month.\n\nIt is presumed that, as this school will be in operation during the whole of the school year, it is not intended that the teacher will begin duties until the date mentioned above. However, if you consider that the school should be kept in operation during the usual summer vacation period and the holidays taken during the winter months, you should forward a recommendation in the matter. In the meantime, you may inform Miss O'Hara of her appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

It is noted from this report that a very large number of the children are shown to have been present every day that the school was open. In view of their age and the further fact that the school was kept open on recognized holidays, the Department doubts whether the return has been prepared as carefully as is required. I would appreciate your taking up this matter with the teacher and sending back a properly prepared return.\n\nInformation previously received showed that Miss O'Hara did not resume duties at the Pic School until February 5th and it is noted that she taught some sixteen days in addition to the regular teaching days during the months of February and March. In this regard I may say that the Department doubts the advisability of a teacher endeavouring to make up lost time in this manner and, at any rate, such procedure should not be followed without receiving express permission from the Department. Do you consider that Miss O'Hara is entitled to more than two months' salary for the period she taught the school during the March quarter? Under separate cover, there is being forwarded a cheque for $90., representing one month's salary, and any balance due will be paid when your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Under the circumstances I would recommend that the teacher be paid for 54 days, the number of days the school was actually open.\n\nI advised the teacher at the time I visited the school, that the Department did not look with favour on the advisibility of teachers making up lost time\u2014especially in her case when she missed so many days.\n\nMiss O'Hara is apparently very much interested in her work, and is making good progress with the children.\n\nI trust the enclosed report is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This amounts to $225.00 and, as she has already been paid $90.00, a cheque for the balance, viz., $135.00, is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nAs intimated in official letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department desires that this school be kept open on the regular teaching days and closed on the recognized holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

While the Department prefers that summer holidays be taken at the regular period, approval is granted in this case provided you consider that there would be a sufficient number of Indian children in attendance to warrant the school being kept open until the date mentioned. If Miss O'Hara teaches until the 15th proxime, the usual two month's holidays should be allowed from that date and she should return and resume duties on October 15th, next.

As you know my total salary for quarter ending March 31 was only ($90 + $135).\n\nIf you can possibly pay me for these extra days taught to make up for time lost, I would be very grateful. The Indian children were satisfied to come to school those extra days, so if you can possibly arrange to send me the extra $45 which was kept off my former check I wish you would do so at an early date.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nI asked Mr. Burke to inform you that I had made up the time lost on Saturday.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKathleen L.

I was impressing upon her the great value the Department of Indian Affairs places upon the work its teachers can do outside of regular classroom hours, when I discovered that Mrs. McDonnell had already provided each of her scholars with a pocket handkerchief, was teaching the older boys to read at nights (they are working in the bush all day) and was taking the older girls for sewing lessons in the evenings.

If I had been applied earlier I would not have been forced to engage a teacher for July to replace me and so have suffered loss unjustly through neglect in your department.\n\nI have six witnesses to the arrival and contents of the letter written by Mr. Burke.

They want a box stove and chimney for the School house.\n\nThere is no doubt that a new stove and chimney are needed for the school which is imperilled by the stove at present in use and I recommend that they be provided.\n\nJ.A. Macrae\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOTTAWA, 4th October, 1897.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that a chimney is required to be built to the Pic School-house and that the school is also in need of a box-stove, as the building is imperilled by the one at present in use. The Department would like to be informed as to why it has not been advised by you in this connection and it would also like a report as to the cost of the chimney and stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. N. McNEILL\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nJ. P.

The freight on the C.P.R. about $1.50 perhaps a little less, waiting for your instructions regarding this chimney and stone, also regarding chimneys for the Poy's Flat Reserve two building alone mentioned above.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.B.

There's no school or school not starting since the 6th of June 1797. It's a great pity to see so many children of school age can't put them to school. The school is here, some of our children who were advancing a head with Education its stop now to anything further a head.\n\nPoor Copy\nknow very well that government don't want that I am sure that at government he give all the chances to the poor Indian to be well educated so to know something so much as smart white people. My children they are advancing ahead with education very good & I don't want to see them to be stopper for to know something a head. I always sending them to school regular when the school is open. I think who the fault of delaying of the school is the Agent & and our delirgy if is the fault rather one of the two I ask to Department to talk to them & I ask to Department also to have them compelled to have the school run regular also to have the to advise them to\nsee the children go to school regular & the school is belong to the Government not the clergy or any body else. The church is belong to clergy & there were I send my children to every Sunday. After I wrote to our clergy Father Spect & Father Bremham of Fort William they have promised to have the school start soon. That's two months when I wrote them. Then after that Father Spect he came here to be his usual visit & he tell us everything be all right after New Year that about the school & no school yet & then he wrote to the chief sometime about Christmas that Mr Donnelly told him that Department he has no money to buy a stone.\nfor the school house, &c. Father Xpect he said to the chief in the same letter that he would write to Department about the stove. For the school house no sign about the stove yet & the man I wrote to Father Xpect if can be granted no stove, for the school, by him and Mr. Donnelly, that I would finish one of my own stove, for the school. And it needed a pipe up to the roof for the stove Pipes were it come out in stable brick chimney, from preventing about fire. For a present time & a damper so, the building it would fit for any person to live in. & I told to Father Xpect in the same letter, to get me the pipe of the stove Pipes and the damper & to\ncharge to me, so I will furnish them two stoves along with my stove. For the school, & that's what I am willing to do. Am so anxious to see school start here. I told him by furnishing them things stove caps, and the damper to let Mr. Daniel know it. No reply yet by attention to Mr. Daniel I went to Department. The chief is the proper man to write to you about the school matter. But he don't often talk to him about it. This is why I am writing to you myself, and expense me too long letter.\n\nMr. Donnelly went by yesterday on the 1st of this month, he told me he's gone down to Ottawa and to New York. He said he won't be back for three months. What we shall do, me and the chief if we might want him all at once. Please let me know.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nA. Morrison\n\nP.S. You know Mr. Macie, is a back store need it here for the school. The chief told me today. Of course he said if he see school start that he would have to send his children to school if the school open. If any further question about the school I will mention where I will see over.\nyou, I'm going try to see you, so soon as I will be ready. If I had money now I would go right off.\n\nA.

On Nov. 27th last Mr. J.P. Donnelly informed me that he had applied to the Department for a box stove for that place also a galvanized iron chimney - but that the Department declined the application on the ground that they had no funds available for that purpose. That he was further instructed to put the school in as good repair as possible for the winter.\n\nAt the same time he asked me to stop the teacher with whom I had been corresponding from coming to Pic River as the room could not be kept without a stove besides being unsafe without.\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to that part of your letter of the 24th ult., relating to the Pic River School, I beg today that, if Mr. Morissette will be kind enough to supply a stove and roof-jack and place them in position so that the school will be fit for occupation, the Dept. is prepared to pay the salary of the teacher whom you say you can secure and it will be glad to hear that the school is in operation again.\n\nYours, &c.\n\nA.

The good man is quite pleased to hear that a school is to be soon again in operation. Mr. A. Morissette, too, has assured me once more, that at a moment's notice he will place in the school the stove he promised, as also the roof jack, which latter has already been ordered, as well as four lengths of stove pipe and 12 panes of window glass.\n\nSeparate school Inspector J. F. White alone has deeply pointed me in not sending him the names of the future teachers both of Pic River & Papillat, the thing undoubtedly expedited his mind amidst his numerous occupations.\n\nI wrote to him again on the subject, and expect a speedy favorable reply.\n\nI am confident to be able to have both schools in working order, in the first days of April, if not on the 1st.\n\nThere is another point I wish to lay before the Depart...\nSometime last summer, if I remember rightly, I thought to its notice, that something should be done to the Indian School of Jackfish Island, on Lake Nepigon. The shingles of the building are completely gone, and ought to be replaced. Something, too, ought to be done to the foundations, as the house is settling. If the thing be allowed to go undone, the damage to the building will be considerable, in my estimation.\n\nSo far said schoolhouse has not cost the Department anything at all, which makes me hope that it will be all the more willing to go to a small expense for it now.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYour obedient servant\nJos. Specht, S.J.\n\n[Signature]\nI hereby certify that Mr. Moses Madaweyosh, of Fort William, is qualified to teach the Indian School at the Pic Reserve, and that his character gives satisfaction.\n\nThis gentleman, though an Indian, speaks English very correctly, and writes it with equal facility.

Unless you intended to close our schools at once I do not see why there should be any uncertainty about it. If you wish to read your statement (correspondence) with Father and the matter you will see that the controversy was not about closing the school but fall application had been made for some years and the buying of a store; the Presbytery answered that there were no funds granted for that purpose in Well, then said if anyone of any body supplied a store what would the Presbytery say? The answer came that the school would be opened. Brother Morrison gave his name Why then did not the school get a teacher? We heard 5 applications but on hearing of the terms we one could accept the school. You have told often enough that the cause of the difficulty was from others which most teachers find too low. It is not fault of the missionary or fault of the Indians and now that though a new chance we could get a good man, we are told that the matter is yet undecided. Truly the Indians must make a great act of faith when they believe that their Father of the Indian Department really loves them.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Metispeetos Band have even been more ill-treated last year by the whites than by the Indians. To have a leader for that place, he was assured flatly, no. Why then have they poor people been doomed to being allowed to put up a school house? It became their numbers have fallen so low that they do not deserve to have a teacher. I hardly believe, for they are more numerous than the Sagt. Plat Band, or are morally unworthy of such a favor. I would say decidedly not, for they are the most deserving Band of Indians I know of.\nOttawa, 26th September, 1898.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Indian School on the Big Reserve.\n\nOn referring to the correspondence in this matter it has just been observed that when the Department replied to the recommendation of the Rev. Father Specht that Mr. Moses Madwayosh be appointed teacher at the school in question, through some oversight that school and the one at Red Rock were confounded, and consequently the reply given to Father Specht was meant to apply to the latter school instead of the former. As a matter of fact on the 10th February last the reverend gentleman was informed that Mr. Morrison would supply a stove and roof-jack and place them in position, so that the school would be fit for occupation, the Department would be prepared to pay the salary of the teacher whose services he stated he could obtain, and the remark was added that the Department would be glad to hear of the school being again in operation.\n\nThe Department, therefore, approves of the appointment of Mr. Madwayosh as teacher, and regrets that the mistake was made in its previous letter of the 15th inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Hedden, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOntario.\nSir,\n\nWe the Chiefs of the Pic Band of Chippewas, do hereby address you concerning the school building in this reserve. The house is in a very poor state and almost unfit for occupation. To repair the same would cost as much to put up a new one. The foundation being rotted all away and therefore the whole building settles down making uneven. And consequence, we came to the conclusion to ask the assistance of the Indian Department through your influence to obtain the sanction of the Department. For a new school-house to be by measurement 20x30 feet and if consent is obtained the work of cutting timber would commence and hauling the timber and the building material while the snow lasts. There must be some bricks for the chimney. The hauling of lumber must be the C.P.R. Station. There is no other way convenient to bring the stuff to the site of the new school-house. And as soon the spring opens the work will commence in putting the building up. And we hope you will do to the uttermost of your ability to obtain from the Department their favorable consideration of our request, an answer by your earliest convenience.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nDuncan Desmoulin 1st Chief\nLouis Desmoulin 2nd Chief\n\nRead, explained and signed in the presence of Moses Madogogok Teacher\nPort Arthur 9th July 1900\n\nSir,\n\nHerewith find communication from the Indians of the Pie Band regarding their school house and asking assistance from the Department to enable them to build.\n\nLast summer when at the reserve Mr. Scott visited the school house and can inform the Department of its condition.\n\nIt is my opinion that the building is not good enough to warrant much outlay for repairs and I would recommend, if the Department consider the matter of assisting in putting up a new building favorably, that when on the reserve next summer I be allowed to ascertain just what material they require and what they themselves will do towards its erection, otherwise to see what repairs are necessary on the present building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Holder\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMemorandum\u2014fpr Secretary.\n\nThe school building on the Pic Reserve is a very inferior one, and it is thought to be certainly preferable to erect another building, rather than repair this old, dilapidated log structure. It is thought wise to do this at once.\n\nProvision must be made in the Supplementary Estimates for next year, as the Pic Band has no funds which could assist in the erection. Probably $600.00 would be required to erect a sufficiently commodious building. In default of this being done, it is absolutely necessary to repair the old building. If $200.00 were spent upon it next spring it might serve for 2 or 3 years longer. This amount would also have to be provided in the Supplementary Estimates. Mr. Hodder and I left the Reserve with the understanding that the chiefs and the school teacher should make a thorough examination of the building and estimate the requirements for proper repair.\n\nThey do not seem to have done as they promised they would, but from what I saw I should judge that $200.00 would cover the necessary repairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Accountant.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, February, 15th, 1900.\nMemo. re application for new school for the Pic Band.\n\nI beg to hand you the accompanying photograph which shows the condition of the school building in 1894 which is not likely to have improved since then as only ordinary repairs have been made. There are from 20 to 25 children of school age on this reserve and the last return shows that there was an average attendance of 15. I do not think it would be of any use to spend a large amount in repairing the old building, and it would take at least $600.00 to put up a new one as this reserve is about 6 miles from the nearest railway station and any lumber required would have to be hauled that distance. When I visited the reserve five years ago I found that the Indians were interested in having their children educated and that they had a very good school under Mrs Mackay, who is now at Lake Helen. The present teacher is not very well qualified and if the Department went to the expense of a new school, it would be well to provide suitable accommodation for a teacher, with a view to obtaining one holding a Provincial Certificate.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve are all Roman\nCatholics, and it is one of the schools which Mr Separate School Inspector White mentions as not being up to the standard.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The old building is very cold for the children and the teacher is getting very old also. Would be pleased if you will try and do what you can to help us. Please answer as soon as possible.\n\nAnd you will greatly oblige yours truly,\n\nDavid Demolin\nChief\nOttawa, 27th August, 1904.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWhen at Pic River recently I visited the School, which, however, was not in session at the time. I found the building to be in a very bad condition of repair and altogether in my opinion unfit for use. The floors are rotten and the foundation has so given way that the whole building has sunk so that the door at the entrance cannot be closed. The building is also very damp and in every respect in an unsanitary condition.\n\nI inclose a letter handed me by the Chief relating to this matter. Chief Desmoulin informed me that if a grant were given towards putting up a new school building the Indians would be willing to assist in its erection.\n\nThe Indians also state that the present Teacher, Moses Madwayosh, is unfit to hold the position owing to old age and infirmity; Madwayosh is about 76 years of age and the Indians informed me that he has no control whatever over the children. They stated also that Madwayosh speaks altogether in Indian to the children and that they have not, therefore, an opportunity to learn English, which they consider one of the most important objects desired in sending children to the School.\n\nThe Priest, to whom I spoke regarding this matter, said that, while Madwayosh is not as competent as he would desire, the difficulty in the way of dispensing with his services is that he has no one in view whom he could recommend to succeed him.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 29th August, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nYou will see from Mr Stewart's report hereunder that the Pic River school building is unfit for use and that the present teacher, Moses Madwayosh is incompetent and too old for the position, being 76 years of age.\n\nI would not recommend that the Department go to the expense of building a new schoolhouse, unless it would be assured that a competent teacher could be secured. This, as the priest says, would be a most difficult matter to arrange, as the reserve is off the line of railway and too isolated for a white teacher to live there. Chief Demolin has addressed a letter to Mr Stewart asking for about $300.00 towards a new building and states that the Indians would be willing to assist in its erection. I do not think there is any use in putting up a building for the present teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He says that on account of the number of families that attend Mass the Church is too small and that he has to put up a larger building.\n\nThe Rev Father says that he would be willing to accept for the building, any reasonable amount that the Department would consider a fair valuation; He says that under the circumstances he would even accept much less than the actual value of the building as what amount he would receive from the sale of same would help him in his new building.\n\nThe building is 20x37 made of log and is clad on the sides, the floor, foundation, and roof being in fairly good repair.\n\nMr Stewart has seen the building, and I think Mr Maude also; these gentlemen therefore would be in a position to say as to whether or not the purchasing of this building would be a wise one for the Department.\n\nI think the Rev Father would accept $300.00\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6153, File 419-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nfor the building and possible he would consider a smaller offer.\n\nThe old school building is in very bad shape and is in my opinion is past repairing. The teacher Mr Blais has managed to bank it up in such a way that he is able to keep the school open this winter but it is only a matter of a short time till the building will be useless.\n\nIf the Department is considering the building of a new school it might be well to consider this proposition before so doing.\n\nIn my own opinion I would consider that from $250.00 to $275.00 would be a fair offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEuclid Bonin\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 8th February, 1906.\n\nMemorandum: -\n\nMy recollection of the church building on the Pic River Reserve is that it is well worth from $275.00 to $300.00. The building at present used for a school is quite unsuitable for the purpose.\n\nAn expenditure of from $75.00 to $100.00 should, I think, convert the church into a comfortable school-house. It would certainly be a very great improvement on the building at present used for a school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Dugas is willing to dispose of the building used now as a church for school purposes. Mr. Bonin refers to Mr. Stewart, of this Department, who has a knowledge of the building offered by him, and I obtained a memorandum from that gentleman, who considers the church building well worth from $275 to $300 and says that for an expenditure of from $75 to $100 it could be converted into a comfortable school-house.\n\nThe present building is very old and must be totally unfit for school purposes by this time. When I saw it ten years ago it was about on its last legs, and the Department has been patching and propping it up continually since then, and if we wish to keep a school on at this reserve a new building will have to be provided, and I do not think that a better arrangement could be made than accept the Priest's offer of the church.\nHow is it that Bonin is styling himself as acting agent?

You will also ascertain the lowest price which Father Dugas is willing to take for the building.\n\nThe Department would also like to be advised as to the probability of its being able to secure the services of a competent teacher, in case it should decide to purchase this building.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nNeil MacDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter re building for school house on Pic reserve I have obtained the following information. The building is log frame 20x30, outside covered with felt paper and good boards, inside boarded up with covering of felt paper and cotton, wainscoting 3 feet all around, floor and ceiling in good condition, the foundation might require new timbers otherwise the building is in fair condition, a building 10x15 is attached that could be used as a kitchen for the teacher, Rev Father Dugas offers to put in the partition dividing school room from kitchen.\n\nThe sum of $300 is the price asked by Father Dugas, the building is worth the money, $50 or less will put it in shape for the purpose desired. A teacher can be had on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 8, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nBy your direction Mr. Agent McDougall was asked to report on the offer made by the Rev. Father Dugas to dispose of the church on the Pic reserve for school purposes.\n\nAs I pointed out in my previous memorandum the present school building is unfit for further use, and a new one is required. It would cost about $1,000 to put up a new school building on the reserve, while the church can be purchased for $300, and with $50 expended on repairs can be converted into a suitable school building.\n\nThe Accountant, as you will see, says the funds can be provided, and if you authorize the purchase I would suggest that the Lands Branch prepare a blank form of transfer for the signature of the church authorities, conveying their right to the building to the superintendent General.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A new building would cost at least $5,000.00 as this is a very out of the way place. Even if Desmoulin were willing to rent the building, which I doubt, the rent he would ask would amount to as much as the purchase price in four or five years.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6153, File 419-5, part 1)\nRegarding the school situation in this Agency I beg to submit the following report:\n\nWe now have three day schools situated at the following Reserves: Port William, Lake Helen, and Sand Point. The Sand Point school and also the one situated on the Pic Reserve were opened temporarily this year as summer schools to ascertain if the parents would send their children to school regularly.\n\nThe school opened on the Pic Reserve was conducted in the Roman Catholic Church. The old school house, a log structure, is in a very dilapidated condition and if repaired would only be fit for a storehouse. The teacher, Miss Kennedy, reported a good attendance and carried on successfully considering most adverse circumstances. The Indians on this Reserve complained about the school being held in the church\u2014this adding to the difficulties of the teacher.\n\nThe Reserve is situated in a most isolated spot 7 miles from Heron Bay on the Canadian Pacific Railway. The only mode of transportation in the summer is by water and a walk of 2\u00bd miles from the C.P.R. Bridge to Heron Bay. Consequently it will be impossible to retain the services of a qualified teacher until a permanent school and residence has been built at this point.\n\nThe majority of the Indians have built permanent homes at the Pic Reserve and do not take their families to their trapping grounds as in the past. They are most anxious to have a permanent school. Several families are camping at White River and Port Coldwell in order to take advantage of school facilities at these points.\n\nI feel that a school and residence is urgently needed on this Reserve, and would recommend the construction of same next spring.\n\nAt the Sand Point Reserve two old log buildings were purchased this summer to conduct a temporary school. The buildings are still answering the purpose of a temporary school and residence, but are not suitable for permanent buildings. Mr. F. H. Paget, Chief Accountant, of our Department, inspected these two buildings last summer and could vouch for their inadequacy as permanent school buildings. On my last visit to this Reserve the majority of the\nTo The Secretary,\n\nIndians had left for their trapping grounds leaving their wives and children on the Reserve to take advantage of the school.\n\nAs this school has proved to be a success I would recommend the construction of a new school and residence next spring on the Sand Point Reserve.\n\nAt Gull Bay Reserve there are between 30 and 35 children of school age. The parents of these children have built permanent homes and are most anxious to have school facilities for their children on this Reserve. The old school at Gull Bay has not been opened for a number of years.\n\nDuring the last three years on every visit to Gull Bay this matter has been brought to my attention, and I have taken no action owing to the fact that I have housed and educated the children in the St. Joseph's Boarding School. I find here, as on all other Reserves in this Agency, a strong desire on the part of the parents to have their children with them, as well as a growing prejudice against Boarding Schools. I have done all in my power to encourage the parents to send their children to the Boarding School but with little success.\n\nAs there are so many children on the Gull Bay Reserve receiving no education I would also recommend the erection of a new school and residence at this point.\n\nThe Indians on the above mentioned Reserves are gradually taking up farming and have built permanent homes. The Indian Day Schools not only educate the children but the whole family in modern way of living and in sanitary habits. I would recommend that provision be made in the estimates for the erection of schools and teachers' residences at Pic, Sand Point, and Gull Bay Reserves.\n\nThe approximate cost of these buildings would be $20,000.00\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 22nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, requesting that new schools and teachers' residences be erected on the Pic Reserve and at Sand Point and Gull Bay. You have been written in separate communications regarding the schools at Sand Point and Gull Bay.\n\nRelative to the Pic Reserve, I beg to say that the Department would be prepared to approve of the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence at this point next summer and to provide the funds required for the purpose. I have to request, however, that you will inform the Department as to whether you could arrange to have the building erected under the charge of a competent foreman who would engage local labour as far as possible - you to purchase and forward all lumber and other material. The Department would furnish a plan of the building and you and the foreman could make an estimate of the quantity of building material required, together with an estimate of the cost. Please state whether you could arrange for the erection of this building under the arrangements above mentioned. Could you also arrange for the transportation and delivery on the ground of the building material required? You might also state whether a suitable site is available or whether it would be necessary to purchase same.\n\nWe note that the Indians at this point do not take their families to their trapping grounds and that they are most anxious to have a permanent school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd inst., your file No. 9-7-5, regarding the erection of a teacher's residence and school on the Pic Reserve.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter I note the Department approves of the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence and are prepared to provide funds for the erection of this building.\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter inquiring if it would be possible to arrange to have the building erected under the charge of a competent foreman who would engage local labour if I purchased the lumber and other materials, I have been advised by several competent foremen that this work could be carried out successfully if the lumber and materials could be shipped to the Reserve before the snow left the ground, as the only mode of transportation in the summer-time is by boat. The supplies could be hauled from Heron Bay to the Reserve by sleighs.\n\nIf the Department would furnish me with plan of the building I would be very pleased to get in touch with a competent foreman and make an estimate of the quantity of building materials required and also the approximate cost for the erection of this building.\n\nA suitable site is available on the Reserve adjoining the old school house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, January 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3lst ultimo, relative to the erection of a school and teacher's residence on the Pic Reserve, and requesting that you be furnished with a plan that would be suitable for the building. In this connection it is noted that you will arrange for the erection of this building under the charge of a competent foreman who will engage local labour and that you can purchase and have delivered on the ground the lumber and other materials required.\n\nThe plan of a combined school and teacher's residence recently erected on a reserve in Quebec is being sent you under separate cover, and it is considered that a building of this type would meet the requirements on the Pic Reserve. You may make any changes or alterations in this plan which you consider advisable, having in view the erection of a building at the lowest possible cost for material and labour. You should get in touch with a competent foreman, and have an itemized estimate of the quantity of building materials required, and also, if possible, the approximate cost, forwarded to the Department at your earliest convenience. When this is received, consideration will then be given to authorizing the purchase and delivering the materials where required before the snow leaves the ground.\n\nIt is noted that a suitable site is available on the Reserve adjoining the old school house. You should see that the site selected is dry and has good drainage, also that there is sufficient ground adjoining the site for playgrounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo, your file No. 7-5, relative to the erection of a school and teacher's residence on the Pic Reserve, and in reply I beg to quote the following prices for lumber, material, etc.\n\nMaterial including freight prepaid from Port Arthur to Heron Bay $3120.00\nLabour including painting and kalsomining 1350.00\nTOTAL........$4470.00\n\nShould asphalt shingles be used in place of cedar shingles, as figured in the estimate--copy of which is attached--add $30.00.\n\nThe enclosed estimate is figured using all first-class material as used in standard construction work in this District. A short cement wall with no excavation, but with good footings around the entire building excepting a full wall basement as shown in the plans, this being under the teacher's residence having a good cement floor.\n\nRegarding the material for the school and residence I beg to advise that several contractors have advised me to use what is known as Empire Wall Board, or Plasterboard, which is 10\u00a2 cheaper per yard than lath and plaster and is considered much more durable. I have been told that a great number of contractors in Port Arthur have been using this material with great success, and as the sand and gravel will have to be transported from the Lake Shore to the Reserve, a distance of approximately 4 miles I would strongly advocate using the plaster board.\n\nThe above quotations do not include transporting the lumber and supplies from Heron Bay to the Pic Reserve nor the necessary sand and gravel which will be used in the cement basement.\n\nAll extra labour will be obtained from residents on the Pic Reserve as per my request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\nFebruary 20, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nLast year, the Department re-opened the Pie Indian Day School, near Heron Bay, in the Fort William Agency. As an interim arrangement, class was held in the church and temporary living quarters were secured for the teacher. The activity was so successful, that I placed in the Main Estimates an item of $5,000 to provide for a combined classroom and teacher's residence.\n\nIn view of the situation of this reserve, it is considered advisable to have the building programme undertaken by day labour - the materials to be purchased by Mr. Agent Burk, of Fort Arthur. He can engage a competent foreman-carpenter, who would be responsible for the work, which, in the main, would be performed by Indian and other local labour.\n\nA plan was forwarded to Mr. Burk and he has estimated the cost at approximately $4,700. Department officers are satisfied that the proposal is a good one but are convinced that the cost will require all of the appropriation for the purpose.\n\nI am now requesting your authority for this expenditure. A considerable saving will be effected if the materials can be freighted from the railroad to the reserve while the snow is on the ground.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 20, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nLast year, the Department re-opened the Pic Indian Day School, near Heron Bay, in the Fort William Agency.

I note you have estimated the cost at $4470, which does not include cartage from Heron Bay to the reserve nor the sand and gravel.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Department approves of this proposal and I have to authorize you to proceed with the work when timely. You may purchase the materials required and arrange for early shipment to the reserve, so that advantage can be taken of the winter roads. You should get prices from the best sources of supply and award the business to those quoting the lowest. When forwarding properly certified accounts, in duplicate, in favour of the firms given the business, you should attach memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. I am returning the bill of material which you enclosed.\n\nAt a later date, you may engage the services of a competent foreman-contractor who will be responsible for the erection of the building and who will be paid on a day labour basis. Indian and other local labour should be employed as far as possible. Labour returns, in duplicate, should be prepared, showing the hours of work each week and the receipts of the men employed. When timely, you may apply for an accountable cheque with which to pay the labour and for a supply of labour returns.\n\nThe plans which were forwarded to you under cover of the 5th ultimo should be followed. The Department considers cedar shingles should be used and, instead of lath and plaster, you should secure \"Rentest\" fibre board. This is considered by our Architect as the most suitable material and is easy to transport and install.\n\nWhen the building is being constructed, you should visit the reserve when possible, as the work is under your supervision. Please see that your estimate is not exceeded, if possible, and that the freighting, other unestimated costs and extras do not exceed $530, which is the balance of the appropriation for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have consulted several contractors in Port Arthur who advised me that Tentest Fibre Board is not considered advisable for the northern climate. They advised me that 85% of the contractors use wall board which is absolutely FIRE-PROOF, and does not expand or shrink.\n\nI personally interviewed the foreman, who will be in charge of the erection of the new school, and he also recommended Empire Wall Board, which is manufactured by the Manitoba Gypsum Company, Winnipeg. This wall board is practically the same price as the Tentest Fibre Board.\n\nI would be very pleased if the Department would advise me by return mail if they would reconsider their decision regarding the use of Tentest Fibre.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a sample of each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The board is of a breakable nature, rather difficult to handle, and in many cases breaks when being nailed to the wall. If you are satisfied that you can make a good job with the Gypsum Wallboard, however, you may use same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst.

It is considered that an inexpensive type of fence would be satisfactory, and I shall be pleased if you will advise the department as soon as possible of the ground the teacher requires to be fenced and the approximate cost of the fencing, material and labour.\n\nThe teacher has also recommended that books be supplied for a library suitable for the pupils. You might have Miss O'Hara prepare a list of the books she requires, giving the name of the publishers in each case.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 11th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., file No. 9-7-5, regarding a recommendation received from the teacher of the Pic Indian Day School to erect a fence around the school grounds, and in reply I would refer you to my letter of the 10th inst., file No. 210-2C, dealing with the same subject.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph on your letter regarding a library suitable for Indian pupils, I beg to advise I have communicated with the teacher, Miss O'Hara, requesting her to prepare a list of the books she requires.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting authority to purchase a rowboat for the use of the teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nBefore the Department could consider authorizing this purchase, I would request that you furnish particulars as to the necessity for this rowboat and the purposes for which it would be used. I may say that we have no funds available to purchase this equipment, and, unless there is urgent necessity for same, we could not consider authorizing the purchase. You should state if it would not be possible to obtain a boat that would serve the purpose at much less cost than the quotation furnished. You should also state what arrangements would be made for the storage and care of the boat when not in use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Bark, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of constructing a fence around the Pic Indian Day School grounds. It is considered that a suitable fence to enclose the grounds could be erected at less cost than the estimate given by you. The Department is not prepared to authorize the building of a fence of an expensive type or the enclosing of a large plot of ground. Please state the type of fence you would recommend be built, the length of same, and whether it could not be erected at much less cost than your estimate, viz., $150 to $200. Please give this matter further consideration, with a view to keeping the cost as low as possible, and report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nMay 16th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., 9-7-5, relative to previous correspondence regarding the cost of constructing a fence around the Pic Indian Day School, and in reply I note the Department considers the estimate of $150.00 to $200.00 too costly.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would suggest that an inexpensive pole fence be constructed, which would possibly cost $75.00 to $100.00. As there is a very large attendance at this school I would suggest that a fence 500 feet square be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, in further reference to the cost of erecting a fence around the Pic Indian Day School grounds.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have an inexpensive pole fence erected, to enclose a plot of ground which you consider necessary for school purposes. The cost of the materials and labour should be kept as low as possible, and should not exceed the sum of $55. The work of erecting this fence should receive early attention and you will see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nAfter this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the fencing material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th inst., 9-7-5, relative to previous correspondence regarding purchasing a rowboat for the use of the teacher at the Pic Indian Day School I beg to inform you that the only mode of transportation from the Pic Reserve to Heron Bay is by boat. The majority of the Indians have canoes and rowboats but do not care to rent them.\n\nThere is a path leading from the Reserve to Heron Bay, which is used extensively during the winter months but not during the summer months, as it leads through very swampy land and is almost impassable.\n\nI will make further inquiries in the city and ascertain if it will be possible to purchase a boat that will serve the purpose at a much less cost than quotation furnished. If the Department purchase a boat arrangements could be made to store same in the old school-house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

Ross, Nipigon Bay, Ontario, for Sunniling Gasoline to Big School Express, Allotment 2.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, September 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your voucher, No. 74-12, for $15.75, in favour of T. J. Beggs, covering the cost of articles purchased for the Pic River School. It is noted that coal oil was supplied on several occasions and charges made at the rate of 40\u00a2 a gallon. The August issue of the Labour Gazette states that coal oil can be purchased in the vicinity of Fort William for approximately 28\u00a2 a gallon.\n\nIn view of this information, the Department is not paying the account which you forwarded, until you report fully, stating why a charge of 40\u00a2 a gallon is being made. Please let me have your reply as soon as possible, in order that it can be decided what the Department can allow for the coal oil supplied the Pic School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nT. J. BEGGS  \nGENERAL MERCHANT  \nAND RAW FUR DEALER  \n\nHERON BAY, ONT.  \n\nSeptember, 11/33.\n\nJ.G. Burk, Esq.  \nIndian Agent.  \nPort Arthur, Ont.  \n\nDear Mr. Burk;\u2014\n\nI have yours of the 8th in regards to Coal Oil supplied the Pic River Indian School.\n\nMay say for your information that most of this difference in price is accounted for in the freight charges from Fort William and Port Arthur to Heron Bay, a distance of approximately one hundred and ninety miles.\n\nA drum or barrel containing 45 gallons of Coal Oil weighs about from 450 to 460 lbs, and is shipped as 3rd class matter at a rate of .77 1/2 cents per hundred pounds making a cost of about $3.50. Freight charges for the #3 45 gallons, then there is a charge of $1.15, for returning the empty container, if the empty container is not returned there is a further charge of $8.00 for each container retained, you will notice that the freight charges on the barrel of oil and the charges on returning the empty is about $4.65, just about 10 cents per gallon on the oil above what your city dealers have to pay, then I understand the oil company in cities deliver the oil to the retailers in their oil trucks at no extra cost to the retailers while we in the small country places have to accept delivery of the oil at the Railway station and take it to our place of business empty same into our tanks and return the empty to the railway station to be returned to the oil company, of course this expense expense is not very great but it all adds to the cost of the oil.\n\nI think if you will ask your local freight Agent you will find that my figures in regards to freight charges are approximately correct.\n\nTrusting this will explain the difference in charges.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6153, File 419-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th inst. No. 9-7-5, regarding voucher No. 74-12, for $15.75, in favour of T. J. Beggs, and note your enquiries regarding the price of coal oil at 40\u00a2 per gallon.\n\nAs you will note I am enclosing herewith letter from Mr. Beggs which is self-explanatory. For the Department's information I may say I called on the Imperial Oil Company and have been informed that 40\u00a2 per gallon is a very fair and just charge, as the freight rate to this point is extremely high, and the cost of returning the barrel extremely costly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nThe Reserve,\nNipigon Bay,\nSept 12/37.\n\nMr J G Burk Indian Agent\nPort Arthur.\n\nDear Mr. Burk, I wish to draw to your attention and also the Department the state of the water supply for the school.\n\nThe Pic River is very muddy and dirty and unfit for use. Only at certain seasons of low water is it clear. The river is at least two hundred yards from the school and all water used must be carried in pails. Some days ten to fifteen pails are needed.\n\nThere is neither sink nor pump here. A cheap pump would save carrying from the river, particularly in winter, and would be a help in case of fire for which there is no protection at present.\n\nI think it very essential to have a pump house on a Reserve; the teacher suffers many inconveniences which cannot be remedied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. S. [Signature]\nPic Bay School\nNipigon Bay.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter which is self-explanatory, received from Mr. Downey, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School. I would suggest that a pump be purchased for the Pic School.\n\nI may say the water supply on the Pic Reserve is very poor, as the Pic River has a clay bottom, and the water is muddy at all times. The spring in the wintertime on the Reserve freezes, and the Indians and teacher are obliged to obtain the water from the River. I may say that the water cannot be used until it has settled as there is a great deal of sediment in the water.\n\nI would suggest that an inexpensive pump be purchased, couplings, and 1 inexpensive sink for the kitchen. The above, including pump, etc. will not exceed $14.25.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, September 19, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say that you may expend an amount not exceeding $14.20 in the purchase of an inexpensive pump, couplings and a sink for the kitchen at the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAs F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nOct., 3rd, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report I have just received a communication from Mr. C. S. Downey, teacher of the Pic Indian Day School, advising that the coal oil stove is beyond repair.\n\nI may say this stove has given a great deal of trouble in the last year, and the teacher recommends the purchase of an inexpensive cook stove. He states they use approximately 5 gallons of oil a month, which costs $2.00. During the year the cost of coal oil would amount to approximately $20.00 to $25.00. A good cook stove could be purchased for $35.00. Under the circumstances I would suggest that a wood stove be purchased for this school.\n\nThe teacher has borrowed a tin stove from one of the Indians, which could be used for a temporary cook stove until authorization has been received regarding the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to a cook stove for the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase a suitable stove for this school, but the Department considers that you should be able to secure one for less than the amount mentioned in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Would you kindly authorize this work as soon as possible and forward a cheque for this amount to cover labour.\n\nIt is presumed that should any saving be made on the cost of this work, at either the Gull Bay, Mobert or Pic school, same may be applied on any one of the three schools and every effort will be made to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is our hope that Indian labour will be available for this work.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $30.00 is being sent forward to you to cover the cost of labour. It is scarcely necessary to add that this work should be undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. J. O.

The window sashes and ledges were pretty rotten and now have been all replaced. The porches were sagging and the flooring (or the porches) rotten in some places and a start has been made to remedy this, but as our current advance for repairs is now all expended it has not been possible to complete this job.\n\nInsulation of the school building is also a necessity, for this school is in the cold White River area. It is desired to have a new shingle job done over the entire roof, as the present cedar shingles are soft and rotten; for this job, I would recommend fire-proof asphalt shingles. Further, the window panes need re-puttying, as the present putty has become bone-dry and is loosening from the panes. Both the class-room and living quarters are in need of kalsomining, and a small amount of interior painting is required.\n\nThis school had been closed for two years prior to reopening in January. There has been little maintenance to the building for three or four years and I recommend having this building put in first-class shape, such as is the school at Mobert.\n\nTo complete repairs, etc., the sum of $400.00 is required for materials and freight and I estimate that $175.00 is required for wages. This is more than was provided for in the 1947/48 estimates, but it was not realized that repairs to such an extent would be required and also that the rise in building material prices was greater than anticipated.\n\nThe materials required can be obtained locally from the Milton-Fran\u00e7ois Lumber Co., who have supplied us with most of our building materials in the past.

Creese, teacher at the above school, in which she has drawn our attention to the need of two ladders on either side of the roof incline at the school. During a recent gale, an Indian on the reserve inspected the chimney of the School, and had considerable difficulty in doing so. He noted that several bricks on the chimney were loose. As a safeguard against fire hazard, your authority to have these two ladders put on the roof and also the rebricking of loose bricks in the chimney is requested. We might add here that the chimney walls and stove pipes were immediately given a very thorough cleansing following this episode.\n\nPermission is also requested to engage a man to clean out a well from which the school obtains its water supply. Miss Creese has remarked that this job is a necessity for their now is no snow, and she has to draw her water from a creek a quarter mile distant. If the well were cleaned out, it would avoid this long trip. I will advise Miss Creese that when the well is cleaned out, to send water samples down here for our transmission to the provincial laboratories for testing purposes. It is considered advisable to do this before the water is used to avoid any danger of contamination.\n\nNVP/lmp (for) J. G. Burk, Superintendent.\nApril 22, 1943.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, file 210-2 (9), the Department approves the placing of two ladders on either side of the roof incline at the Pic School.\n\nYou may also engage a man to clean out the well at the school. It is understood, of course, that you will keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nBernard F.

The basement wall on the outside has developed several expanding cracks which should be recemented. The flooring in the cloakroom has heaved about three inches, indicated a dislocation underneath which condition should be investigated and remedied. The school interior had a first-class decorating job last year, but the exterior trim needs re-doing. If funds are short, the exterior painting could be shelved until next season, but we feel that the fore-mentioned repairs should be given consideration.\n\nWe have on hand about $75. on building materials from a previously uncompleted job at this school, which has been kept in safe and dry storage in the school. We estimate a further $75. in building materials would be required, with major carpentering work being a necessity and undoubtedly would run around $150.00.\n\nIt appears altogether likely that we shall secure the services of a teacher this September and we would like to have the building in good condition. Regardless of whether we do have the school operating, it would be a sound policy to carry out these repairs so that the building's condition will not suffer through lack of attention.\n\nJ.G.

This was outlined in our letter of Aug. 23rd, which stated that the floor of the cloakroom was sagging due to weakening of the understructure, that the verandahs required re-bracing and exterior painting re-trim was required.\n\nOnly a small portion of repair work was carried out, as per our voucher #142, of 1st March owing to there being no skilled tradesmen available. However, the services of a competent carpenter and assistance are now available and we would like authority to have this work proceeded with at an early date.\n\nWe have some 2 x 4's left from a previous repair project, but require flooring, cedar posts and a small amount of mill-work.

This work is being done by the Hasquoil's Bros., 228 W. Gore Street, Fort William, Ontario.\n\nWhile this company has its well-digging crew on the reserve, we would like to have a well dug also at the school.\n\nFor many years we have been unable to hold a teacher at this school for any length of time due to the lack of water. At the present time the teacher has to pack water in buckets from the Pic river which runs some sixty-five feet below the level of the school building. In the winter when the path is icy, it is almost impossible for a woman teacher to pack water up this path. I attach two photographs taken recently on this reserve when the Superintendent of Education inspected the school. One picture is taken part way up the slope from the river and indicates the steepness of the incline.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend for your approval the hiring of the Hasquoil's Bros. to dig a well on this reserve at a cost of $5.50 a foot at a depth not to exceed two hundred feet. The welldiggers estimate that this is the outside depth of the well as they will have to go a considerable depth beyond the river bed.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/RM\nExtract from requisition for school supplies for the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nThe Teacher Requests:\n\nSandtable\nCupboard Space\nPlatform Removed\nNo. 37a\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOctober 13, 1949.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-15 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO The Teacher, Pic Indian Day School, Heron Bay, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1        | Unfinished Bookcase # C7C-5004. |\n\nNote: $8.49 350\n\nThe above is available from T.

There are really three settlements at Heron Bay namely:\n(a) The stores and hotel at the railway station.\n(b) The Indian village.\n(c) The town site of the Ontario Pulp and Paper Company.\n\nThis company owns logs in the Heron Bay district and they are shipped by a long flume to nearby bays where they are shipped to the United States, (for the Chicago Tribune).\n\nThis also is a good spot for a married couple. The town site is but ten minutes walk from the Indian school and the railway station is about twenty-five or thirty minutes walk. The roads are quite good and taxi service is available. In fact, groceries are delivered from the store at the station to the school. The building is in good condition and is similar to the one at Mobert. It has a well lighted classroom and the attached teachers' quarters have recently been painted. There are two rooms upstairs and linoleum rugs are required and have recently been ordered.\n\nTeacher and classroom activities.\nThe teacher, Miss E. Lingley is 39 years of age and has a first class Nova Scotia certificate with eleven years of teaching experience. She seems to be a capable teacher and is bright and intelligent. She was formerly employed as clerk, Grade 3 at His Majesty's dockyards in Halifax. She naturally needs a little practice but with experience should develop into a really efficient teacher. Both Mr.\nGreening and I were pleased with her work in the classroom.\n\nThe pupils are bright but show evidence of poor teaching in the past.\n\nAs a result I spent a great deal of time with this teacher explaining to her our system of reports, requisitions, etc.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1. There is a part basement to this school. We should consider the installation of a furnace at a later date.\n\n2. A well should be dug to provide an adequate supply of water.\n\n3. The attendance at this school should be watched as it may eventually require two teachers.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col:\n\nI just received a very snappy letter from Miss Lingley, our teacher at Heron Bay, complaining that very little cooperation has been received regarding the purchase of equipment, etc. for her school at Heron Bay.\n\nIt was my understanding at the time of your visit, that you were making a list of all her requirements and would order direct from Ottawa.\n\nI quite understand that teachers who are in isolated spots should have 100% cooperation, and I certainly regret that this friction has developed. I am therefore making a trip to Heron Bay almost immediately and will see what I can do to make her happy.\n\nThe requisition for Queen heaters was delayed somewhat as Fairbanks-Morse advised there was a shipment of space heaters expected by boat almost daily and they would let me know as soon as possible regarding the price and shipping date. At the present time they have not arrived but are expected almost any day.\n\nI was very highly criticized by Mrs. Burk for not asking how the papoose situation is. Very kind regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJGB/lmp\nPort Arthur, Ontario\n5th October, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI was sorry it was necessary to phone you yesterday, but the man in charge of the drilling on the Pic Reserve continued drilling past the 95 ft. mark. Apparently they drilled 162 ft. Mr. Hacquoil was notified the day before yesterday, and got in touch with me when I returned to the office yesterday afternoon.\n\nWe were all very much surprised when they did not hit water at 30 or 40 ft. Even the manager of the Ontario Pulp and Paper Company thought we would hit water at 35 ft. However, we will only drill to 200 ft. and will wire you regarding the results, that is, of course, if we do not hit water.\n\nApparently one of your films must have been mixed up with mine, and consequently I am enclosing the negatives and snaps.\n\nWe are now having wonderful weather at the Head of the Lakes, and I hope it will continue for another few weeks.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJGB/Imp\nEncl.:\nOctober 21, 1949.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Burk:\n\nThere was no delay at all in ordering the supplies for Miss Lingley. By now you will have received Purchase Order 49053 covering her various requirements in the way of furniture.\n\nIn our letter of September 30 we authorized the purchase of the janitor's supplies needed.\n\nRecently we have also ordered a book-case, two pieces of blackboard and seventeen gallons of paint for the school.\n\nWe have also sent over a requisition for the space heater, the range oil burner and the camp heater required at this school. By now some of these supplies will have arrived for Miss Lingley and she will appreciate the fact that we are not forgetting her in any way whatsoever. With regard to the question in the last paragraph of your letter, you may advise Mrs. Burk that we have just had twins; one a boy and one a girl. In fact my wife has asked me to inquire of you as to whether you can get a papoose basket for her. If it is at all possible I would like very much to have one for her and will gladly pay for it.\n\nWith regard to the pictures I can understand how our films got mixed up but you did not enclose the negatives and snaps. I presume that I will be receiving them soon. In conclusion may I again thank you and Mrs. Burk for the hospitality shown me during my trip to the Head of the Lakes.\n\nBFN: MMcN\n\nBernard F.

McLean.\nOttawa, October 4, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 2nd instant regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Port Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is surprised to learn that a Mr. Moore has, under the orders of Inspector McCool, been installed as teacher.\n\nI may say that, acting upon the advice of Mr. Inspector McCool, the Department advertised for a teacher, and from the applications received elected Miss Timmerman, as she had the best qualifications, and offered her the appointment, which she accepted, informing the Department that she would be at Port Elgin to begin duties this morning. Inspector McCool was informed that the Department was advertising for a teacher, as suggested by him, and that all applications would be forwarded direct to the Department. He received no authority to appoint Mr. Moore and, while it is regretted that the mixup has occurred, the Department, as per telegram to you of today's date, insists that the appointment of Miss Timmerman must stand and, when she arrives and is ready to begin duties, she must be allowed to do so and have possession of the teacher's residence. The Department cannot go back on its word to Miss Timmerman and has no option but to confirm her appointment.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to adjust this matter satisfactorily and that you will grant Miss Timmerman every assistance you can and that she will meet with every success in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. G. Garland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWalkerton, Ont., October 2nd, 1920\n\nReply to Letter No. 8-3-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sorry that there seems to be quite a mix-up over teachers at Patolga. Mr. MacKenzie asked me some weeks ago to assist in getting a teacher, and when Mr. Moore applied to me, I at once forwarded his letter to Ottawa recommending him as he seemed to be well qualified and had been just recently married. I took the trouble to call on him as his relations live not very far from the Reserve. It seems that he has moved into the school and commenced teaching.\n\nI want to make clear to you that I had nothing whatever to do with his moving to the school or taking the school. When I called, I told him to apply to yourself and ask you to telephone or wire acceptance to him. I gave him clearly to understand that he should be sure of being accepted by Ottawa before beginning work, and I am doing what I can seem to be a misunderstanding.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6154, File 420-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWalkerton, Ont.\n\nIt is rather dangerous to be too curious, for two or three to be trying to do the same business independently.\n\nI might suggest that if Miss Zimmerman does not happen to like the school, you might allow Mr. Moore to remain for a time at any rate. Perhaps Miss Zimmerman will not care to live by herself. However, whether the authorities do or not, Mr. Moore had taken my advice; he would have done nothing until he heard from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McCool\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department regrets that there should have been any misunderstanding regarding the obtaining of a teacher. The Department has no option but to approve of the appointment of Miss Timmerman. Your suggestion that, if she does not happen to like the position and it is necessary to secure another teacher, Mr. Moore be appointed will be favourably considered. It is thought, however, that Miss Timmerman, who is an experienced teacher, will meet with every success in the work. The Department understands that her mother will reside with her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

I hold Mr. Mac Cook's letter-inspector to start the school as soon as possible and agent Galvin orders to open it last Thurs.\n\nNow I've done so and myself has cleaned this whole building and had our supplies bought. Our corn & fruit moved here which has been rather expensive as they were shipped a long way.\n\nI certainly am receiving a very disgraceful reward amongst our friends or relations at your hands after holding myself open for 3 yrs. just to hedge.\nyou certainly seem very grateful after my long inconvenience.\n\nThe new teacher is here tonight.\n\nThere is only one single bed & clothes & 2 sets of dishes so she is being run pretty badly as we intend to occupy this dwelling continuously until my stock is put in my possession. The sooner it comes the more polite for your teacher. I intend to show no good-heartedness to your appointment after your action towards me.\n\nMy wife claims 5 days wages for cleaning $15 for shipping charges on our furniture while I'm waiting here till I receive the pay I was hired for viz. $50.00 plus the small amounts.

Instruct him to vacate residence immediately and give Miss Timmerman possession. Moore received no authority from Department or Inspector to take charge.\"\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that a communication has been received from Cecil B. Moore, in which he states that he had orders from you to open the Port Elgin Indian Day School. If this is correct I would point out that you had no authority to authorize Mr. Moore to take charge. Neither the Department nor Mr. Inspector McCool authorized his appointment and, as the services of Miss Timmerman have been engaged, she is to take charge.\n\nThe Department will pay Mr. Moore for any outlay occasioned by him in cleaning the teacher's residence and for the days he taught, but is not responsible for any other expenses which he may have had. You should forward at once a voucher, in duplicate, for the amount due Mr. Moore for the time and expenditure incurred in the cleaning and for the time he taught. You will instruct him to vacate the premises and see that Miss Timmerman is given possession.\n\nYou should reply at once as to whether you gave Mr. Moore instructions to take charge of this school. The Department will expect you to arrange matters so that Miss Timmerman can proceed with her work as teacher and have possession of the house. An early reply is expected. You should also state the date on which Miss Timmerman began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

An advertisement was placed in the Toronto papers for the services of a teacher for this school and a number of replies received. From among the applicants Miss Timmerman was selected and received the appointment.\n\nMr. Inspector McCool, in a communication to the Department, states as follows, \"I want to make clear that I had nothing whatever to do with his moving to the school or taking the school. When I called I told him to apply to yourself and ask you to telephone or wire acceptance to him. I gave him clearly to understand that he should be sure of being accepted at Ottawa before beginning work.\" If you had observed the Inspector's advice you would not have been put to any inconvenience in the matter.\n\nThe Department will pay you for the work done by yourself and Mrs. Moore in cleaning the teacher's residence and for the days you taught, and Mr. Agent Garland has been requested to forward an account for the amount due. While regretting the inconvenience you are put to, the Department cannot accept any responsibility in the matter, and you will be good enough to allow Miss Timmerman, who has been regularly appointed, to have possession of the school and residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Moore - Moore received no authority from me to teach at Port Elgin School. Moore has in his possession a letter from Inspector Mr. Cook, to commence duty at once at Port Elgin School, as other schools were open some two weeks. Moore came to see me 3 times. I told him I could do nothing to report to Inspector McLeod. He did so. Mr. McLeod also knew he was teaching Mr. McLeod also drove 24 miles out of his way to hire Mr. Moore, only close he made a false statement. His letters are here to prove same. If I kept wish to go any farther with case, I will produce Mr. Cook's letters to Moore to show he made a false statement to Inspector. I will tell him personally what I think of him. However Miss Zimmerman started teaching Oct 9th. Moore is leaving Oct 16th.

The nearest English family is living three and one half miles from here. In case of fire or other serious happenings aid could not be available until too late.\n\nIf the resident teacher could communicate by phone with the Agent conditions would be safer than at present. The question of ordering supplies does not enter into this matter as the mail carrier gives excellent service in that way.\n\nPersonally I do not feel that I can assume any responsibility in supplying phone as I have with me my mother and my\ndeceased sister's child.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter your consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman,\nTeacher, Port Elgin, Ont.\n\nP.S.

The programme of studies calls for the same textbooks, etc., as are used in the rural white schools. In making out your requisitions you should only ask for sufficient supplies for the actual needs of the children in attendance. In your duties as teacher you should be guided by the programme of studies, which will be found on the back page of the daily school register.\n\nThe register of attendance should be carefully entered each day and at the end of the quarter you should prepare a return showing the days taught and fill in all the columns of this return as called for under the various headings. When the return is completed you should hand it to the Indian Agent, who will forward it to the Department, and upon receipt payment of the amount of the quarterly salary due you will be made.\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations, which will show the number of days the school should be open each year, the holidays and the methods of computing the salaries of teachers.\n\nThe caretaker is expected to sweep the school-room daily and scrub it at frequent intervals and also to light the fire and have the school-room warm when the children arrive in the morning. He is also to see that sufficient fuel is available to last throughout the day.

Supplies are brought to us by mail carrier four miles to nearest store and fourteen to Wiarton. Many supplies come from the town. Very high rates are charged for cartage. In coming from Stratford it cost me seventeen dollars without trunk cartage to come from Wiarton by auto to Port Elgin. When rainy weather comes it is difficult to get an auto service even at an exorbitant price.\n\nAs my mother lives with me, being a widow, I find it difficult to meet expenses under an annual salary of nine hundred.\nI would therefore ask you to increase present salary & that amount for the coming year.\n\nWhen first making application I asked one thousand on account of long experience in some difficult schools.\n\nPlease reply to my home address 65 King St.\nStratford, Ont.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman.\n\nP.S. - I should explain that my mother did not come at same time as I causing two auto trips in place of one. Mail carrier is not prepared for passengers.\nOttawa, December 29, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Port Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are receiving salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00, or a combined amount of $750.00. Besides this there are living quarters provided. You have only been a short time in the service of the Department, having accepted the position at the above salary, and have only third class professional qualifications, and it is considered, taking into account the amount of salary and the accommodation provided, that you are receiving a remuneration equal to that allowed teachers of your qualifications in the surrounding rural white schools. Should reports continue to be favourable regarding your work the Department would consider the granting of an increase at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

I was at the time intending a visit to my relations over here after leaving Port Elgin School on the Cape Croker Reserve. I should now like to be placed again about April 1st or sooner if a vacancy should occur.\n\nIf desired I can forward copies of testimonials from the P.S. Superintendent in Manitoulin, and also from the Archbishop Algoma, Dr. Thorlakson, and...\nRev H,\nfrom Mr. Trickell formerly of Little Current. As I have already been in your Service for close on six years I think it may not be necessary for this renewed proof of my ability to undertake the charge of an Indian School or the superintendence of an institution such as that of the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nI shall most likely be returning shortly before March 25th, 1921 but should like to be sure of the post before leaving England for Canada. Where a teacher's house is provided such as as C.

Zimmerman\nWiarton, Ont., Nov. 21, 1921\nPort Elgin Indian School\n\nRev. J. D. McClean\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter consulting Mr. McCool, P.S.I., and our pastor Rev. O. Strapp, in the matter of establishing a Community Centre at this school I have made definite arrangements to carry on the work beginning this week. We have organized a five piece orchestra including a piano which I am fortunate enough to be able to rent for one year. The dealer Mr. McClean is a Scotch Comedian and I could not engage an accompanist for piano work by giving my services free in the locality to Mr. McClean so accompanist he has consented to give me the use of piano for $5 for the year.\n\nYour Agent recommends the plan of asking the Dept. for the first grant until we establish the work financially which will possibly be one year. I have had several years experience in this work also have had a Teachers Course in Toronto Conservatory of Music.\nand feel that my spare time cannot be given to better use. Something of this nature so much needed here\u2014there are lost miles from M. Church and young people in so many cases have very little religious environment about them.\n\nIt is planned to hold music recitals and literary work conducted by Rev. Mr. Strapp, every two weeks. I may add that Rev. Strapp is equipped with magic lantern outfit which he intends trying out here Tuesday or Wednesday evening of this week.\n\nIf you refer to Mr. McCook's last report you will note what he says on the subject.\n\nIn case the Dept does not cooperate as requested I shall carry on anyway and make the donation of Twenty-five dollars to missionary work as long as I am financially able to do so.\n\nRev. Mr. Barker, Calgary, Dept. of Indian Missions, was received by our Protestant Band at C. Carter Methodist Church last Thursday evening. He was much impressed with the musical talent, also highly recommends the proposition submitted to you.\n\nThanking you for cooperation in the past\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay Zimmerman.\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 21st instant, in which you request that the Department pay $25.00 as rental for a piano which you are to use in connection with a Community Centre at the Fort Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state, in view of the fact that this activity on your part is in the nature of extension work and is being supervised by our teacher at this point, that the Department views favourably this expenditure to assist you in your work. In a few months, when the Community Centre has established itself and you can furnish the Department with evidences as to its success, if you will have the account for this piano rental rendered in duplicate and properly certified by Mr. Agent Garland, the Department will consider its payment.\n\nThis must not be taken as a precedent for future expenditures, and, if you are unable to establish this Community work on an independent financial basis, I feel that any future expenditures should be met by the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, as it more nearly comes under their activity than that of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

R. #6,\nWiarton, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Community or Social Service concerts, programs of which I shall forward to you at a later date, are now well established.\n\nDuring my absence for Christmas holidays I had the pleasure of listening to an orchestra about thirty instruments in Toronto, Pantages Theatre.\n\nI have decided to ask you if you have among the stock of musical instruments a Saxophone and a flute which we may use in our orchestra at Cape Croker. We have at present Cornet, Trombone, Drums, First and Second Violins.\n\nThe addition of these two would I am sure greatly improve the musical part of our program.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman.\nOTTAWA, January 13th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, in which you request to be supplied with a saxophone and a flute for the use of the orchestra in connection with the Social Service Concerts which you are holding at Port Elgin.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has none of these instruments on hand and is not prepared, at the present time, to authorize their purchase, as there are no funds available for such purposes. The orchestral instruments that we supplied various schools last summer were some that we had received from the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment, but they have no further instruments for distribution.\n\nI regret that we are unable to comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The Literary work has taken the form of Debates, Readings, Speeches on practical topics concerning Indian Education directly.\n\nRev. Mr. Stapp created much interest by lantern slides of Canadian and old country views. He once gave us four slides to illustrate how to teach drawing of a dog to primary pupils.\n\nI have my Social Service Concert programs made out in duplicate, one file intended to be sent to you at any time you may desire.\nI am pleased to say that this is the first and only one which we shall ask as most of our expenses can now be met by me as a donation to Missionary Work and by annual Concerts.\n\nReturning from Stratford after my Christmas holidays I bought Orchestra Music and have supplied oil for lights since November also lunches and treats at various times. I am pleased to be in a position to do so, believing if more Social workers were interested in The Indians conditions would improve.\nmore satisfactorily. I note with pleasure the downfall of liquor and other vices at this point. Although it may not be due to any of my work yet I feel a great interest and encouragement. It has proved an aid & school and church work.\n\nThanking you for your kind letter of November 29th\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman.\n\nTeacher Pt.

McLeod sec. by Alex. Johnston that we ask the School Inspector Mr. McCool, to give a report to this Council as to the efficiency of Miss Timmerman, as teacher at #2 school and also of the progress made by the pupils at that school.\n\nCarried.\n\nNOTE:-\n\nA large number of complaints have come in to me in regards Miss Timmerman as a teacher and it was the matter of a big discussion at the Council meeting. There has never been a child pass the entrance examination from that school since it was erected and I blame the parents, who are 100 yrs. behind the rest of the reserve both in living conditions and speech and through irregular attendance the children are poor scholars and the blame cannot rest with the teacher. I will write to Mr. McCool for a report at his next visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. D.

The Department will await the report of the Inspector before taking any action regarding the complaint of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Since Jan 9th, 1924.\n\nTruant officer charged me publicly at Council meeting with having all my pupils in one book.\n\nDrawing or Art Work.\nHe complains that there is too much drawing. My Inspector has made several draft day visits at Pt. E. and commends the art work very highly.\nPupils study Reading, Literature, Spelling, Phonics in some grades, from 9 A.M. to 10 or 10:15 A.M., taking the remaining time until recess for Art.\n\nMr. C. complained that a pupil not making suitable progress was kept home by parent. The man referred to is John Pedonequotte. This man has moved three times to my knowledge in three years, sometimes being out of reach of school in winter. When the boy (Primus) attended regularly he advanced rapidly. In April to June 1923 he attended 18 days in 65; consequently he forgot word recognition in a few cases, and while returning to school in September had much to do over again. Last month he came 8 days in 21.\n\nDo you consider it just to judge?\nThe standing of all pupils by an individual case of that kind & Elliott has a reason for doing so I believe; a friend of his who has not passed H. S. Entrance wishes the position of teacher at P.E. The young man I refer to made quite an attempt in 1932 by circulating his as you heard Monday. He then left the reserve for Selkirk and was recently returned intending from what I hear and observe to try again for personal hatred without a cause a certain man at P.E. has made several attempts to have me dismissed. His method of procedure was just what you heard from Mr. C. last Monday only he made it much stronger.\n\nI have spent four years in high school learning \"what\" to teach and one year in teachers' training school learning \"how.\"\nto teach and after having successful experience in white schools, I feel that I can handle the work in an Indian school of this size. My former inspectors, Mr. R. Leslie of Peterborough or Mr. Mr. Dougall, M.A. of Petrolia would give my records in their schools if applied to. Also Mr. Mr. Cook's report may be referred to.\n\nJ.R.C. stated that pupils did not know alphabet. For many years the A-B-C system has run out of date in connection with teaching Primary Reading; proof of which may be found page 4 of East Reading Manual authorized by Ministry of Education. The Phonetic or Sound Method in conjunction with other new methods are the authorized plans of teaching now. I teach by the instruction laid down.\nThis Teachers' Manual, used in the Normal and Model Schools of Ontario. The pupils learn the alphabet names in order and their recognition incidentally. The sound or Phonie system is the outstanding one. In teaching words which do not easily analyze into sounds we use the Look and Say method to assist.\n\nFr. D. said people were going to send pupils to Sidney Bay School because I was not advancing them. None have gone yet. I have had during past year two girls from Sidney Bay School with that defect and I do not think the teacher incapable of teaching either of them. I would say some imaginary cause was the reason. I know a woman here was offended with me because I did not give her\ndelightful piano lessons but as several had asked me the same thing I could not comply with her wish. If I taught one I must teach all and time will not permit.\n\nI have been aiming to establish Entrance work since 1920. At the time I took this school Jr. III was highest grade. If those pupils had remained they should have been Entrance pupils last year. One married and the other left the reserve while in Jr. III. It is regrettable but as Mr. McCool says it is no fault of mine. The registers on file at P.E. show that no pupils have passed Entrance in past eleven years. Registers before 1913 are not here. Why specialize 1920 to 1923 as fault of teacher? I had four Entrance pupils in last school and would be pleased to teach same work here if pupils were here.\nMy dear Mr. Elliott,\n\nI have just returned from Sarria and attended 8 days in 25. Her mother requested me to prepare her for N. S. E. next June.\n\nWhat we need at this school is a Sr. Officer who will call every day at any hour from 9 A.M. until 4 P.M., not one who comes in for five or ten minutes once in two weeks, assuming the duties of an Inspector who must be a University Graduate to hold that position.\n\nIn the beginning Sr. C. performed his duties well.\n\nMr. Elliott told me Wednesday that he intended to call on Chief and Agent to correct false information and impressions he placed before the people last Council.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6154, File 420-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIn closing I would request that the Chief, Secretary and Agent would spend the time during a teaching period once a month in this school thereby placing themselves in a position to deal with information of this nature.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMay Zimmerman\n\nI am sending a copy to Mr. Moore to be read by secretary in March Council, omitting paragraphs indicated as they are personal.\nDear Mr. Conley,\n\nIt is regrettable to have to bring you an unpleasant message, but I think it wise to make you acquainted with conditions as they are. For two years now Solomon has been at various times manufacturing ammunition by which he hopes to have his removal from this school. His last attempt was made through the school office as the enclosed communication indicates.\n\nElliott is more too bright and much of the time had been a \"Swamp\" Distiller. The last few months he has been neglecting his official calls, having made his since June. He comes in about between 10 AM and 10.30 and does some bent work being practiced for 15 or 20 minutes after the children have finished Reading, Literature, Phonics and Spelling. He makes a case out of that and tries to impress the people Council Day that pupils learn nothing.\nHowever Wednesday following Council he came to me to say he intended to take back the false words he had placed before the people and would do so by interviewing the Chief Agent and Secretary. If he does so I shall make no charge against his neglect of duty if he will begin anew and keep silence down.\n\nI am to go after everyone holding positions on the reserve. When I first came here he was after Rev. Hilditch because he was making him keep his place. Mr. H. Would not stand for stealing from Collective Plate. He elected himself Choir leader after Mr. Johnston's death, making an attempt to discharge the organist whom he did not like. Because Rev. C. Strapp would not allow this he formed a petition for the removal of Dr. Strapp. Rev. Mr. Banner has been quietly and told our pastor he would give the petition when it reached him. If he cannot turn public favor from me that will be his next move with me no doubt, that is why I am watching private information so you will know how to handle the matter if it becomes necessary.\nI do not like to trouble Mr. Morse as he has enough of that to deal with now; although he knows this.\n\nMy piano being used in the school seems to annoy one or two women. They want me to teach them to be piano players in a few weeks. Several wanted me to give piano lessons but they have a competent teacher here and anyway I have not time for it.\n\nWhen I train the children for concert work I find that takes all my time outside of study hours.\n\nMr. Dr. Cool thought at his last visit that the children were progressing splendidly. They are becoming quite conversant with English, both written and in conversation. Considering the fact that the native language is used exclusively at P.E.I., in the homes I am often surprised when pioneer pupils converse with me correctly in English. At Cape Croker English is spoken much in the homes. Chief Jones and P. Hodge were married sisters (while women from Stephenville the children (10 in each case) have been\nSupplying Miss Moffatt Entrance Material for years. Those children are exceptionally clever. They stay at school whereas at Pt. L. School Conditions do not exist and when a girl reaches 18 she's the marriage. I believe the conditions are the same at Sidney Bay. Of course it is easy for Mr. Solomon to say the difference in results is due to teacher. The registers show that for past 11 years no pupil from Nahan Entrance from here. I am making all effort possible to keep my present third class interested until they reach high school. It will not be necessary to reply unless Elliott and Solomon take further measures to secure the school Indian boy mentioned in communication to Council. I understand the people sending children here are ready to fight the case if these two men proceed, to knowing that, they may make no further efforts.\n\nTrusting that I may be left at peace with my pupils as they seem to have become quite attached to me and I to them,\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman\nP.S. Last year was first time I failed to have a Christmas entertainment at night. In place of it I had an afternoon public examination and program, giving the children of their gifts. The parents attended likewise and very much. Elliott made quite a fuss about that. The parents expected the cancelling of tree last year on account of my loss in my mother's death. We hope to have entertainment next year as usual. My little nephew(?) will stop with me now.\nCape Croker, Ont.,\nFeb. 18, 1924.\n\nMr. Conley,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA complaint has been laid before\nthe Council of Cape Croker in\nregards to the school at Big Bay\nby an uneducated Indian.\n\nWe wish to say that the\npresent teacher Miss Williamson\nhas performed and is performing\nexcellent work, and knowing\nthe conditions with the Indians,\nand that the children are\nprogressing wonderfully in\nregards to Development,\nEnglish and the work in\ngeneral.\nJohnstone, Bandmaster\nand Sergeant of 9th\nGrey Horse Reg't Band.\nThe Personage\nCape Croker\nOntario\n\nFebruary 19th 1924\n\nMr. Conley\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received the enclosed letter on Monday 17th Inst. with the request that I endorse it & forward it to you.\n\nI have not endorsed it because of the fact that I do not consider that the parties whose signatures are affixed thereto are competent judges of the capabilities or otherwise of the teacher in question.\n\nI personally do not attach any\nimportance to the complaints laid.\n\nI am forwarding this letter as a matter of courtesy to Miss Zimmerman,\nafter consultation with Mr. D.

Also I am of the opinion that this little trouble has wakened the teacher up to her responsibilities and that she is taking more pains in her work and that she has the education for teaching but has never been too willing to give her divided attention to her teaching.\n\nIf conditions remain as they are at present and there appears to be no more difficulties arise between the teacher and parents in the future, I would then consider the recommending that the teacher be retained, but if the old trouble again arises I will at once notify the Dept.\n\nKindly advise if this suggestion meets with your approval.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

We note from your letters that she is taking an interest in the work, and that you are of the opinion the trouble which existed between the teacher and the Indian parents will die out. If she continues her interest and gives her entire attention to her duties, the Department has no desire to dispense with her services, provided you are satisfied that the Indian parents will send their children regularly to school. Previous to the closing of the school for the summer holidays, you should forward a report stating whether the improvement in her teaching has continued and whether the trouble between herself and the Indian parents has died out, also whether you would recommend that she be retained in the position for another year. The question of her remaining after June 30th, next, will depend entirely upon the results achieved by her up to that date and your recommendation as to whether or not she be allowed to remain for another year. If you have given her notice that she is to retire, you may now inform her that her services are to continue until June 30th, next, and that her retention for another year will depend entirely upon herself and the services she performs and in her relationship to the Indian parents. We note that there has been a decided improvement in the teaching and attendance since the visit of the inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D.

Please state whether you would advise that her services be dispensed with and another teacher engaged for the next school year. We are of the opinion that it would be in the best interests of the Indian children if Miss Timmerman would retire. However, before taking any action, we would be pleased to have your views in the matter. Your early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose School reports for the three Schools on Cape Croker Reserve, for the term ending June 30th 1924.\n\nIn acknowledging the receipt of your letter 8-3-1 of June 27th, in reference to the retention of Miss Timmerman teacher of Port Elgin School for another year, I would wish to report that there is still some friction existing between a few of the parents and the teacher in regards the progress of the pupils attending the School.\n\nI called a meeting of the Council to get their views as to whether in their opinion the teacher would be satisfactory if retained for another year and they recommended her being retained for that period, the reason of consulting the Council was that they are in a better position to know of the Indians complaints than I am as when I try to interview them they cannot explain to me in English their grievances and according to the Council, the larger part of the parents sending their children to the School are quite satisfied with their progress there and that the complaints have all originated through private desires on the part of some parents to have their children promoted to higher grades, when they have not sufficient education to be advanced so rapidly.\n\nIn view of the fact that the attendance of this School has never been as high as the last two years, nor the average attendance so good, it leads me to believe that the majority of the people are satisfied and for that reason I would recommend the retention of the present teacher for until Xmas holidays of 1924 and that a new teacher be then engaged, providing this meets with the approval of the Dept., for the present teacher is acquainted with all work connected with gardening, knitting etc needed this Fall and because the majority desire her to remain, and this would also give Miss Timmerman a chance to arrange for the removal of her goods etc and arrange a home elsewhere.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval,\n\nSecretary.\n\nDept of Ind.

In view of your recommendation that she be re-engaged until the end of December, next, and as it would appear that the majority of the parents are satisfied with her services, the Department will approve of her retention in the position until the Christmas holidays, 1924.

Kindly advise.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. There are 15 children on the Register at present.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to terminating the services of Miss Timmerman as teacher of the Port Elgin Indian Day School at the end of the present calendar year. In reply I beg to say it is noted that you have informed Miss Timmerman that her services will not be required after the end of December, next.\n\nRegarding the obtaining of a successor, you should consult the public school inspector, and it may be that he can recommend a teacher having a second class professional certificate. If he is unable to do so, and you are unable to secure a teacher, you may place an advertisement in a daily paper in Toronto for an experienced second class professional teacher. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $750 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, which during the present fiscal year ending March 31st, next, is at the rate of $15 per month. In order to save time, when the applications are received, you and the Inspector may engage the services of the teacher considered to be the most satisfactory from the applications received. You should, however, submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher engaged for the approval of the Department. You should take early steps to obtain a teacher to begin duties after the Christmas holidays.\n\nMiss Timmerman should prepare and forward her return before she leaves, in order that the amount of salary and bonus due her can be paid. The address to which the cheques are to be sent should be stated. You will see that Miss Timmerman vacates the school and teacher's living quarters before the new teacher arrives.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6154, File 420-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nJanuary 15, 1931.\n\nArthur Post, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCAPE CROKER, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Post:\n\nYesterday Mr. Gregor Keeshig and Mr. John McLeod called to see me about conditions at the Port Elgin school and wanted me to take the matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs. However it occurred to me that you were the proper person to lay the matter before as I am not aware from what these men told me as to just how much you know about it already.\n\nIt appears that for some time past the teacher at the school even in the coldest and stormiest weather has refused to permit the pupils to enter the school until 9 o'clock even though they may reach the school grounds earlier and she has refused to let them in the school during recess.\n\nThe treatment by the teacher towards the pupils has been going from bad to worse until a short time ago the teacher, according to Mr. Keeshig, punished his 9 year old child in a most improper manner by throwing her to the floor and striking her several times.\n\nI am writing to suggest that you make a thorough investigation of the matter. These men seem determined to carry the matter to the Department if something is not done.\n\nThey also complain that there was a council meeting at which it was decided that some of the councillors and you would attend at the school at a certain time for the purpose of going into the matter and at the appointed time.\nyou did not arrive but later went there alone and afterwards said that you did not see anything to complain of. They point out that it would hardly be expected that you would find anything wrong by going there the way you did as the teacher undoubtedly would make it a point of having things in order when you were there.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLHS: HH\nSir:-\n\nI beg to make the following report regarding conditions at present existing, at No 3, Fort Elgin School, on this Reserve.\n\nComplaints have been received at this office, also been brought to the monthly Council meeting, that the teacher of the Fort Elgin School, Mrs Bell, has been far too strict with the pupils. I have twice visited this school recently, to investigate the matter, and to thoroughly talk the matter over with Mrs Bell. I beg to enclose a letter from Mr Snider, solicitor, of Wiarton, to whom, it was declared that Mrs Bell struck one of the children. Mrs Bell utterly denied this charge to me, and personally, I have always found her fair to the pupils. Gregor Keenig, at present, refuses to allow his children to return to school- as he is demanding an investigation.\n\nRegarding the charge of the children not being allowed in the school before 9 a.m., I believe this to be correct. At recess time, I consider the teacher is doing the right thing when she makes them go out, as this is necessary for fresh air and exercise. During my last visit to the school, I made it a point to be there at the noon hour, and the children were all in, eating their lunch.\n\nIf it is possible for the Department to have this matter officially investigated, I consider it would be advisable, and at the same time, another matter could be dealt with, namely, that of the estate of the late Henry Jennsten, his heirs being anxious for a settlement.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nSecretary,\n\nDept. of Ind. Affs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to complaints received by you regarding the teacher of the Port Elgin Indian Day and enclosing a communication which you received from a barrister in Wiarton with regard to the complaints made to him by two members of the Band. In reply I have to say that it is noted that you have visited the school and investigated the conditions complained of and have talked the matter over with Mrs. Bell, the teacher.\n\nReferring to the complaint that the children are not being allowed in the school before 9 a.m., I have to say that the classroom should be heated and opened for the reception of the pupils when they arrive at the school. The teacher must permit the pupils to enter the school on their arrival and you should inform her of the Department's instructions in this matter.\n\nIt is further noted that you have taken up with the teacher the complaint regarding the punishment of the child of Gregor Keeshig. It is expected that the teacher will exercise due discretion in administering punishment of any nature and this should be administered only in extreme cases. It is further expected that Mrs. Bell will use tact in dealing with the work in the classroom, any admonishments that she may give and, also, in her dealings with the parents. We are not prepared, at the present time, to have an officer from the Department investigate the complaints, it being considered that you should, after consultation with the teacher fully advising her of the Department's requirements, be able to settle any difficulties that may have arisen.\n\nYou have been written in a separate communication regarding the estate of the late Henry Johnston.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nArthur C. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MCGOOCKIN\nDATED MAY 9, 1932, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE CAPE\nCROKER AGENCY.\n\nNO. 3 SCHOOL.\n\nBuildings and grounds in good condition,\nclassroom clean and well ventilated. Pupils\ngenerally are making good progress and are being\ninstructed in health matters and personal cleanliness. Mrs. Bell is a very efficient teacher and\ntakes a personal interest in the welfare of the\nIndian people.\n\nThe closet screens need repairing.\nWindows in boys' closet broken.\nSome window lights in cellar need replacing.\nHalf a dozen pictures for classroom walls.\n\nMrs. A. Pedoniquott complained that when\nshe told the Agent that the teacher, Mrs. Bell,\nhad made her boy take a piece of soap in his mouth,\nas punishment for using bad language, the Agent took\nno action. There is no evidence to show that he\ndid do anything towards having this practice stopped.\nIn this I consider he was lax in his duty.\n\nGregor Keeshig complained that he reported\nthe teacher, Mrs. Bell, to the Agent for abusing\nhis children in the classroom and that he did nothing\nabout it, the abuse continued with the result that\nKeeshig had to send his children to another school on\nthe reserve some distance from home. I don't think\nthe Agent took such action as he should have done in\nthis matter.\n\nI wish to refer to one of the complaints\nmentioned elsewhere in this report to the effect\nthat Mrs. Bell, teacher at the Port Elgin Indian Day School, made one of the pupils take soap in his mouth as a punishment for using profane language. Mrs. A. Pedoniquott, the mother, states that the boy came home sick and vomiting and that the inside of his mouth peeled off and was raw for several days. I met Mrs. Pedoniquott and several other parents at the school to interview Mrs. Bell. She frankly admitted that she had on several occasions used the soap method of cleaning the pupils' mouths after using bad language. Such punishment while it may prove effective, causes a strong feeling of resentment and illwill towards the teacher and to a great extent injures her influence for good among the Indians. Mrs. Bell is a very efficient teacher and is doing good work. She is a strict disciplinarian and the deportment of the pupils in the classroom is excellent. The soap method of punishment should be stopped right away, by instructions from the Department.\nOttawa, May 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent visit to the Port Elgin Indian Day School, states that the closet screens need repairing and that the windows in the boys' closet and in the cellar of the school building need replacing. You will be good enough to arrange at an early date to have the repairs carried out to the closet screens and any broken glass replaced. All costs for the purpose should be kept as low as possible and, when completed, an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure.\n\nThe Inspector has reported regarding punishment administered by the teacher, Mrs. Bell, and complaints made to him by certain of the parents. It is stated that Mrs. Bell made some of the pupils take soap into their mouths as a punishment and, as a consequence, they became sick. You will be good enough to instruct Mrs. Bell that this punishment is to cease, and that, under no circumstances, must she continue the soap method of punishment. The Inspector has reported very favourably regarding her work and the discipline and deportment of the pupils in the classroom, and states that the pupils generally are making good progress, and receive instruction in health matters and personal cleanliness. The only complaint was regarding her method of punishment, as mentioned above.\n\nThe Department is ordering four of Nelson's Pictures of Canadian History. They will be sent addressed to the teacher, and she should see that they are hung on the walls in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. A.

Church, of Cape Croker, and he has requested me to write to the Department, asking permission for him to hold instruction classes in No. 3, Port Elgin Indian Day School, on Saturday mornings of each week, and during the summer holidays, on three mornings each week.\n\nThis class, he states, is for the benefit of the Roman Catholic children of the Port Elgin section of the Reserve, and he wishes to start the classes immediately after Easter.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind.

However, it is to be understood that he will see that no damage occurs to the equipment and that the room is kept in a cleanly condition, ready for the pupils to resume work following the instruction classes held by Father Artus.

We hope that Mrs. Bell will meet with every success in her work at this school.\n\nIf at any time Mrs. Bell proposes to have her husband live on the reserve, you should correspond with the Department in the matter.\n\nThe other applications which you forwarded are returned herewith.

McLean\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter No. 8-3-5 of 29th I wish to state the following facts in order to hasten matters before the severe cold weather.\n\nMr. Garland thought it useless to deepen the well drilled here some time ago as it is seventy feet deep and water is alkaline. All wells in vicinity no matter what depth have proved the same. The people are using spring water almost without an exception. Last Friday I sent an order to Mr. Carl Jones to have the spring across the road (the sole source of water supply near) properly protected by cement enclosure. I am seeing Mr. Jones who is a thoroughly reliable gentleman.\nfound that this was the spring Dr. Weigall had condemned some time ago. He reported it to me on following day so he might not see the Agent for a few days to tell him Mr. Jones who is one of my close neighbors has lived here for years and knows conditions better than either the Agent or I. He thinks it would be a waste of money to attempt drilling another well; judging from former experiences there is another failing spring of first class water about eighty rods from school building which he suggests should be piped to building. He considers this the only solution to the problem. To engage Indians as carriers of water would be unsafe from sanitary point of view also very uncertain. It is unfortunate that Mr. Abraham did not view conditions here in this matter during his last visit to Cape Croker. Mr. Garland spoke of bringing him before he came.\nOttawa, December 9, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the water supply for the use of the Port Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Garland informs the Department that he does not consider it advisable to deepen the well on account of the alkali in the water. He stated that he was taking the necessary action to have the spring across the road boxed in or cribbed and that a cover will be put on. It would hardly be possible to prevent the Indians from using this spring and it is considered that, if there is a good flow of water, there would be no danger of contamination from the utensils used by the Indians in procuring water.\n\nI have to request that in future you forward all communications regarding school matters through the office of the local Indian Agent, Mr. Garland.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, I had it being cleaned out & boiled in and a note and paid out there and a few put around last fall.

The sample of water you sent me is not fit for drinking purposes & received a report from London for the Provincial Board of Health. Toronto City Report states the water contains bowel bacteria & take it for granted the container was perfectly clean. I sent the report to the Department.\n\nAttentively,\n\nDr. Rigby M.D.O.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6154, File 420-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nChatham, Oct. 8, 1921.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile at Cape Croker recently Miss Timberman, teacher at the Fort Elgin School complained about the water at the school. I am enclosing herewith Dr. Wigle's certificate in regard to the water. This report was made after he had submitted a sample of the water from the well at the school. This report shows that the water in the well is not fit for drinking purposes. Miss Timberman states that she had to carry the water, for the use of the school and for her personal use, about one mile. She enclosed a map which I am also enclosing.\n\nThis map shows location of the school grounds and the drilled well, which is 95 ft. deep. The best water in the locality is obtained from the spring at Laurier Elliott's farm. This spring is never-failing and pure. It is approximately one-half mile from the school. The only solution that could be offered is to pipe the water to the school from this spring. There is a fall of something like 35 ft. between the spring and the school. This should not prove to be a very expensive undertaking and is the only solution that I know to this problem.\n\nThe cost of the pipe would be approximately $250. It would have to be laid below the surface of the ground, deep enough so that the frost would not freeze it. This would require a trench which would cost approximately $5 per rod for digging which would amount to approximately $100.\n\nOn my next visit to Cape Croker I will go more thoroughly into the scheme and ascertain the durability of this spring etc., and in the meantime you might write and say whether it will be worth while to make further investigations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

He reported that this is a running spring all the time and that the water was entirely satisfactory.\n\nIt is considered that the teacher could very well obtain the supply of water she requires from this spring. The Department could not consider the question of installing a pipe line from the spring to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H.

R.G. Garland, and I further consider the $3.00 per day as reasonable charge for the work done on the said school as compared with any outside decorators. I left my position at Purple Valley Cordwood Camp where I was earning $3.00 per day in order to start and finish the School as urged by Miss Mae Zimmerman, the Port Elgin School Teacher before the School Inspector Mr. McLeod paid his spring visit.\n\nI put in 17 full days, hoping you will agree with me. I beg to remain\n\nVery truly yours,\nOliver Johnston\nSir,\n\nIn respect to the work performed at the Pot Sipin School I beg to say that my wife was at work 19 days & that I worked 7\u00bd days we have good faithful service all the time. We were hired by agent Lastman at $8.25 per day. I could have received this wages at other places Cutting Wood etc. I hope that you will see that it is not going to cut down the time worked or the wages, so that I or my wife cannot accept any reduction.\n\nI remain Yours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I used three shades by doubling each & using 3 of the old rolls, thereby making half the quantity do. The brass rods to go with should go with the equipment.\n\nJust use your own judgment about returning for those as I can make use of them perhaps again elsewhere.\nIn regard to The Toilet Set, you spoke of my place of buying a new set which would cost much more than $3.00. I bought a new pitcher & match an old set which was here. Pitcher evidently broken or stolen. Charges were $0.25 express.\n\nI was much disappointed you were unable to attend our Community Concert March 24. Our Band and Orchestra were out in full numbers and the music was splendid. We had just on program for an address but hope at once future time you may find it convenient to attend. I am grateful to know that this work is apparently replacing the drunken frequent debauches which took place previously. To me it seems a crime to suppress the musical talent so marked in these people. Much good can be accomplished through this medium.\nThe last from Nelson while I was there is at Cape Croker. It is addressed to Mr. Gibb who was leaving before I saw him in time to forward it. However, I can't say about it when a new agent takes charge.\n\nThanking you for the attention given the school during your short stay.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMay Zimmerman.\n| DATE   | AMOUNT |\n|--------|--------|\n| April 26 |        |\n| 3 Shades | 2.87   |\n| 6 Curtain Rods | .42    |\n| 1 Pitcher | 2.50   |\n| Express | .30    |\n|         | $5.59  |\n\nPurchase of above for use at the Fort Elgin Indian Day School was authorized.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Lett also desires a sand table made for the minor children as there are a number whose ages range from 5 to 7 yrs and are too young to engage in lessons all day. Owing to some door keys being lost it is necessary to put on a new lock, as it has been proven in the past that some Indians have keys to fit some doors and I have already put on a new lock to the basement of the school on this account.\n\nThe kitchen sink is blocked and the waste pipe is broken and has to be replaced by a new one and the drain opened, a new damper has to be put in the furnace as the fire has burnt the old one out and the heat is not going to the school room as it should, this damper being at the rear of the fire box, and it will be necessary for a mechanic to do this and the sink.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDept of Ind.

You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the slates, and it may be possible for you to have a suitable pointer made to meet the requirements.\n\nYou should arrange to have suitable locks, with keys, placed on any of the doors requiring same. We note that you have already had a new lock placed on the basement door.\n\nYou may engage the services of a mechanic to have the repairs required made to the kitchen sink and waste pipe and also in putting a new damper in the furnace. You should arrange for the purchase of any material required for the above purpose. You may also arrange to have safety fasteners installed on the cellar windows, and you may purchase the pane of glass, 6 galvanized cups, 8 spoons, inexpensive, 3 each plates, cups and saucers, 2 window blinds of the size required, 1 bushel peas and 4 pounds of pork asked for.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the above authorized purchases, as well as for the repairs, etc., which you find it necessary to make in order to place the school in a comfortable condition.\n\nRegarding the sand table which the teacher requires for the younger children, I shall be pleased if you will state whether you could arrange to have a suitable table made, and, if so, the approximate cost of the same.\n\nWe are anxious to make conditions as comfortable as possible for the new teacher, and I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the new locks and other repairs attended to at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If a Phone was installed, it could be put on the pay system, and a small fee charged to pay for itself and could be put in the School or Mrs Edward Keeshig's (which are central) and I would request consideration be given to this need.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nJuly 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant enclosing requisition for school material for the three schools on the Cape Croker Reserve. Regarding the requisition, you will be further advised in a separate communication.\n\nWith reference to the request made for the supplying of a piano or a small organ for the use of the Fort Elgin Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department does not supply equipment of this nature to Day Schools. We regret that it will be impossible to supply either of these instruments for this school.\n\nWith reference to your request that a telephone be installed for the use of the school and people residing on Fort Elgin section of the Reserve, I may say that so far as the school is concerned we do not provide telephone service. However, I will be pleased to have a report from you stating the distance which would be necessary from the nearest service to extend the line to Fort Elgin, also the approximate cost involved in putting up the line including posts, wire and so forth, the phone to be installed in a residence at a convenient centre. If the providing of phone service is approved the cost of same would have to be provided by the Band from their funds. After you have ascertained the cost involved you may refer the matter to the Band in Council and if they wish to have a phone service they should pass a resolution to provide the cost from their funds. When we have full information as to the cost and so forth as requested above consideration will be given to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

This building is Band property and a couple of years ago was overhauled and repaired by the Band and the people have destroyed the locks and Windows and the building is now open to the elements and the Band is not prepared to spend any more on its repair. The United Church is agreeable to keep this building in repair and under the care of a caretaker if they are privileged to use it for a place of worship on alternate Sundays and I would recommend that this be done or that the building be sold outright to some responsible party.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nDept of Ind. Affairs.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14th, 1926.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, \u00a76-1, and to say that the Department approves of the resolution passed by the Cape Croker Council on the 2nd instant, regarding the placing of the school-house at Port Elgin under the charge of the United Church of Canada.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCAPE CROKER, Ont.\nMr Conley,\nDept for Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Old School house property at Port Elgin, Cape Croker Reserve.\n\nMotion #6 of June Meeting of Cape Croker Band in Council, forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, no more of which a copy has been supplied to me, gives the use of property to the United Church of Canada, to the responsibility for caretaking etc.\n\nThis property is at present open to the elements & is rapidly falling into disrepair due to minor & the effects of the elements. It will cost a considerable sum of money to put the property in good repair again & for general upkeep. The motion passed by the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6154, File 420-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCouncil in my opinion does not sufficiently protect\nthe rights of the church, as it might be possible for\nanother council at a later date to receive this motion\n& the Church would then be at a loss to the extent of\nthe repairs made.\n\nWhen I took the matter up with Agent Moore\nthe following was the offer that I on behalf of the Church\nmade.\n\nThe Church would repair & maintain the property,\nprovide caretaker etc., allow all Societies lodges\netc. desiring use of the building permission to use\nafter affiliation to the resident Missionary or\nthe Caretaker providing that the sole right to\nthe title of the property was given to the Church\nunder the conditions upon which the present\nChurch site & Mission House site at Cape Croker\nare held, the promise re. Societies lodges etc not to apply during the hours at which Services may be conducted.\n\nThe Services at the Schoolhouse minister to a large number of people who by reason of age or infirmity are not able to attend the Services of the Church at Cape Croker.\n\nWe do not feel that we can afford the necessary amount of money in repairs unless we are in a position to protect the property from the deliberate vandalism of the present, mostly open of doors, breaking of windows, destruction of shutters, cutting down of fence posts for firewood etc.\n\nI trust that you may be able to give me a favorable interpretation of the resolution of the Council.\nas early as possible so that we may proceed with necessary repairs & thereby facilitate the carrying on of services for the community.\n\nPoveshell\n\nYour Very Truly,\n\nOliver B. Strapp\nOttawa, June 24th, 1926.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 14th instant granting permission to the United Church to have use of the old school house at Port Elgin, I may say that a letter has just been received from the Missionary pointing out that before making expenditure on the building they would like to have some assurance that a new Council would not deprive them of the use of the building. In this connection I may say that you may assure the Reverend Mr. Strapp that they will be allowed undisturbed possession of the school, under the resolution of the band, during the pleasure of the Department, and that they will not be deprived of this privilege without good and sufficient cause.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG. 10, Volume 6154, File 420-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose requisitions for material for the three Schools on Cape Croker Reserve, and would recommend the purchase as ordered by the teachers.\n\nMiss Lett, teacher of Port Elgin School, did not forward a requisition form but sent a list and from which I have copied her order to the forms. I am also inclosing her list for your consideration as it includes articles that she says she will need if she returns and some of which I do not see the necessity of purchasing, namely, flag pole and rope, Sanitary indoor closet, bed and table linen, redecorating residence walls, shed for car and shed for horses.\n\nIn case of the sanitary closets, if they are needed for one School they should be supplied for all, and before supplying for one School I would consult the other teachers. The walls at this School are in fairly good condition and could be redecorated in a few years time. The erection of a garage I would leave for the Dept's consideration as well as these other requests and if you see fit by what you supply other Reserve Schools and from the fact that Miss Lett has not decided whether she will return or not, I would not wish to make a definite recommendation that would be an expense that another teacher would not require.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIf we return we will need:\n1 bedroom\n1 sanitary indoor toilet installed\ncurtains for 4 windows\n1 large lamp\nnot needed, supply of bed and table linen etc.\nnot needed\nKitchen & sitting room walls need redecorating\n\nI also want a shed built suitable for a car and a shelter for a horse or two.\n\nReport blanks.\nOttawa, July 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing requisitions for material for the schools on the Cape Croker reserve. In reply I beg to say that you will be advised under separate cover regarding the classroom material and supplies for the midday meal for these schools.\n\nWith reference to the request of the teacher of the Port Elgin School, the Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a sanitary indoor closet or a flag pole with the necessary rope and flag. Relative to her request that the walls of the residence be redecorated and a shed for car and horses built, I have to say we have no funds available at the present time to have this work done. It is considered that the redecorating can very well stand over and the Department does not provide a shed or garage for a car.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following supplies:-\n\n- 2 brooms,\n- 1 large lamp,\n- 1 dustpan,\n- 1 water pail,\n- 1 axe complete,\n- 1 hammer,\n- 1 screw driver.\n\nIf you consider that the four pairs of curtains are required, you may supply an inexpensive grade of material for the curtains.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the supplies which you are authorized to purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

O.B. Strapp, missionary of the United Church has complained to me about the building being used by an Indian known as Doc Crowell of Saugeen for religious meetings and he has forbidden this, but the Indian still uses the building and refuses to discontinue and I will try and give the facts as I can secure them of the trouble from the start.\n\n\"Doc\" Crowell, for years was an officer of the Methodist Church and as such conducted meetings around the Country until he was deprived of his office. After that he joined the Anglican Church and as an Lay Reader conducted services for them and came at different times to Cape Croker at the request of the Anglicans to preach to them and always used a private dwelling for the purpose. His office in the Anglican Church terminated in the Summer of 1926, and at the present time he claims he is an Lutheran and as such is coming to this Reserve to preach, although according to Mr. Strapp he is not recognized by that body. He has always conducted himself right and I have not heard any complaints of his conduct while on this Reserve.\n\nThere is considerable discontent with Mr. Strapp among the Indians of his congregation and they claim that he is neglecting his people and not giving the attention that he should by not visiting his people when they are sick and that he is always away when wanted and that he preaches in words and\nlanguage that they cannot understand and there is some truth in that, that some of his sermons are a little too deep for the average Indian and a goodly number of them in the Protestant Church cannot understand English well and according to facts I can find they very much desire a change and I have come to the conclusion that they will not be satisfied until they get it and that they will be split into factions if they continue as they are.\n\nThe whole trouble comes from the fact that some of the officers in charge of the United Church, although attending their own services in the mornings request that Doc Crowell preach to them in the afternoons and evenings and order that he use their buildings for that purpose, which has caused Mr. Strapp to come to me to have him forbidden to do that and to be kept off the Reserve.\n\nAs these are religious matters I have in the past refrained in mixing in them and have always left the Churches look after their own businesses and work out their own salvations and as Mr. Strapp has come to me with his complaint I would wish the Dept's ruling on this question. According to the Council's motion other gatherings were allowed and could not be forbidden and the whole question rests on whether the Elders and officers of a Church have control over their own Church or has the Missionary? Has the Dept any evidence that Crowell is an undesirable man to be preaching? If the Indians want him to preach to them, can they be stopped using their own Churches? If an Indian conducts himself properly, would an Agent be doing right in ordering him off the Reserve?\n\nAs I have forbidden Crowell using these buildings, until I have your answer, I would request that your early attention be given.\n\nSecretary.\n\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nApril 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the presence of an Indian known as Doc Crowell, who persists in conducting religious meetings in the old Port Elgin school house.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to my letter of the 24th of June last, in which you were advised that the Rev. Mr. Strapp might be assured that the United Church would be given undisputed possession of this old school house and would not be deprived of the privilege without good and sufficient cause.\n\nAs it would appear from your letter that the Rev. Mr. Strapp is not in good favour with some of the Indians under his care, the only thing I can suggest is that they petition the Mission Board of the United Church of Canada to replace him with a man that will be more suitable to their requirements.\n\nI may add that it is considered in the best interest of all concerned that the Indian Doc Crowell should not be allowed to use the building in question. I find that the Indian Agent at Chippewa Hill had difficulty with this man Crowell and I enclose copy of a letter that was sent to that Agent on the 4th of August last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

MacKenzie\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur Chief informed me that the Council has passed a resolution to put an organ in each of the three schools and he hoped the Indian Dept. would approve the decision.\n\nI thought a word from an old timer might help & gain a favorable answer.\nAs I lay here, knowing as I do by experience what a help a musical instrument is in a class room especially in these isolated Indian schools, also knowing the beneficial influence music has on the Indian child, I sincerely hope the organs will be purchased and installed in each school as soon as possible. Moreover an organ properly cared for will last for years, so the investment will be a good one.\n\nThere are several moderately priced organs manufactured, such as the portable organ which would be quite suitable for small schools, also the school organ, larger than the portable but which would answer all purposes in larger schools.\n\nEverything seems to be going on nicely at the Cape even if we have an unusual number of stormy days. The men are cutting pulp wood, some have begun orchids, all seem to be busy.\n\nThanking you for your kind interest in this little corner of the world.\n\nYours, Yours with respect,\n\nMary Moffitt\nSir,\n\nI beg to report Motion No 4, passed by the Cape Croker Band in Council at their regular meeting held here on March 5th,\n\nMoved by Peter Nadjwon, sec by Alex Johnston, that we requisition the Dept of Indian Affairs for a sum of money with which to purchase three organs, one for each of the Schools on Cape Croker Reserve, the money to be taken from our Band funds.\n\nCarried.\n\nNote.-\n\nI drew this matter to the attention of the Dept in 1925, at which time the School teachers requested that they be provided with either piano's or organs and it was stated at that time that no funds were available for such purchases and the matter was dropped. Since then Miss Moffitt's organ at her School has gone bad and is not fit for use and as it was her own property, it cannot be expected that she would replace it herself and thus the teaching of music has been at a disadvantage. Miss Lett at Port Elgin School also is a good musician and could no doubt use an organ to good advantage and thereby benefit that section. Miss McGarvey at Sidney Bay, while not herself musical, has always had trouble getting an instrument for Xmas concerts or gatherings and no doubt it could be used to good advantage. As the Council is prepared to pay the cost and which should not exceed $100.00 for the three organs, I would recommend their purchase.\n\nSecretary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to a resolution of the Cape Croker Band requesting that an organ be supplied to each of the schools on the Cape Croker Reserve and that the cost be taken from Band Funds.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is not the policy of the Department to provide organs or pianos for Indian day schools. It is considered that, upon the occasion of a concert or other entertainment at the school, there would, no doubt, be some Indian home that would be able to supply the musical instrument, or arrangements could be made to rent one for the occasion. We do not care to expend Band Funds in the purchase of musical instruments of the kind required. Please advise Miss Moffitt and other interested parties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I informed the Council of your decision to their previous motion at March meeting and they are not satisfied and have again passed the above motion for a reconsideration by you. The Council maintain and I also that the three organs can be secured for $100.00 and as stated in your letter an organ can be hired for concerts etc. at the School; this can no doubt be done but as it takes considerable time previous to practice for concerts and as an organ cannot always be secured without some expense it would lead me to believe that one purchased would not cost much more in the long run and would be there when needed. The teacher at Sidney Bay has a rented organ there which has always been used, Miss Moffatt has always had her own (now of no use) and the teacher at Port Elgin always has had trouble procuring one when needed. The part of the motion referring to the benefit derived from the children learning music, has reference to the fact that Miss Moffatt has for years taught the children to play both an organ and stringed instruments and has given a lot of her time out of school hours for this purpose as well as used her own organ for that long period and no doubt a lot of credit is due her that this Reserve can boast of a large number of good...\ngood musicians who received their musical start from her early assistance.\n\nThe Council takes the attitude that they have for years received the benefit of her instrument and that the least they can do is replace it by another either as a complete gift or for her use at the School.\n\nI would request that you give this your consideration and cannot the rental derived from Sidney Bay pasture be used for this purpose the same as it was done for the purchase of the Council Hall piano?\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nApril 16th, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the matter of purchasing three organs for the use of the schools in the Cape Croker Reserve, I beg to say that upon reconsideration the Department has decided to approve of the expenditure which has been placed by you at a maximum of $100.00. As the organs are not in much demand it is thought that you may be able to procure three organs from a Toronto firm at less than the amount mentioned. It would seem advisable for Miss Moffitt to select the instruments as she will have a good idea of what will be suitable for the use to which they are to be put.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The quotations received should include the cost of all material and labour. The person to whom you give the work should utilize the services of Indian labour as far as possible. We note that you estimate the total cost to be approximately $175, and this amount should not be exceeded if possible. The work should be completed during the present summer holidays, and you should see that a satisfactory job is performed. After these repairs, etc., have been finished, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department will leave in your hands the question of the carrying out of the repairs, painting, etc., at the schools in your Agency. It is thought that it would be advisable to obtain prices for the carrying out of the work at each of the schools from a competent white man who would employ Indian labour as far as possible.

Failing to secure a sanitary toilet, a section of the present toilets should be partitioned off for the exclusive use of the teacher and their companions at each of the three Schools and I will again bring this to your attention near the coming Summer holidays when some interior decorating should be done in all the Schools of the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Fort Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the quantity of scribblers and coloured mounting paper asked for.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 1 snow shovel,\n- 1 Gal. boiled oil (for school floors),\n- 1 quart light oak stain,\n- 1 varnish,\n- 1 iron handle,\n- 1 bread pan,\n- 6 thimbles,\n- 1 package needles.\n\nAfter you have made the purchase of these supplies, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply a coal oil stove or a scythe.\n\nRelative to the providing of a sanitary closet for the teacher's residence, I beg to say that you should bring this matter to the attention of the Department before the summer holidays, next, at which time, if you recommend that sanitary closets or separate closets be provided for the teachers in the schools on the Cape Croker Reserve, you should furnish full information as to the cost of any type of closet which you would recommend be supplied, when the matter will receive consideration.\n\nAny interior redecorating required in the schools, together with the cost of same, should be given when you are reporting regarding the closets.

Please furnish, as soon as possible, an estimate of the cost of a bench suitable for the purpose mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. C. Poste Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nOttawa, October 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 9th instant, regarding a manual training bench for the Port Elgin Indian Day School. Mr. Conley, of this Department, who recently visited the reserve, reports that one should be borrowed from the Cape Croker School. It will, therefore, not be necessary to send in an estimate of the cost. Please take the necessary action at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. C. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCape Croker, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nIn answer to your letter dated Oct.14.1929., No 8-3-5, I would beg to report that I had transferred one manual training bench, from Cape Creker School, to Port Elgin Indian Day School, No 3, yesterday, the 23rd.\n\nTrusting this is satisfactory,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI know you will pardon me for writing to you again but I just received a letter from Miss Madjivan. When she was accepted for Cape Croker School she asked to correspond with me as she wanted to profit by my experience.\n\nShe tells me Mr. Poole has taken the Manual Training class from Cape Croker School & Port Elgin School. I was sorry to hear of this action as the decks...\nwere purchased in Cape Croker School over sixteen years ago and have been in constant use ever since. There were only six desks and none can be spared, as the number of boys working at the same time average from 8 to 10 and two boys cannot work at the same desk unless they are beginners and even then they are working under difficulties.\n\nI cannot understand why Mr. Poste who knew so little about school work initiation taking equipment that we in use from another School. Another evidently he is keeping up the traditions of some of his predecessors whom the success at Cape Croker School was an eye-sore and who would have done something he has done & Miss R.\n\nhad I like her been a beginner. Aga had taught me to let them talk. It seems Miss Macgillivray will have to learn that also.\n\nI shall enclose Miss Macgillivray letter so you may see the activities of the School. Of course I have not told her of your letter. Prefer to know more before doing so. It seems to me the same old spirit of bigotry and prejudice is at work. Mr. McKenzie had some samples of 30 years ago. Dear so much of it last year that I am inclined to suspect its presence in these recent occurrences.\n\nWith respect I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMary Moffitt\nOttawa, November 8, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the removal of one of the manual training benches from the Cape Croker School to the Port Elgin School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that this action was taken on the recommendation of Mr. Conley, an officer of this Department, who recently visited the Cape Croker Reserve. He states that he discussed this matter with Miss Nadjiwan and she informed him that as all the manual training benches were not being used one could be spared. Mr. Agent Poste was, therefore, instructed to arrange for the transfer of a bench to Port Elgin, and, in doing so, he was simply carrying out instructions which he received from the Department. Should any necessity arise at the Cape Croker School, the bench could be returned or a new bench supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Mary Moffitt,\n1074 St. Hubert St.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor Port Elgin No. 3 School on Cape Croker\n\nReserve in Cape Croker Agency\n\nDate: Nov. 7, 1929\n\n| ARTICLES          | NO.

We are experiencing cold and snowy weather, and the class room in this school was very cold, in spite of a good fire having been built in the furnace. Consequently, I spent considerable time endeavouring to find the cause of the trouble, but without success.\n\nIn my opinion, the furnace should be thoroughly overhauled by a capable man, whom I could procure from the Hunter Hardware Co., Wiarton, and the work would have to be done on a Saturday, while the pupils were out of school.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind.

If any extra parts are required, you may arrange for the purchase of same. This work should, if possible, be carried out at a time when it will not interfere with the classroom work in the school. Please keep all expense in connection with these repairs as low as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You will be good enough to arrange at an early date to have the repairs carried out to the closet screens and any broken glass replaced. All costs for the purpose should be kept as low as possible and, when completed, an account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure.\n\nThe Inspector has reported regarding punishment administered by the teacher, Mrs. Bell, and complaints made to him by certain of the parents. It is stated that Mrs. Bell made some of the pupils take soap into their mouths as a punishment and, as a consequence, they became sick. You will be good enough to instruct Mrs. Bell that this punishment is to cease, and that, under no circumstances, must she continue the soap method of punishment. The Inspector has reported very favourably regarding her work and the discipline and deportment of the pupils in the classroom, and states that the pupils generally are making good progress, and receive instruction in health matters and personal cleanliness. The only complaint was regarding her method of punishment, as mentioned above.\n\nThe Department is ordering four of Nelson's Pictures of Canadian History. They will be sent addressed to the teacher, and she should see that they are hung on the walls in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. C. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nR.R.

Game, regarding his visit to the PORT ELGIN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 13th, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 8-3-6.\n\nThe school and teacher's residence are combined in one attractive stone building. This is in very good repair except that the walls and ceiling of the class room are very dirty and should be redecorated this summer. The ceiling also is stained apparently from a leak in the roof.\n\nOne eavetrough requires repairs.\n\nThe boys' water closet has filthy seats and a number of boards are off the screen in front of it. All buildings are held by the Indians under the Indian Department.\n\nA few loads of gravel in the low spots in the yard particularly by the school entrance and water closet doors would prevent so much mud being tracked into the school in wet weather.\nOttawa, May 31, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 14th instant, regarding certain repairs, etc., required at the Port Elgin Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department is in receipt of the report of the Public School Inspector on his recent inspection of this school in which he states that the walls and ceiling of the classroom are very dirty, also that the ceiling is stained, apparently from a leak in the roof.\n\nPlease state whether you consider that the classroom should be redecorated this year or if same could not stand over for another year. If you recommend that any work be carried out, you should state, in detail, the work to be done and the approximate cost of same.\n\nThe Inspector also states that one of the eavestroughs requires repairs, and also recommends that a few loads of gravel be placed in the low spots in the yard, particularly by the school entrance and water closet doors, which would prevent mud being tracked into the school in wet weather. The Department will approve of you having a few loads of gravel spread around the entrance to the school and toilets.\n\nWhen this work has been completed, along with the other work which you were authorized to carry out in official letter of the 14th instant, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

After the summer cleaning by the caretaker, the walls and ceiling are passably clean, and I consider the matter of re-decorating might stand over until next year. The other work which was authorized for this school, will be carried out shortly, and accounts submitted in triplicate, accordingly.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nDept. of Ind.

There is no well or pump of any description, situated on the school property.\n\nThe well in question is an open one, and badly in need of deepening. In addition to this, it should be covered, both for sanitary purposes, and because it is dangerous to small children. In my opinion, it would cost in the neighbourhood of $15.00, to have it put in proper repair. If the Department approved of this expenditure, which I beg to state, appears to be a necessity, would it be paid from Band funds, and would it be necessary to have the Council make a motion to that effect?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that this well is not situated on the school property, but is across the road from the school, and that, besides being used for school purposes, it is also used as a community well. It is also noted that the well requires deepening and that it should be covered, both for sanitary purposes and because it is dangerous to small children.\n\nIt is considered that before any expense is incurred, an agreement should be made with the owner of the property on which the well is located that a right of way to the well and the use of the water by the school and community be allowed. You should take this matter up with the owner of the property and also obtain a resolution of the council to use band funds for the purpose of deepening the well and putting a framework around same. When you obtain the agreement and resolution of the council, you may arrange to have the work done, and, when completed, forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

C. Hadjiwon, and A. Johnston, that we authorize our Indian Agent to correspond with the Indian Department, regarding a request to the Department for Indian Education, to have a well drilled and a pump installed at No. 3, Port Elgin Indian Day School, Cape Croker Reserve. The Council feeling that a school pump is desirable, both for safety and sanitary purposes, and is preferable to the Community well at present in use.\n\nCarried.\n\nNote - Your letter No. 8-3-5, dated August 4th-32, I beg to acknowledge, regarding the matter of a well, for use at No. 3, Port Elgin School. I took the matter up fully with the Council, and the Council came to the conclusion that a new well, and pump for the school, on the school property, is the most desirable. It is practically impossible to obtain an estimate of the cost of drilling a new well, as it depends entirely on how deep down they would have to drill, before water was struck. If the Department does not approve of a new well being drilled, the Council expressed themselves willing to have the Community well repaired, the cost to be born from Band funds.\n\nSecretary,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 6-1 of the 7th instant, I have to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to authorize the digging of a well at the Port Elgin Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the Cape Croker Council intends to have the community well repaired - the cost of same to be paid from Band Funds.\n\nIn connection with the repairing of this community well, I would draw your attention to the last paragraph of official letter of the 4th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The ceiling is badly stained, because of a leak in the roof - apparently somewhere in the tower. An extension on the conduit water pipe by the pupils' entrance is required. The water falling too close to the school door makes a muddy spot and is having a tendency to make the foundation settle.\n\nThe wood shed is pulling away from the main building and snow drifts, in winter, through the opening. Otherwise the buildings are in good condition. The buildings are held by the Indians on the reserve under the Indian Department.\n\nWas pleased to note that my suggestion last spring of putting gravel by the school and water closet doors has been carried out. As the paths leading to the water-closets have several low spots, I would suggest that the two paths be gravelled. Two boards are off the screen in front of the boys' water-closet and the seats of the latter are very dirty.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI inspected the Cape Croker Agency on the 28th - 30th Ultimo and beg to submit the following report.\n\nPort Elgin Indian Day School\n\nThe wood shed or lean to at the rear of residence is breaking away from the wall allowing rain and snow to pour in.

Please furnish a report as to whether you would recommend that this work be undertaken at the present time, and, if so, state in detail what is required and the cost of same, including material and labour.\n\nThe Inspector also states that a gallon of floor paint is required to paint the kitchen floor and that, if same is supplied, the teacher would perform the labour in the painting.

The school steps are in a dilapidated condition and the interior of the classroom should be redecorated. White ceilings and cream or buff walls are recommended in the Ontario Regulations. The paths leading to the water closets are veritable quagmires in places. Fine gravel placed in the low spots would eliminate this condition. Boards are off the fence used as a screen in front of the girls' water closet. This fence should be rebuilt.

This only authorized purchase of 12 gallons of paint. Please explain why you exceeded the authority given you in that letter. It is impossible for us to control expenditures if Indian Agents exceed the authority given to them. Incidentally I notice that there is a charge of $6.50 on the account for 3 paint brushes. This appears to be a rather high charge. Why were such expensive brushes purchased and have you taken charge of them so that they can be used in future if required?\n\nRegarding voucher 62 please let me know on whose authority you engaged Mr. Hambly.\n\nThe account covering the labour cannot be considered as you request that full payment be made to Mr. Hambly although apparently several other men were engaged in the work.

Tuffnell, Indian Agent, R.R. #5, Wiarton, Ont.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Port Elgin School Inspector Game recommends:\n\n1. Thoroughly scrub boys' water closet as the seats are filthy.\n\n2. Make further effort to procure the services of a caretaker.\n\nYou should arrange for the immediate cleaning of the toilets. The Department cannot understand why it is necessary for the Inspector to bring this to our attention. I presume that you visit the school regularly and you should always see that the toilets are kept clean.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends painting the exterior of the school and decorating the interior of the classroom. You might let me know the approximate cost of these and a decision will then be made if funds are available.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI have for acknowledgment Department letter of May 12th with reference to Inspector Game reporting on Sidney Bay and Port Elgin Day schools.\n\nI have had the toilets cleaned at both schools; these are cleaned quite often but the children are not very clean in their habits with the results the toilets are not always as clean as they should be.\n\nBefore I would recommend the painting of Port Elgin school I have to suggest that a new furnace is required as the old one smokes so badly that the teacher says it is impossible to teach at times, also it does not heat the classroom properly, the flues and grates are all burned out.\n\nThe approximate cost to have a new furnace installed would be approximately $250.00. I had the classroom decorated five years ago but due to the furnace smoking so much the walls are in a very dirty condition now again.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised by the Department as soon as possible if a new furnace could be installed.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. GAME, SCHOOL INSPECTOR,\n- dated March 25, 1946 - on PORT ELGIN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nThe accommodations and the condition of the school in general are disgraceful. Many windows inside and outside are broken. Shattered glass litters the boys' toilet. Each window has on it scores of live house flies and many scores of dead flies lie on the window sills. Cupboards, desks, floors and desks are untidy. The girls' toilet is untidy and has a broken partition. Eave troughing and conductor pipes are broken or missing. Litter is scattered over the yard.\n\nThe conditions enumerated above are largely because of the inability of the teacher to manage and control her pupils. It is fortunate for the section that a change is being made at Easter. There is little point in reglazing window panes, etc., until the Easter Vacation.\nOttawa, April 16, 1946.\n\nMr. F. W. Tuffnell, Indian Agent,\nR. R. #5, Wiarton, Ontario.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Port Elgin Indian Day School on March 25, Inspector Game writes as follows:\n\n\"The accommodations and the condition of the school in general are disgraceful.

So yet I have done nothing in his case save telling him I would report the case to the Department. Of course if I followed the Ontario School law I could suspend him from school, but I do not consider that the best course to pursue on my own responsibility especially as we want to get Indian children to attend school. I do not in this letter mention his name as I want to give him all imaginable chances to do better, but I cannot say what day he may repeat the same act. Since telling him I would report him and perhaps one\nOne or two others with him that follow his example, though they have never faced me in school as he has, he has done much better, which he may continue to do, in which case I would not desire to do him injury by giving his name.

J. Lawrence, I beg to say that before the Department can consider this resolution it will be necessary to have a full report from you as to why such resolution was passed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs.\n\nD. J.

While this excuse is made, the real cause is that he has had to discipline several of the boys and, among them, the son of the mover of this resolution, Alfred Stinson. He is a large boy about fifteen years old, he and his father came to me complaining that Mr. Lawrence had expelled him for a week from school. I at once went to the school and enquired into the facts and found that his conduct was disgraceful and his influence most hurtful in the school.

While we are endeavoring to find a properly qualified teacher whom we could recommend to the Department to have permanent charge of the school, it may be necessary to find a temporary supply for a few weeks.

They had such difficulty in getting her to go that the Missionaries came out to see what they could do to help her.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nSec. Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 10th, 1910, file No. 152,199-1, I may say that I did not receive this letter until my return from the Rama reserve. The agent however, had drawn my attention to the matter, and Miss McBain, the teacher, desired to discuss the matter with me also. I find the councillor, who took upon himself the right to lecture Miss McBain was Councillor York. I drew the attention of the Chief and some of the head men of the band to the matter, and found that they mostly all thought very well of the teacher, and promised me that there would not be an occurrence of this kind again. In talking the matter over with Miss McBain, I found that she is quite willing to continue her duties, so long as she is not further interfered with in this matter. She said she had already noticed a change in the demeanor of some of the pupils, and I may say that I cautioned the Chief and Council to render her what assistance they could, and to aid her in maintaining proper discipline in the school. I do not think you will hear any more of this incident.\n\nWill you be good enough to send an order either to her or to the Agent, authorizing them to purchase four large panes of glass for the schoolhouse, as I found a number of the windows nailed up with cardboard.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, May 21, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Ramsden, who was instructed to inquire into the trouble you had with one of the Councillors of the Rama Band regarding your absence from the school last month for a day and a half, reports that, although he had not received the Department's letter of instructions, the matter was brought to his attention by the local Agent. Mr. Ramsden also states that, after calling the attention of the Chief and some of the head men of the Band to this matter, he is of opinion that nothing more will be heard of this incident.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will remain on and hopes that no unpleasantness of this nature will occur in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Eva McBain, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nRama Road, Ont.\nSee Department Indian Affairs Office.\n\nGentlemen,\n\n152199/1\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st instant, I would say that after giving the matter a great deal of thought I have come to the conclusion that the worst course for me to pursue under the circumstances is to resign my position as teacher of the Ram Reserve School.\n\nWhen your Secretary, Mr. Ramsden, upon the occasion of his visit here informed me that he had received no instructions from the Department regarding this case, I was so surprised that I could not properly explain what had taken place or why there had been such a delay. But as the Indians had nothing to say and apparently had quieted down, I agreed with him that it was better to let the matter rest.\n\nThat the Indians do not intend to do so, however, is evidenced by the fact that during the week following Mr. Ramsden's visit because I was one minute after nine o'clock in teaching school, Alfred Simon, Jr., of the Board and Sam Snake, walked into the school room wrote on the blackboard:\n\n\"Teacher late.\"\nWhy they should keep up this sort of thing is more than I can say unless it is that they still erroneously believe that the members of my family are wholly responsible for the taking away of their child, and even go so far as to say that she caused her removal in order that she might be trained as a maid for my sister, who is about to be married.\n\nThese people have also circulated many statements detrimental to my reputation as a teacher. They have stated repeatedly that they are going to put me out at Midsummer, yet a teacher with papers. This, of course, I know they have not the power to do, but it only shows the attitude they have taken.\n\nThey have also had a good deal to say about the school being closed in February owing to my illness. This would not have occurred had the school been in proper repair.\n\nAll along the north side of the school room there is at least a space of from two to three inches between the floor and the wall. This with the broken window and the transom being loose, caused the school room to be very uncomfortable and in very wet weather almost impossible to keep warm.\n\nI also several times after a long walk through the deep snow have reached the school room only to find it locked and sweat outside until the case takes arrived and put a fire and think the Department will agree with me that it is not well to insist that a holiday was required.\nThe principal work with this idea is that they are such an art around it that an opportunity presents itself; they will not come out into the open and say what they have to like men but will work and talk about you in a way that is difficult to get at and yet leads to destroy any little influence one may have. And if you do not lend them all the money they wish to cross them in any particular, they do not hesitate to tell the most absolute falsehood if they think by doing so they can injure you in any way. Men cannot fail to be certain of it at their mercy.\n\nThis Alfred Slavin told Mr. Graham, the agent, that he was absent from my school a week without leave and a fee\u2014that this is a deliberate false tool can easily be proved.\n\nAll this talk, of course, has had its influence upon the children and this I feel may benefit them and anything else for no teacher who has not the cooperation and good will of the parents can hope to do effective work.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why I think it better & worth doing.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Before applying to School Boards, the holder of such certificate should consult the Inspector in regard to available vacancies.\nSYLLABUS OF FIRST YEAR'S COURSE\n\n1. EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND GENERAL METHODOLOGY\n\nThe object of the course is to provide the teachers-in-training with such an elementary working knowledge of the nature of educational principles and of general methodology as is practicable at this stage, and as will improve natural tact and skill by determining procedure and forming ideals.\n\nThe course embraces the following topics:\n\nMethods of Instruction: The purposes of method; the necessity of basing methods of instruction on a knowledge of the characteristics and conditions of the learner.\n\nAttention: Learning conditioned on the attention of the learner; non-voluntary and voluntary attention, conditions of each; attention in young children and in adults compared; methods of securing and retaining attention; obstacles to attention.\n\nApperception: Nature of apperception; necessity for making subjects taught meaningful; the process of interpreting the new in terms of the old applied to school studies; significance of the maxim, \"Proceed from the known to the related unknown.\"\n\nRetention: Conditions of retention; the relation of retention and apperception; the factors in efficient recall; functions of the drill lesson and of the review lesson; methods of conducting drills and reviews.\n\nThe Process of Learning: Learning a development from the vague to the definite, by a process of analysis and synthesis; typical illustrations of this principle from varied subjects.\n\nImpression and Expression: Their interdependence; expression as a phase of method; the necessity and use of the expressive studies.\n\nMethods of Lesson Presentation: Lecture method of presentation; text-book method of presentation; question and answer method of presentation, right and wrong methods of questioning, qualities of a good answer, treatment of faulty answers; mistakes in dealing with answers; graphic representation as a means of presentation, use of diagrams, pictures, maps, etc.; nature and functions of objective teaching, limitations of objective teaching.\n\nNote.\u2014The foregoing course should be taken up in a simple manner early in the session.

The following should be emphasized:\n\nThe importance of signing the name correctly and the Christian name in full, and of specifying in the case of females, whether Miss or Mrs.\n\nThe necessity of making all agreements clear and conclusive. These should be contracts as provided by the statute. Substituting for the contract an agreement made orally or by correspondence often leads to misunderstanding and difficulty. (P. S. Act, Section 85 and form of agreement.)\n\nNote.\u2014Every school register contains two copies of a form of agreement, one for the Teacher and one for the Board. Additional copies may be obtained on application to the Department.\n\nDuties of teachers and Inspectors. The payments of the grants and of other matters directly affecting the teacher, trustees, and school. (P. S. Act, Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 82, 84, 87, 99, 116; and Instructions 12, 13 and 14.)\n\nThe Public School Regulations.\n\nPenalties and prohibitions regarding the buying and selling of textbooks and school supplies, and the use of unauthorized books and pamphlets. (Department of Education Act, Section 28; P. S. Act, Section 112, and Text-book Regulations, Circular 14.)\n\nThe Ontario Public Health Act and Regulations, so far as they pertain to teachers, pupils, and the school.\n4. SPECIAL METHODOLOGY\n\nThe object of the course is to prepare the teacher-in-training for the intelligent application of the principles of education to the course in each subject of the Public School programme.\n\nThe course in each subject embraces the following topics:\n\n(1) A general survey of the Public School course of study with a view to understanding the special object of each subject and the correlation of the different subjects amongst themselves.\n\n(2) The systematic study of the subject matter of the Public School textbooks with emphasis on the elements; special methods of instruction with type lessons and other illustrations of the most important topics, including those detailed under each head below, so that the teacher may know how to use each textbook. The use of the natural method in each subject should be introduced by a few lessons of a general character, embracing the application of the principles of general method to the teaching of the subject.\n\nNOTE.\u2014A number of Manuals of Method in the subjects of the Public School course have been prepared. The Department of Education hopes to have the series complete at an early date.\n\n(3) In the Ottawa and Sturgeon Falls Summer Model Schools for teachers of English-French Schools, the special methodology of teaching English to French-speaking pupils is provided for under Language and Composition below. For the methodology of French Reading and Grammar, no special provision is necessary. Notwithstanding the differences in the content of English and French Reading and Grammar, the methodology of the former may easily be adapted to the latter. In the case of Grammar, however, due to French etymology should be taken up in the language lessons of Form I, to account for the numerous inflections which must be assimilated early in order that the pupil may be able to write and spell even simple sentences.\n\nNOTE.\u2014A Manual of Method for teaching English to French-speaking pupils is now being prepared and, by next September, will be distributed amongst the English-French Schools of the Province.\n\nI. LANGUAGE AND COMPOSITION:\n\nThe special object of the course in Language and Composition is to prepare the teacher to train his pupils to speak and to write good English as a fixed unconscious habit.\n\nOral and written composition: Their relation; the purposes served by each; correction of common errors of speech and of written answers; discussion and exemplification of topics suitable for each Form, with reasons for selection; suggestions as to sources of material; methods of dealing with oral and written compositions; how, and when to teach the sentence, the paragraph and the use of capitals, punctuation marks, etc.; story telling and its value; letter writing; informal grammar taken up in language lessons.\n\nThe following special methodology of teaching English to French-speaking pupils of Form I should be discussed and illustrated.\n\nAs far as possible, the Natural, or Direct, method shall be followed. This consists in establishing the same direct association between experience and expression as exists in the use of the mother tongue\u2014in associating in the mind the impression or idea directly with the English word, and, in the process, the eye, ear, and voice should be used successively\u2014showing, expressing, and having the pupils repeat. The object is to give the pupils the command of the language as a means of oral and written self-expression.\n\nOral and concrete work exclusively at first, followed by reading from the blackboard or charts and by writing, when pupils have acquired a certain ability in the correct pronunciation of common words, phrases, and sentences. Later, the written exercises should embrace transcription, paraphrasing, spelling from dictation, and the composition of short sentences.\n\nIf the natural method is properly applied, the use of the mother-tongue will not often be required to teach English. When, however, it is required to clear up any difficulty or to avoid a loss of time, its use should be confined to explanations which are absolutely necessary.\n\nThe first step in the use of the natural method is to teach a certain number of names of objects which are found in the school or at home, and which are familiar to the pupils. This step should be followed by the teaching of some simple descriptive words, colours, qualities, dimensions, position; also the names of persons, and of the most common action-words. At this stage the teacher must use the objects themselves or their pictures, perform the actions, and have the pupils perform them. Connecting words are taught systematically through simple language lessons. To teach complex and abstract ideas, the teacher uses gestures, context, examples, comparison, and translation, when needed.\n\nThe general directions and communications, such as \"stand up,\" \"sit down,\" \"go,\" \"come,\" etc., are picked up without much difficulty. Numbers, names of the days, months and seasons, the usual forms of greeting, etc., should be taught incidentally. (See Sec. 32, Primary Reading Manual.)\n\nNursery Rhymes and Memory Gems being of great value as a means of acquiring a good pronunciation and of developing the sense of rhythm should be taught from the very beginning.\n\nThe pupil should understand clearly the meaning of everything he says, and he should never be asked to write or memorize anything that he does not understand clearly, and cannot say correctly.\n\n(See Primary Reading Manual, page 47 and following pages.)\n\nNOTE.\u2014The classes in the First and Second courses in the methodology of teaching English to French-speaking pupils, might, for the present session, be taken together; and, for the class work two hours might be taken from the time allotted to Language and Composition in Reg. 8 above, with four additional hours from the time available under Reg. 8 above.\nII. Reading:\n\nThe special object of the course in Reading is to prepare the teacher to train his pupils to get the writer's thought and feelings (intelligent reading), and to communicate them to the listener so that he may appreciate them (intelligible reading).\n\nThe course embraces the following topics:\n\n- The two stages of reading, primary and advanced; how to start a class of beginners; the sentence, word, phonic, and combination methods; the planning of lessons for each Form; common faults on the part of both pupil and teacher and how to correct them; criticism by teachers and pupils; the use of supplementary readers and supplementary reading.\n\nIII. Spelling:\n\nThe special object of the course in Spelling is to prepare the teacher to secure accuracy in the mechanism of written word expression.\n\nThe course embraces the following topics:\n\n- The importance and value of spelling to the pupil; relation to phonics; aural and visual types; when to be introduced; difficulties and how to overcome them; transcription and dictation; rewriting; grouping of words; testing and checking; devices for correction.\n\nIV. Literature:\n\nThe special object of the course in Literature is to prepare the teacher to create in his pupils a taste for good literature.\n\nThe course embraces the following topics:\n\n- An investigation of the previous reading of the teachers-in-training; qualities of literature most appeal to children of different ages; scope and purpose of literature in each Form; illustrated by taking up a poetry and a prose selection from each reader; the place and value of memory work; the use of the dictionary; supplementary reading; lesson procedure; preparation by teacher and by pupils; special value of memorization and of oral reading after preliminary study.\n\nV.

Am at present taking six months' complete rest and special treatment, after which, I believe, my usual strength will be restored.\n\nBut I considered I should not postpone my duties indefinitely any longer so have made arrangements with Miss McCain till Christmas after which I fully expect to be able to teach. Miss McCain in addition to her own work, is willing to take mine, for which I've agreed to pay her my salary amounting to about $50 a week for the teaching part of the year. I'll omit the first four weeks' allowance, to which I believe I'm entitled if I teach after Christmas. If my salary is sent to me till then, I shall settle with Miss McCain. It'll be very satisfactory to the Inspector and me if it is to you. I wished to frankly explain to you my exact position. I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McBein, Teacher of the Rama Indian Day School\nDated Rama University, Rama, January 6, 1914.\n\nI suppose you have heard that we have a rival teacher at present, an Indian who calls himself \"Elias\". He has been around here about a month now preaching. He says he can handle all the children in Rama and there is no need of two teachers. The people of the reserve are very much infatuated with him and say they are going to \"chase old Nelson (the minister) and the teachers\" and install Mr Elias in the new school, so if you hear of our being turned out bag and baggage some day, don't be surprised.\n\nTonight he (Mr. Elias) opened a night school in the old school house for the young people. The chief came over and asked me to give them a few pieces of chalk, so I went over and gave them two or three pieces sticks. Then they wanted ink, slate pencils and books, so I told them I had no authority whatever to give them any supplies and that I would write to the Department and if it sanctioned this would do as authorized. At present\nwe have only material enough to supply our own wants\nand we certainly cannot carry books, etc., backwards\nand forwards from one school to the other.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as you conveniently\ncan about this as no doubt I will have no peace until\nit is settled.\n\nThe contractor will not allow us to open school\nuntil he hears from the Department. In the meantime\nwe are glad of the chance to get everything into shape\nfor work.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nSgd. Eva M. McMain.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Myers, Indian Agent, Atherley, encloses a communication from the Rev. W. A. Elias, who wants to open a night school on the Rama Reserve. From the Agent's letter it would appear that some of the Indians are in favour of Elias' application and he has asked what shall be done. Elias is an old busybody and if he is allowed to remain on the reserve will cause trouble, in fact he has already done so as you will see from the extract herewith from a private letter I have received from Miss McBain, the Senior Teacher of the day school on the reserve. This letter was opened by mistake by Col. Benson and only reached me today.\n\nMr. Myers was married last Wednesday and Miss McBain tells me that he intends to come to Ottawa on his wedding trip. In case he calls at the Department the question might be discussed with him.\n\nThe records of the Department shows that Elias, who\nwho was teacher at the Shawanaga School for a short time,\nis a failure and I think it would a great mistake to give\nhim any encouragement. There is no need for a school for\nadults on the reserve and it would be an easy matter for\nElias to stir up strife there, as the Rama Indians are\nnaturally cantankerous.\n\nThe new school building is finished and the\nteachers have moved into their quarters, but they have\nnot yet opened the school, as the contractor has not\nhanded over the building. There is a balance due the\ncontractor and there are some outstanding accounts\nagainst him. Would it not be well for someone from\nthe Department to take over the building, settle the\noutstanding claims and dispose of Mr. Elias?\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.K., Deputy Premier have better\nattend to this\n\n[Signature]\nI made my weekly visit to Rama School on Thursday Jan 15. I found all ready for passing by the government. The teachers are waiting for the school to open. The people are anxious for the same. The delay in sending out a man is causing inconvenience. As there are some extra pleas notify me when the man will be sent so that I may notify the contractor. Yours truly,\n\nMoses Chamberlain\nInspector\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nFOR ONTARIO, QUEBEC AND MARITIME PROVINCES.\n\nOttawa, Jan. 24th, 1914.\n\nSir;\n\nWith reference to school matters at Rama reserve which I was asked to take up I beg to report as follows.\n\nAt a council meeting of the band, held on the 22nd inst I informed the Indians that the department would not support their request for a night school for adults to be conducted by Mr. Elias. They were given to understand that they could not make use of or have access to any of the day school material or building. The council had passed a resolution asking that Elias be paid $25 monthly from the band funds. I informed them that the Department would not allow this payment to be made from band funds. They were further informed that if they were determined to carry on the night school scheme that they would have to support it from their own pockets and furnish what supplies they needed from the same source.\n\nMr. Elias being present, I informed him in presence of the band that the department would stand for no interference with the work of the day school; that he was not residing on the reserve with the consent of the Superintendent General and that he was therefore a trespasser and would be so dealt with in accordance with Sec. 34 of the Indian Act if he interfered in any way with the day school, its pupils or its teachers. He was also informed that he should not accept as pupils any children under 16 years of age.\nThe meeting was somewhat stormy, the Indians and Mr. Elias not taking very kindly to the plainness of my remarks. I fully expected this, however, as these Indians are inclined to unrest and agitation. I made the matter as plain as possible to them in order that there might be no room for excuse in case of further trouble from this source. I hope that the talk I gave them may have the desired effect but am not certain that it will. The Indian Agent was present at the meeting.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept.

I kept John Simcoe in school till 5 o'clock trying to elicit the truth from him about the cutting off of the buttons. After I let John Simcoe out, I did not see where he went.\n\nThe night after the assault I accompanied the Missionary and Miss McRein to the home of the Nanequishkung children and found Martin dressed and sitting on a chair his mother bathing his knees which was much swollen and a slight abrasion of the skin. Since the assault, Martin has not come to school at all. His sister Mary only one or two days.

When the boy came in, I found he was hurt in the leg near the knee. He could walk some. The leg was swollen. I bathed the knee to take away the pain.\n\nMartin has not been to school since then because I kept him at my home until this matter settled. I was afraid to send Martin to school on account of ill treatment and told the teacher Miss M. Bain so.\n\nMartin is 8 years old.

I had no rubbers on that day and I did not kick Martin myself. I never threatened Martin in any way. I remember seeing Mr. Myers and Frank Shilling in the shed on the day of the assault. I did not see the fight between Martin and John Simcoe. I went home.\n\nVictor York\n\nDefendant: John Simcoe\n\nI am 12 years of age. I did not kick Martin.

The papers were served and I took the precaution of asking him to tell the truth in this case. I asked him about the buttons he said he had gotten the knife at the house and cut the buttons off. He said he put the buttons in his pocket and as there was a hole in the pocket he lost the button. I asked him if he could find me the button and he said no. I asked him about this assault case, he told me that Joe Shilling was with him. I called Joe Shilling out and Shilling said he was just with him. John afterward admitted Shilling hitting Martin. When questioned he said Martin had called him names, he went at him hit and kicked.

D. MOLLAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.W. Myers, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtherley, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWhen I sent in my requisition sheet, I purposely omitted playground equipment. I had some plans, but I wished to come to the O.A.C. before sending in the list. I thought I might get some new ideas. I will tell you what I would like, then you can decide as to how much or little you will give me. I hope it will be much.\n\n1. I would like swings and teeter totters in the playground. They could be made by some of the Indians I think. It would be a bit of work for them.\n\n2. A football for the boys.\n\n3. Baseball equipment (the indoor base ball - it is softer)\n\n4. A basketball. The Indians could make the goals, baskets etc. I would really like 2 balls. They could be used for other games.\n\n5. I really am afraid to ask for the next - but I do want a piano - a little cottage one will do. I would\nrather have a piano than an organ\u2014it is more suitable for school. In my opinion an organ in school is just certainly better than no instrument.\n\nI know I am asking a great deal, but if these Indians can only have some healthy organized amusements\u2014I believe it will their ideals will be higher, and their lives better in every respect.\n\nThey are very fond of music\u2014and by this means plus organized games\u2014I hope to help in making our school a social centre for the neighbourhood.\n\nI hope my numerous requests have not wearied you in any way.\n\nYours truly,\nPercy Waite\nOttawa, August 18, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo asking for certain equipment for the Rama Indian School.\n\nIn reply I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have an estimate of the probable cost of making the swings, teeters and goals and baskets for basket ball and also of the cost of the football, baseball equipment and the basket balls. This information should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent and in future all applications of this kind should be sent through him.\n\nIn reference to the piano I beg to say that the Department does not supply these to its schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ruth Waite,\n57 Hannaford St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nRAMA RESERVE SCHOOL FAIR.\n\nThe First in the County of Ontario.\n\nMr. R. A. McLennan, Inspector of Public Schools for the North District of Ontario, has been present at the school fair last Thursday, on the Rama Reserve in this county, the result of which is a cause for congratulation, to show how much interest the pupils and teachers in charge of the school, who take so deep an interest in the welfare of their school and district.\n\nThe first rural school fair, proper, is being held this year by the reserve school on the Rama Indian Reserve, near Grimsby. The unique feature of the fair was something unique in its way, the garden exhibits. There were no gardens at the school, and the manual exhibits were the only ones on display in the school room. The result was a most interesting display of the work of Miss McFaul and Miss Waite, who have worked so faithfully to make it a success.\n\nThe beautiful new two-room school, which belongs to the teachers, is situated on the Rama Reserve on a piece of land which is very fertile, and requires only cultivation to make it productive. To grow vegetables requires very little land, and cultivation has been undertaken successfully by the pupils of the school. It is to be hoped that the school can continue the experiment and show possibilities of the land and that, when they become independent farmers, the land will be productive fields of grain and vegetables.\n\nThe fair is the object of the school and the parents of the pupils.\n\nOf course the older men are benevolent towards the children, and there is no doubt that they would resort to lessons from two lady teachers, Miss McFaul and Miss Waite. Miss McFaul and Miss Waite are quite able to demonstrate their knowledge of gardening and farming than are to be found on the reserve.\n\nProfessor S. M. McCready, of the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, was present, and was very much pleased to address the pupils at the afternoon session, in the afternoon on the school grounds, and also gave a talk on the subject of the concert in the Council Chambers. The people came in large numbers to hear Prof. McCready's glowing account of what the pupils could do by growing good corn and vegetables under his supervision.\n\nMr. J. H. Scott, M. P., Mr. Hutchison, the Inspector of Public Schools, and Mr. McCready were giving addresses of help and congratulation to the pupils. Prizes were awarded as follows:\n\nSixth Class - Miss W.

The Inspector also states that he attended the school fair held on the afternoon of October 15th, last, and that the hand work, i.e., the sewing, art work, box making, etc., was surprisingly good and the garden produce was far superior to anything on the reserve.\n\nThe Department is pleased to receive such a very favourable report on the work of your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Last month, I threw open my school room for the youths and men of the reserve to use as a reading room or anything suitable that may develop from that. The pastor supervises. So far, it has been a success. This month I arranged a different programme and it has been accepted. It is as follows:\n\n1st Monday in the month \u2014 Prayer Meeting.\n2nd \u2014 Agricultural Discussions.\n3rd \u2014 Literary-Miscellaneous (Debates)\n4th \u2014 Social \u2014 Reading \u2014 Games.\n5th \u2014 Open for suggestions.\n\nI have promised to take up the Agriculture with them, and some appear really interested. When I was at Guelph this year, I understood Prof. McCready to say that the Dept. supplied seed free to Indians who were progressive.\nenough to experiment with it - and follow instructions. If I have rightly understood him, may I know what help I can expect for them?\n\nMiss Mc Bain intends taking Domestic Science with the girls and women on the Reserve, in the New Year. I hope they turn up as well as the men, then we shall feel well repaid for our efforts.\n\nWishing you the complements of the season -\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Elmo) Ruth Waite\nOttawa, December 21, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant giving an outline of the work you are carrying on during the winter months for the uplift of the Indians on the Rama Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department fully appreciates the efforts of yourself and Miss McBein to interest and encourage the Indians to become self-supporting and law abiding citizens. I can assure you that the Department will afford you every assistance and will fill any requisitions you may make in the interests of agriculture or domestic science.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I transmit herewith forms of bond of indemnity for execution. If this form is properly filled in and returned to the Department the question of the issue of a duplicate cheque will be considered. The bond should be executed by Moses Chambers and his sureties and the bank should affix its corporate seal.

Among those present, also the Rev. John Nelson, Mr. N. M. Nelson, Mr. C. W. Myers. The pupils sang in their own language and afterwards in English some patriotic songs. Appropriate addresses were made by the teacher, the Agent and Mr. David Simcoe. The pupils then read their reports, and then came the most interesting part of the afternoon, when the Chief presented Miss Evans, Director of the Princess Mary Gift Book. The book had been forwarded from the Department of Indian Affairs as a gift of the Hon. W. J. Roche.

The Inspector Mr. McFadden report as to Rama Reserve way school attendance being unsatisfactory. The Indians go North to be guides and the families also, they sell their fancy work to the tourists. This year the return of the Indians' families was about last week in September, which was later than other years, and when Inspector Mr. McFadden was here he found this state of affairs which was no fault of any neglect of duty of the officials, as we were all at our post. The children were away with their parents. The teachers reported in their quarterly report this cause of the small attendance.\n\nThe Inspector laid down the law at the afternoon meeting as to school regulations; the School Officer was on the alert when the families returned, and our attendance at school is now satisfactory.\n\nI am writing to get an opportunity to make an impression as to school neglect, which I have not as yet got the chance.\n\nJ.B.

It would relieve her of much anxiety and extra work.\n\nYours faithfully,\nPuck Waite.\nDear Sir,\n\nI resumed my duties on Wednesday, March 1st. With regard to Miss Sperian's salary, I do not know how you arrange such matters, but I am quite willing for her to have my salary for the month of February when she acted as my substitute. I mentioned the matter to the Agent\u2014and to Mr. Cooke when he was here. I am quite strong again now, and hope to remain so.\n\nLast year was a series of disappointments all through. Owing to ill-health I was unable to take evening classes for the men again as I intended. They have not had any lessons in Agriculture this winter.\n\nWe enjoyed Mr. Cooke's visit, and the Indians were justly proud of him. I wish we had one or two like him here. They would have a good effect on the others. These people need a real leader with plenty...\nOur Women's Institute has not done much yet. There were no meetings during my absence. If the women had a bit more courage, they would hold the meetings whether the teachers were present or not. The last meeting was the best. The women really seemed interested enough to discuss the subject. A friend of mine from Toronto was here. She is a trained nurse, and spoke to them on personal hygiene, chiefly in connection with their children. We are to meet as usual next Tuesday evening. These meetings are held in Miss McAdam's school room.\n\nYours faithfully,\nPercy Waite\nOttawa, March 14, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you inform the Department that you resumed your duties as assistant teacher at the Rama Day School on the last instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you have fully recovered from your recent illness.\n\nWith reference to the payment of the salary of the substitute who taught one month during your absence, I beg to say that the Department would prefer to pay you the full quarter's salary and have you settle with the substitute for the amount due her. The Department is not aware as to the amount of salary that Miss McBain, who engaged her services, promised to allow her therefor.\n\nYou might inform the Department as to whether this arrangement for the payment of a substitute's salary is satisfactory to you.\n\nThe Department is glad to learn that the women of the reserve are taking an interest in the meetings of the Women's Institute conducted by you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nMiss Ruth Waite,\nTeacher\nRama Indian School,\nR.

I was quite ignorant about such payments and wondered how they were managed. May I correct a slight error in your letter? Miss Mc Bain conducts the meetings of the Women's Institute as she is President. I am the Secretary.\n\nYours faithfully,\nRuth Waite\nThe Women's Institute met on Tuesday evening, May 16th, and held the first annual meeting. The officers were re-elected, and are as follows: President, Miss McIlvain; Vice-President, Mrs. Smith; Secretary-Treasurer, Miss Walter. Mrs. Hopkins was the guest lecturer, and Mrs. T. Williams were appointed Directors; and the following were elected: Mrs. Hopkins, Mrs. Stinson, Mrs. W. Smith, Mrs. H. Smith, Mrs. Shilling, and Mrs. E. Shilling. The seats sent up by Mr. Putnam for the garden centre were accepted. Mrs. R. Kentell, Mrs. W. Snache, Mrs. R. Shilling, and Mrs. Kentell. The meeting was more encouraging than any we have had. Probably the members are beginning to realize the importance of which the Institute stands\u2014Home and Country.\n\nSOLDIERS have never been in Rama a weekend quite like this, in all its history. Soldiers on parade in Rama. The Nightingale Band met the five o'clock train on Saturday night, and the soldiers marched to the Council Hall, where they were given a hearty welcome. The Hall was crowded to overflowing for the concert in the evening. Needless to say, the Band played as well as ever. On Sunday afternoon, the Band had gathered about two o'clock, and marched through the part of the village, returning in plenty of time for the afternoon service. Many officers were present from Orillia. In fact there were so many visitors from Orillia and Long Branch that the church would not hold the crowd, and consequently the service was held in the open air. It was a glorious day. All nature seemed to welcome the event\u2014the promise of a new Honour Roll. The day will never be forgotten. It is a day that will live in the hearts of Rama. The Rev. John Nelson opened the service, and the Band played the hymns. The Rev. Mr. Anderson, in a few appropriate words, expressed his high opinion of the Rama women, and their response to the call of King and Country. He then called upon Captain the Rev. P. W. Anderson, who read the \"Acton Service\" booklets, which the Rev. Mr. Walter had prepared. The Rev. Mr. Anderson in a few appropriate words, congratulated the soldiers on their splendid record, and the call of the Empire in this terrible struggle for right, honour and liberty. He briefly referred to the admiration on the booklet cover\u2014\"Quit you like men.\" Mr. Nelson then called upon Captain Miller, who spoke before the audience. Rama owes him a deep debt of gratitude for the beautiful home he has given to the community. He even told the audience that he would make it better than any she had previously made, and the work is certainly exquisite. He spoke of the patriotism of the mothers and girls of Rama, for so readily giving their sons and daughters, and growing the Empire. He spoke of the pleasure it gave him to see the ladies of Rama presenting a new honour roll to replace the small one which will not hold all the names of those who have died. The boys had done splendidly and the whole community should be proud of them. Many white communities, where in many instances, the women were holding back the men, but Rama took up the franchise, and the Indians, who are now citizens, too. The women could thus excuse themselves from active service, have nobly risen to the occasion and responded to the call of the Empire. Again they were congratulated. Captains Miller of the local battalion, and Lieut. Gladstone of the 17th, each made a brief speech, commending the ladies for the manner in which they fulfilled their duties. They were good, efficient helpers. The ladies then thanked Captain Miller for the Honour Roll, and also thanked the ladies of Rama for their presence. His speech was very brief. He seemed specially solicitous for the comfort of the ladies. The Rev. Mr. Franklin made a patriotic speech, referring to the sacrifices made by the forefathers took a part. What they did then, they can and will do again. He ended by saying \"Long live the Indian.\"\n\nThe service concluded with the National Anthem. In the evening there was a special service held in the church, which had been very prettily decorated for the occasion of the day. Private William Martell preached, chiefly in Indian. He made a speech, saying that they must rise to the great battle of conquering themselves. They must rise to the battle and not fall to do their duty to their King and Country. No one could listen to him without being impressed by his earnestness. He is a God-fearing man. Mr. Samson Ingersoll also addressed the audience for a few minutes.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herein the balance of $1.75 due by widow James St. Germaine for violation of school regulations which I collected from her Spring interest money. I beg to report that I did not deduct the fine from widow Joseph St. Germaine on account of her two daughters having died this Spring, the old lady being now over eighty years of age and nearly blind, the trouble being our her grand daughter not going to school who resides with her at the time who is now 16 years of age.\n\nSuggesting this will meet the Department approval.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nChas.

When I first went to the Rama School, I understood that my salary was equal with that of Miss McCain, and that our positions were of equal value. It is only during the last few months that I have discovered the inferiority of my own financially. I did not feel justified in asking for an increase of salary before on account of my ill health, not knowing whether I would be strong enough to continue the work. Now however I think I am justified. I have had a good vacation on the Atlantic coast in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and am quite strong again.\n\nI have taught the Senior pupils in the Rama Indian School for 2\u00bd years and have materially increased the curriculum. I introduced Agriculture and sewing the month the school opened, and have taken them weekly since.\n\nLessons in\nElementary Hygiene and Physiology are given regularly. Last year I added Domestic Science to the curriculum and the girls take this subject on Friday afternoon. Two remain after school hours on Friday, and apply the instructions given. When war broke out, I taught the girls to knit, and the few I had, knitted $10 worth of yarn for the Red Cross. The money was the proceeds of a concert they gave for the purpose.\n\nThe Fall Fair in 1914 was due to my efforts and I am hoping we will have another this year.\n\nI am not in the habit of retailing all I do. This is exceptional and I hope I have not wearied you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRuth Waite\n\nMr. McLean\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 28, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant asking if the Department would raise your salary as teacher at the Rama Indian School from $500.00 to $550.00 a year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to increase your salary to $550.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter.

When Miss Mc Bain Principal of the school at Rama was in Toronto attending the Women's Institutes Convention she came to see me and complained of not having felt well for some time past. On examining her I found a large tumor in the right side of the pelvis and advised her to see a specialist at once. This she did; and it was found necessary for her to have an operation just as soon as possible. We advised Miss Mc Bain to apply at once for three months leave of absence and I am sure in view of the long faithful and unselfish service which she has given you will grant her this\nnecessary leave. It will be much easier for Miss Mc Bain to have Rama while the D.O. nurse is there, for she has not only taught in the school, but nursed in the homes and been general welfare worker on the whole Reserve.\n\nThanking you for granting my first request and sending the nurse to Rama, and for this help I know you will give Miss Mc Bain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMargaret Patterson\n97 Walmer Rd\nToronto.\nDecember 12th, 1916.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 8th instant.

Miss Mc Bain awarded her prizes on the last day she taught, December 13. I intended having my Christmas tree and prizes on Thursday, December 21, but unfortunately I am suffering from tonsilitis, and have not even been well enough to purchase the gifts. I am so sorry to disappoint my pupils, but we will endeavour to have a good opening day in the New Year and they can receive their gifts on that day. As soon as I purchase the prizes, I will forward the bills to the Agent.\n\nIn some of the homes, there are sick cases which we suspect are mild\nform of scarlet fever. In fact, I will not have one of my pupils at school, because Dr. Harvie emphatically stated that the children in the house had a very mild form of scarlet fever. Another doctor diagnosed the cases as scarlatina. Therefore I do not see how I can receive those children in school before the end of 4 weeks, although Dr. Gilpin I understand said it was not fever. On Monday, the nurse discovered another affected family and notified the agent who sent Dr. Gilpin there yesterday. I do not know his report. I know I have not had the same sickness, but thought it only fair to the Department and the people here to send you the enclosed medical certificate. I think the whole building should be fumigated, especially as some of the sick children were in school last week.\n\nI blame my cold school room for my bad throat.

I gave up my work on Wednesday the 13th but just as I was preparing to leave, Miss Wait's cook fell ill with tonsillitis.\n\nThis necessitated my remaining to assist the nurses who had already patients clocked off & could not very well do this. Miss Wait waits at the same time, then she's the housemaid to do meals, etc., etc.\n\nMiss Wait is recovering, I am glad they let mine not likely to allow it.\nleech this week.\n\nAbout a week after the nurse arrived Dr. Albert Harvey reported to her two mild cases of scarlet fever in the Reserve. He said the patients were not very sick but the house should be quarantined. Dr. Gilpin, Sandusky, was called in and said the children had not scarlet fever & no precautions were taken.\n\nThis morning the nurse was asked about some school children who were sick\u2014when she arrived at the house she found the eldest child had a temperature of one hundred and three (103) & with a rash on face & chest. This child had not been well since Wednesday before but had been to school every day. This morning included all of the head with a high temperature. Her brother also had the same symptoms. Sandusky has been very mild cases in the Reserve.\n\nUpon her return, Miss Wallace notified the agent who has asked the doctor...\ntomorrow\nto see these children & report.\nThe nurse thinks the school should be\nclosed at once and the whole building\nfumigated.\nWe are hoping no more cases will\ndevelop but the outlook is not very\npromising.\n\nYours very truly,\nEva M.

He views Social Reform from the Christian standpoint. He is an exceptionally interesting speaker\u2014indeed a Prince among orators.\n\nBesides you will notice that Dr. P. H. Bryce, Chief Medical Officer for the Dominion Government; Dr. Hastings H. Hart, the Child Welfare Expert of New York, with a Continental reputation; Dr. L.

Pidgeon, of Toronto, are among the other speakers of Dominion-wide reputation, in addition to men and women from within the Province.\n\nSocial and Economic Betterment have never had such an opportunity in Canada as at this moment. These Congresses should do much toward preparing the public to make the best use of the opportunity.\n\nYou are at liberty to appoint as many delegates as you choose.\n\nSee the inside of the front cover for special Railway rates.

D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ruth Waite,\nTeacher,\nRama Indian School,\nR. R. No. 2,\nAtherley, Ont.\nIt is 3 years and 1 month since I came to Rama. During that time, I have studied the Rama Indian at close quarters, and drawn my own conclusions about them. I may be right and I may be wrong, but I have thought for a long time that the social conditions of the people, housing, morals etc., are in a deplorable condition. What to do for the best, is a huge problem. It is certainly best to make them help themselves wherever possible. My chief hope of salvation is with the children. Yet when they leave school, they seem to lose all ambition. There is no occupation for them\u2014no training. I feel as if I would like them under my supervision until they were 18, yet with present conditions here, it would be impracticable. We would need an Indian High School. I have 2 very nice, good little girls, who could take Entrance next year, but for many reasons, High School would be out of the question. The girls enjoy their lessons in cookery, but accommodation is so limited here. I can only take all together with a demonstration lesson.\nI often think an oil stove in the school room would be a valuable asset. Then the pupils who remain for the mid-day meal could \"warm up\" their lunch. It would be more convenient also for the cooking lessons. I never encourage the pupils to remain at school during the noon hour. I think if they are suitably dressed, and the weather fairly good, it does them more good to get the exercise and fresh air to and from home.\n\nI often think organized games would considerably help these children, physically and morally. There is such a spirit of good comradeship developed in outdoor sports. The boys play football. Each season they subscribe towards a ball. The girls have no desire to subscribe for balls. They do not know how to play and do not show any inclination for organized play. In England, we had outdoor sports as part of the curriculum. Every child had to take part, swimming for girls and boys, rounders & tennis (girls), football and cricket (boys). None were excepted unless physically unfit. I would like to have organized games as part of my school curriculum (one a week). I consider it physical and moral training.\n\nIf you would grant us a football, (for captain ball) and baseball equipment.\nI might commence the scheme.\nI have taught my pupils, Captain Ball and Overhead Ball, but they have not caught the spirit of play yet\u2014except the boys. They enjoy their football after school hours in the fall of the year.\n\nAnother thing that distresses me, is the fact that young motherless girls, with only old people responsible for them, just run wild. If those girls had only had a course in Domestic Science they might have made their homes decent and taken pride in the care of them. A 6 months course, living in the school house, under the supervision of the teachers, might help, if we could make it practicable.\n\nJust one more suggestion. Can we not form a branch of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals? The half starved dogs, badly housed animals, and frequently ill treated also birds\u2014are sometimes a distressing sight. I do all I can to get the children to love and care for the animals.\n\nI hope I have not wearied you\u2014but I have wanted to say this and more, for a long time. They are only suggestions, but we may evolve something worth while from them.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Ind. Affairs.

McBain and Miss Ruth Waite.\n\nSuccess,- Excellent.\n\nThese girls are doing especially good work in many ways. They are not only teaching their classes well but they take an interest in all the social life of the reserve. If there is any advancement being made in the reserve, and there is an advancement, most of the credit is due to Miss McBain and Miss Waite. Living has advanced very much during the past few years and as a result $550.00 is hardly enough salary. I should like to respectfully suggest that the salary be raised to a minimum of $600.00, at least.\n\nDate of Inspection,- June 1st, 1917.\n\nEnrollment = 43\nAverage = 25\n\nNumber present on day of inspection = 43\nAverage attendance = 33\nTHE E.
