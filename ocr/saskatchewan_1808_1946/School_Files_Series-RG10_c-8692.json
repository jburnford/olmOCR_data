Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nOn October 25th, 1949, a letter from this Office, file 2516-6-1-107 (656) was forwarded to the Department with enclosures from Superintendent Jones and the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company, regarding a heating plant for building No. 34 at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School, Prince Albert.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter I asked if funds could be made available to have this work done this fiscal year and I have not as yet had a reply. Could I please be advise if there is any possibility of having this work completed before March 31st, as time is getting short. Requisitions would have to be prepared and sent forward immediately to have necessary purchases made and the work completed.\n\nIf this is not possible I would like to be assured that a sufficient amount is included in the 1950-51 Estimates, to have the work done before next winter and paid for from the 1950-51 appropriation.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nFebruary 13th, 1950.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is being operated under the auspices of the Church of England, in the former military camp at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. In view of the failure of water at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, it has been found necessary to close this school temporarily and transfer twenty-nine children to the Lac la Ronge Residential School. In addition, Regional Supervisor J.P.B. Ostrander has reported that there are still a number of Church of England children who require institutional care.\n\nIn view of the above, it is necessary to provide additional accommodation, and Regional Supervisor Ostrander reports that if we renovate Army Building No. 20, part of it can be used for a dormitory, part for a manual training shop, and the remainder for a room for physical training purposes.\n\nMr. D.M. Morrison, Supervisor of Construction, from Mr. Ostrander's office, recently inspected this building and states that the following work is necessary: Build partitions; supply and install blackboards; supply and install partitions and doors for all toilets, including necessary hardware; redecorate and paint entire building throughout; repair roof on the entire building; transfer heating from existing locations and install same according to Provincial and Dominion Building Codes; install new electric wiring; renew and repair all defective plumbing; supply and install battleship linoleum in the dormitory.\n\nThe Harvey Lunam Construction Company, Regina, Saskatchewan, who are presently completing a contract for us.\non another building in this camp, and whose work has always been satisfactory, have forwarded a tender in an amount of $13,131.60, for the work which the Supervisor of Construction, Mr. Morrison, considers necessary. The price mentioned may be reduced if some material salvaged from other army buildings, can be used to advantage.\n\nThe company mentioned is prepared to carry out the work before the end of the current fiscal year, and as funds for the improvements are available in the 1949-50 Appropriation, I recommend that an Order in Council be obtained accepting the Harvey Lunam Construction Company tender. A Memorandum to Council is enclosed.\n\nPP/ST Enc.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Morrison, Supervisor of Construction, on Building No. 20; quotation of the Harvey Lunam Construction Company on the total cost of erecting partitions and general repairs to Hut No. 20 to prepare it for a dormitory, a manual training shop, and a separate room for physical training, at a total cost of $13,131.60 if AA Battleship Linoleum is laid in the dormitory, and $12,427.60 if no linoleum is used; and quotation of the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company, of Prince Albert. It will be noted from the quotation of the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company it is expected that a considerable quantity of material can be salvaged from other buildings to reduce the amount of $4,892.40 for the heating and plumbing part of the tender by Harvey Lunam. I may say in this connection that the Harvey Lunam tender includes the $4,892.40 quoted by the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company.\n\nAfter discussion with Major Clark and Mr. D.N. Morrison it was decided to send Mr. Morrison to Prince Albert to go with Indian Superintendent Jones to the school to examine various matters and, particularly Building No. 20, as it was hoped that the necessary expenditure for Building No. 20 can be dealt with before the 31st of March. Everything mentioned in Mr. Lunam's quotation, and Mr. Morrison's report agree with Major Clark's suggestions, but, unfortunately I have not a copy of the rough plan which Major Clark prepared, as I gave my copy to Mr. Morrison and he left it with Mr. Jones. I am hoping that when this letter arrives in Ottawa Major Clark will still be in the Ottawa office in order that this may be referred to him for agreement as to detail.\n\nIf it is necessary to get other quotations on this work it will then...\nwork it will then be necessary to have an architect put on\nthe job, and a proper blueprint and specifications prepared.\nThat, of course, will take so long that it will not be possible\nto get the work done out of the current year's appropriation,\ntherefore I sincerely hope that the Department can accept this\npresent tender as fair, and can trust the Harvey Lunam Construction\nCompany to complete the job satisfactorily at or before the\n31st of March. I have every confidence in the Harvey Lunam\nConstruction Company, and I also have the services of Mr. D.N.\nMorrison, who can be in close touch with all of the work while it\nis progressing, and see that it is carried out according to\nintentions.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n304 Post Office Building,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: LAC LA RONCE Indian Residential School\nBuilding 20\n\nI inspected this building with a representative of\nThe Harvey Lunam Construction Company on February 1st and 2nd, 1950.\nWe found the plumbing and heating system nearly all disconnected\nand many parts have been removed from this building. The Viking\nboiler which originally heated this building is partly stripped. The\nLunam Construction Company have submitted their tender for the sum\nof $13,131.60 for complete repair of this building. This tender\nincludes:\n\nPlumbing - the toilets in this hut need new flush valves,\nball valves, and seats. The showers will require new\ncontrols and heads. Some pipes will need renewing and\nrepairs are required to some of the spring taps. Mr. C.A.F.\nClark recommended installation of bath tubs. These have\nbeen omitted owing to the added cost of breaking the floor\nand installing new drains, also in view of the fact that\nthey are considered impractical by the Principal of the\nschool.\n\nLighting - some wiring is to be done in conduit, with 17\nlights in the east wing; 1 light in the furnace room; 2\nlights in the Wash Room; 2 lights in the shower and toilet;\nand 21 lights in the west wing, and switches to control these\nlights, all wiring to pass inspection.\n\nAll doors and windows are to be repaired and fitted,\nand the floor of the manual training room is to be prepared and\ncovered with battleship linoleum. The radiators and windows of the\nplayroom are to be covered with heavy screening, and the interior\nof the building redecorated. I feel, however, that before any extensive\ninterior decorating is done, the leaky roof will have to be repaired. This is not included in the tender. I would suggest cedar shingles for the purpose, as these buildings are only on cement footings, and there is considerable movement of the buildings due to frost and numerous other conditions. The sides of the building also should be recovered. I would suggest cedar lap, or drop siding for this purpose, and paint for this purpose, for the same reason. This, also, is not included in the estimates.\n\nThis building was formerly heated by a Viking boiler which is partly stripped. The caretaker assures me we can find, from various sources, sufficient parts, etc. to complete it. There is also part of a pump, with no motor, or impeller. The caretaker also assures me that he can find a motor and impeller, but this is problematic. If this old equipment can be used, the Lunam Construction Company's quotation will be reduced by $1,991.40.\n\nD.N. Morrison,\nSupervisor of Construction.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Army Hut No. 20, for Department of Indian Affairs, Canada, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nWe wish to confirm that our tender for work at the above building, Prince Albert, Sask., is figured on the following specification:\n\nThe Contractor is to install heavy wire mesh screens to protect the windows in physical training room. Also supply and install heavy wire mesh screens to protect all radiators, pipes, electric lights, etc., in same room.\n\nAll windows throughout the building to be refitted or replaced where necessary and all windows to be fitted with weatherstrip satisfactory to the Superintendent of Indian Agency. Reglaze and replace broken glass where necessary on all windows in this building.\n\nSupply all labour, material, etc., for building all partitions as outlined on plan, including all necessary hardware for doors, etc., to the entire satisfaction of Superintendent of Indian Agency.\n\nSupply and Install Blackboards in selected locations.\n\nSupply and Install Partitions and Doors for all toilets, including all necessary hardware, etc.\n\nRedecorate and Paint entire building throughout.\n\nThoroughly repair roof of entire building.\n\nAll heating to be transferred from existing locations and to be placed on outside walls and to be installed according to Provincial and Dominion Building Codes. Four Fans to be installed behind radiators in order to circulate the heated air.\n\nNew Electric wiring to be installed according to Provincial and Federal building codes.\n\nAll Defective Plumbing to be renewed, or repaired where necessary.\n\nThe Purpose of these alterations and renovations, etc., is to make this building into a Dormitory as outlined, also Manuel Training Shop as well as a Physical Training separate room.\n\nThe Contractor is to thoroughly inspect all Plumbing, Heating, Electrical Work and all other work which may require repairing or replacing to give an entirely satisfactory job when the contract is completed, as no extras will be tolerated. The Contractor is to supply all permits inspection fees, etc., as well as all other charges for a complete and thoroughly satisfactory job.\n\nThe entire Price of this work as outlined and including the Supplying and Installing of AA Battleship Linoleum in Dormitory, is Thirteen Thousand One Hundred and Thirty One Dollars & 60/XX Dollars ($13,131.60). Should Linoleum be omitted our price will be reduced to ($12,427.60) Twelve Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Seven & 60/XX Dollars. Yours very truly\n\nManager\nM. & K. Plumbing and Heating Co.\nH.

The cost of this boiler is seven hundred and sixty six dollars and forty cents ($766.40). The cost of the jacket heater is one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00), the tank, one hundred and eighty dollars ($180.00), eight hundred and forty square feet of radiation, eight hundred and forty dollars, some piping and fittings to the value of fifty five dollars ($55.00), or a total of nineteen hundred and ninety one dollars and forty cents ($1,991.40). There is also a part of a pump with no motor or impeller. The caretaker also assures me he can find the motor and impeller, but this is problematical.\n\nWhat we propose is this: We are quoting four thousand eight hundred and ninety two dollars and forty cents, but any of the above material that can be used would reduce this quotation in the amount of the value of the goods you supply.\n\nPlumbing: The toilets in this hut will need new flush valves, ball valves, and seats. The showers will require new controls and heads. There will be some piping needing renewing, and repairs to some of the spring taps. We would quote a price of four hundred and ninety one dollars to refurbish the plumbing ($491.00).\n\nWe trust this will be satisfactory, but should any further information be required, we will be glad to supply it.\n\nYours very truly,\nM & K PLUMBING & HEATING CO.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe present laundry is located in the transverse bar of N-hut No. 35. The equipment includes four ironing boards, one circular tub, one extractor, one drier, and electric iron. I am informed that this equipment is not sufficient to handle the laundry for this organization.\n\nThe present laundry room is 35 feet in length and 24 feet in width, and it would be impractical to install new equipment in this room.\n\nThe sewing room, linen room, and storage rooms are located in the west end of a lean-to on the south side of the drill hall, building 27. It is therefore necessary to carry the laundry from building 35 to building 27 which is a considerable distance.\n\nIn addition to this inconvenience, the water is piped into this building at the east end and a small stove has to be kept burning at all times to keep these lines from freezing. This creates an additional fire hazard, as there is no brick chimney for this stove. And with the transverse bar of this hut in use as a laundry it renders the adjacent wings practically useless for all practical purposes.\n\nIf the laundry is moved to the lean-to in building 27, by removing a temporary partition installed by C.W.T.S., and the sealing of double doors a building 65 feet by 86 feet should be obtained for the laundry, without altering the present sewing, linen and storage rooms. This portion of the building is now being used for manual training classes, and a storage for two staff members' cars. It will be vacated on completion of the new manual training room in building No. 20. I am informed this building is easily heated and will be large enough for additional equipment required.\n\nI have also been informed, the former principal of the school, Mr. Fisher, wanted the laundry to be put in building 35. I interviewed Mr. Scrase, the present Principal, and he would like this change made.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs feel that owing to the fact that the laundry was put in building 35 at the request of the former Principal, the expense of moving this equipment should be paid for by the school. This difference will have to be settled between the school authorities and the Department.\n\nD.H. Morrison,\nSupervisor of Constructional\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nRe: Old Laundry Equipment at Lac La Ronge\nIndian Residential School.\n\nI inspected the old laundry equipment at the Lac La Ronge\nIndian Residential School, consisting of three pieces, which include:\none Extractor, serial No. SS10-M7107; one Drier, serial No. 22730-M787;\nand one Tub, serial No. 1215-M7249. All of the above mentioned\nmachines are manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Company Limited.\n\nThe Extractor appears to be in very good condition and is\nready for use. The Drier appears to be in good condition, but has\nbeen used on a low pressure system, as it is equipped with a low pressure\ntrap. I have been unable to ascertain the reason for this, but it is\npossible it is some defect in the coil and it will not stand high\npressure. The tub is in very poor condition. The revolving part which\nis wooden is warped, shrunk and rotted in several places. I am advised\nby Mr. Paul Mascho, of the M & K Heating and Plumbing Company that it\nis beyond economic repair. The line shaft pulleys and mounting brackets\nfor this equipment are all in good condition. All machines are equipped\nwith driving points.\n\nTo use the drier and extractor in the laundry, at this school,\nit will necessary to equip them with individual driving motors. It\nappears that the drier has been used on a low pressure system, and in\nview of the high pressure system (80 pounds) in this laundry, I would\ndeem it advisable to install this equipment in one of the schools where\na line shaft and low pressure could be used, and new equipment be purchased\nfor Lac La Ronge, if and when the laundry is moved to larger quarters.\n\nD.M.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n304 Post Office Building,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nGeneral Inspection Report on the\nLAC LA RONDE Indian Residential School\n\nSanitation\nGarbage in the kitchen has been allowed to accumulate for several days. I am informed that the City of Prince Albert move this garbage, but have not been picking it up as regularly as they should. I asked Mr. Serase to dispose of the refuse daily, as I feel he has sufficient staff to perform this extra duty. This matter will be referred to Dr. A.B. Simes, Regional Medical Superintendent, Indian Health Services, Department of National Health and Welfare, with regard to disposal and type of containers for garbage to be used in the kitchen.\n\nFire Equipment\nThere is not sufficient fire fighting equipment at this school. I have been informed by Mr. E.S. Jones that a number of hand extinguishers recommended by the City Fire Inspector have been ordered.\n\nFire Hazards\nThere are no chimneys for heating stoves in Buildings 33 and 34. There are no receptacles for ashes from furnaces and stoves. These ashes are piled on the ground, in the open, and the wind can blow these hot ashes among much inflammable material. Some of the buildings have been used for storage, and are badly neglected. This not only creates a bad impression and criticism, but is an additional fire hazard.\n\nGeneral Condition of the Grounds\nThe grounds generally appear neglected. I have asked Mr. Serase to have them cleared. He has promised his co-operation.\n\nD.N. Morrison,\nSupervisor of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I find the windows in this building are in good condition, and the floor is covered. The building is partitioned, and the corridors are heated in such a manner that no direct draft can get into the living quarters.\n\nThese are the only apparent reasons that contribute to the easier heating of this building.\n\nD.N.

Ostrande, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n304 Post Office Building,\nREGINA,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nREPORT ON LAC LA RONGE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nBuilding 3A (Mess Hall).\n\nThis building is an \"H\" type army hut, of which one side, and the transverse bar of the \"H\" are being used. This wing is divided into two portions, one 100' x 26', which is used for students, and one 26' x 20' which is used for the staff. The students' mess is heated by two small heating stoves, and the staff mess by one of the same.\n\nThere are no brick chimneys in this section of the building, and the Klondike chimney is being used. This condition is viewed with much concern by the City Fire Inspector.\n\nI would recommend the above condition be rectified at once, as serious fire is apt to result if it is allowed to exist.\n\nMay I say I am in complete agreement of plans outlined by Mr. E.S. Jones for remodelling this building.\n\nD.N. Morrison,\nSupervisor of Construction.\n\nIt will make both wings usable. They need the space. Cost about $600, Mr. Jones said to me. Where are his plans?\nRegina, February 1st, 1950.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n304 Post Office Building,\nREGINA,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nREPORT ON LAC LA RONGE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nBuilding 23 (Classroom)\n\nWe have received numerous complaints from the teaching staff regarding the heating of two classrooms in this building, one of which is located at the north end of the west wing, and the other at the north end of the east wing. The classroom at the north end of the east wing is 42' long and 32'6\" in width. There are 5 windows along the east wall and one at the north end of the west wall. The entrance to this classroom is at the north end and is protected from the weather by a small cubical. The door of this cubical is on the north side and is in a direct line with the door leading into the classroom. This room is heated by two 24-coil hot water radiators which have been placed along the east wall of the building, and are about 10' from the north and south walls, with the same distance between them. I am informed by the teacher of the room that these radiators are always too hot to touch, but the room is very cold, and the day of my visit was the first day it had been warm. On further inspection I found all inside windows and sashes very loose, and in many cases the windows do not close properly. The doors are very poorly fitted, with gaps from \u00bc\" to \u00bd\" at the top, bottom, or both.\n\nThe floor of this building is not covered, and is very drafty. I would recommend covering this floor, but I feel that if the windows and doors are properly sealed the classroom will be warm enough.\n\nSections of the outside wall covering should be repaired. I have asked Mr. Scrase to have his engineer, Mr. Bird, attend to the doors and windows, and report the resulting changes to us as soon as possible.\n\nThe classroom located.......\nThe classroom located at the north end of the west wing of this building is the same size as the former. The storm porch and doors are located in the same manner. Five windows are located on the west wall and one on the east wall. Two 24-coil radiators are located along the west wall, in the same manner as the classroom formerly described. The same conditions exist in this classroom with regard to doors and windows, and the same recommendations have been made to Mr. Scrase. The classrooms in the south end of this building are not so hard to heat, but the doors and windows are in need of repair.\n\nThe air in these classrooms, at the present time, is very foul, and it is my opinion that an air circulating system of some kind should be installed. This would not only protect the health of the students, but help solve the heating problem as well.\n\nThere are \"ventilators\" in the roof. If the room were warmer, correction might take care of air movement. Forced air would be good, of course.\n\nD.H.

Our comments on Mr. Morrison's reports are as follows:\n\nBuilding 23\n\nIt is hoped that the school management have arranged to have the doors and windows properly fitted.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Morrison's comments on the air in the classrooms, Mr. Clark points out that there are ventilators in the rooms. Are these working properly?\n\nBuilding 34\n\nWe do not appear to have received from Mr. Jones the plans to which Mr. Morrison refers. We understand that to effect the improvements in this building as suggested by Mr. Morrison, it would involve an expenditure of over $5,000.00. If it is possible for you to let us have the plans and your recommendation in the near future, it might be possible for us to find the funds in the current year's appropriation if the work or most of it could be completed before March 31st.\nBuilding 30\n\nWith reference to Mr. Morrison's suggestion that this building be relined, Mr. Clark points out that there was lumber stored in the building used as a gymnasium. If this is not available at the present time, you might let me have a requisition for the material required.\n\nIn connection with the general remarks of Mr. Morrison, it is hoped that the school management are giving attention to keeping the surroundings of the buildings in good condition, and that the garbage is not allowed to accumulate in the kitchen.\n\nP./ST\n\nBernard F.

It is in Prince Albert now, and whether it is used at the File Hills Colony School or some other point it will have to be overhauled before it will be of any use for a lighting plant.\n\nI would recommend that it be overhauled at once, but if parts are needed it will be some little time before the parts are all delivered, therefore it seems impossible to make immediate use of it to provide electricity for the File Hills Colony School.\n\nIn any case it is quite evident now that the school will have to open without a lighting plant, and as the teacher is moving in next week, I am asking Mr. Lunam to prepare the place temporarily so far as the sewage is concerned, with final arrangements being completed after the matter of power is satisfactorily settled.\n\nJ.P.B.

The funds for renovating the buildings are in the current year's appropriation, and as you know, the present fiscal year ends on March 31st. We would like to have the work on these two buildings completed by that date, as funds have not been provided in the 1950-51 appropriation.\n\nIncidentally, while writing to you, may I point out that we are extremely anxious to have all work that is under way completed by the end of March, in order that the funds in the current year's appropriation can be used.

Lac la Ronge Residential School\n\nOur requisition dated February 18th, 1950 - The machinery ordered on this requisition is intended to replace certain laundry machinery transferred to the Lac la Ronge School at the time of the closing of the Chapleau Residential School approximately two years ago. At the time the machinery was transferred, it had been in use for over 20 years at Chapleau. There is no question that this particular machinery has served its usefulness, and as mentioned above, it is for this reason that we ordered the machinery requested on the requisition dated February 18th.\n\n2. Qu'Appelle Residential School\n\nOur requisition dated February 27th, 1950 for ironer - Attached is a requisition for a new ironer. The authorized pupilage at the Qu'Appelle School is 300, and the ironer presently in use is too small for the purpose required, but can be used to advantage at the St. Phillip's Residential School. If the new ironer as requested on the requisition is supplied at an early date, we will transfer the ironer at Qu'Appelle to St. Phillip's, which is a much smaller school.\n\nWe had an interview this afternoon with Mr. W.H. Buzby of Stanley Brock Limited, and we understand that if that firm could obtain the business in connection with both Qu'Appelle and Lac la Ronge Schools, they would be in a position to make a fairly liberal allowance on the old laundry machinery.\nformerly at Chapleau and now at Lac la Ronge Residential School as mentioned above.\n\nWe recommend such action for your consideration.\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F.

In this regard may I refer to Departmental letter 656-5-(E.1) of November 10, 1949. In regard to Invoice No. 8383 amounting to $19.08, this I consider the responsibility of the Harvey Lunam Construction Company. Invoice No. 8230 and 8281 amounting to $29.65; this covered a very simple repair, the nature of which must be expected often in the type of heating plants in use at this institution. The pump and motor are attached together as one unit. During winter months this unit operates twenty-four hours of each day and consequently needs close supervision and maintenance. In fact, I gave the same attention to the motor and pump on the Agency office plant. It is evident the present engineer employed at the school has a very limited knowledge of electrical equipment. He is of course an employee of the school and I maintain the school should be responsible for both his mistakes and inability. Invoice No. 8620 amounting to $98.52, this I consider is a just charge against our Branch and must admit this was an oversight on my part. However, had this been drawn to my attention a considerable saving could have been brought about, for instance, the asbestos covering the old Jacket heaters could have been dissolved by soaking with water, and later used to cover the new Jacket heaters. Some of the piping too could have been salvaged. I have prepared vouchers covering the whole of the accounts, but I do think the instructions contained in letter 656-5-(E.1) of November 10, 1949, should be adhered to.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of February 24th, 656-5 (El), I am enclosing herewith contract agreement completed by the Harvey Lunam Construction Company, in connection with the alterations at Army Hut No. 20, Ex 22, A.B.T.C., which is now used as Lac La Ronge Residential School.

Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nWith reference to Department army message of the 7th instant, and my reply by army message of the 9th instant regarding the heating of building No. 34, Lac La Ronge Residential School, I visited the school yesterday to discuss the matter of plans with Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones. It was my intention to interview Mr. H.P. Mascho of the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company, Prince Albert, with a view to getting plans and a quotation from him, however, Mr. Mascho was out of the city and will be for several days. It is necessary to discuss it with him, as he made the original suggestion as to the method of installing the plant and it can hardly be taken out of his hands at this stage.\n\nThere is a suitable boiler in stock in Prince Albert at the present time, and I asked Mr. Jones to take the necessary steps to submit a voucher for the boiler and a quantity of pipes and connections which will be necessary, in the hope that the voucher will be accepted and can be paid out of 1949-50 appropriation. Of course, if the purchase is to be made through the Departmental Purchasing Agent, with the writing for quotations, etc., it would be impossible to make the purchase before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nThe remainder of the cost of the new heating plant will be materials and labour to construct a small boiler-room and connect up the plant. This cannot be done until after the 1st of April, because of the continuing severe cold. It was twenty-five below zero when I left Prince Albert last night.\n\nJ.P.B.

Under the same file number and under date of 24th June, 1949, you stated that the salary allowed would be $60.00 per month for the period ending 30th June, 1950.\n\nThe Principal of this School points out that a continuously employed full-time Nightwatchman will be required after the termination of the present authorization. We agree with the Principal because of the number of buildings and the nature of their construction and therefore request that authorization of a Nightwatchman at a salary of $60.00 be extended until 30th June, 1951, with the proviso that the matter will be reviewed again in the spring of 1951.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nLaundry Equipment - All Saints Indian Res. School\n\nThe statement that extra equipment will be surplus is surprising, and should not cause us to refuse delivery of the equipment ordered.\n\nThe present laundry has been criticized adversely because of its location in a building apart from the storage and repair rooms. The Department consented to move the laundry into the drill hall building and thus stream-line the procedures with clothing, but this cannot be done until the school vehicles and the Manual Training shop have been moved into other buildings in order to make room for a proper laundry installation comprising enough equipment to handle the load expeditiously.\n\nWe have already provided elsewhere for a Manual Training shop. It is now up to the local people to find garage space elsewhere. They usurped this space originally without authority. Its continued use as a garage invites hazards such as overtook Round Lake but with a tremendously greater potential loss. The vehicles belonging to the school and staff members should be housed in a building where a fire would not destroy other equipment.\n\nOur plan for the permanent installation is first of all to make the space in the drill hall available. Then the new machinery should be set up on expert advice as part of the full installation. Drains will be placed in the floor and spaces left so that there is room to fit in duplicate units at certain points. The new machinery will thus be able to operate while the machinery from the hut No. 33 is being transferred and set up alongside the new machinery.\nThe installation of new machinery in the drill hall involves previous attention to the provision of a chimney and hot water. If at all possible we should avoid building a new chimney and use the excellent chimney already in existence near the point where the new machinery will be set up. I have made additional copies of this memorandum so that if you wish it may be submitted to others concerned for their comments.\n\nC.A.F.

Jones, and myself as to what should be\ndone this year, and there has been considerable correspondence to\nthat effect.\n\nHowever, in my opinion it is necessary to get advice\nfrom the Engineering Services before taking further steps. After\nplans are prepared by Engineering Services (Mr. W.W. Perrie preferably),\ntenders should be called in accordance with those plans.\n\nI do not recommend that Mr. D.N. Morrison be placed\nin charge of such an important piece of work, and to have it performed\nby local labour, as we could run into a great deal of difficulty with\nregard to the supply of material. It is the intention to send\nMr. Morrison to the Beauval Residential School to supervise the work\nat that school, and he will be tied up there most of July and August.\nThe work at Building No. 34 should also be done in July and August,\ntherefore there is some urgency about it.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJune 1st, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. CHAS. E. BUCK,\nCHIEF ENGINEER\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, this school is operating in the military camp just outside the town of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nBuilding No. 34 is being used as a dining hall, but it is not satisfactory in its present condition owing to the large enrolment at the school.\n\nWe have been informed by Regional Supervisor Ostrander that the following work at least should be done to the building in order to make it satisfactory for the purposes required:\n\n1. Steam heating is to be put in - thus removing danger of fire from a number of stoves in the dining halls and passages.\n\n2. A second room should be built at the back and water tanks and heaters moved from the kitchen into the boiler room, thus giving more kitchen space.\n\n3. Battleship linoleum is required for the floors.\n\n4. The interior of the building needs painting.\n\n....2\nThe above suggestions apply to both wings of the building used as a dining hall, as 150 children are seated in each wing. Mr. Ostrander states that Mr. W.W. Perrie is familiar with the situation at this school.\n\nIt is most important that this work be done during the summer holidays (July and August 1950) so that the dining hall will be in proper condition when the school reopens on September 1st.\n\nBoth Regional Supervisor Ostrander, Regina, and Superintendent Jones, Prince Albert, should be advised of the exact date on which the engineer will visit this school.\n\nYour immediate kind attention to the above matter would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nLaundry Equipment,\nLac La Ronge Indian Residential School:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I discussed this matter with the Reverend Principal last Sunday.\n\nI confirmed the fact that his present urgent need is for a drier rather than an extractor, as it needs two driers to keep up with the other units because of the difficulty in this climate of hanging things out to dry. It is not convenient to wait for a dry yet dust-free day to hang the whitewear out.\n\nThis drier can be set up in the meantime beside the other working units. Room was allowed for it in the plan for the set-up. The instructions also called for the fitters to install the steam-pipes so that the addition of another drier would be only a minor operation.\n\nThe second washer and extractor should be stored on the school premises until the provision of garage space for trucks, etc., is made away from the Drill Hall where the full laundry installation was intended.\n\nIt was our hope that the larger school would do the laundry for the smaller school (St. Albans). It has been doing some of the latter's laundry for weeks because of a break-down in the equipment at St. Albans. This further demonstrates the unwisdom of depending on single large units. Two medium-sized units like washers, etc., are better for school purposes, on the same principle as supplying two medium-sized heating units (boilers).\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Regina\nSuperintendent, Prince Albert\n\nC.A.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part II)\nChief, Education Division\n\nAlterations at Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nIn March of this year weather conditions retarded the project for changing the heating arrangements for Hut No. 34 (dining-room). I have not in the meantime seen the comments of our Heating Engineer or Supervisor of Construction concerning the plan and estimates.\n\nI understand that it is proposed to eliminate from the kitchen two hot water tanks with their coal heaters, and I wonder whether the extra costs that this would involve are necessary. In favour of the change is the argument that the firing would be done by a skilled fireman\u2014when there is one. Against it there is the point that the cooking staff will have to attend to the many stoves anyway, and hot water is in their interest. A responsibility that someone else does not fulfill would be another source of friction.\n\nMost important is the necessity to get the job done as efficiently and cheaply as possible this summer.\n\nOn the point of cheapness of installation and part-time (as it should be) operation could we get an opinion on the feasibility of forced hot air rather than hot water? As it is a two-winged building the factor of flexibility might affect the cost of operation. We have two large hot-air furnaces in the Drill Hall which are said to be too expensive to use. A smaller unit of that type might supply sufficient fresh warm air to the dining-rooms. Ventilation as well as warmth is a consideration. It is for that reason that I think the engineering branch might review the present plans and alternatives.\n\nCopy to:\nRegional Supervisor, Regina\nDept., Carlton Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Superintendent Jones also informed me that the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company quote $8,200.00 on the heating plant, as outlined in the blue print. This amount, together with approximately $2100.00 for the building, indicates that the whole will cost over $10,000.00, therefore advertising for tenders will certainly be necessary.\n\nMay this matter be given consideration as soon as possible, and request made that an engineer visit the premises and prepare plans and specifications.\n\nJ.P.B.

A. J. Scrase, the Principal, (Supt. Jones was out of the City and therefore not available to go with us) to the Prince Albert Fire Hall where we discussed the matter with the Chief of the Fire Department. He recommends a Model V Federal Siren (such as is mounted on his car) operated from a 6-volt battery; he prefers battery to line operation because of the danger of disruption of power lines in event of a fire. The Chief informed me that this particular siren is handled by The Prairie Fire Extinguisher Company, Moose Jaw, Sask., so I wrote that firm for a quotation and enclose the original of their reply received today.\n\nYou will note that the price of the Model V Federal Siren, 6 volt, is $29.00 f.o.b. Moose Jaw. To this should be added the cost of a 6-volt battery (car battery) which I understand is about $20.00 in Prince Albert.\n\nAs discussed by telephone this afternoon we shall be glad if you will authorize the purchase and installation of the above at an early date as a safeguard to the pupils and staff, a number of whom will be in residence in this school throughout the summer.\n\n(P.T.O)\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition to those, the following were brought to my attention during my visit:\n\n(a) Handicrafts\n\nI was informed that your Major Clark, who visited this school recently, recommended that a Handicrafts Instructor and an Assistant Manual Training Instructor be added to the Staff.\n\nWill you please let us know whether or not your Department will pay the salaries of such personnel (as you now do in the case of the Manual Training Instructor) and also what grant, if any, you are prepared to make towards the cost of materials for handicrafts work. The question of provision of materials also arises in the case of St. Alban's School where one of the Staff has been very successful in her teaching of the girls in plastic work, bead work, embroidery, weaving, etc.\n\n(b) Prayer & Hymn Books\n\nThese are needed at Lac la Ronge School and also at St. Alban's. Will they be supplied by you on requisition by the Principals to your local Superintendent?\n\n(c) Bread-Slicer\n\nWith 250 children (and possibly 300), besides staff, the slicing of bread by hand is a long and laborious process. It will be appreciated if a bread-slicer can be supplied before the commencement of next term.\n\n(d) Electric Irons in Laundry\n\n3 additional electric irons, with wall outlets for plugging in, are needed.\n\n(P.T.O)\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, the results were de-\nfinitely most unsatisfactory as all the vegetables produced in the\nSchool garden and stored in this structure froze and the beets, carrots\nand turnips were a total loss. It was found possible, but only by\nmeans of special cooking, to utilize most of the frozen potatoes.\n\nThis year the School garden comprises 6-7 acres of\npotatoes and 2-3 acres of other vegetables. Unless proper winter\nstorage for this produce is provided, the loss of money, time and\nlabour will be very great and will involve heavy waste of essential\nfood.\n\nIt is urgently requested that early action be taken\ntowards provision of proper storage space either by reconstructing the\npresent accommodation or providing some suitable alternative. It is\nsuggested that advice of local officials of the Department of Agri-\nculture be sought as regards methods of making the present accommo-\ndation satisfactory. From a casual inspection it would appear that\ninsulation is needed on the sides and ends and that a roof vent should\nbe installed to ensure proper ventilation.\n\nWill you please let us know what you propose to do\nin this connection because if no suitable storage is provided the\nPrincipal will have to try to dispose of all the produce that cannot\n\n(P.T.O.)\nbe consumed before cold weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G.

Brault, Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works, asking him to instruct Mr. Ramage, of the Saskatoon office Public Works, to inspect the root house in question and submit a report to our Branch with his recommendation. After Mr. Ramage has made his inspection and reported, his recommendations could be carried out before the time to use the root house for winter storage of this year's crop.\n\nMay I please be advised.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan\nMr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nPost Office Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have for acknowledgement letter 1874-107/6-1-656, dated July 6th, 1950, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Anglican school authorities to our Branch pertaining to the Root Cellar constructed last year at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School. I withheld my reply in the hope Mr. Scrase, Principal of the school, would return from holidays which would enable me to discuss the matter with him. I now understand Mr. Scrase does not expect to return until August 12th. I was advised last year the Department would consider furnishing a Root Cellar providing the cost was not too high. I wrote the University of Saskatchewan giving them an outline of our requirements and requested I be furnished with plans of the construction of Root Cellars. On receipt of the plans mentioned I had two different contractors work out the cost. Both estimates were in the neighborhood of $4,000.00. I considered the plans too elaborate and was of the opinion something much cheaper and just as suitable could be constructed. In this connection I solicited the services of Mr. Ramage, engineer of the Department of Public Works, who kindly gave of his time and assistance in preparing the plan, which was eventually carried out.\n\nIn his letter, General Turner has been very unjust in his criticism of the construction of the Root Cellar concerned or his is not aware of the actual facts.\nI recall seeing approximately forty bushels of potatoes harvested and placed in the portion of the lean-to adjoining the Root Cellar. These potatoes represented so much muck. It is my understanding they were later placed in the Root Cellar with other vegetables, the fumes from which I submit would have a tendency to rot every vegetable in the Root Cellar. Further, when the cellar was constructed, a stove was set up in the building with the intention of putting on a fire when temperatures remained below normal for any length of time. From inquiries made, it is very apparent the stove was not used once during the winter.\n\nIt is my opinion the plan and the construction of the Root Cellar is practical and suitable for the storing of vegetables. What is needed is to educate the Principal and the staff of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School in the correct method of harvesting and storing vegetables, also the careful checking of the cellar during the winter months.\n\nI would appreciate if arrangements could be made to have Mr. Ramage of the Department of Public Works examine the building and submit a report.\n\nAt the present time, a portion of the earth has been washed down by recent heavy rains. A considerable amount too, was brought down from the upper portion of the embankment by the children who used the embankment for a slide the whole of last winter and the greater part of the summer.\n\nE.

But it was expected the saw-mill referred to in paragraph 3 above would be in operation about the end of August, and shortly after that the work of building would begin. The site selected is as healthful and as suitable in every respect as could be found in the locality.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nNistawasie, Sept. 23rd, 1905.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJuly 21st 1909\n\n346826\n\nI am informed that Mr. Leetoot Reid is likely to proceed shortly to Lac la Rouge to carry out surveys under instructions from your department. I would respectfully request that the land on which the Indian Boarding School is situated may be surveyed by Mr. Reid. We claim for the school about half a mile frontage on Lac la Rouge and about a quarter of a mile back.\n\nI would also request that the school be allowed a small timber reserve on the Big Stone Lake, anything from half a mile to one square mile.\n\nThe probability is that timber limits may be secured in that part of the country before long, and we may have difficulty in getting timber for the use of the school. I am writing for Lac la Rouge on the 3rd prox. and a reply addressed to me at Prince Albert that may reach me before I leave would be a great favour.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nOttawa, July 29, 1909.\n\nMemo.\n\nMr. Bray,\n\nMr. Reid may be instructed to survey for the Lac la Ronge Boarding School land to the extent requested by the Ven. Archdeacon Mackay, i.e., with a frontage of one-half mile on the lake and a depth of about one-quarter of a mile.\n\nThis would appear to be a reasonable amount for the use of the school.\n\nNo action will be taken to secure a timber limit for their use at present.\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, July 29, 1909.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your proposed surveys of Indian reserves at Lac La Ronge I beg to inform you that in accordance with the representations made by Ven. Archdeacon J.A. Mackay it has been decided to allow to the Indian boarding school at Lac La Ronge a tract of land having a frontage on the lake of about half a mile with a depth of about a quarter of a mile. I have to request you to be good enough to consult with Mr. Mackay who is probably now at Battleford, or with the Principal in charge of the school, and to survey the said tract of land in the usual manner. The general instructions regarding surveys for this Department with which you are familiar will cover this case.\n\nMr. Mackay also requested that a timber limit be also surveyed for the school but the Department has decided that no action be taken in this direction for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

They have felt the pinch considerably and the coming season is not more promising. In the district in which Lac la Rouge is situated very destructive fires have waged in the course of the summer, owing to an exceptionally dry season and it may be assumed that there has been great destruction of fur-bearing animals. Furs will be scarce and the price will be low so that there will be a good deal of want. In my operations at Lac la Rouge school last summer, I endeavored to give the Indians all the employment I could in my limited means, and, besides employing them at the saw mill, I gave them work in clearing and draining a swamp near the school. The drain is good and the land when drained is excellent.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nA. Hanna\nall that is required in labour. This work is de-\nsirable in more ways than one\u2014\n1. It would afford the Indians some employment\nand help them out in their need.\n2. It would be an object lesson to them and\nteach them that there is plenty of land within\ntheir reach that might be made productive\nby intelligent labour.\n3.

Sir:\n\nOn the 15th October the Department sent you cheque No. 2116 for $500.00 being an advance wherewith to defray expenses of drainage of land in connection with the Lac La Ronge Indian Boarding School. It is desired that you will kindly account for the expenditure of the proceeds of this cheque without delay, as the present fiscal year will close on the 31st of March, and it is necessary to have the money accounted for before the close of the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nPrince Albert,\nSaskatchewan.\nLac la Rouge\nMarch 16th 1918\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No 212538-1 of the 29th ult. I herewith enclose a voucher for the expenditure of $79.67 which is all that I have spent so far on drainage. This I had ordered before I received the $500.00 from the Department. When I received the cheque from the Department, cold weather had set in and it was too late in the season to resume work on drainage. As you state that it is necessary to have the money accounted for before the close of the fiscal year, I have asked the Revillon Freres' agent, through whom I have been making the payments, to give me a voucher for $403.33, to make up the balance of the $500.00, only the account is for lumbering, not drainage. As a matter of fact I have spent over $800.00 on lumbering, but I do not intend to spend this money on lumbering eventually. I intend to spend the whole of the $500.00 on drainage as soon as ever the season opens and work of that kind can be obtained. I do not know that this way of doing things will be satisfactory, but it is the best that I can do at present.\n\nI am Sir,\nYours obediently,\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n&c.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\nOttawa, March 31st., 1916.\n\nVery Rev. Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with enclosure, relative to the advance of $500.00 made to you by cheque No. 2116 wherewith to defray expenses of drainage of land in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Boarding School; and in reply I return herewith the voucher for $420.33 which you have submitted. When the $500.00 has been expended on the drainage as intended, the full amount should be accounted for. The Department will require evidence that the Indians received the money through orders. These orders should be attached to the account, which should bear your certificate to the effect that the work has been performed and that the charges are fair and just.\n\nI also return the account of $79.67 which you submitted, which amount has already been expended from the proceeds of the cheque for $500.00. This account is incomplete without the orders and it should be certified by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLeod\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen.

The money was paid mostly in orders on the Revillon Freres and Hudson's Bay Company. The orders I am sending are all duplicate orders copied from the stub of the original order book, and are as follows: $298.00 on the Revillon Freres and $31.25 on the Hudson's Bay Co. The men were paid at the rate of $1.25 per day, and rations. The School supplied rations at a cost of 70 cents per man per day. Which amounts\n(263\u00bd days @ 70 cents per day) $184.45\n\nSo that the total amount expended when the muskeg work is $513.75.\n\nI may say that about (10) ten acres has been cleared and drained, half of which was under cultivation last Summer. Owing to the land being part of a large muskeg it is subject to frost, so that last year we were able to grow green feed only, but with further draining and clearing good farm land may be obtained. It is the largest piece of cultivated land within a radius of (100) one hundred miles, so that it is an entirely new industry up in this part. The muskeg or swamp is many thousands of acres in area, and when drained and cleared makes the very best of rich land.\nThe soil being a black loam of 3 and 4 ft in depth, and of mould were cleared I think the Indians here would take hold of the idea of farming. They will soon have to do something other than trapping for a living, for fur is getting scarce.\n\nLast year the Department kindly sent garden seeds for the Indians which I urged them to sow, and the results were very satisfactory, for nearly every Indian had his garden patch last Summer. I think next Spring I could get more sown if the Department would kindly send more.\n\nThanking you for the help you have given us towards starting a farm.\nI beg to remain.\n\nYour obedient Servant:\n\n(Row) Charles F.

The large lot of 76 acres has a frontage of half a mile on Lac la Ronge. It was surveyed at my request as a School Reserve when I was building the original Boarding school, and it belongs to the Indian Department with all the school buildings. The smaller lot, 8 acres, was cleared for purposes of cultivation while I was in charge of the school, and I had a special grant from the Indian Department for the purpose. The whole thing, school buildings and land, belongs to the Indian Department. When we handed over the school to the M.S.C.E. we, that is the Diocese, had no property to hand over. All that we handed over was the control. If Mr. Hives has made affidavits or statutory declarations in support of the claims of the Church of England, he has done so on his own responsibility or under instructions from the M.S.C.E. The Church has no claim and has no object in entering a claim for the land. The Government has built the school and the Government is supporting the school, and the whole property belongs to the Indian Department of the Government.\n\nI hope this will give you the information necessary to make a clear reply to the Department of the Interior.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) J.

In this connection I beg to enclose for your perusal a copy of a letter dated 22nd October, 1923, from the late Archdeacon McKay to Bishop Lloyd.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 18th ultimo enclosing the report of Mr. Agent Waddy on his visit to the Isle a la Croix Agency regarding the clearing of land at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the Department is noting for inclusion in the Estimates for the next fiscal year an amount for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If so, the Department would be glad to send you an accountable cheque for paying wages.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Chas. F.

At the present time we have not more than three acres, and that not very good. I am wondering whether the Department will make this school a grant of $1000.00 to clear some new land. In this way we can obtain more land, and at the same time provide employment for the people here.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 27, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, requesting that a grant of $1,000 be provided for the purpose of clearing new land for cultivation at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that our appropriation for the present fiscal year was considerably reduced. It is possible to provide funds for only the more urgent requirements at our Indian schools. I regret that the Department will be unable to provide any grant this year to clear more land at the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. W.

The\nschool management now go from island to island in the lake\ncutting a little here and there wherever it is to be found.\nThey are experimenting with oats on small pieces of ground,\nand from results obtained, feel confident that the hay and\ngreen feed problem can be solved if more land is cleared.\nYour Department made a grant for this purpose a few years\nago, and the money was well spent in clearing about five\nacres of land near the main school building. A great many\nstones, however, will have to be removed before this area\ncan be seeded to advantage. The bush fire of 1927 which\ndestroyed the forest around the school and endangered the\nschool buildings at the same time, revealed considerable\nland about a mile or two behind the school, which could be\nbrought under cultivation if properly cleared of stumps\nand shrubbery, and as this would afford employment for the\nIndians in the settlement, our Commission strongly recom-\nmend that not less than 25 acres be cleared as soon as\npossible. As this area does not at present lie within the\nboundaries of the school property, our Commission feel\nthat steps should be taken to have the school land in-\ncreased sufficiently to enclose it, and they trust that\nyour Department may be able to help them in the way\nindicated.\nOttawa, September 8, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo which relates to additional land for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. The school land may be described as Lots 9 and 12 in the La Ronge Settlement, comprising a total of 64.8 acres. The land to the north is, I believe, owned by the Provincial Crown, and, before an application is made for a parcel, it will be necessary to know with some accuracy just what land is desired by the school. Please have the Principal indicate what land is desired, on a rough sketch, giving distances as far as possible and showing the relations of the present school lots.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM RE LANDS OF THE LAC LA RONGE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nApproximately 84.5 acres, having been granted by P.C. 689 of May 4, 1925 (\"the said lots be and they are hereby transferred to the control of the Department of Indian Affairs for the purposes of the Indian Boarding School and Hospital at La Ronge\").\n\nMay be briefly described as:\n\nLots 9 and 12 of La Ronge Settlement in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe land which was set aside for this school is all rock and muskeg. I went into this matter very closely and was informed that there was some land about one-half mile north of the school where a sufficient acreage could be cleared to enable them to grow their own feed for stock. I walked over this land in company with the engineer and found that his statement was correct. It would be quite possible to obtain the clearing of 25 or 30 acres, which would meet the requirements. In order to provide this, another quarter or half section might be set aside for the use of the school. The land I speak of, I am satisfied, will never be taken up by settlers, as owing to the fact that it is surrounded by rocky land and muskeg, and has no lake frontage, it is practically valueless as it stands. I was informed that this land could be cleared with the help of the big boys at a cost of about $20.00 per acre. They have already cleared about three acres of this, but the Principal does not feel that he would be justified in spending any considerable amount until they have a proprietary right to the land. Unless some such arrangement is made, it would be impossible to increase the number of cows.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\ndated October 8th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on 132-1-5.\n\nWith regard to the Lac la Ronge School, it will be noted that the situation of this school is not by any means as favourable as that at Beauval, there being very little land under cultivation or fit for that purpose. The Inspector points out that some might be obtained if the Department could arrange for the purchasing of same, or for having it set aside. I do not know how this affects the arrangements made with the Provincial Government re setting land aside for the Indians, but would suggest that it be set aside as an Indian reserve, and the school then allowed to use it. I would be glad to be advised in this connection, and I will then take the matter up with the proper authorities here. We should certainly provide for the growing of hay for feed for the cattle, so that the children could obtain milk as part of their diet.\nOttawa, October 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 8th instant, which has reference to the need of more land at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. This question has already received the attention of the Department, and, on the 8th ultimo, I wrote to the school authorities, asking that a rough description, with sketch showing the land desired, be submitted to the Department. When this is to hand, I will write to you further concerning overtures to the Provincial Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 8th, 1931, #132-2-9, requesting further information as to the parcel of land which our Society desires to be added to their Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge in Saskatchewan, I beg to state that I have just received the information requested from the Principal. The delay has been due entirely to the delay in the delivery of the mail from Prince Albert, the delay being caused through the almost impassible condition of the roads. Enclosed herewith you will find - (a) a plan of the La Ronge settlement as received from the Surveyor General, and (b) a rough sketch of the additional land desired. The land at present attached to the school as stated in your letter, is Lots 9 and 12, or a total of 84.6 acres. From the rough sketch submitted by Mr. Principal Fisher, you will see that the additional land desired lies immediately behind these two Lots.\n\nThe Principal states that \"quite a lot of the area shown is muskeg, and parts are too stony to do very much with\", but, he expresses the opinion that at least twenty-five acres could be found, which, if cleared, would be suitable for cultivation.\n\nI beg to recommend that the whole section, one mile square as indicated on the Principal's sketch, be added to the school property. The hay and wood problems at this school are an annual burden of anxiety to our...\nSociety, and I have good reason to believe that this burden will be considerably lightened if the additional land is provided, and we can receive some help from your Department in having it surveyed and cleared. I commend this request to your early and sympathetic consideration and remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R.W.\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nP.S. I shall be obliged if you will let me have the plan of the La Ronge settlement back again when you have finished with it. T.B.R.W.\nOttawa, February 22, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with enclosures, relative to additional land for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I am arranging to have the school's needs placed before the Provincial Government, and you will receive an additional letter at a later date. I am returning the plan of the settlement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n25th February 1932\n\nSir,\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England have an Indian residential school established on Lots 9 and 12 of the Lac La Ronge Settlement. The school finds itself handicapped for lack of land for agriculture and a scarcity in the supply of wood. For the better prosecution of their work among the Indians they are requesting that a parcel of land containing slightly more than one square mile be secured for their use.\n\nThe lands are described as:- Commencing at the North-East corner of Settlement Lot No. 13; thence North 65 degrees 58 minutes East along the North boundaries of Lots 2, 3, 6, 5 and 4 to the North-East corner of Lot 4; thence North 24 degrees and 2 minutes West at right angles 80 chains; thence South 65 degrees 58 minutes West 80 chains and 80 links; thence South 24 degrees and 2 minutes East 80 chains, more or less, to the place of beginning, containing seven hundred and ten acres, more or less.\n\nIt is stated that a very considerable portion of the land is muskeg and parts are too stony to be of much use but that about 25 acres of cultivable land may be found, the remaining portion is required for wood and pasture.\n\nEnclosed is a plan of Lac La Ronge Settlement which shows the situation of the parcel. May I request your Government to have this land set aside for the use of the Industrial School?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Barnett Esq.,\nDeputy Minister\nDepartment of Natural Resources\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 24th ultimo, wherein you make mention that the Missionary Society of the Church of England have an Indian Resident School established on Lots 9 and 12 of the Lac la Ronge settlement, and they request that an area of slightly more than one square mile adjoining the above mentioned lots be set aside for their use owing to a lack of land for agriculture and a scarcity in the supply of wood.\n\nIn reply thereto I wish to advise that after taking into consideration the possibilities of further development in the Lac la Ronge district in the future and also that we have established a policy whereby hunters, trappers and fishermen are charged permit fees and dues for cabin sites and rental for land which they may require for grazing and cultivation purposes, also that it is necessary for us at all times to bear in mind the need of other settlers in the community, we find that we are unable to grant the request to alienate lands for an extensive area for the purpose mentioned.\n\nHowever, if the authorities of this Society desire to apply for a permit for cultivation and grazing on certain areas the application can be further considered. The annual rental for the area to be cultivated would be at 50\u00a2 per acre and the grazing 2\u00a2 per acre.\n\nAt the present time we grant free permits to institutions of this nature in the northern parts of the Province to cut 25 cords free of dues. In excess of this amount the dues are at the rate of 10\u00a2 per cord for fire killed or dry timber and 15\u00a2 a cord for green poplar, other species are permitted at the regular rate of dues.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn Barnett\nDeputy Minister of Natural Resources.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 17, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Barnett:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to this Department's application for a parcel of land at Lac la Ronge, for the use of the Indian Residential School there. Perhaps I did not make it clear that this is a government-owned institution and that the request is that title to the parcel be in the Federal Crown. This school has over 100 children in residence and they are given a vocational as well as an academic training. At all these schools, there is a good-sized farm, for example, at the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret, 1120 acres. There are over 700 acres in the farms at the Round Lake School, near Stockholm, and at the Indian Residential School at Duck Lake. I may say that at 9 of the 14 Indian residential schools in Saskatchewan this Department has title to farms which are not Indian reserves.\n\nAlthough this parcel is not required as an Indian reserve, it is considered necessary in connection with the administration of the school, and, under the terms of Treaty 10, the Crown is under obligation to maintain educational institutions for the Indians. In fact, it is mere accident that a farm was not set aside for this school by His Excellency the Governor in Council some years ago, before the return of the natural resources.\n\nI should be grateful if you would review the matter in this light and give this application on behalf of our wards favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJohn Barnett, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Natural Resources,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 22, 1932, #132-2-9, in which you stated that our request for additional land for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School was being placed before the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, I shall be obliged if you can let me know at an early date, if our request has been granted. Our Commission are anxious to have the farming activities at this school extended, in order to reduce the heavy cost of maintenance, but they are finding this quite impossible with the limited area attached to the school at present.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/W Field Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 12, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the application for additional land for the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. The Department has been in correspondence with the Deputy Minister of Natural Resources for Saskatchewan, and I am hopeful that we will receive a Provincial Crown grant for the parcel in question. Even if our application is unsuccessful, we would, no doubt, be able to secure a permit for cultivation and grazing purposes, or we could arrange to purchase what is needed. In view of these facts and the location of the school, I think it quite safe for the Reverend Principal to proceed with any farming activities he wishes. Of course, it would be advisable for him to confine his activity to that section of the parcel requested, which is nearest the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the report which Col. Mermagen, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission presented after his visit to the Lac la Ronge School last month, he refers to the urgent need of having more land cleared, and especially the land in the immediate vicinity of the school, in order that a greater acreage might be available for raising garden produce. As this land is very stony, and can only be made fit for cultivation by removing the stones, and drawing soil from a considerable distance, the Commission felt that they could not undertake so great a work without some financial assistance. After consultation with the Principal, the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer was of the opinion that the sum of $400.00 would be required to accomplish this work, and I was instructed to ask your Department to authorize this expenditure. As the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of the Commission spoke very highly of the work which is being accomplished in every department of this school's activities, our Commission are keenly desirous of encouraging the school management by supplying their needs to the fullest extent of their power, and if your Department can undertake the clearing of the land, so that it may be in readiness for seeding next summer, you will render a very valuable and timely contribution to the work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\nOttawa, October 5, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting that a grant to the amount of $400 be provided towards the cost of clearing land in the vicinity of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, in order that a greater acreage will be available for raising garden produce.\n\nIn reply I regret that the Department will be unable to provide any grant for this purpose from our Appropriation for the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this I concur.\n\nIn going over the land I was forcibly impressed with the fact that this institution will never support its staff and members by any produce derived therefrom, regardless of the amount of labour expended in any attempt to do so. While here, I was questioned concerning a further grant of land to them.\n\n(Sgd.) S. H. Simpson,\nPaying Officer.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward a report on the schools included in the Isle a la Crosse agency, submitted by the Paying Officer for this year, Mr. S. H. Simpson.\n\nLAC LA RONGE RES. SCHOOL.\n\nYou will note he mentions that he was questioned regarding a further grant of land to them. I took this matter up quite fully last year, looked over the ground, and made a recommendation regarding land which might be set aside. This is a matter which I think should receive some attention before it is too late to secure suitable land. There is very little fit for cultivation in that whole area and it is important, if this school is to be continued, that sufficient arable land be secured upon which to grow the feed requirements of the stock belonging to the institution.\n\n(Sgd.) W. Murison,\nInspector.\n6th October 1932\n\nDear Mr. Barnett,\n\nI shall be pleased if you will advise me if, after consideration of the information given you in letter of the 17th March last, your Government can set aside the lands requested in letter of the 25th February last for the use of the Indian residential school at Lac La Ronge Settlement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\nJohn Barnett Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Natural Resources\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This program will be extended this year and will require an adequate supply of building material.\n\nLast year an arrangement was made with the Principal of the Indian Residential School, Mr. Fisher, to recondition the sawmill located at the point mentioned for the purpose of sawing lumber for our immediate needs as it was difficult to get new equipment in due to the roads at that season of the year being impassible, and time was also a definite factor.\n\nThis mill had been used by the Native People and due to mismanagement, had deteriorated to such a point where it was almost completely wrecked. The boiler was in fairly good shape.\n\nThe agreement was that we were to pay rental for the mill and charge this to the costs of repair and rebuilding. We were later informed that the mill belonged to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs we will require additional building material for this coming year, and have a crew of Indians getting out logs for this purpose at the present time, we are desirous of knowing whether or not your Department would be interested in selling this mill, and if so, at what price.\n\nWe have an opportunity to purchase a used mill in good condition, which can be moved in. However, in order to do this, a definite decision will have to be made at an early date as the spring break-up within the next two or three weeks will make it impossible to provide transportation until the middle of the summer.\n\n....If a ..........\nIf a satisfactory deal can be made with your Department, it is felt that it would be needless to take in a second mill as there is not sufficient timber to justify such action.\n\nThe mill would have to be moved to a new site as at the present time it is extremely difficult to get the logs out of the water and over the rocks. In addition, all the bed pieces are rotted and there would have to be a complete new foundation.\n\nIn the majority of cases last year we used Indian labor to cut the logs as well as do the main work around the mill. Their services proved quite satisfactory. We did some custom sawing for several of them, which provided lumber for their own requirements. We would be prepared to continue doing this for the local residents. In fact, we would encourage them to get out sufficient logs to enable each of them to build himself a house. In this way new living quarters would be provided, the only cost being the work of getting the logs out. Payment for sawing could be made by working at the mill. In other words, no cash outlay whatever would be required on their part. We are most anxious to assist these people in becoming self-supporting and see they are encouraged to help themselves.\n\nDue to the transportation difficulties previously mentioned, we will appreciate your early attention to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Please let me have your comments on this letter as soon as possible, in order that Mr. Hoey can reply to the letter.\n\nWhen writing you might also let us have definite information regarding the matter about which you spoke to me on the occasion of your last visit to this office.

J.L. Phelps letter to me, dated January 12th, 1946. This letter was received by me today. I enclose for your information, a copy of my reply.\n\nLet me say first of all, that we are in a difficult position, in which the Government has the whip hand.\n\nWe are the victims of a mistake made in the past, for which we must pay dearly.\n\nMy understanding is, that when the survey was made, which was in the time of the Rev. C.F. Hives, the sawmill stood in front of the school, on the land which is now used as the road. I understand that a \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (whatever that may mean) was entered into by Mr. Hives and the Surveyor, and instead of the road being surveyed along the Lake shore, where it should have been from the first, the road was carried across the school garden. Our warehouse stands over one of the official survey posts. From there it cuts diagonally across the school garden to a point of the veranda of the Principal's residence in passing. A more senseless arrangement could have never been made. But I suppose no-one ever thought of a Lac la Ronge Townsite then.\n\nIt would appear that we have much to lose, unless some satisfactory arrangement can be made with the Government. If the Government (meaning Mr. Phelps) should decide to follow the old survey, then our position here would be no longer tenable. To my mind there can be no question whatever of selling the Government land for the road. We will have to give whatever is required for that purpose, in order to save the area within our fences. Regarding the other part, I feel it would be to the Commission's advantage if an official of the Commission would come up to Lac la Ronge, and look over the whole situation. It would be so much easier to view things on the spot. Trucks are coming in from Prince Albert almost every day, and there would be no difficulty getting in and out. John Friesen would be glad to bring in whoever may come. I feel that this matter is urgent.\nThere is one other thing I feel I should say, and I have this on good authority. Mr. Phelps is a little misleading when he said that the Hudson's Bay Co. is giving them land for $1.00 per acre. This is true, but he does not say that the Hudson's Bay Co. is also retaining a certain amount of land which they plan to cut up into lots and which be leased to those who desire them.\n\nI am attaching a very rough plan of our property, that is the block upon which the school and garden area, and you will see at once just where we stand.\n\nHoping to have an early reply from you on this matter,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nG.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal.\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines And Resources,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of March 9th,  \n132-2-9, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Minister of  \nNatural Resources for the Province of Saskatchewan. I am  \nglad to take the opportunity of laying before the Department  \nvarious questions in connection with this school property  \nwhich are being raised by the Provincial Government.\n\n(1) The School Saw-mill: I have before me a letter from our  \nPrincipal dated January 14, 1945, speaking of the visit of  \nthe Hon. Mr. Phelps and his suggestion about buying or renting  \nthe school saw-mill. Our Principal wrote as if the mill be-  \nlonged to us and we were in a position to sell it if we de-  \nsired. He recommended that a sale should be negotiated in  \nview of the increasing difficulties experienced in operating  \nthis mill. On the other hand, he was ready to accept the sug-  \ngestion of Mr. Phelps that the mill should be taken over \"on  \na rental basis with the government making the necessary re-  \npairs and charging the cost of same against the rental charge  \nper operating hour of $1.50 per hour.\" At that time we auth-  \norized Mr. Fisher to secure the best possible price for a sale  \nor to rent the mill on the proposed basis. It is a little  \ndifficult for us to find out how this mill was purchased in  \nthe first place but we readily agreed with the Principal that  \nthe time has passed when it was wise or profitable for our  \nschool to engage in milling operations.\n\n(2) Property: We have been negotiating with Mr. Phelps in re-  \ngard to the property on which our school is located. He de-  \nsired to purchase a substantial portion of the land to enable  \nthe Provincial Government to carry out some of its program of  \ndevelopment. The price suggested was $1.00 per acre in view  \nof the fact that the land was to be used for public purposes.\nand it was stated that the Hudson's Bay Co. were prepared to relinquish part of their property on these terms. We felt unwilling to do anything which would in any way interfere with the interests of our school, but declared that in principle we were prepared to co-operate with any plans for the good of the community provided our own interests were safeguarded. We were uncertain as to the ownership of this particular property and have been in communication with the Land Titles Offices in Regina and Prince Albert and also with the Diocese of Saskatchewan, as one of our early missions was established at this point and it seemed probable that the Church had been in possession of the land for a considerable time. I now have, through your kindness, a copy of the Order in Council, PC689 dated May 4th, 1925, in which lots 12 and 9 were transferred to the control of the Dept. of Indian Affairs. We are suggesting to Mr. Phelps that, from this point, he should negotiate with you in regard to this whole question.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of the settlement showing the location of lots 12 and 9. On a recent visit to Lac la Ronge, I learned that the Hudson's Bay Co. possesses lot 13 and that the land desired over-laps that lot and the western portion of lot 12 on which the school is situated. I found that the inner portion of lot 12 is of very little value as it largely consists of muskeg and swamp. It would be possible, however, to dispose of part of the bush area nearest to lot 13 without jeopardizing our interests in any way.\n\n(3) Road: The attached rough plan, copied from a sketch sent by the Principal, will illustrate the road question which has also been raised. In this connection, I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Principal Fisher dated January 16th, 1946. It is strange that a road could have been surveyed in this manner but I take it that the desire was to go up to higher ground as at times the lake has risen considerably and a road nearer the shore might be affected. You will note that the trail continually used at present by the trucks which frequently go to and from the fish filleting plant passes through the middle of the boys' playground and then between some of the school buildings. Mr. Phelps has held out the prospect of a new survey and an alternative road passing between the church and the lake and then continuing between the school garden and the shore as indicated. This would be probably more expensive, as a certain amount of filling would be necessary at the corner of the school garden where a well is situated. There is, however, an abundant supply of rock lying around the shore for this purpose. In consideration of having the road constructed in this manner, we would certainly be prepared to recommend that some portion of the land might be turned over as requested.\n\n(4) Day School: It will be recalled that the small building shown on the plan east of the Principal's residence was constructed in the first place for hospital purposes. The Dep-\nartment made a grant of a few hundred dollars at the time and our Commission has spent a good deal more from time to time. It was not found practicable to operate a hospital and for a number of years we have operated a day-school. The Provincial Government gave a grant of about $500.00 a year and we employed an additional teacher who had charge of this day-school for non-treaty and white children in the community. She also gave some service in the school as a member of the staff. The new Provincial Government took this school over entirely and has rented the building from us. We had enlarged it to take two classes and there are now two teachers. The school is being administered by a local Board and we are receiving a rental for the property. The Director of Northern Education, Mr. A. Piercy, is now pressing us to sell this building and about an acre of land around it for playground purposes. He has ambitious plans for building a large day-school, possibly with three rooms, but for the present desires to take over the present building and enlarge it. We have pointed out that we are not in a position to sell this building as the Indian Department has an equity in it. On the other hand, our Principal has suggested that it will be necessary for us to operate a third class-room for day pupils, as a number of treaty families are likely to move into the settlement by reason of developments taking place. He has suggested that we might agree to sell the building and construct a new class-room with the proceeds.\n\nThese various matters have been rather perplexing to us and we are not very happy at the whole situation, as our experience suggests that an Indian boarding school is better in a quiet place than in a developing community. We have been informed that the Provincial authorities plan to develop Lac la Ronge for tourist purposes by reason of the good fishing, that they intend to build a large boarding school for non-treaty children and also a hospital, and that our land is really required for these purposes.\n\nI trust that these matters have been clearly outlined and shall be happy to supply any additional information to enable decisions to be reached.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 23, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Phelps:\n\nI regret the delay that has occurred in replying to your letter of March 6th, in which you discuss the advisability of purchasing or renting the sawmill located at the Lac la Ronge residential school.\n\nThe records here indicate that this sawmill was not purchased from Parliamentary appropriations and is consequently the property of the Church authorities, probably the property of the M.S.C.C. Any agreement, therefore, that may be reached between your department and the Church authorities for either the purchase of this sawmill or its use on a rental basis will be satisfactory to this department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Honourable J. L. Phelps,\nMinister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, March 22, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to certain matters affecting the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Director has written to the Minister of Natural Resources for Saskatchewan to the effect that our records indicate that the sawmill at the Lac la Ronge School was not purchased from Parliamentary Appropriation and consequently can be considered the property of the Church Authorities. It is therefore in order for you to make whatever arrangements you desire for the sale of this sawmill to the Saskatchewan Government.\n\nI have also discussed with Mr. Hoey the question of the road. He feels that it would be advisable for the M.S.C.C. to have someone go to Lac la Ronge in connection with these various matters. While proceeding there, your representative could call at the Saskatchewan Government offices and discuss the matter with the Minister. At the same time, your representative could call on our Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. Ostrander, whose headquarters are in Regina. In making the above suggestion, we feel that it will save both time and effort to have personal interviews.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A.

We shall accordingly advise the Saskatchewan Government in regard to this.\n\nI fully agree that the method of personal conference is advisable in regard to the other property questions that have been raised. You will recall that I made a special visit to Lac la Ronge at the beginning of February and my personal recommendations have already been made to you. As the property is in the name of the Crown I felt that I was not in a position to negotiate further with the Provincial Government. It is not easy for me to visit Regina at present but I may be able to do so about the middle of next month when I plan to visit our schools in the Calgary area. I am a little afraid that the Hon. Mr. Phelps will desire action earlier than this as the season appears to be advanced and work at Lac la Ronge may be possible in the near future. I shall communicate with Mr. Phelps and endeavour to arrive at some definite conclusions with him.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time past we have been negotiating with the Indian and Eskimo Residential School at Lac la Ronge, as well as the Hudson Bay Company in an effort to secure portions of the lots in that settlement to use in the expansion programme of this Department. The Government contemplates considerable development work in this area in the near future, which will require additional properties.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company have offered to turn over to the Department a substantial block of the land held by them in this particular area. When it came to dealing with the Residential School, Mr. Fisher, the Principal was quite willing to exceed our request, as he felt they had a great deal more land than they would ever require for their own use. However, when the matter was investigated it was discovered that Lots 12 and 9, comprising 76.7 and 8.10 acres respectively, were transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs by Order-in-Council on May 4th, 1925.\n\nWe would, therefore, appreciate having your Department transfer back to us, providing the Residential School is agreeable, approximately 50 acres contained in the above mentioned lots. Please be assured that we are quite prepared to allow the School to retain the area in Lot 12 required for the maintenance of their Institution.\n\nWe will have our Surveyors go in and make the necessary new surveys, which would include changing the location of the present road, which by the way passes through the center of the school property; in fact some of their main buildings are built on the road survey. However, the Department is quite prepared to have a road diversion constructed and bear the cost of same.\n\nYour early reply in this regard would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. L. Phelps,\nMinister of Natural Resources & Industrial Development.\nOttawa, April 1, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nToday we received a letter from Honourable J. L. Phelps, Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development for the Province of Saskatchewan, requesting us to transfer to the Provincial Department approximately 50 acres of the land contained in Lots 12 and 9, the present site of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. His letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Please be assured that we are quite prepared to allow the School to retain the area in Lot 12 required for the maintenance of their Institution.\n\n\"We will have our Surveyors go in and make the necessary new surveys, which would include changing the location of the present road, which by the way passes through the center of the school property; in fact some of their main buildings are built on the road survey. However, the Department is quite prepared to have a road diversion constructed and bear the cost of same.\"\n\nI discussed Mr. Phelps' letter with Mr. Hoey this afternoon and he suggested that I write to you immediately and ascertain your views in the matter. It appears, from your letter of March 16, that you might not be opposed to transferring to the Provincial Government the land that they desire.\n\nIf 50 acres were transferred, it would only leave approximately 25 acres for school purposes. Possibly this is enough in that section of the country. In the event of your consenting to our transferring the land, would it be advisable\n\nReverend H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential\nSchool Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\n..... to request\nto request the Provincial Government to fence the remaining property? I am not certain that they would do so, but we could try if you thought it would be of any benefit to the school.\n\nAn immediate reply would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your 132-2-9 of the first and have read with interest the letter quoted from the honourable J. L. Phelps of Saskatchewan.\n\nOur Commission will be agreeable to the transfer of a substantial portion of the school property but before agreeing to disposing of fifty acres I feel we should have the assurance of our Principal that the interests of the Residential School will be safe-guarded. From the plan which I sent you on March 16th, you will observe that lots 12 and 9 comprise eighty-five acres in all. However, the inland portion of lots 12 consists of muskeg of very doubtful value. It was in my mind that the Provincial Government desired probably twenty-five acres adjoining lot 13. Unless they are prepared to accept the area which we have described as muskeg it is plain that they will have to take portions on both sides of the school and this may hem us in considerably. It was estimated by our Principal that possibly one-third of the section of lot 12 on which the school stands was really unfit for use. You will understand, therefore, my hesitation to give an unqualified agreement to the transfer of so much ground.\n\nWould it be sufficient for the present to give tentative approval of the proposal but with the reservation that the surveyors should give the Principal full information and that his agreement should be necessary before the final decision is made and the fencing of the school property on the new basis is undertaken. Only when the survey has been made and the extent of what will be left to the school is clearly known would it be possible to say definitely that we are satisfied. We can communicate with the school by telegraph and there need be no delay at all in reaching the final decision. I certainly feel that the Provincial Government should be asked to fence off the school property and am confident they can plan the new road in such a manner as to leave us in a stronger position.\n\nI trust that this somewhat uncertain reply may be of some value and that the matter may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 5, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Phelps:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 27, with reference to securing approximately 50 acres of land at Lac la Ronge.\n\nAs you know, Lots 9 and 12 of Lac la Ronge Settlement were transferred to this Department on May 4, 1925, to be used for the purposes of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nWhile we have no desire to impede any new plans that your Department may have at the present time, I feel you will agree that it is my duty to safeguard the interests of our Indian residential schools. Before submitting your proposal to my Minister, I require additional information.\n\nThe Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada operates the Lac la Ronge School for this Department and before definitely agreeing to sell 50 acres of the land intended for the purposes of the school, I believe we should have the assurance of the Principal that the interests of the Residential School will be fully protected.\n\nSome of the land which we own is of little use and possibly this is the portion which you desire to secure. However, it may be possible that you wish the land on both sides of the school and, if so, it might interfere seriously with the successful operation of the school.\n\nI am prepared to recommend to my Minister that\n\nThe Honourable J. L. Phelps,\nMinister of Natural Resources\nand Industrial Development,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\n.... tentative\ntentative approval be given to your proposal but with the reservation that your surveyor should give the Principal full information regarding the portion of the land which you require and that his agreement would be necessary before a final decision is made. There would be a further condition that in the event of our transferring land to you the line fence between your property and ours would be constructed at the cost of the Provincial Government. You might also let me know what price per acre your Department is prepared to pay for this land.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\nBishop\nThe Rt. Rev.

Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing to you on behalf of our Church property at Lac la Ronge. Recently the Provincial Government has been endeavouring to purchase land which really belongs to our Residential School at this point. I also understand that there has been correspondence between our Indian Residential School Commission and the Saskatchewan Government in this matter. In a letter recently received by the Principal of our school at Lac la Ronge, there was a quotation from a letter written by the Honorable, Mr. Phelps. This quotation is really part of a statement received from your Branch by our Commission, and it reads in part:\n\n\"I have now through your kindness a copy of the Order in Council, PC689 dated May 4th, 1925, in which lots 12 and 9, were transferred to the control of the Department of Indian Affairs.\"\n\nMy reason in writing to you is that our Church and mission house both stand on lot 12, and I am anxious that this particular piece of land should be safe-guarded for our Church. It is my understanding that some years ago our Indian Residential School Commission handed over to the Diocese of Saskatchewan this Church site. In view of the above information, I am anxious to know what steps, if any, I should take on behalf of this Diocese to make sure that our interest will be properly safeguarded in the future. It is most apparent that the present Provincial Government is most active in our north country, and they have many schemes on foot. Lac la Ronge in particular seems to be one of their main points of activity, hence my anxiety.\n\nSorry to bother you but I know you will help me with your sagacious advice. With kindest regards,\n\nI am, faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBP/1\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have laid the whole matter fully before the Director after making a special visit to Lac la Ronge to gain first-hand information. I have now received a letter from Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, suggesting a visit to your city to talk the matter over with the Hon. J.L. Phelps, and also with yourself. I have also just heard from our Principal, the Rev. G.W. Fisher, to the effect that Indian Agent Jones has been spending a few days at the school and is sending a report to you.\n\nI may say that the Provincial Government commenced by asking us to sell part of Lot 12 on which the school is located as they wished to carry out various developments. The offer was made to give us equivalent land elsewhere by way of exchange. After considerable difficulty we have found that the land is not ours to sell, as it was formally transferred to the Indian Affairs Department in 1925. I, therefore, turned the question over to the Director with an expression of opinion that we could readily part with the western portion of Lot 12 without any injury to the interests of the school.\n\nA further question concerns the Day School building which has been regarded as the property of the Church and for which the Director of Northern Education, Mr. Pierce, of Prince Albert, has offered us the sum of $500.00. He also desired an acre or so of ground around it for playground purposes. We have, of course, nothing to say about the sale of the land but apparently the building is mainly the property of the Church, although an initial grant of $200.00 was made by the Indian Department at a time when a small infirmary was contemplated. We have operated a day school in the building, with the Provincial Government giving a grant which fluctuated in value but never covered the cost. Under the new Government a local board has been set up and the Day School is now being administered\n\nProvincially with a rental of $20.00...\nProvincially with a rental of $20.00 now being paid to us. In principle, we are prepared to sell this building but believe the price should be at least $1,000.00 in view of the cost of construction. If the building should be sold we can see no difficulty in recommending to the Indian Department that a small portion of land should also be disposed of as our school interests would not in any way be affected.\n\nThe third matter concerns a sawmill which is the property of the Church but at the present time is rented to the Provincial Government. The Hon. J.L. Phelps wrote to Ottawa on March 6th offering to buy this mill and the matter has been referred back to us as the Department is aware that it is our property. I have already informed Mr. Phelan that the Church is prepared to sell this mill at a fair price, but Principal Fisher's letter now suggests that your Department may wish to obtain possession of the mill for the benefit of the Indians. He said that Agent Jones would be writing to you in regard to this. There is a further question concerning a road. At present a road has been surveyed which cuts through our property and would represent a very serious difficulty and hazard if it should be constructed. Mr. Phelps has been giving consideration to a new survey which would carry the road along the Lake front to the Fish Plant which has been established. If this is done it will be possible to fence our school property and prevent trucks travelling through the children's playground and some of the buildings as is the case at the present time.\n\nI trust that I have made this tangled matter reasonably clear and venture to suggest that you may be able to confer with the Hon. J.L. Phelps after receiving your report from Agent Jones. It is quite out of the question for me to leave the city for some time to come and I know that the Provincial Government is most anxious to proceed with its development program at Lac la Ronge at the earliest possible date. I can only reiterate that as far as Church property is concerned we are fully prepared to dispose of what is desired if it will further the plans of the Provincial Government, and if the various items can be disposed of without hurting the interests of our Residential School.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd. H. A. Alderwood,\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have received a letter from Reverend H.A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Missionary Society, Church of England in Canada, in connection with some matters relating to the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge and the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter referred to. Also enclosed is a plan of the Lac la Ronge settlement showing thereon Lot 12 referred to in Dr. Alderwood's letter. School buildings, grounds, and gardens, are situated on both sides of the highway in about the centre of Lot 12.\n\nAs the Department is aware, the present main building of this school is an old building and a fire trap. It should be replaced either by another residential school or a number of day schools at various points now being served by the residential school. If it is replaced by another residential school I believe the site should be changed as the total area held by the school is about 80 acres and most of it poor for farming purposes.\n\nWith this point in consideration, and in view of the fact that there is no other land available immediately surrounding the present buildings, making it impossible to commence farming or to grow sufficient feed for livestock, it will no doubt be necessary to erect the new residential school (if one is erected) at a different site. Consequently I see no reason why negotiations should not be entered into with the Provincial Government with a view to surrendering to them part of Lot 12 with a promise from them to give us an equal or larger acreage at a more suitable point when the decision is made to build a new school.\n\nI have had a discussion with the Honourable J.L. Phelps in this connection and he seems quite willing to co-operate with us in any reasonable manner.\n\nWith regard to that part of Dr. Alderwood's letter which refers to the road it is quite evident that a road will have to be erected somewhere along or near the lake front thereby cutting through the Department property at some point. I do not see how this can be avoided.\n\nReferring to that part.......\nReferring to that part of Dr. Alderwood's letter which refers to the sawmill, I have already written the Department in this connection, my letter of the 1st instant, No. 499-303-4A. Please instruct me regarding further negotiations with the Provincial Government authorities in connection with the matters referred to herein.\n\nJ.P.B.

Boiler (Twin Units), one Brantford log carriage and\none Planer.\n\nThe Rev. George Fisher stated that to the best of his knowledge\nthis equipment was purchased for the late Archdeacon McKay out of money\nappropriated by the Department to build the present Indian Residential School\nat Lac la Ronge, for the purpose of sawing lumber for the school.\n\nSince that time the mill has been used for sawing lumber for the\nIndians, and some lumber has been sawn for outsiders, including the Hudson's\nBay Company, (when building their new warehouse in 1941). The following\namounts of lumber were put through the mill, as mentioned above, during the\npast five years as taken from the Mill books:\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1940 | 56,196 feet. |\n| 1941 | 47,940 feet. |\n| 1942 | 18,000 feet. |\n| 1943 | 30,725 feet. |\n| 1944 | 71,000 feet. |\n\nIn 1945 Mr. Fisher rented the outfit to officials of the Provincial\nGovernment at the following rates: $1.50 per hour for the use of the mill and\n$.75\u00a2 per hour for the use of the planer.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a complete statement covering this transaction\nwhich was prepared by officials of the Provincial Government at Lac la Ronge.\nYou will note that all repairs, replacements and time used to clean up the\nsite was deducted from the rental dues outlined above for the use of the equip-\nment.\n\nI feel that the mill has served the Indians well, and can continue\nto do so for many years to come, consequently Mr. Fisher and myself do not favour\nselling the mill. The matter was also taken up with the Indians, they are also\nof the same opinion. I find some of the Indians did have lumber sawn in 1945,\nand also found two Indians who took in logs amounting to approximately 4,000 feet,\nwho lost their logs, lumber, and all. However, I have hopes of straightening this\nout.\n\nSgd. E.S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/ae\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Fisher advised us that as far as he personally is concerned, any contract entered into would be satisfactory providing sufficient land is left to maintain the school and grounds in their present location as he does not feel there will be any need for further expansion at that point; and also providing the road survey is changed to its proposed new location.

Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your 132-2-9 of the 13th and am glad to know the present position of this matter.\n\nWe have just received word from our Principal that Mr. C. Piercy, Director of Northern Education for the Provincial Government, has again been in Lac la Ronge and is most anxious to secure possession of the day-school building and the land on which it stands. Our Commission has now agreed to sell this building for $500 but have pointed out that we have nothing to do with the land. I believe the plan which I sent you showed that the day-school building is east of our school and, in our judgment, this strip of land could be transferred.\n\nMr. Fisher advises us, however, of a further difficulty concerning the sawmill which stands on this strip of land near to the lake. We were quite willing to sell this and to divest ourselves of all responsibility for it. However, our Principal informs us that Indian Agent Jones, on a recent visit, was rather opposed to this suggestion and felt that it would be well to retain possession of the sawmill as the Indians have always had a good deal of benefit from it and there might be a good deal of new building in the near future. If we are to retain possession, it would seem to be advisable that the land on which the mill stands should not be transferred to the Provincial Government.\n\nOur Principal raises the further question in regard to the land between our school and the Hudson's Bay Company property. There is a supply of wood on this which he would like to cut for school purposes and expresses the hope that in any agreement this may be provided for.\nI trust that these tangled matters may soon be settled to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 6 and other correspondence in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter dated April 12 from the Honourable J. L. Phelps. I also enclose a copy of a letter just received from Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C.\n\nI again discussed the whole situation at Lac la Ronge with the Director yesterday afternoon, and it would be appreciated if you would again interview Honourable Mr. Phelps and endeavour to finalize the matter.\n\nThe Director is prepared to recommend to the Minister the transfer of the land required by the Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development for the Province of Saskatchewan, provided mutually satisfactory arrangements can be completed between the Provincial Department and the Principal of the Lac la Ronge School. You will note from the third paragraph of Mr. Phelps' letter that he is anxious to meet the Principal's wishes as far as possible.\n\nI have noted Indian Agent Jones' letter to you of March 28, but we cannot find any record here indicating that the sawmill was purchased from parliamentary appropriation. We therefore presume that it is the property of the Church authorities and they can dispose of it as they see fit. What has\nbeen said regarding the sawmill pertains also to the day school building mentioned in the second paragraph of Dr. Alderwood's letter. I am also forwarding with this letter the plan to which Dr. Alderwood refers. With the information contained in this letter we are hoping that you can obtain a definite proposal from the Provincial Minister, which Mr. Hoey can submit to our Minister.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nApril 30th, 1946.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of April 16th regarding the transfer of part of our school lands to the Saskatchewan Government. This letter did not reach me until yesterday due to the curtailment of air-mail service on account of seasonal ice conditions. Hence I could not reply sooner.\n\nBoth the Indian Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C., and myself have been quite willing to transfer part of our school lands to the Provincial Government for its development projects, so long as an adequate amount of land is left for our own use. But we have not been satisfied with the price offered. It is true that the H.B. Co. is willing to accept $1.00 per acre for the land it transfers, but it should be remembered that the Company has an ulterior motive in wishing to keep the settlement as near as possible to its store. We have no such motive. In fact the coming of the settlement will add to our school problems.\n\nSince the land would appear to be at the disposition of the Indian Affairs Branch, it would appear that the Department would have the final word in this matter. As I am working under the direction of the Indian Residential School Commission as it affects us, the Commission would have to give approval as far the School is concerned. I am, therefore, writing to Dr. Alderwood asking him to write you again on this matter.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, May 11, 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 26th ultimo, in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nMay 17th, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Property at Lac la Ronze\n\nIn further reference to your 132-2-9 of April 13th we have now heard from Principal Fisher in regard to the land desired by the Provincial Government. Unfortunately, Mr. Fisher's reply has been greatly delayed through mailing difficulties and even now is somewhat inconclusive. He really does not answer the specific question as to how much ground can be disposed of without hurting his own school. Possibly the exact line can only really be drawn when the surveyors are on the spot.\n\nI take it that your Department will not be greatly concerned about the price to be charged for the land. Possibly you have already given the necessary agreement to the Saskatchewan Government in view of Mr. Fisher's reply direct.\n\nI trust to be in Ottawa shortly, possibly on the 27th, and shall look forward to the opportunity of discussing this and other matters with you then.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood,\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, No. 132-2-9, enclosing copy of a letter the Department has received from Reverend G.W. Fisher, Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, with particular reference to the transfer of part of the school lands to the Provincial Government.\n\nI may say that following the receipt of Department letter of the 26th ultimo, No. 132-2-9, I discussed with Honourable J.L. Phelps the matters under consideration. Mr. Phelps informed me that he is not certain that the Provincial Government will now require the land as he is awaiting the report of his town planner after he makes a survey of conditions at the present Lac la Ronge Village to decide on the possibilities of development on the present site surrounding the residential school. Mr. Phelps states it is possible that a decision will be made to move the town site to another point on the shore of the lake.\n\nIf Mr. Phelps decides to make formal application for part of the Indian school lands the question of the value of the lands to be transferred could then be discussed. While I believe that $1.00 per acre, which the Hudson's Bay Company is willing to accept, is very low, I do not think that a very high price should be set even though it may eventually be in a town site. I am reasonably certain that the town site will not be established on the land surrounding the Lac la Ronge Residential School unless our Department first consents to relinquish a part of the school lands to the Provincial Government. If the Provincial Government is not assured of part of the school lands there is no doubt that they will decide to establish the town at another point on the lake shore. As previously stated, there is some possibility of this being done even if the Provincial Government is assured of the transfer of part of our land. I shall write the Department further after I have heard further from the Honourable J.L. Phelps in the matter.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nJuly 19, 1946.\n\nHon. J. L. Phelps,\nMinister of Natural Resources\nand Industrial Development,\nProvince of Saskatchewan,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your survey presently under way at Lac la Ronge I am including in this letter extracts from a memorandum received from our Principal at the Anglican Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge.\n\n\"With further reference to the pending land surrender to the Saskatchewan Government, I would report that a preliminary survey is now being made, and it would appear to me that this survey is being made without much consideration being given to ourselves.\n\n\"Yesterday I was talking with the young man who is making this survey, and from what he told me, and what I could see of his operations, their plans call for the road passing between the Church and the School, and after making a slight turn, through our garden parallel to the school building.\n\n\"I pointed out that if they take much of our garden, we will not have very much worth-while left. It was suggested that possibly Government machinery could move the good soil to another place. But as I pointed out unless a considerable amount of work was done, the rest of our land was unsuitable for a garden.\n\n\"Later I saw the head of the surveying party, and tried to get more definite information as to what was going to be done. His attitude seemed to be that the land was Government property, (and while he did not say this) you in Winnipeg did not need to be considered. I hope I am wrong in this opinion. He did emphasize that this was but a preliminary survey, and that I should not be unduly worried.\"\n\"about things; and that our needs would be considered, but I do know that the suggested route of the road fits in very well with the present plans for the townsite, and that in the eyes of some of the people of Lac la Ronge our needs and prior rights do not matter.\"\n\nAs our Principal seems somewhat alarmed, unduly we hope, may we ask that you give consideration to our position at Lac la Ronge and protect our interests as you outlined in your letter to Mr. Hoey, written April 12th, 1946.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJCHF/DH\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nDominion Government,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nRe: Property at Lac la Ronze.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing a copy of our letter to Mr. Phelps, Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development in Saskatchewan. We hope Mr. Phelps, in view of the considerations outlined in his letter to Mr. Hoey, will extend full co-operation to Mr. Fisher. If we hear anything further on this matter we will keep you advised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of May 20th, File 790-303-11 AGE, I have just returned from a visit to the Lac la Ronge School. While at the school I went over the property accompanied by Mr. Bereskin, of the Surveys Branch of the Department of Natural Resources.\n\nNo good purpose would be served in continuing to hold the school property referred to in the plan as Lot 13 and containing approximately 76 acres. The whole of this property is either solid rock or muskeg and it would be a great mistake to ever consider building another school on the property. I therefore told Mr. Bereskin to proceed with the subdivision of all but 7 acres into town lots. The survey will be at the expense of the Department of Natural Resources. The 7 acres referred to contain all of the Department buildings, playgrounds, and garden. The garden is 2\u00bd acres which was made useful by hauling soil as there was no soil in which to have a garden.\n\nI would recommend that the school property, with the exception of the 7 acres, be sold to the Provincial Government at $1.00 an acre with the understanding that the 7 acres, including 2\u00bd acres of garden, will not be disturbed until it is possible to erect a suitable residential school in another year or two.\n\nArrangements might be made with the Department of Natural Resources to exchange with us a suitable area for a school at another point and they have agreed to do this. However, I have gone over the possible school sites in that area and I do not think that there is anything suitable for our purpose. As the surveyors are nearly finished with the work which they had, and were anxious to proceed with subdivision of the school property into town lots, I gave the surveyor permission to proceed with the survey. I trust that my action in this connection will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI have given a great deal of thought to the matter of erecting another residential school to replace the present one at Lac la Ronge. This building should be a fire-proof building and should be situated on a fairly large acreage of good arable land with a good water supply. The Department is aware that the present Lac la Ronge School Building is a fire-trap and no money should be spent on it other than to meet immediate needs. I have instructed Indian Agent E.S. Jones to prepare a requisition covering the cost of installing two more fire escapes and submit it through this office. The interior of the building is badly in need of painting but there is a large supply of paint on hand at the school which will be sufficient to do most of the interior decorating and arrangements will be made shortly to have this done.\n\nMr. Wickenden, the new Principal, is an active and very conscientious man, and I believe he will make a successful school principal. Most of the school staff are new and I spent some time with them explaining their duties and the attitude which they should have toward the Indian children under their care.\n\nI believe that serious consideration should be given by the Department before arriving at a decision as to the location of the new residential school when one is to be built. The Lac la Ronge School and the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert are both under the auspices of the Church of England and under the management of the Indian and Eskimo Commission. I would suggest that it would be better to build...\nbe better to build one large residential school to take the place of the two. Both are poor buildings and both need replacing. Neither of the schools has sufficient playground space or land for gardening and farming. There is a large acreage of unused land on the Little Red River Reserve, not far from the main highway, which is nearly completed between Prince Albert and Lac la Ronge. A large school somewhere on the Little Red River Reserve would serve the whole area so far as Anglican children are concerned. I believe it will always be necessary to have a residential school for the majority of Indian children of the Lac la Ronge area and many of the children from the reserves of the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies. Unless the Department has decided to build no more residential schools I would recommend that consideration be given to my proposal that one large school be erected to take the place of the two when materials are available.\n\nI would be glad to have the Department's comments in this connection and I shall be pleased to furnish any further information which may seem desirable.\n\nJ.P.B.

This survey should give detailed information regarding the land which they wish us to transfer to them so that we can prepare the necessary documents.\n\nIt is noted from the fourth paragraph of your letter that the Department of Natural Resources in the Province of Saskatchewan would provide a suitable area at another point if we decide to erect a new school. Would it be possible for you to secure an official letter from the Department of Natural Resources outlining their policy in this regard? Is it understood that the Department of Natural Resources, Province of Saskatchewan, would only allow $1.00 an acre for the land that we are supplying to them? We would like a definite reply to this question as definite information must be included in any documents which we prepare.\n\nWe have also noted your remarks regarding the possible location for a new school to replace the present Lac la Ronge School.

This area will comprise about 7 acres and temporary markers have already been set. As the survey party has completed the work in the adjoining lots and has returned to Regina we would appreciate your confirmation that the balance of the lot will be sold to the Department before incurring the expense of surveys of the portion to be retained by the school.\n\nThe survey party has already subdivided two blocks of land in the Lot 12 and it is therefore suggested that the transfer of land be effected in two stages; first a transfer of the westerly 850 feet in width and finally a transfer of the balance excepting thereout the portion to be retained by the school and church. The land already subdivided consists of scrub, rock and muskeg and is of no value to the school either present or potential. A price of $1.00 per acre for this area is considered to be a reasonable one. A legal description for the purpose of effecting transfer is as follows:\n\nAll that portion of Lot 12 according to the Dominion Government Survey of La Ronge settlement, in Saskatchewan, as shown on a plan of survey approved and confirmed at Ottawa, on 23rd May, 1923 and contained within the following limits:\nOn the West by the westerly limit of said lot;\nOn the South by the southerly limit of said lot;\nOn the East by a line drawn northerly from and at right angles to the said northerly limit from a point distant 850 feet easterly thereon from the North West corner of said lot to the intersection with the bank of Lac la Ronge;\nOn the South by the bank of Lac la Ronge;\nThe portion above described containing 28.4 acres, more or less.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is suggested that the area granted should not exceed 76.7 acres, the area of the present holding.\nAs indicated in the attached letter it is suggested that immediate action be taken to dispose of the westerly 28.4 acres not required for school or church.

It is likely that you will receive then a letter from Mr. Phelps concerning the sale of the additional land.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Phelps:\n\nWith reference to your telegram addressed to me at Ottawa, and your letter of the 14th instant in connection with the remainder of the land held by our Branch at Lac la Ronge, and on which the recently burned school was situated, I discussed the matter with the necessary authorities while in Ottawa and I believe that there is no doubt that this land will be transferred to the province at a valuation decided upon in due course.\n\nHowever, our Branch still has some buildings on the land and I believe some school equipment which was not totally destroyed. These matters will have to be cleared up and a satisfactory arrangement arrived at with the Church Authorities before the transfer can be made. Consequently there may be some delay. However, you may rest assured that the desire of your Department will be given full consideration before any action is taken about the property.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of your letter and a copy of this letter to Ottawa in order that the matter may be given due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

Now that the school has been destroyed by fire, you may wish to abandon the site for a more suitable one elsewhere.\n\nIf you desire to rebuild this school on a new location we would be quite prepared to negotiate with you with a view to exchanging this land for property which might suit your purpose to better advantage. In the event you desire to dispose of the buildings, which still remain on the site, we would also be prepared to negotiate for their transfer.\n\nWe are at the moment considering plans for expansion in that area for the coming year and, while we do not wish to rush you unnecessarily, we would ask that, in the event of you desiring to make any disposition of this property, we be given first opportunity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.

Neary, Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nRe: Lac La Ronge School Site\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of March 10th and may say that I had the opportunity of discussing this question yesterday with Mr. Phelan. I plan to leave tonight for a visit to several schools but scarcely feel able to go as far as Lac La Ronge. There are many questions relating to the situation which I cannot answer satisfactorily but I expect to see Mr. Fisher at Sioux Lookout, who was for 17 years the principal at Lac La Ronge. I shall also see Mr. Wickenden at the Gordon's School and believe that he can make many matters plain. I have left with Mr. Phelan a copy of the letter from the Secretary of the Indian Department in regard to the building of the principal's residence. From the rest of the correspondence it is evident that this structure was put up by our Commission with the assistance of a grant of $2,500.00 from the Department. Dr. Percy E. Moore has advised me that he desires to obtain this building for use as a nursing station and we shall see that no disposal is made of it until the question of ownership is settled.\n\nI note that the Minister of Natural Resources of the Provincial Government desires to take over the land on which the school stood and may say that local officials of the province have been endeavouring to purchase other buildings on the site. I trust that the offer of Mr. Phelps to place other property at the disposal of the Indian Affairs Branch in exchange for this site may be favourably considered. Our principal has urged strongly that the new school should be constructed somewhere on the south shore of the lake where it would be removed from the harmful influences of the present settlement but would be within reach of the new road recently constructed.\nIt is my hope that I may see Inspector Ostrander in Regina and I should be in a position to discuss various matters more intelligently after my return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, March 15, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

No doubt this can be corrected and I would ask that steps be taken to do so, as apparently the Provincial Government is delaying payment of the nominal sale value of the land at $1.00 per acre until the matter of title is cleared up.\n\nJ.

The transfer of the Natural Resources Agreement of March 20th, 1930 provided (Para. 10) that Indian Reserves should continue to be vested in the Crown Dominion.

Your letter 132-2-9 (R3) dated March 24, 1937, refers.\n\nThe Registrar at Prince Albert Land Registration District advises that a grant for the land transferred to the province is necessary before the plan of survey can be registered. P.C. 21 in itself is not sufficient on which to issue certificate of title to the province.\n\nAs there are a number of transactions pending in regard to the lots subdivided by this Department it would be appreciated if a grant is issued and forwarded direct to the Registrar, Land Registration District, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nYour early attention would be appreciated as there are a number of transfers of lots held in abeyance until plan of survey is registered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Bereskin,\nController of Surveys.\nOttawa, October 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 11th, your file 14, with reference to the transfer of part of Lot 12, Lac la Ronge Settlement, made to your Department by P.C. 21 of 3rd January, 1947; and we are indeed surprised to learn that the Registrar at Prince Albert has stated that the Order in Council is not sufficient on which to issue a Certificate of Title and requires a grant of the land.\n\nIn so far as our records indicate, all transfers of this nature, which have been made since the Natural Resources were turned over to the provinces, have been by way of Order in Council and when the very point at issue was considered by the Law Officers of the Crown Dominion some years ago, they expressed the opinion that an Order in Council is the proper and only mode of conveying lands or any interest therein from one Government to another. As Mr. Justice Newcombe pointed out in the Saskatchewan Natural Resources Reference Case 1931, 1 DLR 855 \"There is only one Crown and the lands belonging to the Crown are and remain vested in it notwithstanding that administration of them and the exercise of their beneficial use may, from time to time, as competently authorized, be regulated upon the advice of different ministers charged with the appropriate service\".\n\nIn short, the Crown is one and indivisible and it is merely the beneficial use that is transferred from the Dominion to a Province or vice versa, the title at all times remaining in the Crown.\n\nA. I. Bereskin, Esq.,\nController of Surveys,\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Industrial Development,\nNatural Resources Bldg.,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nAs stated previously, we are of the opinion that a transfer by Order in Council is the only method which could be followed by this Department as regards the Lac la Ronge land and as such transfer follows similar transfers made since the Natural Resources Agreement, it would seem apparent that on the matter again being brought to the attention of the Registrar, he will accept the Order in Council as a sufficient basis for the issue of a Certificate of Title to the Province.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

You will probably recall that last year this Department purchased a 28.4 acre portion of the lot at a nominal rate of $1.00 per acre.\n\nYour plans for re-establishing the La Ronge Indian School, destroyed by fire last year, may not have been finalized but the proposal herein made appears flexible enough so that in the event your Department decides to rebuild the school it will have reserved ample land for school, playing field, teacherage, etc.\n\nIt is, therefore, suggested that the 48.3 acre remainder of lot 12 be transferred to this Department at a nominal rate of $1.00 per acre. We will then extend the townsite survey and subdivide the land into town lots and survey a four acre parcel for your school and hospital site, teacherage, church and apurtenant buildings. We will absorb costs of making a legal survey and transfer back to your Department land required for the school, etc. and land at present occupied by teacherage and church.\n\nIt might appear that your Department is receiving a small acreage of surveyed land in return. Actually much of the 48.3 acres is muskeg and the portion conveyed back would be a good part of the land suitable for settlement. As costs of survey borne by this Department will be about $500.00 the proposal seems an equitable one to all concerned.\n\n...........\nShould you decide to definitely abandon La Ronge for the site of a new Indian Residential School suitable provincial land could be exchanged for the area vacated in line with the Minister's earlier letter to the Honourable J. A. Glen.\n\nI would respectfully urge that a survey be made. As it stands at present part of the road allowance surveyed by the Dominion Government in 1920 is occupied by some of the school outbuildings and sheds and the present trail from La Ronge Avenue in the Townsite meanders across your lot. The Department would like to improve the road leading to its Fish Filleting plant but cannot legally do so until right to the land is secured or approval granted for a roadway across the balance of your lot. Due to the completion of the Highway, La Ronge is becoming an increasingly popular tourist attraction and therefore this bad stretch of road should be improved.\n\nAs there is some urgency in this matter a reply at your earliest convenience would be appreciated. An air photo of La Ronge showing nature of the ground is attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. A. I. Bereskin,\n\nA. I. Bereskin,\nController of Surveys.\n\nAIB/MH\nEncl. 1 photo.\n| For your attention and necessary action |   |\n|----------------------------------------|--|\n| For preparation of reply                | X |\n| For suggested reply                     |   |\n| For your comments                       |   |\n| For noting and return                   |   |\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 16, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hogg:\n\nRe: La Ronge Townsite\n\nThe letter of November 14, 1947, from Mr. Bereskin, your Controller of Surveys, is acknowledged and the delay in reaching a decision in the matter is regretted.\n\nWe note your request for a conveyance of the balance of Lot L2 to your Department in order that you may be enabled to proceed with the survey of an extension of the townsite.\n\nPlease be advised that the question of rebuilding the residential school at Lac la Ronge destroyed by fire last February has not yet been decided between this Branch and the Anglican Church which is jointly interested with us in the matter. It would appear, however, that if the school is eventually rebuilt in the La Ronge district, the old site would not be entirely suitable for our purposes and that of the Church.\n\nIt is noted, however, that you undertake to reserve for the departmental use of this Department a four-acre parcel from the lands surveyed to be held for our use for school, hospital, church, teachersage and appurtenant buildings, which we interpret as meaning for any purpose in connection with the administrative requirements of this Department.\n\nIf you could add to that assurance, an assurance that, in the event of the residential school being rebuilt, you will cooperate with us in the selection\n\nC.

MacKinnon,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon:\n\nReference letter from your Department dated 8 April, 1948, expressing concurrence to having the matter of road alignment at La Ronge settled by our respective representatives.\n\nThe road diversion has now been completed across the corner of the garden to the mutual satisfaction, I believe of our representatives. As tourists from as far south as Florida visit La Ronge the road improvement has eliminated a source of complaint which partly nullified the good work of our respective governments in tourist promotion.\n\nAs La Ronge is growing rapidly we are now faced with the problem of expanding the townsite. All the suitable land has been subdivided and about 75% of the lots taken up. There is a good possibility that the recent uranium find 35 miles from La Ronge should it develop into a mine, will accelerate growth of La Ronge.\n\nIn order to prevent a shanty town springing up on the outskirts of the present townsite, which has been laid out in accordance with community planning principles, it is suggested that the 48.3 acres now held by your Department be sold to the province. To protect your interest following proposed is made.\n\n1. The Federal government sell to the province the 48.3 acre parcel at the nominal rate of $1. per acre as was previously done in sale of your 28.4 acre parcel of land to the province.\n\n2. The province will then subdivide the land into town lots and integrate your nursing station, church, cemetery, buildings and grounds into a townsite in accordance with modern town planning principle.\n\n3. The province will bear all costs of survey and then sell and\ntransfer back to the Dominion all your buildings and appurtenant grounds required for your purposes at the same nominal rate of $1. per acre.\n\n4. In addition to the above should you at any time require provincial lands for the purpose of erecting an Indian School or hospital we will transfer such lands, in any area which is mutually agreed upon at the same nominal rate of $1. per acre.\n\nIt is believed that above is a flexible arrangement as it will enable the Dominion to obtain provincial lands for school, hospital or ration store purposes at strategic points in northern Saskatchewan in order to best serve the Indian population.\n\nI might say that only a small part, probably four acres of the 48.3 acres parcel is now in use. The land is not suitable for gardening but most of it is suitable for building lots.\n\nThe proposal has been discussed at executive level among our respective representatives and I believe that they are in general agreement to the above proposal. May I suggest that if the proposal has your general approval that details be settled by our representatives who are familiar with the situation at La Ronge.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. L. Phelps\n\nHon. J. L. Phelps,\nMinister.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAug. 1/46\n\nTo the Deputy Minister:\n\nAttn: Director of Land Development Services\n\n---\n\nAttached is a letter to the Minister dated Aug. 2nd from the Hon. J.L. Phelps, Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development, Regina, Sask., further to correspondence relative to road alignment at La Ronge as arranged between the Federal and Provincial Govts. Mr. Phelps suggests the sale to the Province of some 45 odd acres near the present townsite and the letter sets out certain protective provisions.\n\nThis letter has not been acknowledged as yet. Please have a draft letter prepared to Mr. Phelps for the Minister's signature in this connection.\n\nA.C.L. Adams\nPrivate Secretary\n\nMr. Gibson:\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1948.\n\nThe Honourable the Minister of\nNatural Resources and Industrial Development,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lac La Ronge Townsite\n\nIt is a matter of regret that we are unable to give you a conclusive answer to Mr. Phelps' letter of August 2nd as the Department of National Health and Welfare and our own Schools Administration cannot yet give us specific information as to their land requirements at La Ronge.\n\nAs soon as their respective plans are finally decided, we will be pleased to re-convey any surplus lands in Lot 13 to you subject to the conditions outlined in Mr. Phelps' letter.\n\nI see no reason why we could not now transfer to the Province the land you require for the highway.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJas. A. MacKinnon.\nHon. Paul Joseph Martin,\nMinister, Department of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Martin:\n\nRe: Lot 12\u2014La Ronge\n\nIt is understood that your Department now has control of the 48.3 acre parcel remaining in Lot 12, as is indicated by the attached copy of letter received from Dr. Keenleyside.\n\nDue to the influx of settlers, and the increasing tourist traffic, it has now become absolutely necessary to improve the road in the settlement. The unfavourable reaction and bad publicity due to settlers and tourists having to pass over a rough trail at La Ronge itself after driving 170 miles along one of the best highways in the province would adversely affect our work in promoting this area.\n\nAs shown on the attached sketch, the road could be built along the old road allowance, title to which is held by the Provincial Department of Highways. This would require the removal of many of your buildings which are sited on the road allowance, and as some of them are of good size, it would not be an easy matter to move them.\n\nIt would be preferable, in my opinion, to transfer the old road allowance to your Department, so that your buildings may then be located on Dominion land, in return for which we would be granted the right to extend La Ronge Avenue as shown on the sketch.\nHon. P. J. Martin, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nMarch 10, 1948.\n\nAbout a quarter acre of your garden would be affected in so doing, but we are prepared to pick up the soil with our power equipment, and extend your garden elsewhere so that the area under cultivation would be the same. This would probably be the best solution as the relocated road will be well away from the nursing station so that the patients will be unaffected by noise of traffic.\n\nShould you decide at any time to vacate La Ronge Settlement, and establish a nursing station at some more strategic point away from a growing settlement, we would be glad to exchange an equivalent acreage of suitable provincial land for the 48.3 acre portion now held by your Department at La Ronge. Our object is to expand La Ronge Subdivision to provide more building lots for settlers and campers.\n\nThe matter of exchange of land or transfer, to us, of the portion of your 48.3 acre parcel not required for the nursing station purposes, could be considered at some future date, but our immediate concern is to improve the road sometime within the next two months. It would be appreciated, therefore, if this matter is given early attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Phelps,\nMinister.\n\nAIB/CCS\nAttach.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJanuary 7, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Hogg:\n\nRe: La Ronge Townsite.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated November 14, 1947, from Mr. Bereskin, your Controller of Surveys, requesting a conveyance to your Government of the balance of Lot 12 at Lac la Ronge to enable your Department to proceed with an extension of the survey of the townsite, and regret very much the delay in replying.\n\nIn looking into the matter, however, it has been ascertained that the land in question is occupied by buildings now owned by the Dominion Government as represented by the Minister of National Health and Welfare and that that Department is unwilling that we should part with its ownership.\n\nThe actual facts are that the Department of National Health and Welfare has purchased the old mission buildings which it is remodelling into a nursing station and residence for its employees and for other purposes.

Phelps,\nMinister of Natural Resources\nand Industrial Development,\nProvince of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatchewan Resources Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Phelps:\n\nLot 12 - Lac la Ronge\n\nYour letter of March 16 along with a copy of a letter from Doctor Keenleyside and a sketch of the Lac la Ronge townsite is hereby acknowledged.\n\nThere are several reasons why we are hesitant to approve of your request to place the road allowance as indicated in the accompanying sketch. Field officers of Indian Affairs Branch as well as officers of our own department advise against allowing this road to be put in as requested by your department. It has been stated that a large proportion of the garden would be destroyed and as this is the only garden in the townsite and the earth was brought by canoe by the Indians of the district, it means a great deal to not only the Indians, but is essential in providing fresh gardens for the use of the nursing station.\n\nThe road as proposed by you would pass directly in front of the nursing station and would be a disturbing influence on the patients. At the present time, our sewage disposal lines and water supply pipe run from the nursing station to the lake shore. The road would be built over these lines which might cause difficulties in the future in repairing the lines.\n\nIt is also understood that there is a sawmill on the property owned by the Lac la Ronge Band of Indians and it is understood that the Indian Agent wishes to retain this mill on its present site for the benefit of the Indians.\nAs an alternative, it is suggested that instead of running a road south of the nursing station along the south shore, that you have it constructed north of the nursing station. Instead of crossing the school garden, it should turn left at the corner of Lac la Ronge Avenue and Hastings Street, then proceed to the end of that street. From this point it could be continued at right angles to Hastings Street until it joins the street between blocks 12 and 13. The road would then be back of all the buildings and would in no way create a nuisance or disturb the present arrangements. I am advised that there would be a better view along this road as it would be higher up than down along the lake shore.\n\nThe nursing station, although it is owned and will be managed by Indian Health Services of the Department of National Health and Welfare, will do considerable work for local non-Indian residents of Lac la Ronge. Dr. Moore has made definite arrangements with Dr. Hames, Deputy Minister of Health, Province of Saskatchewan, to supply this service to local residents.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would give this alternative suggestion your earnest consideration with the hope that this proposal will be satisfactory for all concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPaul Martin.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFebruary 16, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLot 12 - Lac la Ronge\n\nFollowing your visit and discussion on this block of land at Lac la Ronge, I have made further enquiries and now find that the title of this land is under the Indian Affairs Branch, Welfare and Training Division.\n\nI have discussed it with Colonel B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Training and he tells me they require part of this land for dormitory purposes for their school. I would, therefore, ask that you get in touch with Mr. Neary regarding your request to this Branch on your recent visit.\n\nThere is a possibility that if the land were surveyed and you were able to forward a description and plan of it to Mr. Neary they might be in a position to allot part of it to you. However, this will be their responsibility and is not the concern of Indian Health Services.\n\nI am sending Mr. Neary a copy of this letter and also the plans that you so kindly left with us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Director, Indian Health Services.\n\nMr. A.I. Siereksin,\nController of Surveys for the Province of Saskatchewan,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore,\nDirector, Medical Services,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Land for expansion of La Ronge Townsite\n\nIt is understood that Mr. A.I. Bereskin of this Department held preliminary discussions with your office on February 1st, in regard to securing more land from the Federal Department whereby La Ronge Townsite might be expanded to provide for present and future needs.\n\nMr. Bereskin has, no doubt, indicated that the need for more building sites is urgent, and that there is no other practicable alternative except expand over the unused acreage held by the Federal Government. So as to avoid an uncontrolled Indian village or squatter settlement springing up in the outskirts of the townsite, with consequent sanitation problems, it was proposed that we survey the Federal Block of 48.3 acres and integrate it into our existing townsite which is laid out along community planning lines.\n\nI am pleased to hear that the proposal has your approval, and that permission has been granted to Mr. Bereskin for the making of a preliminary survey of your land. The preliminary plan will show the location of all your buildings, improvements and appurtenant grounds, and a decision could then be made of the land which is to be retained for your purpose and of the remainder to be transferred to the province.\n\nThe various points discussed and agreed upon, I believe, were as follows:\n\n(1) So as to simplify subsequent land transfer, the Department of Indian Affairs would obtain formal title to the 48.3 acre remainder of Lot 12 if the land is not yet held in the\nname of your Department. We will also make a search in the local Land Titles Office, and if the land is held by the Department of Health and Welfare, we will advise your office.\n\nYou may decide that it is unnecessary to transfer title from one Federal Department to another. We can see no objection to dealing with the present title holders of the land except that your office is more familiar with, and is more directly concerned, than the Department of Health and Welfare. In any event, if the large parcel is in your name, certificates of titles of the various lots required for your nursing station can be readily transferred direct to your Department.\n\n(2) The Surveys Branch of this Department will make a Development Plan showing all your buildings, fences and improvements, so that necessary lands can be retained. A lot and block layout will also be superimposed so that a handy unit is provided for transfer of lands required for operation of the nursing station. The development and legal survey is to be done entirely at our expense.\n\n(3) Upon entering a written agreement between our Departments for retention of the various town lots required for your purpose, your office will transfer the entire parcel of 48.3 acres at one dollar ($1.00) per acre, and then we will transfer back to you the various lots required for your purposes at the same nominal rate of one dollar ($1.00) per acre.\n\n(4) The entire block is to be laid out in accordance with community planning principles with due consideration to sanitation, and orderly development.\n\n(5) Our Department will also make the legal surveys of the roads and streets, and arrange for the cancellation of the old Dominion Government road allowance, which is now held in the name of the Provincial Department of Highways, and which is occupied by some of your buildings.\n\n(6) Our Department will also contact Dr. Hames of the Provincial Department of Health, so that he will be familiar with the proposals in the event that the operation of a health center at La Ronge is turned over to the province.\n\nMay I be advised if the above proposals have your approval so that the necessary surveys may be made by next month before the expected influx of tourists and settlers.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) C.A.L.

Hogg, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development, for Saskatchewan.\n\nThe provincial authorities have been urging, for the last two years, that we turn over to them as much as possible of the land which we are not using at the former site of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I think they should be definitely told that we are not yet ready to make a decision. Two matters are still unsettled. First, the building of a dormitory at Lac la Ronge in connection with educational plans there, and second, the establishment of a headquarters for our Assistant, Indian Agency, for that area. The letter from Mr. Hogg refers to 48.3 acres as not being used. I doubt that 10% of this land can be used for building purposes if and when they decide to build, as nearly all of it is solid rock. It would be very unwise to turn over to the Provincial Government any area until we deal with the problem of finding a suitable place to build a dormitory, a residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency, and a warehouse and office, as well as decide upon sewage disposal, and a water supply. These last two factors are very important when most of the surface is solid rock. They criticise us for moving too slow. I believe they have been too hasty in many things.\n\nJ.P.B.

Mr. Wickenden has drawn the enclosed sketch which gives a clear idea of the lay-out. I trust it will be of value.\n\n\"The enclosed sketch may help you in your negotiations with the provincial Govt. of Saskatchewan, and I wish to stress the fact that the measurements given are only approximate and that I have made use of snapshots in determining distances to aid my memory. You will note that it was planned by the surveyor in charge of the new town site to continue the highway east right across the school garden since it seemed the cheapest and most practical thing to do. Good garden land is very scarce in the Lac la Ronge district and the plot in front of the old school was, and is, valuable. I see no reason why any of this land should be sacrificed for building purposes. I have indicated the position of the present public school a little east of the cultivated land, and I don't see any reason why the same site should not be used for the new public school. A site, more or less opposite the missionary's residence, was suggested as a possible site by the Administrator of Education, in Northern Saskatchewan in the fall of '46. It will be hard to find a site with level and extensive playgrounds in any case.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nMay 13, 1949.\n\nReverend Canon H. G.

Resources Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nSeptember 13, 1949.\n\nMr. H. L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Keenleyside:\n\nRe: Lot 12 adjacent to La Ronge Townsite, Sask.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of March 22nd, 1949, our Department has surveyed the balance of Lot 12 adjacent to La Ronge townsite.\n\nAttached herewith is a development plan showing the various buildings and improvements. The area surveyed comprises practically all of the usable portion of the 48.3 acres now held by the Dominion Government. The area north of the subdivision falls off very sharply to the muskeg which occupies the major portion of the 48.3 acres remaining in Lot 12.\n\nTo facilitate the transaction it is suggested that the entire 48.3 acres be transferred to this Department and we will then, upon registration of the plan of survey, transfer the following Lots and Blocks to your Department to cover existing improvements and lands which may be required for expansion of your facilities:\n\nLot 7 in Block 12 - now occupied by a house;\n\nAll of Block 13 - upon which is situated two sheds, two cemeteries, barn, warehouse, power house, hospital, garden, greenhouse and fence;\n\nLot 6 in Block 14 - now occupied by a building formerly used as a school.\n\nIt is believed that the Anglican Church and manse \"squatted\" on Dominion lands and therefore Block 16 will be transferred to the Church authorities if you so direct.\nThe sawmill shown on the foreshore is of a portable type and it is our understanding that the Department of Indian Affairs have agreed to its removal. However, if desired, we are prepared to issue an annual permit for the use of the space necessary for its operation until such time as you have had the opportunity to take the action mentioned.\n\nIn addition to the above, we will cancel out the portion of the old road allowance now held in the right of the Provincial Department of Highways so that the warehouse and hospital building which now extends into the provincial road allowance, will be entirely absorbed in Block 13.\n\nMay I suggest that the transfer of lands between our Departments be at the nominal rate of $1.00 per acre as was previously done in the transfer of the westerly portion of Lot 12.\n\nThe settlement of La Ronge is a growing one and I feel that the integration of your lands and buildings in the survey will set the pattern for its orderly growth along sound community planning lines. La Ronge is becoming an increasingly popular fishing resort and is visited each summer by numerous American as well as Canadian tourists.\n\nFour prints are attached for your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

Hogg, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development, Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe title to Lot 12 adjacent to La Ronge Townsite, Saskatchewan, 76.70 acres, is vested in His Majesty in the right of Canada, under the authority of P.C. 589 dated May 4, 1925, \"for the purposes of the Indian Boarding School and Hospital at La Ronge, Saskatchewan\".\n\nIt did not pass to the Province with the return of the resources, as it was in an exempted class.\n\nIt is not an Indian Reserve nor is it Indian lands and is, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of this Branch. The Lot is Federal Crown land within the jurisdiction of the Lands and Development Services Branch and that Branch alone, according to my understanding, has the right to convey it, as requested by Mr. Hogg.\n\nBy P.C. 21 of January 3, 1947, 28.4 acres of the Lot were conveyed to His Majesty in the right of Saskatchewan, leaving a balance of 48.3 acres still vested in the Crown Dominion.\n\nIn the view of this Branch an Order of the Minister is required declaring that the land is no longer required for school purposes and directing that the administrative jurisdiction over it be transferred to the Lands and Development Services Branch. This the Minister may properly do as the school which formerly occupied this site was completely destroyed by fire in February, 1947, and is no longer used or required for school purposes.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Order above referred to is hereto attached for the Minister's signature. It should, however, be drawn to the attention of the Lands and Development Services Branch that the Department of National Health and Welfare have an interest in the land by virtue of their ownership of many buildings thereon which they acquired from the Anglican Church and that Department should be consulted before any conveyance as requested by Mr. Hogg is made.\n\nFurther, as mentioned in Mr. Hogg's letter, the Anglican Church may have an interest and their concurrence in Mr. Hogg's proposal for the protection of their interest might be considered necessary.\n\nWere the lot in question within the administrative jurisdiction of this Branch, we would have little hesitation in recommending that Mr. Hogg's proposal be accepted, as it appears to be a practical one.\n\nIf the Minister approves the attached Order, it is respectfully suggested that the file and the Order be forwarded to the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nDirector.\n\nDJA/MC\nI, Colin Gibson, Minister of Mines and Resources, Dominion of Canada, do hereby declare that that portion of Lot 12 at La Ronge Townsite, La Ronge, Saskatchewan, presently vested in His Majesty in the right of Canada by virtue of P.C. 689 dated May 4, 1925, is no longer required for school purposes by the Indian Affairs Branch of this Department, and I do hereby transfer administrative jurisdiction over the said land to the Lands and Development Services Branch of this Department in order that it may be disposed of.\n\nDated at Ottawa this day of , A.D. 1949.\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, October 14, 1949.\n\nJ.P.B.

Hogg, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development, Regina, together with a plan of a proposed addition to the Townsite of La Ronge. We find this plan somewhat confusing and suggest that you interview Mr. Hogg and Mr. Bereskin and see if you can clarify the picture for us.\n\n1. Is it correct to assume that the area marked in green on the plan is the old road which the Province undertakes to close and do you concur in the proposal?\n\n2. Is Block 13, as referred to in Mr. Hogg's letter, bounded as indicated in red on the enclosed plan?\n\n3. Are you satisfied that both cemeteries and all the medical buildings, except the house on Lot 7, Block 12, are within Block 13?\n\n4. It is our understanding that the new Superintendent's residence is being built near the hospital in Block 13. Will you please plot its exact location on the plan in relation to La Ronge Avenue.\n\n5. Re Lot 6, Block 14 - It is assumed that this is our school and if so, is Lot 6 sufficient land or should we also retain Lots 9 and 10 to provide for extension, playgrounds, etc., before divesting ourselves of title to all lands surrounding it.\n6. Re Lot 7, Block 12 - Is this one Lot sufficient for our purposes or should we also retain Lot 2 to give us a frontage on La Ronge Avenue?\n\n7. Can you ascertain if the Anglican Church are content that we should convey to the Province the land in Block 16 south of La Ronge Avenue on which their church and manse stand?\n\n8. Are you satisfied with the arrangement proposed by Mr. Hogg with reference to the sawmill?\n\nIf and when you are satisfied with the proposed arrangement, would you please ask Mr. Bereskin to prepare a legal description satisfactory to him for our use should the Minister agree to convey the remaining 48.3 acres in Lot 12 to the Province by Executive Order, as proposed by Mr. Hogg.\n\nYou should also ask Mr. Bereskin to prepare a schedule of legal descriptions of each parcel which the Province agrees to reconvey after registration of the plan.\n\nYou might discuss with Mr. Hogg and Mr. Bereskin whether or not, as owners of Lot 12, the Minister could not consent to the registration of the plan and after registration then convey to the Province any surplus which we could certify as not being required \"for the purposes of the Indian Boarding School and Hospital\", thus clearing our title from the condition imposed by the Order in Council which constitutes our title to the property.\n\nEncs.\n\nDirector.\n\nDJA/MC\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hogg, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development; and Mr. A.I. Bereskin, Controller, Surveys Branch; and the writer; and the various matters referred to in Mr. Hogg's letter to Dr. Keenleyside and in the Director's letter referred to, were discussed at some length.\n\n(1) The area marked in green is the old road which the province undertook to close before locating the new road shown on the plan as La Ronge Avenue.\n\n(2) Block 13 referred to in Mr. Hogg's letter is as indicated in red on the enclosed plan.\n\n(3) Both cemeteries and all medical buildings, except the house on Lot 7, Block 12, are within Block 13, with the exception that the old cemetery extends slightly over the boundary of Block 13 into Backlund Street as indicated on the plan.\n\n(4) The new residence for the Assistant, Indian Agency, Lac la Ronge, the construction of which is almost complete, is located as shown in red ink in Block 13 on the plan.\n\n(5) The school building on Lot 6, Block 14, was built some years ago as an infirmary in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School which was destroyed by fire. This building was later converted into a school to accommodate white and Metis children, and operated under the auspices of the Anglican Church. Subsequently it was leased to the provincial Department of Education by the Church Authorities. This arrangement ended with the opening of the new provincial school at La Ronge Village. I believe that the Anglican Church claims this building, but I have every reason to believe that it should be considered the property of our Branch as I believe Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, who was Indian Agent, Carlton Agency, at the time this building was erected will confirm the fact that the cost of the building was met out of Parliamentary Appropriation. Mr. E.S. Jones, Indian Superintendent, Carlton Agency, has discussed the ownership of this building with Reverend Archdeacon Paul, of the Anglican Church, who stated he was not sure of the ownership of the building, but that he would write to Canon H. E. Rives, at Battleford, whom he thought could answer the question.......\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(5) the question. I would also suggest that the Department communicate with Mr. R.S. Davis, or I shall do so, if so instructed. With regard to retaining sufficient land adjoining Lot 6, Block 14, for school purposes, if such is desirable in the future, I would recommend that Lots 4 and 5, in Block 14, be retained in preference to Lots 9 and 10. I make this recommendation because of the fact that suitable playgrounds could be made on Lots 4 and 5, but not on Lots 9 and 10, because of the fact that the latter is nearly solid rock.\n\n(6) In addition to Lot 7, Block 12, on which a house is situated, I would recommend retention of Lot 1 in conjunction with Lot 7, in preference to Lot 2. My reason for this recommendation is in the fact that if we retained Lot 2 there would eventually be a private occupant of Lot 1 whose property would be surrounded by our property on two sides and streets on the other two sides.\n\n(7) Bishop Martin was absent when Mr. E.S. Jones endeavoured to contact him regarding settlement of the title to the land on which the Church and Manse stand in Block 10. However, Reverend Archdeacon Paul acted on behalf of Bishop Martin, and stated that he would like, if possible, to have title to this property transferred direct from the Dominion Government to the Church Authorities, and I would so recommend.\n\n(8) I am not satisfied with the arrangement proposed by Mr. Hogg with reference to the sawmill. While in a sense this sawmill could be called a portable one, the method in which it has been set up on cement bases with twin steam set up which forms the power unit, the cost of moving it to another point would be almost prohibitive. This sawmill is used from time to time as a way to supply the Indians of that area with cheap lumber for erecting their homes. It must be near the lake in order to have the use of the lake water for steam, and it must be situated on fairly level ground where logs and lumber can be piled, and where there is room for disposal of saw dust, shavings, bark, and other refuse from the sawmill. It would be difficult to find any other place on the lake shore where such natural facilities are available. If the title to the land on which the sawmill is situated is to be transferred to the province, there should be some arrangement for a long term agreement, perhaps for 20 years, for rental of the property necessary to operate the sawmill, at a nominal rental.\n\nAs the matter of allocating this land is of some considerable concern to the Department of National Health and Welfare because of the fact that they are operating an Indian Hospital in Block 13, I discussed the matter with Dr. A.B. Simes, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, and he has emphasized the fact that the Provincial Government should not be permitted to make use of the property close to the hospital for a tourist camp. This refers particularly to the land immediately south of Block 13, and between La Ronge Avenue and the lake front. This point is emphasized because of the fact that..................\nthe fact that I have heard rumours that a proposal in that direction has been considered. It is a well known fact that tourist camps are very noisy during the summer until the early hours of the morning, in fact the quietest period at such a place is usually between daylight and noon. It is imperative that we have quiet at all times around the hospital, not only for the sake of the patients, but also in order that the hospital staff can secure proper rest when off duty. This point was discussed with Mr. Hogg and Mr. Bereskin, but there was no clear-cut decision at the time. However, they agreed that the property in question should not become a tourist camp. It is my opinion that this part of the lake front (marked in yellow) should be retained as a landing place for Indians bringing patients to the hospital, visiting the hospital, or coming to transact business with our Assistant, when travelling by canoe.\n\nWith regard to the last three paragraphs of your letter, Mr. Hogg and Mr. Bereskin are both of the opinion that the suggestion in Mr. Hogg's letter to Dr. Keenlyside should be carried out in that the entire 48.3 acres should be transferred to the province and that the Department of Natural Resources and Industrial Development will then, upon registration of the plan of survey, transfer to our Department the lands and improvements which we require. Technically, this may be the easier way, but I favour the suggestion made in the last paragraph of your letter, and I believe we should hold out for such an arrangement.\n\nTo summarize, we should have title to all of Block 13; Lots 1 and 7 in Block 12; Lots 4, 5, and 6 in Block 14, also that part of the lake front previously referred to and marked in yellow, and a long-term lease on the sawmill site at a nominal rental. Mr. Hogg has tentatively agreed to these conditions, and will forward me a letter, in duplicate, to that effect, following which I shall forward a copy to the Department. I have been assured that this will be within the next few days.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nRegina, November 1st, 1949\n\nD. M.

Hogg, Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development; and Mr. A.I. Bereskin, Controller, Surveys Branch; and the writer; and the various matters referred to in Mr. Hogg's letter to Dr. Keenleyside and in the Director's letter referred to, were discussed at some length.\n\n(1) The area marked in green is the old road which the province undertook to close before locating the new road shown on the plan as La Ronge Avenue.\n\n(2) Block 13 referred to in Mr. Hogg's letter is as indicated in red on the enclosed plan.\n\n(3) Both cemeteries and all medical buildings, except the house on Lot 7, Block 12, are within Block 13, with the exception that the old cemetery extends slightly over the boundary of Block 13 into Backlund Street as indicated on the plan.\n\n(4) The new residence for the Assistant, Indian agency, Lac la Ronge, the construction of which is almost complete, is located as shown in red ink in Block 13 on the plan.\n\n(5) The school building on Lot 6, Block 14, was built some years ago as an infirmary in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School which was destroyed by fire. This building was later converted into a school to accommodate white and Metis children and operated under the auspices of the Anglican Church. Subsequently it was leased to the provincial Department of Education by the Church Authorities. This arrangement ended with the opening of the new provincial school at La Ronge Village. I believe that the Anglican Church claims this building, but I have every reason to believe that it should be considered the property of our Branch as I believe Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, who was Indian Agent, Carlton Agency, at the time this building was erected will confirm the fact that the cost of the building was met out of Parliamentary Appropriation. Mr. E.S. Jones, Indian Superintendent, Carlton Agency, has discussed the ownership of this building with Reverend Archdeacon Paul, of the Anglican Church, who stated he was not sure of the ownership of the building, but that he would write to Canon H. E. Hives, at Battleford, whom he thought could answer the question......\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(5) the question.

Hives, but as he has been away from there for many years, he could not give much information. However, this week, when the Bishop and I both returned from itinerating, I found out from him that the building formerly used as a school for non-treaty children, situated East of the Hospital, was built by the Indian School Commission, and after the Residential School was burnt down was sold to the Diocese to be used for Sunday School and various meetings. The Bishop has the papers showing transfer to the Diocese.\n\nAs the Bishop and Canon Payton are busy on another matter this afternoon, I cannot look up the papers now; but I will look them up as soon as possible, and note the number of the lot.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd.

As soon as the Colonel has returned, and his statement has received the consideration of our Commission, I will write to you again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/JLC\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to your Mr. Hoey's letter of the 11th ult., No. 132-2-14, and my reply to the same on the 22nd ult., I beg to state that our Commission has given much careful consideration to the suggestion made by Mr. Indian Agent Davis that the cows at our Lac la Ronge School be disposed of and that the School be supplied with canned milk.\n\nFor your information I may say that Colonel Mermagen, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Commission, recently visited this School and carefully discussed with the Principal the Indian Agent's recommendation. After considering the matter, they decided that the Principal should set forth in writing his opinion, and from his statement the following is extracted:-\n\n\"Before a final decision is taken in this matter I would like to call the attention of the Commission to the fact that as shown in the Farm Reports, there has been an increase in the amount of milk produced at the school. This has been due largely to the fact that the cows kept have been better milkers. Taking the first three months of the years 1936-37-38 for purposes of comparison, the amounts produced were respectively:-\nJan. - Mar. Quarter, 1936 ...... 80 gals.\n\" \" \" \" 1937 ..... 159 \"\n\" \" \" \" 1938 ..... 730 \"\nApril-June \" 1938 ..... 959 \"\n\nThis shows that there has been a great increase during the last year, and the prospects are quite good for the coming year. Taking Mr. Davis' figures - $800.00 - as substantially correct as to the cost of keeping the cows at the School (this includes part of the Farmer's wages, and feed for cows) and providing we can maintain a milk production of from 6 to 8 gals. per day during the time the children are in School, it would appear that the cost per gallon of fresh milk would be cheaper than that of canned or dried milk. Based on a consumption of six gals. per day, the canned or dried milk diluted at the full strength as directions on containers, the cost would be, based on the children being at School for a minimum of 309 days per year:\n\nCanned Milk: 48's @ $9.45 per cs. landed .79\u00a2 per gal. or $1,664.96 per year.\n\nDried Milk: 48 lbs. to cs. @ $20.70 per cs. landed. 64\u00a2 per gal. $1,186.56 per year.\n\nThese figures have not taken into consideration that a lower cost per case might be obtained for quantity purchase, or that the milk could be used in greater dilution.\"\n\nIn addition to the above, the Principal points out that the cost price of the hay ($800.00) includes the salary of the Farm Instructor for at least four months in the year and that the acceptance of the Indian Agent's recommendation would not relieve the Commission of the necessity of maintaining a Farm Instructor, as \"the bulk of this agent's time is taken up in securing wood for the School furnaces\". Should a Farm Instructor not be retained it would be necessary to engage another permanent worker in the capacity of General Assistant to act as teamster during the winter months and to secure the necessary hay supply for the horses during the summer.\n\nIn the light of the above information, our Commission feel that it would be better to allow the existing arrangement to stand for another year or two at any rate. The members heartily share the desire of your Branch of Government to train the Indian boys and girls in the Schools under their control to become self-supporting and useful citizens, and while the country around\nLac la Ronge may not be suitable for farming and gardening activities on an extensive scale, it is by no means impossible for such activities to be gradually extended. Such extension would surely help in achieving the desire that you and we have so much at heart.\n\nFor some years I continued to urge your Department to make a grant of $500.00 for clearing and bringing under cultivation quite a good piece of land not far away from the main school building. If it were at all possible to have this assistance, I am convinced that the results would justify the expenditure. If some further help could be given by your Department to drain the large muskeg immediately behind the School, it would not be long before the School management would be able to secure all the hay and oats required for horses and cattle, and the annual cost of operating the School would be considerably reduced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/KH\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the cattle at the Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the existing arrangement may stand for another year or so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Secretary, Indian Residential School Commission, M. S. C. C., and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the suggestion made by Dr. Westgate in the last paragraph of his letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nMr R.A.Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI have before me a copy of your letter dated the 19th inst, and addressed to the Rev. Dr.Westgate, with regard to \"the cattle at the Lac la Ronge Residential School.\" You conclude your letter as follows:\n\n\"In view of the information contained in your letter the existing arrangement may stand for another year or so.\"\n\nThis quotation seems to indicate a misapprehension concerning the basis of the arrangement under which the Church of England in Canada and, I think, the other Churches concerned, administer the Indian Residential Schools for which they are severally responsible.\n\nOn more than one occasion when it was my responsibility to address the Hon'ble, the Minister on behalf of a joint Church Delegation, I referred to this subject and emphasised the fact that the basis of the partnership between the Churches and the Government is one of co-operation not of subordination.\n\nThe original agreement between the Churches and the Government reserved to the Government the right of appointment of the Principals of the Schools; but the matters concerned with the ordinary administration lay within the competence and responsibility of the Churches. This statement of principle has never been disputed and, as far as the several Ministers addressed have been concerned, has received at least consent by silence.\n\nI refer to the point now because, after 28 years of experience, I am of the firm conviction that any interpretation\nof the agreement in question which would appear to place the Churches in a subordinate position to the officials of the Department could lead only in the end to great dissatisfaction and probably great disagreement.\n\nThe contents of this letter are not intended to mean that the Inspectors, or other officials of the Department are not at liberty to express their opinions regarding this or that general aspect of the Church's administration of the Schools but they are intended to mean that in details, such as the example under discussion, the matter rests solely within the competence and decision of the Church concerned.\n\nBelieve me, with kind regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, October 1, 1938.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you refer to a communication dated September 19, 1938, sent forward by the Department to Reverend Dr. Westgate.\n\nI must express regret that Dr. Westgate felt compelled to bring this matter to your attention. There is not, in my judgment, the slightest danger that the Government or the officials of the Department will at any time encroach upon the jurisdiction of the Churches in the administration of residential schools.\n\nI have myself, since entering the Department, encouraged our Indian agents and our inspectors to take an active interest in the administration of our residential institutions, in the hope that by so doing the Principals would be encouraged and the general administration of the schools improved. I have, for example, succeeded in securing the services of an official of the Department of Agriculture to make a survey of farming conditions at one or two schools, in an attempt to help the Principals. It was my hope, also, that I might secure an official from the Forestry Branch to undertake a worthwhile programme of reforestation and beautification at a number of our schools, particularly in the West.\n\nThe comment sent forward to the Department by Indian Agent Davis - copy of which I enclose - was forwarded in the hope that certain economies might be effected at\n\nReverend Canon S.

(RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLac la Ronge School. May I point out, also, that the suggestion made by the Agent has a very direct relationship to government expenditures. Last year, we made a special grant of $500. to the Lac la Ronge School, in an attempt to compensate the institution for the losses sustained by drought conditions throughout the province of Saskatchewan. A somewhat similar grant, paid on the basis of $5.00 per pupil, was sent forward to all the residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan. In addition to this, I have had before me now for a couple of years a request from Dr. Westgate for a special grant of $500.00 for the clearing of land. This land, it would appear, is necessary to maintain a herd of cattle at the institution. You will, I feel, understand my position, therefore, when I express regret that Dr. Westgate has brought this matter to your attention.\n\nIt is just possible that the departmental letter of the 19th ultimo, to which you have referred, was somewhat loosely worded. It is somewhat difficult, however, for our officials to keep constantly in mind the principles underlying the administration of our institutions, particularly so when our duties appear to be multiplying from day to day. I hesitate to send forward a copy of your communication to our agents and inspectors. I have discussed the administration of residential schools with them on more than one occasion and I know how reluctant they frequently are to visit these institutions. If, however, you feel that a copy of your letter, or a letter along somewhat similar lines, written by me, would enable our officials to more clearly define where their responsibilities begin and end with respect to our residential schools, I shall be glad to prepare and send out such a letter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr R.A.Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter dated the 1st inst.\n\nI receive, I may say, copies of all correspondence written or received by Dr.Westgate. The copy of letter relating to the question under discussion was the cause of my communication to you. In other words, the matter was not drawn to my attention by Dr.Westgate.\n\nI have in mind also Dr.Westgate's letter to you in which he states the results of his examination of the cost of the herd of cattle at Lac la Ronge as compared with the cost of a supply of tinned milk - his conclusion, I think being (I am speaking from memory) that the total cost per annum of the cattle is less than the total cost would be of an adequate supply of tinned milk. In addition, we must bear in mind the fact that the cattle provide no inconsiderable part of the meat supply needed for this school. When therefore all the items are taken into consideration it appears to me that, from the standpoint of economy, the cattle are cheaper than the tinned milk.\n\nIt is in connection with points such as this one that the Inspector or the Agent of the Department is liable to jump to conclusions and to make recommendations which are not supported by an examination of all the facts. Our Commission at Winnipeg, with its two very capable agents - Dr.Westgate and Colonel Mermagen - have given very careful consideration during the last seventeen or eighteen years to the question of relative cost, and operate the schools under very definite instructions of the Executive Committee of the Society that the closest economy, consistent in particular with the adequate feeding of the children, must be exercised.\nThroughout the whole period, I may say, we have carried an annual net bank overdraft on account of the schools we administer, of a sum varying from $30,000 to $80,000. The approximate net amount of this overdraft on the closing of our books for the year 1937 was $55,000.\n\nThe chief cause of this state of affairs in recent years was the harsh, and in my opinion, unjustified action of the Government in reducing, without notice, and without consultation, the rates of per capita grants by successive sums of 10% and 5% - 15% in all. The first cut of 10% has, of course, been restored. We greatly need the restoration of the second cut of 5%.\n\nThe special grants last year mentioned by you of $500. to the Lac la Ronge School, and of $5.00 per pupil to the Residential Schools in the Province of Saskatchewan, was a very welcome and much needed action by the Department. It was, however, not an equivalent for the outstanding cut of 5% on the rates of per capita grants.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the Church, the Agreement between the Churches and the Government, is not, in my judgment, equitable in that the liabilities of the Government are stated and known while the liabilities of the Church, over and above the estimated receipts for any one year from per capita grants, are unstable and unknown.\n\nAs an illustration, we have the fact that in the face of the cuts in per capita grants, the Churches were required by the Agreement to meet the adverse conditions brought about by what are usually, but erroneously, described as \"acts of Providence.\" In other words the results, and they were disastrous and expensive, of drought and crop failure affecting over so many years, several of our largest schools.\n\nWith regard to my letter. I have always found it the best policy to be completely open and candid in my interviews, or correspondence, with the responsible officials of the Department. With this position I feel that you are in complete accord. Please, therefore, treat my letter as official to you only. In other words, I have no desire whatsoever that copies of it should be sent out to your officials in the field. Given Departmental Field Officials of experience and sympathetic approach, I would, for my own part, prefer not to limit unduly either the scope or the nature of their recommendations and even criticisms concerning points, such as the one under discussion (cattle versus tinned milk,) in their visits to the schools. There is always of course the odd man on the side of both the Church and the Department who is lacking either in experience or the personal qualities required for the proper discharge of his\nMr R.A.Hoey....................3\n\nimportant duties.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSG:G General Secretary.\nLeask, Sask.,\nOctober 3rd 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 19th, file 132-2-14, enclosing a copy of a letter you received from Rev. T. B. R. Westgate in regard to the supply of milk at the Lac La Ronge Indian Boarding School. I note that they state that they receive an average of 6 gals a day of milk for 309 days. Their cows may give 6 to eight gals of milk in the summer months, but throughout the winter months, I doubt very much whether they get more than three gals a day, if they get that.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of Rev. Westgate's letter, Rev Fisher, the Principal has taken the matter of clearing this piece of land up with me many times and I advised him that I would not recommend it as this land will be useless when it is cleared as it is all rock formation. After they had spent $500.00 on clearing a piece of land like the one in question it would not produce enough to feed one cow. To keep land of this nature in good condition it would be necessary to import soil and use fertilizer, otherwise the land would only produce one crop successfully.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Some arrangements should be made whereby the sick pupils could be isolated. If this child had been isolated he would not have caught the measles and would then have had a better chance to fight the T.B.

We could add to it another part 28ft.x 50. Also a stone building, and the two combined together would make a good and substantial school house as the accompanying sketch shows; which, I think could never be obtained if the sum of money granted would be employed to improve, or to enlarge, the old school building which is too fall soon into ruins.\n\nThis combination would also accommodate better the children who are now too far from the church.\n\nBesides, as we intend to have in a,\na time more or less remote.

They have their house fairly well furnished, such as bedstead and bedding table, chairs, stoves, dishes, cupboard, etc. They have 5 cows 2 steers and one heifer.\n\nI think they have both done as well as can be expected, and that the marriage was advisable and desirable.\n\nI have, etc,\n\nsgd Jno P.

The plea of a desire to avoid taxation may or may not be objectionable; but if once the Department became the owner of the school buildings, it would not be able to decline to entertain applications for grants to increase, enlarge or improve the buildings as it can now. On the other hand, if disposed to accept the transfer of the property, the Department ought to insist on an absolutely unconditional deed. Otherwise, if at any time the buildings should be handed back to the Church authorities, the Department would lose the value of any improvements made by it.\n\nH.C.

A. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nFred. W. Denchey, Esq.,\nTouchwood Hills,\nKutawa P.O., N.W.T.\nOttawa 10th May, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith for your report thereon, and also for such action as you consider necessary, a letter of the 27th ultimo, from Mr. Fred. W. Dennehy, in which he states that there are two non treaty children in attendance at the Muscowequon's Boarding School who have been reported as belonging to treaty and who have consequently drawn annuity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI have the honour to beg to bring to your notice irregularities & misapplication of public money in Muscoweau's Indian Boarding School, Touchwood Hills Agency.\n\nThere are maintained at that school two non-treaty children to whom fictitious names & treaty numbers have been given on the returns, so that the rent grant for Indian children has been drawn this year for non-treaty children. This can be verified now, if promptly investigated; and leakage of public funds stopped.\n\nThe irregularities consist in marking children present in class or in maintenance at the school, who were out of the classroom on the days certified to, or absent altogether from the school for periods more or less long. I know certainly several such cases exist; but refrain from estimating the number you may be able to verify, as a lot would depend on the testimony of the children or their parents\u2014an unreliable factor.\n\nI refrain from specifying names & dates, for the time being\u2014but if further light is desirable on the subject, and you decide to investigate, I can help the Department to testimony both documentary & verbal sufficient to substantiate my statements.\n\nI ought to be well acquainted with the facts as I opened Muscoweau's School in '86 (among the Indian topics) & only left it in '97, at the request of the Oblate Fathers, who got it removed from Govt (Ind. Reserve) land to their own adjoining private property, the Ind. Department, whose servant I had always considered myself, being unable to interfere.\nAs to my reliability, I am probably known to most of the Western officials from the Commissioners & Inspectors down & could also refer you to our local member Mr. McDonald M.P., but I am unknown to the Hon. Mr. Douglas M.P.\n\nPrivate considerations, as well as zeal for the purity of the public service, impell me to address you this letter, after due & serious consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFred. W. Dennehy\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nI beg to acknowledge your letter No. 116733/1 of the 10th inst., stating that the alleged irregularities at Muscowequan's Boarding School, Touchwood Hills, are being looked into.\n\nShould my assistance be required, I am willing to help the Department to proofs of the facts stated in my previous letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nFred. W. Dennehy\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No. II6,733/1, of the 10th instant, and enclosure, being a letter from Mr. F.W. Denehy drawing the attention of the Department to irregularities and misappropriation of public money in Muscowequan's Indian Boarding School, Touchwood Mills Agency.\n\nThe charges made are - 1st. That there are maintained at that school two non-treaty children to whom fictitious names and treaty numbers have been given on the Returns so that the Government Grant for Indian children has been drawn this year for non-treaty children. 2nd. That children are marked as being present in class and in maintenance at the school who are out of the class room on the day marked, or absent altogether for periods more or less long.\n\nIn regard to the first charge: There is one non-treaty pupil at the Muscowequan School and his admission thereto was duly authorized whilst Mr. Denehy himself was in charge of the school. In this connection I may add that non-treaty children are to be found in nearly all the Industrial and Boarding Schools and their admission has been authorized pursuant to a letter from the Department to Rev. Father LaCombe, No. II7,657/8, dated the 18th of September 1895, a copy of which\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nwhich was transmitted for the guidance of this office under cover of official letter of even date and number.\n\nRegarding the second charge: I do not see how Mr. Denehy could have preferred it unless he was personally aware of the absences of the pupils coupled with a knowledge of the contents of the returns. He may, of course, have noticed from time to time a pupil absent from school but it is exceedingly unlikely that Mr. Denehy could have seen the Returns either at the Agency or at the School. At the Agency it would have been a breach of confidence, and the relation in which Mr. Denehy stands towards the School makes it impossible for him to have obtained this information there. This charge has therefore all the appearance of having been made at random and without any specific information on the part of Mr. Denehy, and solely with the view of harassing the authorities of the school from pure personal spite, for it must not be forgotten that Mr. Denehy after being in charge of that school for several years (and I must say with considerable credit to himself for a time) was dismissed for what was fast becoming habitual drunkenness. Since his dismissal he has entertained no light feeling of rancor against the authorities of the school. This sentiment, I fear, is more likely to have moved him in the present instance than a feeling of interest in the purity of the public service.\n\nThe Returns, as the Department is aware, are certified by the head teacher and the Agent, and it is not likely the latter especially would attach his signature to a certificate unless reasonably certain that the statements contained therein were correct.\n\nTaking all into consideration I do not think that in the absence of particulars the department would be justified in causing an enquiry into this general charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 30 May 1892\n\nAccountant:\n\nI do not know why this matter was dealt with in your Branch in the first instance; but the course having been followed, I think I had better not take up the matter now.\n\nH.C.

McClelland, M.C.F.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nTouchwood Agency,\nKutawa, P.O.N.W.T.\nIndian Warehouse.\nWinnipeg, June 6, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the 1st instant, No. 116,733/1, sent to me here from Kutawa, enclosing copy of letter from Mr. Dennehy, dated 27th April.\n\nI expect to be in Touchwood at the Treaty Payments, in July, when I shall see Mr. Dennehy, and give him full opportunity of making his statements, and furnishing proof, and will report results without any delay.\n\nIn the meantime I would remark that I inspected Muscoweuan's School on 21st April last. Thirty-one pupils were present, including two non-treaty, which I noted on my report. The Principal informed me that he had authority to include these two pupils and this I verified by the letter of the Commissioner giving such authority, so that there was no concealment of the matter and no fictitious names were necessary. On a second visit, 12th May, there were thirty-five pupils present, including the two non-treaty, and only thirty paid for, this being the limit.\n\nI compared the attendance during the year with the visits made from time to time by the Agents and found them to agree with the roll. The Agents enter the number present on their diaries each visit, and I do not believe that any attempt was made to deceive, or charge for more pupils than the actual attendance warranted.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nMr. Dennehy knew I was at the Agency from 12th April to 21st May, and if he was so \"actuated with a zeal for the purity of the public service\" as he says he was, it would have been easy for him to have given me the information necessary and to have any abuses corrected.\n\nAs a matter of fact I called on Mr. Dennehy on 12th May before making my second visit. I was passing near his school and merely called, and if he had wanted his charges \"promptly investigated\" surely this was a favourable time, when I was on the spot, but he never said one word of any irregularity.\n\nIt is well known that Mr. Dennehy was relieved of his situation early in 1897 for very good reasons and one of which was noticed in my report of the previous year. Mr. Dennehy feels sore at being dismissed, and I am afraid his feelings have got the better of him and he has allowed other motives than the \"purity of the service\" to actuate him in making the charges he has. The transfer of the property is another vexed question, as this will deprive his school of a good portion of the revenue from taxable property.\n\nHowever, I will give him a full chance to prove his charges. Muscowequan's School, to my mind, is one of the best conducted in the Territories. Everything was in apple pie order, the staff most efficient, and the Rev. Sister Valade an accomplished teacher, and the pupils showed careful training.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Revd. Father Perreault who is presently in charge of the Muscowequan's Boarding School, informs me that he has not received the authorization of taking more than thirty children at his school, and that he has now this number about complete.\n\nMay I ask you to be kind enough to recommend that the authorization of receiving a greater number of children be granted by the Department. As you know, there are, in the District of Touchwood Hills, and particularly at Nut Lake, quite a number of children who attend no school at all. We would like to do all in our possible to bring their parents to send them to school, and we would like to be sure to be able to receive them whenever they consent.\n\nThe Muscowequan's School is the only boarding school we have presently in the whole district of Assiniboia, and if the authorization asked for were granted it would be a good opening and the only one we have to receive some of the younger children of other reserves when the\n\nparents\nparents could not very well send to Qu'Appelle Industrial School on account of their young age and on account of this last school having its number completed.\n\nAn augmentation in the number of children at Muscowequan's School would only cause an expense comparatively small and only for the board and tuition of children. As you know, our school building is certainly large enough to receive easily forty children; we have the teachers and other employees required, we have also the furniture required.\n\nAs we had been given to hope that the authorized number of pupils would be augmented after the 1st. of July we have provided for it in advance. Last May I have purchased ten new iron beds which I have forwarded to the School last week. So the School would be ready to receive easily forty children if we had the authorization.\n\nYou have been kind enough to inform us that Mr. Inspector McGibbon has found the school very satisfactory; you know that the Rev. Father Perreault and the Rev. Sisters spare no trouble to make the school successful in every respect, it would greatly encourage them and promote the work of education if the authorization asked for were granted.\n\nI beg therefore to ask you to be kind enough to recommend that the authorization\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nauthorization required to receive forty children instead of thirty be granted by the Department for the Muscowequan's Boarding School, and to see that the necessary funds for that are put in the estimates of present fiscal year.\n\nI have the honour &c.&c.\n\nJ.F.Magnan.\nSupt.\n\nMr.Swinford.\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Hills.\nAssa.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nKutawa.\nAug 10th. 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Rev. Father Magnan in regard to increasing the Department's grant to the Muscowequans boarding school.\n\nThe letter fully explains itself and needs no further comment from me.\n\nThis school can well accommodate forty pupils, and I believe would be procured if the grant for that number were authorized.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Father Magnan, Mr. Indian Agent Swinford and this Office in regard to increasing the grant and also the number of boarders at the Muscowequahn Boarding School. I have said that the first request could not be entertained, but the second taken into consideration in connection with next year's estimates. If, however, it were at all possible to do something this year in the latter direction, I should like that it should be done as this school is a most deserving one and in this regard would beg to refer the Department to Inspector McGibbon's report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 19th September, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY.\n\nWith reference to the application for authority to draw the per capita grant for a greater number of pupils than that at present authorized at the Muscowequan Boarding School (R.

Touchwood Agency, I beg to say that it is impossible to allow the grant for a larger number than is provided for in the vote, viz., 30 pupils at $75.\n\nAccording to the last return there are 33 children on the roll, only 3 more than provided for by Parliament.\n\nH.C.

The Indians in our vicinity feel more inclined to send their children to school, and I think it would be very easy to find that additional number for our school.\n\n2. Our school house can easily accommodate at least fifty children; an increase of ten boarders would make the number forty, which would enable us to use the whole building, which was erected at a heavy cost, never yet covered by school revenue.\n\n3. An increase of ten would place education within the reach of more Indians, without increasing the staff, and would help us to meet, or approximately, the running expenses of the school, which cannot be done with a grant for thirty children only.\n\nHoping to have the present request granted,\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.E.H.

B. Desjarlais, No. 71, and a young lad named Daniel Pelletier, aged 9 years, not as yet on school register, were missing from the school premises this particular afternoon, and were not discovered until the following day (Monday), when it was known that the Hudson's Bay Co., store, Touchwood, had been robbed the night previous, and on search, the above named lads were found in a bush in the vicinity with the money and articles missing in their possession, cash amounting to $12.85 and $65.00 worth in goods, with exception of a blanket, a hat and pair of gloves, the stuff taken by them was pop-corn, mouth-organs, ribbon and such trash. The boys were arrested and taken before the local Justice of the Peace, found guilty and the two older ones, as the leaders, were sentenced to two months in Regina gaol, and the little fellow sent back to school to be summarily punished, by order of the Court.\n\nI have since written the Principals of the schools here, warning them that they are responsible and should be most careful and prompt to ascertain the whereabouts of their pupils when missing from the school premises, and to have their staff to strictly comply with their orders.\n\nThe Hon.

(RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nHonorable Sir,\n\nLast May we had the pleasure of having the visit of our new Inspector, Mr. Graham. We were well pleased with his inspection, his kind ways, good advice to the children, and encouragement to the staff. We appreciated deeply his kind visit and so full inspection. We were only sorry to have not the school on the good standing it should have. It seems to me that Boarding Schools should be as efficient as possible. Besides a good teaching there should be a kind of experimental farm where children could learn how to keep up a farm on a fair standing at least, taking care of a stock... But to obtain such a result.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nMinister of the Interior,\nE. Laver.\nwe should have more help from the Depart-\nment than we have. At least, we should be allowed\nto have more children than we had so far. We have\nroom for forty, even more. Being so long ways\nfrom the Station, the freight being so dear, it\nmakes it impossible for us to make the im-\nprovements required and give the Indians the\nexample they need so much in this part of the\nworld. A fair, substantial help from the Indian\nDepartment would be so gratefully received\nand so well used as to make a good show\nnot only for the service but also for the\npublic, the many settlers coming in.\nWe would tell them it is through the gener-\nosity of the Department if a good show could\nbe given. I would be too well pleased to acknowl-\nedge publicly that I will have the pleasure\nof doing so and that the School, through you,\nHonorable Sir, will be a credit to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nJ. H. Magrane\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nMinister of the Interior\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, 19th October, 1904.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 4th instant, addressed to the Hon. Mr. Sifton, containing your suggestions with reference to the Boarding School at Touchwood Hills and stating that you had received a very satisfactory visit from Inspector Graham.\n\nThe Department will be only too pleased to take into consideration the matters mentioned in your letter and to advise you of its conclusions in connection therewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. Father J. A. Magnan,\nPrincipal, Muscowequan's Boarding School,\nTouchwood Hills, Assa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 15th November, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith regard to the application from Rev. Father Magman, Principal of Muscowequan's boarding school for provision for an increased number of pupils, I beg to say that 30 children are all that are at present provided for. He has accommodation for fully 40 pupils and the staff.\n\nThe Gordon's Boarding school conducted by the Church of England is also in the Touchwood Hills Agency, and it has provision for the same number of pupils.\n\nIn addition to these two boarding schools there is also one day school in this Agency.\n\nOut of 847 Indians as shown by the last census as belonging to this Agency, 628 are pagans and there are about 150 children of school age and there would be no difficulty in obtaining the additional number asked for by Father Magman, if the necessary funds were provided.\n\nUpon referring to Mr Inspector Graham's report on this school, dated the 5th July last, I beg to say that this would appear to be the most satisfactorily managed boarding school in the Territories. Mr Graham states that the Principal has started a farm in connection with the school which was a model of neatness. The grain was well put in and well advanced.\nThe school property consists of 160 acres belonging to the Oblates Father, 78 of which were under crop. They had 52 head of cattle with 7 horses and other live stock, which were all well cared for and successfully wintered. Mr Graham further states that the boys received a thorough training in farming and the care of stock and that the girls, although small, are efficient housekeepers, making all the butter and bread used in the institution.\n\nAlthough this school is said to be so well managed, the financial statement furnished by the Principal for the year ended 30th June last, shows a deficit of $1076.60. Supplies of all kinds are expensive in this locality and with the small number of pupils provided for, it would appear to be impossible to make ends meet. I think that if the Department could see its way to increase the number of pupils for next year, it would only be a fair recognition of the good work done at the school.\nMr. Benson -\n\nWill you please look into this report on it\nMUSCOGEQUAN'S Boarding School,\nTOUCH-WOOD HILLS, ASSA.\n\n116733-1\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n273720 Ottawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nLast summer, I had the honour to receive from you a congratulating letter on the work done at our school. Indeed, we have always endeavoured to make it a success, a credit to the Indian Department. We are still doing so and will continue in the future. But, Honourable Sir, you are aware, with the small government grant, it is impossible to do what should be done notwithstanding the amount of our money we find in every year. A noble work has been done and done well, as our esteemed Inspector and yourself have acknowledged it; we ought to be entitled to some encouragement. Last week, our new and so devoted, so zealous Agent,\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nAgent, Mr. W. Burron, inspected the School. He seemed to be highly pleased with what he heard and saw; at least, he said so. He greatly approved my present request and promised me his support. I did, Honorable Sir, grounded on your so kind and encouraging letter of the 15th of July last, on the report of our so just Inspector, the recommendation of him so devoted Agent, that I pray for a furnace. Stoves are a so dangerous thing especially with Indian children. Several times we had narrow escapes through the imprudence of some of them. This besides the saving of time and wood could be avoided with a furnace. I am so confident that my request will have a due consideration and an effective one, that I bought already a wind pump to carry water in all the rooms of the school. This could be effected only with a furnace for with stoves the pipe would break and would be of no use.\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\nMUSCOWBOUAN'S Boarding School,\nTOUCH-WOOD HILLS, ASSA.\n\n273720\n\nSo you see, Honourable Sir, we do not spare money to improve the school and prevent accidents. I trust the Indian Department will see its way to comply with our request. It would be a tangible acknowledgment of our constant efforts to civilize the Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nJ. D. Magoun,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 20th April, 1935\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. J.A. Magnam, Principal of Muscowequan's boarding school applies for a grant for a new furnace for his school to replace the present heating arrangement by stoves. He says that he has installed a water system throughout the school and without a furnace it will be useless in the winter as it would freeze and break the pipes.\n\nHe gives no idea of the cost and there is no provision for this work. The Department has already contributed $1800.00 towards the building of this school which belongs to the Church and was built by them after their plans. If we accede to his request it will most likely form a precedent for other boarding schools to make similar demands.\n\nFather Magnam gives as a reason for asking for this grant the encouragement held out to him in a letter of the 16th July last. No such letter was written from the Department, and he most likely refers to one he received from the Assistant Commissioner, written after the receipt of Mr Inspector Graham's report on this school, as Mr McKenna states in a marginal note on this report that \"So excellent a 'sowing calls for special commendation and I have written the Principal accordingly'. I think it is a great mistake for officials of the Department to write such commendatory letters, as in this case the...\"\nPrincipal is using Mr McKenna's letter as a lever to raise funds.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Magnan, Principal of Muscowequan's boarding school has applied for a grant to enable him to purchase a new furnace on the strength of the encouragement held out to him in a letter of the 18th July last, which was apparently sent from your office after the receipt of Mr Inspector Graham's report on this school. As Mr McKenna stated in a marginal note on this report that \"So excellent a showing calls for special commendation and I have written the Principal accordingly\". The Department does not approve of the practice of writing commended letters as they offer encouragement to apply for grants. In this instance there are no funds available for this purpose, and Rev.

But since the change, since he had orders to come on special calls only, we are in a bad fix as far as admission of children is concerned. They must be examined by the doctor, and whom will pay the expense of the trip? The Indian Department cannot accept that school who cannot meet the two ends, console. Neither can the Department expect that we will have to go to the big city fifty miles to have a child examined by the doctor before he can be admitted to school. As far as schools are concerned, it was certainly a wrong step to have the doctor come only on special calls. I would pray to have the doctor coming once a month or have the children admitted to school before they are examined by the doctor to not have to wait four or five months and lose the grant. I have the honour to be\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nJ. B. Macdonald\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1905.\n\nReverend Sir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., reporting that on account of the periodical visits of the Doctor to your School having been discontinued it is impossible for you to have pupils medically examined before admission in all cases, and that, owing to this, you are sometimes deprived of the grant for a considerable period.\n\nIn view of the circumstances the Department will consent to pay for new pupils taken in to fill vacancies from the date of their admission until they are examined by the Doctor, but should such examination prove unsatisfactory they will have to be removed.\n\nThe Department, however, will expect you to exercise great care in the selection of pupils who are to receive this privilege.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner will be advised of this concession.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Magnan,\nPrincipal, Muscowequan's Boarding School,\nTouchwood Hills, Assa.\nSir:-\n\nA letter has been received from the Principal of the Muscowequan's Boarding School in which he claims that owing to the discontinuance of the periodical visits of the medical officer he is sometimes obliged to wait four or five months before he can have pupils examined who are required to fill vacancies, thus losing the per capita grant for that time.\n\nIn view of this state of affairs the Department has informed the Principal that he will be permitted to fill vacancies temporarily pending the examination by the regular medical man and that the grant will be allowed for the time they are enrolled, but, if they fail to pass the necessary medical examination, they are to be discharged. He has also been instructed to use the greatest care in selecting pupils to fill any vacancies that may occur.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Graham, that an increase of five children has been promised last year for the Musgowequan's Boarding School. I have been since waiting for the notification, but in vain. Would you kindly tell me if there is any truth in the Inspector's report or rather promise time and again repeated to me? Sure at late we had not quite our number on the return but now we have thirty three and we could have more.\n\nYou know yourself, Honourable Sir, good reports have been sent to your Office of our school. Without any boasting we are doing a great work here. We should be encouraged in being allowed to have not only thirty five children.\n\nThe Honourable Superintendent of Indian Affairs, I have the honour to be,\n\nOttawa\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ. H.

Some months ago a few of our horses got sick and fearing slander, I wrote to the Government in Regina about it. They sent down an inspector to investigate, resulting in shooting five horses. Previous to the inspector coming four died making a total loss of nine. So we have not a horse left even to drive or do any kind of work. We had quite a few acres of land ready for crop and were just starting to seed where the inspector arrived. As we have got no horses nor money to purchase any we shall not be able to put in a crop of any kind. Since two years I had bought\n\nThe Hon.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOct.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Now all hope are gone.\n\nMoreover we largely depended upon the farm to keep our school going and the boys were just acquiring a taste and a very good knowledge of farm work in general and as our Indian Agent, Mr. W. Morrison can inform you, our boys were becoming excellent farmers and were certainly a credit to the School and to the Indian Department. I could also state here as the Agent can tell you that whatever we were making out of the farm was entirely spent for the benefit of the School as I considered I would be failing in any duty as Principal if I should not endeavour to the best of my ability to encourage the boys in every respect and to teach them an idea of self-respect and self-support so that when they would leave the School that they would make successful and prosperous farmers, be an example and an incentive to the other Indians.\n\nThe Hon.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOnt.\nBut now our efforts are and must be at a standstill, because we have no horses to carry out our good objects and we shall not have a crop of any kind this year. It is discouraging after losing so many horses, to see fine wheat land ready for crop and no teams to carry it. If I had at least a promise of some help I could even at this late date buy some horses and put in good many of oats, but everything seems to foil me unless the Indian Department would be kind and generous enough to consider my sad case and help me out so that I might be able to buy two teams and do some work. If we have no assistance our Boarding School shall indeed be in a very sad state.

Previous to the inspector coming four of our horses died and when he did arrive he examined and tested the remaining, resulting in shooting five and placing the four remaining under quarantine.\n\nI have not got now a single horse to put in my crop and as I have no money to pay any I cannot put in crop of any kind this year.\n\nThough the season is rather late yet we had quite a few acres ready and had just started seeding when the inspector came. I thought of writing to the Indian Dept., Ottawa, asking...\n\nW. M. Graham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSask. Hills.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nThen to help me out but before doing so I thought it better to acquaint you of my intentions, and Mr. Graham you would certainly do me a great and personal favor if you would be kind enough to write also in my behalf, or if you should consider it better I will leave the whole matter in your hands as I know you have far more influence with the Dept. than I have, and to that effect would be received with gratitude.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nJ. H. Hayman\nPrincipal\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nFile Hills,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nI attach hereto a letter I received from the Principal of the Touchwood Hills Boarding School. You will see by this letter that the school has suffered a great loss, and while I am quite aware that the Department do not assist Boarding Schools over and above the grant, I think this is a special case and deserving of some consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 5th June, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the last instant, with enclosure, I beg to say that the Indian Commissioner reported to the Department by wire on the 26th ultimo, that nine horses had been lost by glanders at Muscowequan's Boarding School; and on the 28th of that month the Department telegraphed in reply that six hundred dollars would be advanced for the purchase of horses for the Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nLast May I had the pleasure to receive six hundred dollars from the Indian Dept. to help me to buy horses. I have delayed to let you know about the deal in order to know if our agent Agent P. Morrison, and myself, had been lucky in the deal. Today I must say that the two teams we bought for seven hundred dollars are really two good teams for farm purposes. I am proud to show them to our visitors and state it was through the kindness of the Dept. we got them. Of course, it is not completely the truth, but I am not convinced to have put in my share and I am quite willing to let it stand as it is, unless the Dept. would like better to pay the hole amount.\n\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nand state that the two teams were completely bought by them, leaving the matter before you and thanking you for your generosity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nHon. Sir\n\nRespectfully & faithfully yours,\n\nJ. R. Maginn\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe General Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe very much regret the inability of the Department to assist us in the matter of the heating apparatus for our new school, inasmuch as we shall not at present be able to put the existing structure into such thorough repair as we had anticipated owing to the additional expense; however, we will do all in our power to provide for the health and comfort of our Indian children.\n\nNow that we have, or shall have in a few weeks' time more and better accommodation for our pupils, will not the Department allow us to take a few more children? There are fifteen more children on the Reserve whom the parents are desirous of placing in the school, and they have as much right to the assistance of the Department as their neighbors, some of whom to the present\ntheir children have not received any education whatever, still running about half naked and wild.\n\nWe feel sure you have as much at heart the welfare of the Indians, as we ourselves, and cannot but admit the reasonability of our request.\n\nIt is most true that we are totally unable, with the small number of children we are to present allotted, to even defray expenses for board and clothing, in the present grant. In addition to this we have some to great expense of erecting new buildings in order to comply more with the ideas of the Department. So, will not the Department allow us to utilize our buildings, time and labour to assist them in the important step of civilizing the Indians, and grant us the permission to admit these fifteen children into the school? We may add the our Sunday grant is only for forty, and we shall have good and ample accommodation for fifty-five.\n\nLooking forward to a favorable reply.\n\nHonoured Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I see no reason for refusal now that the old objection\u2014the lack of room\u2014is removed.\n\nSince our new buildings are completed we have ample and good accommodation. If our refusal, besides depriving us of the help of which we are in urgent need is at the same time a great disadvantage and drawback, I may not say an injustice to those children not able to receive admittance.\nThe request for the heating apparatus for the said school has been refused by the Department. The same Department has also refused the request for an increase of stipend (Ref. 186721-1 Oct 20th/91) on the grounds that the appropriation for Indian education placed at the disposal of the Indian Dept. for the current year were insufficient to permit of an increase.\n\nThough Mr. Morrison, Indian Agent has already forwarded his estimates for the coming year, I understand there is still time for you to provide for the administration of the more funds for April 1st 1910.

Doctor Phillips has found fault in this connection.\n\nI would also draw your attention to what Nurse LeDrew says regarding the dining room. There is no excuse for this. As you know, this building belongs to the Church and it is their business to see that screens are supplied and that the flies are kept out of the school. We know very well that it is difficult to keep all the flies out but still much could be done that is not done. I consider the condition at this school very unsatisfactory and one that the Department should not pass up lightly.\n\nWe have schools on the Reserve that are a credit to the Department and in the fly season you see very few flies for the simple reason that precautionary measures are taken, and then you go to another school and find things such as they are reported here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

They get better care and supervision from the Sisters. The boys are very dirty and neglected. Spoke to the Principal about this. He says he has great difficulty in getting competent help for the boys' side. Result is the boys' health suffers.\n\n2. Visited the play-room of boys and found it very dirty. Floor was thick with mud, could hardly tell it from the ground outside. Spoke to Principal about this, also to the man who was in charge of boys. The room had not been cleaned up before I left school.\n\n3. Also noticed that quite a number of the boys could not spell their own name when I asked them to do so.

I am urging you to bend every effort to obtain a suitable supervisor for boys' activities and a strong teacher for their classroom. This Department is concerned about the health of our wards and deeply interested in their training for future citizenship. I am sorry that one of our field officers has complained about dirty conditions among the boys and the type of education they are receiving, and I regret the necessity of directing this communication to you.\n\nOur officer reports that the work among the girls is in splendid order, and I trust that by this time conditions on the other side of the house have been improved.\n\nI would further suggest that early next spring screens be supplied for the dining room, in an effort to do away with the large number of flies that bothered the children in this part of the building during the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Beys O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Missionaries for Southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan, has requested me to propose officially to the Department of Indian Affairs, the purchase of Muscowequan Indian Boarding School, at Lestock, Sask.\n\nThis present proposal may be also considered as the answer to the Department's letter, dated February 20th, 1923, to Most Rev. Archbishop Mathieu requesting complete particulars in the matter.\n\nAt the request of Very Rev. Father Beys the following are respectfully submitted to your appreciation:\n\n1o-It is the opinion of Very Rev. Fr Beys and his Administrative Board that $35,000.00 is a very moderate estimate of the value of all the buildings of the Muscowequan School.\n\nThe annexed diagram gives the exact disposition and dimensions of the buildings with their respective valuation. Kindly note that this valuation was made before the war and therefore based on pre-war prices, far below the present ones. We do not doubt that in spite of the necessary depreciation since said valuation was made the buildings are worth today more than in 1914.\n\n2o-Very Rev. Fr Beys and Administrative Board find that the sum of $6,000.00 mentioned in last year's valuation of Lestock's School (Statement annexed to letter of Very Rev. Fr Beys to Mr. Scott, February 17th, 1923) and intended for cattle, machinery and furniture, is a very fair valuation for the above.\n\n3o-It is also the opinion of Very Rev. Fr Beys and Board that a complete section of land would be required for the School. In fact, it was with this view that the Oblate Administration bought Section 14 of Township 27, Range 15, West of 2nd Meridian, on which the school is presently erected. The price of $20.00 an acre (or $12,800.00 for the whole section) is very moderate and should appeal to the Department. Moreover the accompanying plan of Township 27, Range 15-W.2nd M., shows that Section 14 is entirely enclosed in the Muscowequan Reserve and should, therefore, as a matter of good policy and to regularize the plan of the Reserve, be purchased by the Department.\n\nTo sum up the amounts above proposed viz:\n\nMain building and outbuildings $35,000.00\nCattle, machinery, furniture $6,000.00\nLand: Section 14-Tp 27-R 15-W.2 M. $12,800.00\n\nwe reach a total of $53,800.00\nand offer the School building and outbuildings, the cattle, machinery, furniture, and the land as described for said sum or better for $55,000.00 as indicated last year.\n\nYou will note on the enclosed plan of Township 27 that, besides Section 14, the Oblate Missionaries own the whole of Section 25, W.\u00bd of Section 23, legal subdivision N.\u00bd of legal subdivision 2 and legal subdivision 7 and 8 of Section 22. All those lands are used for the benefit of the school and could be sold to the Department but as the outlay (1099 acres at $18.00; $16,485.00) would be a substantial addition to the amount above proposed we do not think proper, for the present, to suggest the purchase of land outside of Section 14.\n\nI understand that the sum of $35,000.00 has been placed in the Main Estimates in view of buying a R.C. Indian Boarding School. That amount falls short by $20,000.00 from the sum presently asked. I am confident that you will be in a position to enclose this balance in the Supplementary Estimates or that the appropriations in the Main Estimates will allow your securing the amount from the general vote.\n\nI take the liberty to propose, in the name of Very Rev. Fr. Boys O.M.I., Inspector Murison as Government valuator for this School. Mr. Murison has been, for a long time Indian Agent on the Reserve and he is perfectly conversant with the situation and all other circumstances. Moreover, he can be relied upon as a fair and impartial valuator.\n\nKindly consider this present letter as the official request from the Oblate Administration for the purchase of Muscoweguan Indian Boarding School.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter the same effective attention as that given to the purchase of Kenora Indian Boarding School in 1922, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted your suggestions - made on behalf of His Grace Archbishop Mathieu and Very Rev. Father Pey. The valuation of $55,800.00 can be verified in the near future by giving a commission of appraisal to an independent valuator.\n\nThere was provided by Parliamentary Appropriation the sum of $35,000.00 for the purchase this fiscal year of Indian residential school property from the Roman Catholic Church. My suggestion is that we proceed with the transfer of the Muscowequan School, and when you give us title to the property in question - Sec. 14, T.27, R.16, W. 2nd Md., on which the school buildings are situated - the Department, with the approval of His Excellency in Council, will make a payment of $35,000.00, and will direct an official letter agreeing to give the Oblate Fathers the balance of the purchase price as soon as funds are provided for the purpose.\n\nIt is not the present intention of the Honourable The Minister to ask for a supplementary appropriation for Indian Education this fiscal year, and I regret to state it is unlikely that sufficient funds could be found in our current Vote to complete the purchase price for this property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nIn connection with the purchase of a residential school the following steps should be taken, after funds have been provided:\n\n1. Get a description of the property.\n2. Secure the name of a valuator from the Minister.\n3. Give the commission of appraisal.\n4. Get the Dept. of Justice to have their agent search the title and submit a draft transfer. (Mr. Williams).\n5. After the title is searched, arrange for an Order in Council for the authority to purchase (Mr. Moffat).\n6. Get Receiver General's cheque, payable to the Dept. of Justice's agent and the vendor, jointly. (Mr. Paget.)\n7. Send cheque to the Dept. of Justice.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The property is owned by the Oblate Fathers, with whom we have been negotiating. The Church authorities own nearly three sections of land at Lestock, but it is our intention to purchase only Sec. 14, Tp. 27, R. 15, W. 2., on the northwest quarter of which the school is situated.\n\nBefore final arrangements can be made with the owners, I wish to have a valuation of the property by an independent valuator, and I should be pleased if you would undertake the commission of appraisal for the Department. The valuation should show the actual present value of the property, i.e., 640 acres in Sec. 14, the main and other buildings, furniture, stock and machinery. It is the Department's wish that the transfer be completed in the near future, and I shall be pleased if you will undertake this work at your earliest convenience. Please advise me if you will act for us in this connection, and indicate the probable date of your valuation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. W.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with my former letter, I have made a valuation of the farm, buildings, stock, implements, etc., a full itemized statement of which is enclosed herewith. I have gone into the whole matter fully.\n\nIn submitting the value of the buildings I have taken measurements and detail as fully as possible, not having specifications to work on.\n\nIn preparing value I have taken material prices as at Saskatoon, which I found was practically the same as at Lestock, any difference being made up by haulage from Lestock to the farm, figuring on the same basis as I did when contracting and building.\n\nYou will notice I have added 10 per cent. to material for contractor's profits, and deducted 15 per cent. depreciation from the total on all buildings. While this may not appear to be a fair depreciation, I decided, owing to the good condition of the Girls' Building, that if I made it 15 per cent. all round, the amount would be reasonable.\n\nI might mention that with the exception of the Implement Shed and Granary, all the buildings were well constructed and\nin good condition; the outside of all buildings need re-painting and the floor and shingles of Chapel and floor of Boys' Building are in a poor condition.\n\nThere is an item of $6,500.00 at the bottom of statement of Girls' Building, which covers steam-heating, plumbing, etc., as per the attached note which I received from Rev. Father Guy. This is the only specification I have been able to secure and I think covers cost of septic tank.\n\nIn valuing the Implements and Household Furniture I took cash prices from International Harvester's price-list and T.Eaton's catalogue, and have taken off 25% per cent. for depreciation.\n\nThe Live Stock is of very good quality, and I have valued same, not at what it would bring on the market today (except the steers), but at what I consider it worth for operating the farm and as breeding stock.\n\nFarm Lands. I find there is about 560 acres of good quality land; the balance, 80 acres, being largely slough, with poor land surrounding it. These lands adjoin those owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company which sell at $15.00 per acre. I have therefore considered the cultivation of the land, and would place a valuation of $20.00 per acre - 640 acres at $20.00, $12,800.00; making a total value of $78,756.35\n\nHoping you will find this report in order, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nI have examined the Auditor General's reports for the last 20 years and the late files, with reference to departmental expenditure at the Muscovequan Indian Residential School, other than per capita grant. And I find that our expenditure for equipment and plant is inconsiderable. Horses (1907-08) $600, and well (1922-23) $400. I propose making enquiries relative to the land, owned by the Oblates, with a view to ascertaining if the Crown or the Indian Band released any of it for a nominal consideration.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Caswell's valuation, in the literary matter he refers to the value of the land (640 acres) as $12,500, ($20 per acre). In his recapitulation of values, \"Farm Lands\" reads $17,800. His page 18 contains \"Bedding,\" totalling $601, and \"Other Linens,\" totalling $168. These items could hardly be allowed. I am also in doubt as to whether or not the Department supplied either or both of the two typewriters, valued at $350. \"Children's clothing, totalling $5592,\" cannot be allowed.\n\nIn Mr. Caswell's recapitulation he did not include the chapel, which he values at $2158. I have checked the additions and deductions and found them correct in some cases.\n\nR.F.A.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Caswell:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 7th instant, covering your valuation in detail of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School property. I have noted the care which you have exercised in the matter of appraisal and I am pleased to have your explanation of some of the items.\n\nIn your letter you have mentioned that the value of the farm is $12,800 - 640 acres at $20; in the recapitulation farm lands are valued at $17,800. I should be pleased if you would throw light on this apparent oversight. On page 12, covering the building known as the chapel, I find a valuation of $2,158 which does not appear in your recapitulation. Please indicate whether or not the chapel was intentionally omitted. I am returning the second copy of the valuation, so that you can make any changes that may arise out of the subject matter of this communication. I also draw your attention to apparent inaccuracies in addition on pages 1 (the recapitulation), 6, 10 and 19.\n\nIn your covering letter of the 7th instant your opening words are: \"In accordance with my former letter.\" I regret that the Department has no record of having received this communication from you and I should be pleased if you would send me a copy so that our files will be complete.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. W. Caswell, Esq.,\nSaskatoon,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nTravelling Nurse I. M. Lucas, in a report on her visit to the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, in August, last, states that the children at this school do not get the proper nourishing food, or enough. They get no milk and no vegetables, except potatoes, and very small portions.\n\nI have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the principal. You should point out to him that it is expected that the children will receive a sufficient quantity of nourishing food, also that an ample supply of milk will be furnished for the use of the younger children, especially. I shall be pleased if you will obtain a daily diet sheet, showing the food supplied the children for a period of one week, and forward the same for the information of the Department.\n\nThe travelling nurse further drew attention to the poor ventilation in the dormitory, in the old part of the building, for the number of children sleeping in the room. You should draw this matter to the attention of the principal and it may be possible that, by utilizing the windows, more air can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. B. Hardinge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nHIS NO. 312-11, dated Sept. 15, 1923.\n\nOriginal on File 121-5-6.\n\nI understand the Department are negotiating for the purchase of this school and I hope no deal will be put through without first having a report from a competent inspector as to the suitability of the building for school purposes. It would be too bad to spend a lot of money on a building not adapted to our work and I think perhaps this building comes under this class to a certain extent. One thing I am sure and that is if the school is to be made modern it will take a lot of money to do it.

I have noted the care which you have exercised in the matter of appraisal and I am pleased to have your explanation of some of the items.\n\nIn your letter you have mentioned that the value of the farm is $12,800 - 640 acres at $20; in the recapitulation farm lands are valued at $17,800. I should be pleased if you would throw light on this apparent oversight. On page 12, covering the building known as the chapel, I find a valuation of $2,158 which does not appear in your recapitulation. Please indicate whether or not the chapel was intentionally omitted. I am returning the second copy of the valuation, so that you can make any changes that may arise out of the subject matter of this communication. I also draw your attention to apparent inaccuracies in addition on pages 1 (the recapitulation), 6, 10 and 19.\n\nIn your covering letter of the 7th instant your opening words are: \"In accordance with my former letter.\" I regret that the Department has no record of having received this communication from you and I should be pleased if you would send me a copy so that our files will be complete.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR.

I left Saskatoon Sept 25th for California travelling by auto and find your letter here. I hope it has not caused any inconvenience.\n\nI have checked over the statements and corrected the errors.\n\nThe error in the value of the land was made by typing a 7 instead of a 2 and in looking it over I missed the error. Any letters in stating the value of the land at twenty dollars per acre was correct.\n\nWhen writing me again address Campbell Cal.\n\nYours Truly,\nPitt Carwell\nOttawa, Oct 23/1923\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Adding this to his total of $71,205.85 gives a valuation of $73,363.85. Miscellaneous equipment, totalling $2,537, should have deducted a total of $735.20, the value of the bedding at the institution; the item for children's clothes of $5,606 cannot be allowed, making a total deduction of $6,334.20. Therefore Mr. Caswell's valuation of the property that we should pay for, if we purchase the school in its entirety, is $67,024.15.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The children themselves are averse to returning, the girl Delia, aged 16 years, complains that improper proposals were made to her by Father Poulette of the school referred to, when she was working in his office at the school, the boys Fred and Emile aged 14 and 15 years respectively say they have received no education in the past six years, being unable to read or write at all, and were employed wholly at farm work at the school.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and the fact that Malboeuf and his wife are half-breed immigrant Indians from the U.S.A., arriving in this country in 1897, I thought it advisable seeing that they are not treaty Indians, to report these circumstances before taking any action in the way of detaining and escorting of these children back to the school.\n\nMalboeuf and his wife are very respectable people of their kind, and the children are being well taken care of in the meanwhile.\n\n(Signed) Sergeant,\n(T.W.

INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON,\nDATED MARCH 6th, 1925, ON THE TOUCHWOOD AGENCY.\n\nMUSCOGEQUAN SCHOOL.\n\nI noted a great change in this school since Father Poulet has taken charge there. He has done a lot of changing around in the building and everything now is in first-class order. There is also a great improvement in the appearance of the children. They are evidently well cared for, and are receiving a much better training than they were when I first visited this institution.\nWE, the undersigned Indians belonging to the Poorman Band, plead for higher education for our children. We find that our school officers do not take our children on to the higher grades, but as soon as they are fit to go to a higher grade the child has to set out to work until of age to leave the school. We regret to find that the officials of the Indian Department do not allow an Indian child to have any more than a very poor education. We know that if an Indian child can be trained and given a good education there is no reason why he should not succeed in any profession or business. We would like to say with regard to a boarding school to which our children go that they do not get any education higher than grade 5, and some of them do not go higher than grade 3, and when they come out of school they know nothing to start to make a living with. We do not want our children to go to school to learn to work, but to get an education. We can teach them to work on the Reserve outside of school work, and we do not think our children get good teaching at the school, and we would like the Department to look into the matter.\nMEMORANDUM FOR Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Paediek Brothers-Lestock,\nS.W.17 & S.W.18-27-14-2nd\n\nKindly accept our best thanks for your letter of the 23rd June.\n\nR.Wells.\nTo Mr. D.

Father Magnan and Father Guy are in town today and are going to discuss with me, likely tomorrow, the needs of the work.

As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now that he is occupying the new building he wishes that the Department would consider allowing him the grant for the whole 67 of his number of pupils, or whatever the average may be at the end of this quarter. He is under a lot of extra expense due to the move and if he can get the grant for the March quarter for his full list of pupils it will assist him greatly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, March 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School to be allowed per capita grant on the average attendance of pupils at the school during the current quarter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will allow a grant for the average attendance up to 67 pupils for the quarter ending the 31st instant. After that date, and when the new school building is in operation, grant will be provided for an average attendance up to 100 pupils.

Their books are well kept, and\nall work neatly set down.\n\nThe classroom was well aired and tidy.\nThe children were clean and all well\ndressed. The girls were all dressed alike, and they\nlooked exceptionally well.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Sister\nCraft, and I found 21 present, 8 boys and 13 girls.

(RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-1, part 1)\nMUSCOGEQUAN R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe Sister is greatly interested in her work, and I feel that the children are being given a good start. They are not shy, and speak out well. Here, as in the senior room, the girls were all dressed alike, and were neat and tidy in appearance. The boys were well dressed.\n\nNeedless to say, the school could scarcely be better cared for, and is perfectly clean from top to bottom. The work in the various departments is all under capable supervision, and splendid work is being done. The kitchen is supervised by Sister Goyette, and here the girls are taught all kinds of cooking, bread making, as well as the art of butter making.\n\nThe girls are also taught to milk, as well as to do gardening, and I believe receive a splendid all around training, which should fit them well for life on the reserve.\n\nThe farming operations are supervised by Mr. Dahl who does excellent work. I have always found the farm work well done and up-to-date, and Mr. Dahl appears very successful in the handling of Indian boys.\n\nA large herd of cattle is kept, from which the milk cows are selected, and at no time have I found any shortage of milk.\n\nSteers are fed during the winter, and this spring a carload of fat stock was shipped. Hogs and poultry are raised with good success, and are a wonderful help to the food supply needed for such an institution. The training received by the boys should be of great assistance in later life.\n\nThe ground\nMUSCOGEQUAN R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe ground in front of the new building has been graded and laid out for a proper driveway, with beds for flowers and shrubs. A great amount of work has been done, and I have no doubt this will be one of the finest residential schools in the West.\n\nThe laundry, which I understand is to be in the frame portion of the old school, has not yet been finished, but it is hoped that this work will be carried out before school opens in September.\n\nThe Principal, the Rev. Father Poulet, is assisted by three men and eight women, all of whom are well qualified to carry out their duties.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision Sub-District Detachment\nDEPOT YORKTON RUNNICHY\n\nDistrict S.S.D.\n\nDate June 21st, 1931\n\nFyle References\nRe: Attendance at Opening of Muscowequan Indian Reserve School, Muscowequan Reserve.\nRequest of Indian Department Officials.\n\nHeadquarters\nRelative to the above, I beg to report that I was requested to be present at the opening of above School on the 17th inst., by J.W.

The Reverend Principal was so advised in official letter of July 14th, 1931, on File 121-5-3.\nOpening of Muscowequan Indian School at Lestock\n\nLestock, Sask., June 30.\u2014The new Industrial School at Lestock, which cost $250,000, was formally opened today by His Grace Archbishop McGulgan was present, and after the High Mass confirmed forty Indian children. His Grace spoke to the children and gave an address about the new Church; he blessed the building to be devoted by those in charge to the future welfare of the Indian children.\n\nThe building is three stories and at present accommodates seventy-five pupils. In connection with the school there is a very large farm upon which the boys learn what is necessary for them to know about agriculture. The farm work is carried on entirely by the boys of the school.\n\nThe first formal ceremony on Thursday was the handing over of the keys to Commissioner Graham to Rev. Father Poulet, O.M.I., principal of the school. Father Poulet in accepting the keys dedicated the building and earnestly promised that at all times those in charge of the school would do their utmost for the advancement and betterment of the Indian children.\n\nA banquet was served to the visitors. His Grace Archbishop McGulgan was seated at the head table, flanked on the right by Commissioner Graham, of the Indian Department, who represented the Federal Government, and on his left Dr. J. H. Ball, Deputy Minister of Education, representing the Premier of the Province and Minister of Education. Rev. Father Poulet was the idea behind the present Archbishop McGulgan, Commissioner Graham and Mr. Ball, in responding to toasts, spoke in a most praiseworthy manner of the great work accomplished by the Oblate Fathers in their work among the Indians. The Grey Nuns and their grand spirit of sacrifice and care for souls were not forgotten by the speakers.\n\nMuscowequan History\n\nFather Tache, later Archbishop Tache, in the year 1866, said the first Mass on the very spot upon which the school stands today. Archbishop Tache himself tells us in his \"Twenty Years on the Missions,\" that he stopped at Touchwood, and exercised the ministry in the month of August, 1864. \"When the Indians visited, they leave something to God,\" as the holy Cure d'Ars said. In 1891 Father (now Magr.) Campeau worked among the half-breeds in these parts\u20141891-95. Father Campeau was visiting this mission two or three times a year, dwelling among the Indians, after their own fashion, as it was not until 1895 that the old stone church was erected, and was of its kind in this country. In 1897 (July) the first Sisters of Charity came to the mission, among whom was Rev. Sister Valarie who had just finished her novitiate after making vows at the Normal School in St. Boniface, she is again on the teaching staff of the present institution. From that time on, residing priest has always remained at the school.\n\nThe conversion of Indians was due to Father Campeau, Poulet and Valarie who left to successors the fruits of their own zealous ministry. In 1925 the school, formerly the property of the Oblate Fathers, was sold to the Department of Administration, remaining with the Oblates. In 1925 a request was made by Rev. Father Poulet for a new school, which owing to the kind assistance of the late Archbishop O. Mathieu, was granted in 1928, a school being definitely approved by Duncan, the Commissioner of Indian Department.\n\nAny article failing to recognize the part played by Rev. Father Poulet, O.M.I., in the history of this school, would not be complete, nor even true to facts. To Father Poulet, a son dear to credit is the school, conversions have been renewed, and the former antipathy of the Indians to school life, and, indeed, to this one, has been vanquished. And if a magnificent up-to-date building now replaces the old one, it is largely due to Father Poulet's indefatigable zeal and energy, and his unstring solicitude for the welfare of the Indians and their children, a people ever beloved by the Oblate Order.\nDear Father Poulet;-\n\nI enclose an account of $50.00 from Dr. A.E. Whitmore for medical services to Frank Doll. This is not an account I can certify as being on account of the Department, though if you take it up with Ottawa direct yourself they might consider it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev J.

Aug. 8, 1931.\n\nDuncan Scott,\nDeputy Minister\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Frank Doll, our engineer, was badly burnt in the fire which destroyed our school on July the 29th. He has received medical attention from Dr. A.E. Whitmore from Kelliher Dr. J.B. Tucker, our local medical officer, being absent.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Department will shoulder the expenditure - this man having lost all his furnitures besides having to meet hospital bills - and all this through devotedness to one of your institutions. Please, advise and oblige,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S.- I cannot honestly charge the school budget for this extra Expenditure owing to the great losses in the farm operations of the two last years.\n\n$50.\nOttawa, August 13, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 8th instant, with enclosures, relative to the Doctor's expenses of the engineer at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, who was burned in the recent fire. I regret the regulations are such that the Department cannot consider expenses of this nature in the case of an employee of the school. These employees are not Civil Servants, as they are engaged by the management of the school or the church authorities.\n\nUnless the members of the staff at your school come under the Provincial Workmen's Compensation Board, I believe the Doctor's account, which I am returning, will have to be paid from school or church funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the TOUGHWOOD INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 10, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at TOUGHWOOD AGENT Oct. 10, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTOUCHWOOD AGENCY\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Jan. 12th, 1944\n\nPuzzochy, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nPUNNICHY, SASK.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this April 4th 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Misceganet Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MISSIONARY BOARD RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended December 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the LESTOCK SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscovequan Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MUSCOGEEAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL LESTOCK, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered as per Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the MUSCOGEEAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL LESTOCK, SASK., School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal V.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Res.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscovequan Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Huron Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 30 Sept. 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return, the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at TOUCHWOOD AGENCY this SEP 30, 1947\n\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at this place, Punnichy, Sask., 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the Within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date] 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at TOUCHWOOD AGENCY APR 1 1946 this Punnichy, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sasawagan Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30th, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at TOOWINWOOD AGENCY JULY 4, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nTOUGHWOOD AGENCY\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Punnichy, Sask.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended...December 31st...19...\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated...December 31st...19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent........................................................\n\nDated at..............................................................\n\nthis.................................................................19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated June 30th, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this 2nd day of July, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS     | AGE | BOY | GIRL | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0395            | Stevenson Clara    | 16  | 1   | 0   | Cote                    | 21,9,47                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0396            | Kay Edna           | 9   | 1   | 0   | Peorman                 | 8,10,47                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0397            | Akan Rosa          | 7   | 1   | 0   | Muscowequan             | 1,1,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0398            | Ernest Gelina      | 16  | 1   | 0   | Jack Fish               | 28,1,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0399            | Ernest Virginia    | 14  | 1   | 0   |                         | 28,1,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0401            | Simaginis Lina     | 10  | 1   | 0   | Pundmaker               | 28,1,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0402            | Mahigens Josephine | 8   | 1   | 0   | Muscowequan             | 12,5,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0404            | Bruce Corinne      | 9   | 1   | 0   |                         | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0405            | Desjarlais Doris   | 7   | 1   | 0   | Peorman                 | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0406            | Assapace Helen     | 8   | 1   | 0   |                         | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0408            | Stevenson Julia    | 14  | 1   | 0   | Cote                    | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0409            | Kiteimonia Lenora  | 11  | 1   | 0   | Kesjeekons              | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0410            | Queesanoe Gloria   | 16  | 1   | 0   |                         | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0411            | Queesanoe Mary A.  | 14  | 1   | 0   |                         | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0412            | Gordon Pearl       | 8   | 1   | 0   | Gordon                  | 1,10,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0415            | Muskegon Elizabeth | 14  | 1   | 0   | Nut Lake                | 6,11,48                    | 91 / 56    |\n| 0414            | Bitternose Verna   | 12  | 1   | 0   | Gordon                  | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0415            | Bitternose Gora    | 10  | 1   | 0   |                         | 5,9,48                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0416            | Singoose Margaret  | 14  | 1   | 0   | Cote                    | 6,1,49                     | 91 / 56    |\n| 0417            | Nanakawetang Delvina | 7   | 1   | 0   | Fish Lake               | 26,3,49                    | 91 / 56    |\n\nTOTALS 16 64 96 TOTALS 33 25 2617 2416 11\n\nNOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of columns.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the total placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Punnichey, this October 5th,

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pacing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils appearing on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nthis\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202619\u2026\u2026\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 9th, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Minawegun Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1932.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30th 1932\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Punnichy this 20th December 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 257             | Wolf Joe Wm.          | 15  | 1   |      | Muscowequan    |                    |                         | 4-2-46                     | 92         |\n| 286             | Manitopies Vincent    | 15  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 2-4-45                     | 92         |\n| 301             | Bruce Louis           | 14  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 2-9-45                     | 92         |\n| 292             | Bigsky Jim Isidore    | 14  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 1-30-45                    | 92         |\n| 298             | Marigen John          | 13  | 1   |      | Poorman        |                    |                         | 1-9-45                     | 92         |\n| 308             | Swain Ronald          | 14  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 27-10-40                   | 92         |\n| 322             | Swain Lloyd           | 12  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 27-10-45                   | 92         |\n| 304             | Akan Frank K.         | 12  | 1   |      | Muscowequan    |                    |                         | 1-9-47                     | 92         |\n| 305             | Bigsky Wilfrid        | 12  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 1-9-47                     | 92         |\n| 306             | Pasbrun Baptist       | 13  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         | 1-9-47                     | 92         |\n| 308             | Longman Martin        | 12  | 1   |      | Gordon         |                    |                         | 1-9-47                     | 92         |\n| 309             | Wolf Joseph           | 12  | 1   |      | Muscowequan    |                    |                         | 1-9-47                     | 92         |\n| 316             | Nippi Francis         | 12  | 1   |      | Kinistino      |                    |                         | 1-11-47                    | 92         |\n| 328             | Bruce Lawrence        | 12  | 1   |      | Muscowequan    |                    |                         | 5-9-48                     | 92         |\n| 329             | Manitopies Jos.

After making inquiries I have decided that the equipment should be supplied, but I may say that I am disappointed to see that the Department are only willing to supply mattress covers, that are to be filled with hay or straw, instead of the regular mattresses.\n\nWhen I visited the Duck Lake School the Sisters brought to my attention the matter of having to use straw filled mattresses and they were very much opposed to this, pointing out that it would be impossible to keep the dust and the straw when it became pulverized from going through the mattress covers onto the floors. I also found that the school authorities at the St. Pauls School were disappointed at not getting regular mattresses.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Father Poulet, Principal of the Muscowequan School for which these beds and mattresses are to be supplied, in which he states that hay or straw mattresses may be sanitary, but they are neither comfortable nor clean, neither do they stand the wear and tear, and in his opinion they are not worth the trouble. He would rather not have anything at all if he is not to be supplied with regular mattresses, and, personally, I more or less agree with the Principal. I would rather pay for mattresses myself than to be forced to use these covers.\n\nI know\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI know just what it means to keep beds in proper shape and keep the floors under the beds clean when this type of mattress is used.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department should reconsider this matter and allow the Principal to have mattresses. Father Poulet is a hard working man. He is doing a good work and spending a lot of his own money to make this school a success. In the meantime I am holding the order up and will only buy the beds and not the mattress covers if you cannot see your way clear to supply regular mattresses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A of the 4th instant, with reference to the supplying of twelve new mattress casings for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. I note your remarks regarding this equipment and your recommendation that mattresses be supplied. The Department, after much thought, is giving a trial to mattress casings only at these institutions and I regret that I am not prepared to authorize the purchase of mattresses at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nOn the 4th of November I wrote you with reference to the matter of supplying mattresses for the Indian Boarding School on the Muscowequan Reserve. I have your letter of the 11th ultimo 1925 acknowledging mine, and saying that after much thought the Department is giving a trial to mattress casings only, and that you regret you are unable to authorize the purchase of mattresses at the present time.\n\nThe contents of your letter were conveyed to the Rev. Principal and he now asks me to have mattresses made with the proper filling and asks that the Department make the deduction from the invoices of the cost of material used for the casings, and the school will pay for the filling.\n\nMy opinion is that the Department's attitude in regard to the matter of not supplying mattresses for these institutions is most impractical and unreasonable. I have a letter from Father Delmas of Duck Lake, asking if I could buy him some mattresses. This system may be the means of having the Principals buy their own mattresses, but as for economy and efficiency there is neither.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nG. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A of the 9th instant, with reference to the supplying of mattresses at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. The general question you raise is receiving consideration. I note that the Rev. Principal is desirous of securing mattresses, that he wishes the Department to pay for casings and he will meet the cost of the filling. I regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration, as it is our practice to supply whatever mattresses, casings or bedding are to be allowed only when a school is securing initial equipment. All ordinary replacements should be met by the school management. I realize that the Department has lately given a few beds to this institution, but the school itself should supply whatever pillows, mattresses, etc., are needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the matter of supplying mattresses for the Muscowequan Residential School I do not understand your letter #121-5-5 of the 16th instant, in which you refer to the practice of the Department to supply mattresses etc., only when schools are securing initial equipment, in view of the Department's letter of the 9th October last requesting me to buy for this school twelve additional cots and mattress covers. In my letter of the 9th instant I merely asked if the Department would allow the mattresses to be purchased complete, on the understanding that the Principal of the school would pay the difference in cost between the complete mattresses and the mattress covers only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 31, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A of the 26th instant, with reference to the supplying of mattresses for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. When I wrote on the 16th instant, I overlooked the fact that mattress casings had been authorized. You may purchase twelve institutional beds and mattresses for this school; but the management should pay the difference in cost between the complete mattresses and the mattress covers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, #121-5-5, with reference to supplying mattresses to the Muscowequan Boarding School. In accordance with your instructions the cost of the filling and making of the mattresses will be paid by the Principal of the School and the cost of the covering by the Department. The whole matter in my opinion is trifling, unbusinesslike and unsatisfactory, and I quite agree with the Principal of the Duck Lake School when he was authorized to use casing not to use them but to undergo the expense of either buying mattresses himself or using the old ones.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School in the Touchwood Agency, in which he informs me that he has been advised that the Department do not propose going on with the work of adding an addition to his school during the coming year, and in view of this he makes a request that a building, now used as an employee's residence, be moved to a point close to the main school and be used as a hospital, which would relieve the situation somewhat. Last year I hoped to be able to do this from the funds that were allowed for painting, but the painting used up the full appropriation. The cost of doing this small amount of work would be about $150.00, and I think it would be well spent if the Department have the funds available. I would, therefore, recommend that $150.00 be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 312-11A of the 25th ultimo relative to the request of the Principal that a building now used as an employees' residence be moved to a point close to the main school to be used as a hospital.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of this arrangement being carried out, and will provide an expenditure not exceeding $150 towards the cost of this work.\n\nYou should forward vouchers in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred in the moving of the building which should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

FERRIER\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend Father J. Poulet, O.M.I., Principal of Muscowequan Indian Residential School, has requested me to place before you a couple of items of great importance:\n\n1 - The galvanized Water Tanks providing supply for the School are leaking badly and might be cut off any moment now on that account. An expert reports to me that they are not even fit for repairing. Two new tanks of 500 gals each are necessary.\n\nThis, I presume, is an emergency case and would ask you kindly to rush requisition. I have no idea of how two galvanized-reinforced tanks would cost.\n\n2 - The pigstye needs new flooring altogether. It is sinking and breaking through every day. A prompt action should be taken before the winter in this connection. Provision must be made to take care of the stock on hand. The expenditure for same would amount to about $125.00 the total surface being 44 X 48.\n\nCommissioner W. M. Graham has been advised of these requests by letter of September 22nd. I hope that he has taken up this question with the Department.\n\nMy only purpose in the present instance is to expose the pressing need of the above mentioned request in case Commissioner has not already written.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 7th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the improvements required at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, has been authorized to purchase 2 reinforced galvanized iron tanks, 500 gallons each, as well as to provide for new flooring for the hog pen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I received a long distance telephone call from the Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Boarding School, informing me that the steam pipe on the return line of the heating boiler in the school had burst in several places and he could not get a plumber nearer than Saskatoon, and wanted immediate assistance as he had all the children in the institution and the weather is cold enough to necessitate the building being heated. I sent a plumber from Regina to fix the job up, and he has returned after fixing the pipe, but informs me that there is considerable more work than what he has done which should be undertaken at the school, and a low estimate for this would be $250.00. He points out that two of the closet bowls are broken and cannot be used; these must be attended to. He also adds that the two range basins are in a most unsanitary condition and unfit for further use. There are eight basins in the boys' dormitory and nine in the girls'. These basins have no taps and the connection from the basin to the waste pipe is made with a piece of rubber tubing, which of course is a very poor affair and allows the smell to ooze out and the dormitories are reeking with this odor. Why work of this kind was ever done the plumber cannot understand. He says that this work should be attended to without delay. I would, therefore, recommend that you advise me by wire if I may undertake the expenditure, as the weather has now moderated considerably and we might get the job finished, or at least well under way, before the winter sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Regina Voucher No. 4307 in favour of Messrs. Paulin & Swayze for $712.06, representing work and material in connection with the repairing of plumbing at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nCertain repairs to the plumbing were authorized by the Department, and I instructed Mr. Paulin, the nearest plumber I could get, to go and do the work and supply the material, after having sent a man who was at Touchwood at the time to make a survey as to what was absolutely necessary. While at the school the plumber found that there was a lot more work necessary, and the Rev. Principal took it upon himself to have it done. This is rather a heavy account, but there is no doubt that the plumbing was in very bad shape, and the work which was authorized by the Department was just something that had to be done at the time in order to enable the school to carry on.\n\nI may say that when this building was taken over by the Government the plumbing was in bad shape. I suppose the Department will be prepared to pay this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMUSCOGEEQUAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was not inspected when I made my last inspection in December, as it was quarantined for Smallpox.\n\nThis school is old, and too small to accommodate all the children who wish to attend.\n\nThe children in both class rooms appeared well along in their grades, although only work up to grade V is carried on. The reading was quite loud and clear, and read as though understood. The spelling and arithmetic was also good. It would appear that more advanced work might reasonably\nMuscowequan Indian Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nmight reasonably be expected on the part of some of the older boys and girls. The class rooms were both clean and well ventilated, although the junior room is very small and cramped. The children were exceptionally clean, and their clothing was good.\n\nThe work in the sewing room was well done, and everything kept neat and tidy. In fact, the work in all departments was good, and the order and discipline splendid.\n\nThe furnace will need a new set of grates before another winter as the ones installed last winter have already burned out.\n\nThe boys' playroom is very small, and if a new building is not provided, more playroom accommodation could be made by removing a partition and taking in the dining room now occupied by the Rev. Father. He would like very much to have this done if a new building is not provided before another winter. Several other repairs are needed in connection with floors, and yet if a new school is under consideration, it hardly seems worth while to make these repairs.\n\nBoth the dormitories were clean and the beds were nicely made. All the bedding appeared fresh and clean. Both dormitories are small, especially the boys', and the floors are badly sunk. Individual towels and tooth brushes are supplied to the children in each dormitory.\n\nThe outbuildings are in fairly good shape. However, the floors, both in the cow barn and horse barn, are badly worn and will need renewing. Cement would give far better results, being easier to keep clean and would last indefinitely.\n\nThe horses were in splendid condition and\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\nMuscoweguan Indian Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nwork on the land was well under way. About 70 head of cattle are kept at the school, 10 to 12 being milked for school purposes.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, Mr. Dahl, is an exceptionally good man. He understands farming, and apparently is able to get results from the boys. The work was well up to the mark, and the yards were neat and tidy.\n\nThe children appeared well fed and well clothed. They did not appear overworked, although the work in each department was kept up to the mark. There was no sickness and the children appeared quite happy.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Touchwood agency, which were inspected by Mr Inspector Hamilton last week.\n\nMuscowpetung School\n\nI understand it is not the intention of the Department to proceed with the addition to this school at the present time.\n\nI do not know that the Department should be called upon to supply new furnace grates. It seems to me that this should be a matter for the school to look after.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nStatement of Account Re-Inspection of Boiler and chimney sweeping by A.O.L.

Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1927.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed account covering the cost of the inspection of the boiler and for cleaning chimneys, etc., at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. In this connection, I beg to say that the Department can only be responsible for payment for the actual cost of the boiler inspection and for the sixty joints of pipe supplied. The school authorities should be responsible for the payment for the cleaning of the chimneys. You should prepare and forward new vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the charge made for the inspection of the boiler and for the pipe.\n\nI enclose a copy of a communication from the boiler inspector. You will note the recommendations made by him regarding the chimney from the ceiling of the boys' dormitory, the renewing of the grates in the furnace and lining for range in the kitchen. In connection with the Inspector's recommendations, I have to request that you will furnish an estimate of the cost of having the work, as mentioned by him, carried out. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the work being performed. Your early attention to this matter will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. S. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nFurther to my letter of the 27th ultimo I beg to report that I have now received a quotation of $11.39 for firebox linings for the range at the Muscowequan Boarding School. The Western Foundry Co., of Wingham, Ontario, are the manufacturers of this range and it was from them that I received this figure. As regards the new grates for the furnace I have not been able to locate the makers, but I am advised by the Ashdown Company of Winnipeg that it would be just as satisfactory if $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch boiler plate were placed on top of the old grates, that is two plates set $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch apart so as to allow for draught. The cost would be approximately $12.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the fire box lining required for the range at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.

It is noted that the estimate received by you for supplying same is $11.39.\n\nIf you consider it would be satisfactory, you may arrange to have 1/4\" boiler plate supplied and placed on top of the old grates in the furnace. We note that the cost will be approximately $12.\n\nPlease arrange for the supplying of the above equipment at an early date, and forward certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We have such a system at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and I would recommend that punch clocks be purchased for the Muscowequan Boarding School at once. The Principal of the latter school was in to see me today, and informs me that he has a night watchman, but has no means of checking him up, although he has no reason to believe that he is not doing his duty.\n\nThe question of having night watchmen at all our schools is, to my mind, a very important one, and I would urge the Department to give consideration to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The Reverend Principal called at my office on or about the 12th of October and advised me that it was out of order and needed repairing and I authorized this expenditure.\n\nAfter the generator had been returned to the school and put into use again, it was found that it was not giving satisfactory service and did not properly charge the batteries. I yesterday received a telephone call from the Principal explaining the situation and advising me that an expert, who had visited the school, recommends that a new one be purchased and installed. The present one is of 900 watt capacity. The one recommended to replace it will be of 1\u00bd K.W. capacity, and I have ascertained will cost approximately $160.00. I have not yet been able to ascertain whether the old generator will be taken over in part payment, but whatever arrangements can be made along these lines will be made. The lighting service now at the school is very unsatisfactory, and the Principal has asked that authority may be given by telegram to purchase the larger unit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMUSCOGEQUAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on March 12th, and found everything in its usual good condition. The school throughout was spotless, and the work in all departments good.\n\nThe classroom work is carried on in the junior room by Sister Valade, and in the senior room by Sister Mary of the Cross. The children appeared well up in their grades, and the discipline was excellent.\n\nI found the fire escapes in good condition. The fire extinguishers had been re-filled and were in prominent places. The fire hose are in poor condition, and I found one bracket in the main hall without any. This one should be replaced and, in addition, two others, all to be 50 ft. in length.\n\nSome of the floors are badly in need of repair as they are worn through in places. These should be repaired, as well as some patch work on the plaster. No money was estimated for this school as the Rev. Principal expected a new wing to be built this year as well as the old one remodeled.\n\nI found\nI found the laundry one of the poorest, and with the least equipment of any school I have inspected. The floor is cement, which is badly broken and rough. The water is heated in \"feed cookers\" and no power machinery is used.\n\nThe outbuildings are in fair repair, with the exception of the horse barn, which needs re-flooring. The old floor is of plank and is worn through in places. This is dangerous for the horses as the floor is off the ground nearly a foot. This place should be filled with gravel and a cement floor put in, which would make a permanent fixture.\n\nSome very fine horses are kept at this school, as well as a large number of cattle. At present they are milking 10 head, all of which freshened within the last six weeks. I believe there is never any shortage of milk.\n\nA large flock of hens is also kept, and at the time of my inspection they were receiving 80 to 90 eggs a day. Father Poulet informed me the children were given eggs two to three times a week.\n\nThere appeared a shortage of large girls at this school and the Rev. Father Poulet considered that washing by hand and the mixing of all bread, along with the other work required, made too much for the girls, and asked that he be provided with a bread mixer. This, of course, could be moved if at any time a new wing was built.\n\nIn this\nMUSCOGEEQUAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nIn this school there is an excellent staff and I believe the boys are receiving the best of instruction with regards to farming.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., March 30th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection of the various schools in the Touchwood Agency which was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton.\n\nYou will notice that the laundry at the Muscowequan School is in very poor shape. This school is, I understand, one that the Church expects the Department to make an addition to. In that case the question of the laundry and other repairs could be gone into.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 10, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 312-11 of the 30th ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the various schools in the Touchwood Agency.\n\nRelative to the Muscowequan School, it is noted from the Inspector's report that the fire hose are in poor condition. You may arrange for the purchase and replacement of the quantity of fire hose which you consider necessary for the use of this school. The cost for the purpose should be kept as low as possible.\n\nThe Department is arranging for the supplying of a dough mixer.\n\nRelative to the resementing of the laundry floor and the reflooring of the horse barn, I beg to refer you to your letter of the 28th ultimo and the Department's reply thereto of the 2nd instant, authorizing you to incur an expenditure not exceeding approximately $200 in the purchase of the cement, etc., the labour to be provided by the school staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You were requested in my letter of the 23rd ultimo asking you to quote to state the horse power of the gasoline engine required to operate this mixer and also the size of the pulley required.

While a 2 h.p. electric motor is ample for this work, we have found on several occasions that a 2 h.p. gasoline engine is hardly strong enough and in order to secure 100% efficiency from this machine we believe it would be necessary to use a 3 h.p. gasoline engine.\n\nWe are sending under separate cover a copy of our bakers machinery catalogue which gives details of our bake-shop equipment and assure you it will be a pleasure to give you further details at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPENDRITH MACHINERY CO., LIMITED.\n\nPresident.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding your application to be supplied with a dough mixer for the use of the Muscovequan Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the Pendrith Machinery Co. Ltd., Toronto, state that they can supply a 1 bbl. type \"M\" belt drive dough mixer, F.O.B. Lestock, Sask., for the sum of $315.00. Canopy top for this machine would be $25.00 additional. This firm state that they would recommend that a 3 H.P. gasoline engine be used to operate this mixer. The Department is favourably disposed to consider the supplying of the dough mixer, but consider that the school authorities should be responsible for the purchase of the 3 H.P. gasoline engine. I shall be pleased if you will state whether, in the event of the Department supplying the dough mixer, the school will be prepared to provide the cost of the gasoline engine to operate same. Your early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Poulet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nMuscovequan Indian Res. School,\nLestock, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th ultimo No. 121-5-5, in which you authorized an expenditure of $200.00 to purchase material for repairs to the stable and laundry at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I am informed that $200.00 will not begin to purchase the necessary material, as it has been found since the old floor in the stable has been taken up that the beams & the stalls have all rotted away and will have to be renewed, and that the pillars holding the loft floor have also rotted and must be renewed, and while the Principal has given the time of two of his men, it is impossible for him to do all the work, especially the laying of the cement and the carpentry work, which require an expert. There is about 500 feet of flooring to be repaired, in addition to some plastering, and it will take at least $450.00 to complete the work. I should be glad to see this amount authorized, as I feel sure the Principal is doing all he possibly can in the way of furnishing labour, and it would be hardly fair to expect to encroach on the time of men who are working in the fields. There will be no slack time from now on for the men who are working on the land. When seeding is completed they will have summerfallowing to do and after that comes haying. This school is doing good work and I should like to see it encouraged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection it is noted that, since the old floors in the stable have been taken up, it is found that the cost of making the repairs will be greater than was at first stated in your letter of March 28th, last. The Department will approve of the increased expenditure required, not exceeding the sum of $450, in the completion of these repairs, which is to include the cost of all material and any labour other than that performed by the school staff.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, accounts in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded in the usual manner, covering the cost incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have had a visit from Father Poulet, Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, who made a special trip in to see me regarding his lighting plant, which is out of order. The school is practically without light at the present time, and this, of course, must be remedied without delay.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Moore, our Agent at Punnichy, made a report to the Department, recommending that the work of repairing the batteries be placed in the hands of Messrs. Motherwell & Swan, of Punnichy. These people undertook to do the work, but from the information I gather from Inspector Hamilton and the Principal, instead of improving the condition of the plant they have made it worse. When Mr. Hamilton paid a recent visit to this school, the Principal brought the matter to his attention, and he called upon Messrs. Motherwell & Swan to again overhaul the batteries and put them in proper working condition. This they attempted to do, but Father Poulet tells me today that the batteries are absolutely useless, and asks that immediate action be taken.\n\nI think perhaps it would be advisable when matters of this kind come up, to advise this office. I would never have agreed to have local men fix these batteries, as it takes real experts to put batteries in repair in most cases, especially when they have been in a run-down condition, as these were. We have had a lot of experience with run-down and worn-out batteries, and nine times out of ten we find that\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nit is not advisable to spend money on them in the way of repairing, but that the better plan is to renew them entirely. I do not know the exact amount of money that was given to Messrs. Motherwell & Swan, but whatever amount it was I consider that it is just money lost, and in future I should be glad if in the matter of repairs to lighting plants you would see that the instructions come to me. I would be able then to deal with the firms in the City who are in that business. In the meantime I would ask that I be granted authority to purchase a complete set of new batteries for the Muscowequan School, at a cost of about $420.00. This is the price quoted for the best batteries; we can buy cheaper ones, but this would not be economy. I may point out that when I made enquiries regarding the batteries I was told by experts here that unless they are placed in the hands of men who thoroughly understand the business and who have proper instruments they are more often destroyed than repaired.\n\nI should be glad to have a wire from you authorizing this purchase, as you will understand that the situation is critical.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I find that my difficulty in dealing immediately and favourably with the above demands is that necessities of the work conducted by your Church in other parts of the country are more pressing and must be given the earliest attention.\n\nIt would not be proper for me to make any definite promises on behalf of the Honourable the Superintendent General or to forecast what Parliament may appropriate in future; but, so far as I am concerned, I am hopeful of being able to give more favourable consideration to these representations a year from now.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C.

Principal that I would prepare a rough sketch of a layout for a new School. I am sending you today, under separate cover, two blue print copies of a rough sketch plan, and I would ask you to please show this to the Principal and return one copy to me on which you might indicate any changes that the Principal desires in the layout. The building is planned to accommodate 100 pupils. You will note that I have carried out his suggestion in placing the baths on the floors adjacent to the dormitories. When the building is erected it is the intention to demolish all of the old building with the exception of the frame building, which I have shown connected to the new building by a passage. It will be my intention to locate the laundry in the basement of the existing frame building, also the electric lighting plant. I would be glad to have these plans back as soon as possible.\n\nI would like to express my sincere thanks to you for your kindness to me while at Punnichy, and I hope to be able to visit Punnichy when the Gordon's School is completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I have just returned from a visit to the Rev. Father Paulett who went over the sketches with me and was much pleased with them. There are one or two minor changes such as sizes of some of the staff rooms, that he suggests, but he wishes to take the blueprints into Winnipeg tomorrow, to show his church authorities, so I am delaying the return of a copy for a few days until I hear finally from him.\n\nI understand from the Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuscoweyan Indian Residential School\nLestock Sask., Dec. 2, 1929\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Swan of Punnichy has handed over to me your rough sketch of the layout of our new school. May I be permitted, first of all, to express you my deep gratitude for your earnest cooperation and kind support in this connection. I personally feel that your ambition is to make the schools of our Indian schools, and accordingly, to prepare such plans as may meet with the approval of all parties concerned. In this instance your sketch will certainly please and bring about this consoling result.\n\nNow, with your kind permission, I beg to submit a few suggestions of minor importance which may help you in the final drawing of the plans.\n\n1st Location of the New School - so as to protect operation of school activities during the time of the construction:\n\nI beg to inclose two blue prints which I prepared for your consideration in this connection. The first map will show you the exact location of each building on the school grounds - as also that of the well, the preservation of which is of vital importance to this institution. We have dug nine different wells around here at great cost - and all but that one has proven any good. It is all cemented from top to bottom and may provide easily from 5 to 6 thousand gallons of water a day.\n\nThen, the second map is a tentative proposition for the location of the New School - so as to preserve both, a) the operation of the school activities during the time of the construction, b) Preservation of the Well.\n\nN.B. The dotted part is the existing Church and could be demolished at the earliest convenience.\n\n2nd Re-minor alterations for Basement Plan:\n\nAdjoining both recreation halls there is one room for coats. To help discipline I would suggest that these rooms opened directly on the recreation halls, thus avoiding access and crowding in the corridors.\n\nb) In your sketch there is no Bakery Room in close connection with the Kitchen. Would it be possible to make allowance for that? The Bakery is operated and supervised by the head cook.\n\nc) The Father's dining room could be made three feet longer and the store room adjoining smaller accordingly, with the door on same opening on the Father's dining room rather than on the corridor.\n\nN.B. This dining room is also the Visitor's dining room and consequently, I presume, that a larger space should be allowed.\n\n3rd Re-minor alterations on the Ground Floor Plan:\n\na) I would suggest that no door should connect the Senior Boys Study with the Male Staff sitting room. This door could be placed to greater advantage as a second entrance to the Senior Boys Study.\n\nb) In connection with the Chapel gallery layout may I be permitted to ask for an outside entrance at the rear, same to serve as a special entrance to outside Indians wishing to attend the services of the Church, thus avoiding the free access and crowding of the corridor leading thereto.\n\nc) May we also hope for the erection or a gallery in the chapel which would prove a great convenience indeed for the singing choir.\n\n4th Re-minor alterations for first floor Plan:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n4th. Re-minor alterations for First Floor Plan:\n\na) It is most important that a glaze wall be erected at each end of the corridor to isolate the Sister's Department.\n\nb) Would it be possible to have the Bath Rooms adjoining each of the four dormitories connected directly with same, thus avoiding the passing of bathers in the corridor?\n\nc) Would it be possible also to add one more toilet in each of the four dormitories, same to serve as a private convenience for the guardians? These extra toilets could open on the guardians' rooms.\n\nIn conclusion, may I ask you, as a special favour, that all doors leading on the corridors of the school be supplied with a Transom? to provide better light for same? The remark has been passed to me that the corridors in existing schools of this type were rather dark.\n\nDear Sir, I now leave it to you to decide in all matters concerning the above suggestions. I really feel that our cause is in good hands and will be generously protected.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJoseph Butler\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.

The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of defaults being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim in default of the said wages is made to the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the sub-letting of contracts it shall be understood that sub-letting, other than such as may be necessary for the true completion, is prohibited except the approval of the Minister is obtained; sub-contractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of sub-contractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprised in and to be executed under the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\nSCHEDULE OF WAGES AND WORKING DAY HOURS\n\n| TRADE OR CLASS OF LABOUR          | RATES OF WAGES NOT LESS THAN | HOURS OF LABOUR NOT MORE THAN |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Bricklayers and Masons           | $1.45 per hour              | 8                            |\n| Plasterers                       | 1.35                        | 8                            |\n| Helpers                          | .50                         | 8                            |\n| Plumbers & Steamfitters          | 1.25                        | 8                            |\n| Helpers                          | .55                         | 8                            |\n| Structural Steel Workers         | .90                         | 8                            |\n| Cement Finishers                 | 1.00                        | 8                            |\n| Electricians                      | 1.00                        | 8                            |\n| Sheet Metal Workers              | 1.00                        | 8                            |\n| Carpenters                       | .90                         | 8                            |\n| Painters & Glaziers              | .875                        | 8                            |\n| Pile & Gravel Roofers            | .85                         | 8                            |\n| Cement Mixer Engineer            | .65                         | 8                            |\n| Gasoline                         | .65                         | 8                            |\n| Sheet Metal Workers Helpers      | .65                         | 8                            |\n| Electricians Helpers             | .70                         | 8                            |\n| Concrete Workers                 | .45                         | 8                            |\n| Common Labourers                 | .45                         | 8                            |\n| Building                         | .50                         | 8                            |\n| Truck Drivers                    | .50                         | 8                            |\n| Teamsters, team & wagon          | .90                         | 8                            |\n\nIndian Affairs.

The root cellar has caved in. This cellar is under the barn floor and is unsatisfactory. As a large garden is always grown, a new cellar should be provided.\n\nThe present hen house is high and unsuitable for the purpose. The Rev. Principal makes a special effort along this line and would appreciate a good log chicken house. The present building is more like a dwelling and he would like to have it moved and used to accommodate Indian parents who come from a distance to visit their children.\n\nThe present granary is very old and the floors are in poor condition, allowing the rats and mice to get in and destroy quantities of feed and seed. The building is not on a proper foundation and the sills have rotted in several places. Before repairing this building, it might be well to move it further away from the school or, at least, in line with the barn buildings.\n\nThe old school residence is in need of some repair, but as the Rev. Father Poulet expects a new school this year, it would be useless to incur any further expense.\n\nEXTRACT from Letter of Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, forwarding Mr. Inspector Hamilton's Report on his inspection of the MUSCOGEEQUAN Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 121-5-6.\n\nI cannot see why the Principal, with the assistance of members of his staff and the bigger boys, could not fix up the root cellar. I do not think the Department should be called upon to do this, nor should we be called upon to do anything about the henhouse. Of course, if we are expected to do everything it is a different matter, but my understanding is that we are not. The same remarks will apply to the granary.\nOttawa, May 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, forwarded under cover of your No. 312-11 of the 8th instant, in which he draws attention to the condition of the root cellar, hen house and granary, I have to say that the department has no funds available to carry out the suggestions of the Principal regarding the roofing of the present hen house and fitting it up to accommodate Indian parents, or in making repairs to the granary and root cellar. I would suggest that the school authorities carry out these alterations and repairs themselves; the staff and older boys performing the labour required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The door that is shown on the plan is too narrow for this purpose. I found this feature also at the new Brandon School.\n\nI would also suggest that the walls of the playrooms be wainscoted with v-joint. I note that the plaster comes right down to the base-board, which means that it will be broken off within a year. Wainscoting should be put on at the Brandon school as well.\n\nIt is noticed that the two bedrooms at the Brandon School leading off the main hallways, have cement floors. I think this was meant to be terazzo, because the two storerooms upstairs have terazzo flooring. The contractor should have called the Principal's attention to this before proceeding with the work, as I am sure it was never the intention to put terazzo floors in the storerooms and cement in the bedrooms. This change should also be made on the Muscowequan School plans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nDept.

Swan,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nMr. William Swan,\nArchitect,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nRE LESTOCK INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nYour letter dated July 22nd reached us Saturday noon. We do not know the cause of this late delivery.\n\nComplying with your request regarding our steel we beg to advise that 80% of this steel is fabricated by us in Winnipeg and all detail plans were made by us. The remaining 20%, which consists of the light column sections, is being made in the United States. These sections require the operation of a milling machine to face the splice seats. The milling machine is a very large affair that a number of small structural shops in Canada do not have. We offered this part of the work to Combined Dominion Bridge and Manitoba Bridge, but they refused to do it for us unless they could do the whole job at a price $800, above what we are charging for the contract.\n\nWe are a Canadian Company, composed of Canadians, working in opposition to all other Canadian Bridge Companies. We have been going ahead with the steel for the above building fully confident that our methods were in accordance with the meaning of the specifications, as structural steel of the class required for this job is a foreign material, not obtained in Canada. Therefore we firmly believe that the small proportion of the material - approximately 20% - that we are having fabricated outside of Canada in order that we might enjoy a small share of Canadian business, would quite agree to the specifications, on this class of material.\nAccording to our method, the cost of material, both plain and fabricated, with freight paid to Winnipeg, is $4,550.00.\n\nTotal material direct from Mill - no work done, with freight paid to Winnipeg would be $4,000.00.\n\nDifference - $550.00\n\nOur price for material F.O.B. Lestock - $6,800.00\n\nWe will be able to show invoices later to prove that these figures are approximately correct.\n\nWork on the columns is advancing.\n\nWe have endeavored to make our position clear to you, which we trust to your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWINNIPEG BRIDGE CO., LTD.\n\nPer [signature]\nAug. 2nd, 1930.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock. Report No. 2.\n\nSince my report of July 19th, the above job has gone on well. Material is being delivered on the job in good time and well up to standard called for. The only delay is with the steel columns which I have had no word of yet, apart from the fact that they were under way and that about 20% of the fabrication was being done in the United States. With further reference to my letter of yesterday's date I am now enclosing the letter received from the Winnipeg Bridge Co., so that you may fully understand my position in this matter. If I live up to the specifications I must refuse to allow these columns to go into the job. Will you return this letter for my files?\n\nOwing to the fact that the heating plans call for a 30\" chimney I have instructed the contractors to increase the size to this; the cost will be about $90.00 extra.\n\nI have found that the screen doors cannot be put in place on the rear entrances of Gordon School on account of the Yale door closers, so would suggest that you allow me to have the rear entrance doors on this job made with the upper section glazed in small panes; this to be interchangeable with screens for summer use.\n\nFather Pauliet would like to have full screens on all windows in class rooms, dormitories, and playrooms. Also to have a skylight about 2'.0\" x 6'.0\" over the end of Kitchen furthest from windows. I thought it might be just as well to arrange for inside heavy screens for playrooms now.\n\nThe concrete walls are now in and the basement frames set on the front portion, and the brickwork started today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nRA439 49 COLLECT\n\nPUNNICHY SASK 11 200P\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nHAVE INVESTIGATED MATTER OF COLUMNS WINNIPEG BRIDGE CANNOT GET FABRICATION DONE IN WINNIPEG IF STEEL IS REORDERED WILL NECESSITATE CLOSING JOB DOWN FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS THROWING ALL MEN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT WE ARE WAITING FOR STEEL NOW WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT CONTRACTORS BE ALLOWED TO USE COLUMNS\n\nWM SWAN.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott today; after a lengthy talk with Smith Bros. & Wilson Ltd. It would appear that the Winnipeg Bridge Co., are a new firm who at the present not able to do a certain amount of the column fabrication in Winnipeg, although I am informed that they will be doing so next year. As outlined in their letter to me, which I forwarded to the Deputy Minister, they were unable to get the Dominion Bridge or Manitoba Bridge (both the same now) to do this work, so they proceeded to have it done in Minneapolis. The total cost of this fabrication I am told is about $550.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that the job would be closed down for three or four weeks anyway if steel had to be reordered, and that we are right now waiting for these columns I feel that they should be allowed to go in. It would certainly be unfortunate if the brickwork were delayed into the cold weather; by the time you get this the brickwork will be up to column height on the main building, and some of the masons will be laid off.\n\n1.\nWould you object to having the upper panel of the stair entrances made removable so that a screen panel could be put in instead of using a screen door which cannot go on because of the arm of the Yale closer. It might be better to have such panels in the vestibule doors and arranged to hook the entrance doors back. With the small amount of light that gets to the bottom of the stairs I believe a glazed panel, fairly high up, would be best for the entrance doors.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He finds existing well only good for one hundred twenty five gallons per hour and suggests drilling another so that supply may be six hundred. Understand that Commissioner Graham has sent drilling outfit to Punnichy for other work. Could we have authority to drill while this is in district? Cost is reasonable.

The 24\" one has a capacity of about 11,000 gallons when 12\" from the top.\n\nThese quotations are for tanks similar in design to those furnished at Duck Lake and Cardston for the Indian Department and the quotations do not include any piping. The arrangement for piping should be considered in the price for septic tank work and the outside sewage and rain water disposal.\n\nPlease bear in mind that one year's rainfall on these roofs would be about 80,000 gallons.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.\nper\n\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ.Y.\nAugust 16th 1930.\n\nJ.B. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock. Report No. 3.\n\nThe above job has just been making fair progress since my last report, although materials are arriving in large quantities with the exception of the steel. It is on this account that the work is being held back, but I understand now that there is every chance of the Winnipeg Bridge making a working agreement with the Dominion Bridge to fabricate the columns in Winnipeg. The contention of the contractors is that the fabrication of the columns in Minneapolis is quite in accord with the specifications as it is merely Canadian materials that is called for and not Canadian fabrication. In any event much of the steel sections will be rolled in the United States even if the Dominion Bridge do supply them.\n\nThere seems to be a general feeling up here that the combined Dominion Bridge and Manitoba Bridge Companies are trying to squeeze out any competition, and that the Winnipeg Bridge Co. is the only company in Western Canada from which contractors can get a real competitive figure on structural steel.\n\nI trust that by Monday we will have definite word that things are settled, and that there will be no more serious delay. If there is to be more than a weeks delay the contractors will shut down as the building is up to ground floor joist level on the main structure now, and only four bricklayers are working.\n\nI am enclosing a price on a rainwater tank received from the contractors, and it would be as well if this could be decided upon at an early date.\n\nI am meeting a Mr. French from Calgary on the job on Wednesday to go into the matter of the water supply and the sewage disposal with him.\n\nWould it not be as well to decide soon on which rooms you intend to cover with linoleum?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 121-5-15.\n\nI have received your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the water supply at the Muscovequan Indian residential school near Lestock, Saskatchewan, containing a copy of the Inspector's telegram regarding the drilling of a new well and note that the department has authorized that this well should be drilled.

Report No.4.\n\nSince my report of Aug. 16th this job has been making good progress. The question of the steel has been settled by the Winnipeg Bridge Co., making arrangements to have the columns fabricated by the Dominion Bridge Co. These columns are now all in place on the works and steel joists are being put on. See photographs enclosed.\n\nThe brickwork is up to ground floor level on main portion of building, and the bricklayers are now working on the rear wing and interior walls.\n\nThe cut stone is mostly all on the ground and the setting of that on the front entrance has been started.\n\nYesterday the concrete floors in boiler room and coal room were put in place, so that the boilers could be set as soon as they arrive.\n\nMr. French of the Water Power and Reclamation Dept. at Calgary was down from Aug 20th to Aug. 23rd, and we went over the question of water supply and sewage disposal. The latter is settled, but the water question will not be settled until the well drillers have been on the job, which I expect will be early next week. I drove Mr. French to Nokomis to interview a well driller, but eventually arrangements were made with a Regina firm who had instructions from Commissioner Graham to do some drilling on the Poor Man Reserve; Mr. Graham kindly giving them instructions to divert the outfit to Muscowequan first.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Mr. French it was decided to recommend that the electric plant be housed in the same building as the water pumping machinery, and thus leave only the laundry to be placed in the old school building. I think this would be a great advantage in case of fire in the old wooden building. Mr. French will be submitting a layout to you.\n\nWe are having good building weather and with the ground floor slab being run early next week there will be more bricklayers put on, and the job should go rapidly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Paulet is expecting that it will be in the same rooms as at Gordons which of course is the chapel, classrooms, dormitories, principal's office, and corridors. This undoubtedly does make a real job for a school building.\n\nThe work is going along well, although it has not been rushed so far; but now that the steel question is cleared up things will move quicker. Herewith a snap of the front I took the other day, and although I carelessly had my camera at quite an angle it gives you some idea that we are getting a real good job on the brickwork.\n\nI hope that you will be able to come West again this fall and look all the work over.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Report No. 5.\n\nThis job has been going on well during the past two weeks; the ground floor slab is all on except for a portion over the Boiler Room which we have had to leave until the boilers are in place; they being at Lestock today. There are now ten bricklayers at work and the walls of the Ground Floor are going up; see photographs enclosed. The plumbers and electricians are on the job, and most of the underground work has been done.\n\nAfter a little delay the well driller got started yesterday, and today he was down to forty feet with water showing; we intend to go another ten or fifteen feet before putting a test on which we hope to do on Monday.\n\nThe steel erector is keeping well ahead with the steel and it is going up without trouble.\n\nThe work is going along well and smoothly and I think that there will be little danger of the building not being closed in before cold weather. I think it would be as well to arrange to have the passage from rear of building connected up with the old building at an early date. This of course comes out at a level some four feet below grade and should continue to connect up with present basement of old building where the laundry machinery will be installed. This will require excavating, concrete, and brickwork, with possibly a concrete slab roof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSept. 19, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 17th regarding linoleum for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, will you please advise me if it is your intention to purchase this linoleum or if the contractors will purchase same, and have it included as an extra to the contract.\n\nIf the linoleum is purchased by you I will send you the names of firms from whom prices may be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock.\n\nReport No. 6.\n\nSince my last report we have obtained a good supply of water in the new well at a depth of 146 feet. It is very soft and quite nice to drink. I have samples in at the Provincial Analyst and within the course of a day or so should have a full report, although we are quite satisfied that it will be O.K. The water is within thirty feet of the top of casing and by boiling at the rate of 400 gallons per hour it can be taken down to ninety feet from the top but at that rate stays at that level. I have given Mr. French at Calgary a full report of this and have a letter from him this morning in which he states that the plans for the pump house and septic tank have been drawn up, but have not yet been traced. I would urge that every effort be made to get this work in hand right away as we are now having frost at night, and can expect real cold weather within a week or so. I really believe that it will be unnecessary to save the rainwater now that we have a good supply of soft water. If the electrical plant is housed in the same building as the pumps and pressure tanks I think it will be much more satisfactory than to put the plant in the old wooden building with all the risk of having the building without light and water should a fire occur in the old building.\n\nThe contractors are still keeping things moving smoothly, there being two slabs poured and steel joists on one wing ready for the third. The boilers are now installed and the floor over is poured and ready for the Chapel brickwork. The Plumbers and Steamfitters are making good progress all underground work being in, and the concrete floors being run. All steel is erected with the exception of beams running into brickwork. The plasterer arrived on the job yesterday to see if the lathing could be started; I find that he did not figure on metal angle beads as they were not definitely specified, but I notified the contractors that these would have to be used on all external angles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSum Insured $65,000.00 Premium $32.50 .05\u00a2 Term month\n\nFrom twelve o'clock noon (Standard Time), of the 2nd day of October 1930\nUntil twelve o'clock noon (Standard Time), of the 2nd day of November 1930\n\nThis Policy of Insurance Witnesseth,\n\nThat THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDANT GENERAL, DEPT.

Swan Esq., Punnichy, Sask.\n\nfor services as Inspector of Construction for Cerminis and Muscowequan Schools\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Inspector was at Muscowequan every day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith plans for sewage disposal works to be constructed for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School near Lestock, Sask.\n\nIntroductory:\n\nThis school is one of the modern standard fireproof structures similar in design and size to those at Gleichen and St. Paul, Alta., or Punnichy, Sask. The number of pupils and staff will probably not exceed 150 people. The sewage requirements will therefore be similar to those at the other schools and the volume should be less than 1,000,000 gal. or two acre-feet per year.\n\nThe school is located upon a high elevation of ground having considerable slope towards the east and south. It was considered sufficient to build a standard septic tank and turn the effluent into a ditch upon the side of the hill about 400 feet east of the school. The liquid would largely seep away into the cultivated soil. The drainage would be in the direction of a large shallow slough about one half of a mile northeast of the school. This is the same system recommended for the Blue Quill school near St. Paul, Alta.\n\nWorks:\n\nThe sanitary sewage and drainage from boiler room will be kept separate until past the septic tank. The drainage from the laundry room located in the old frame structure will be through the existing sewer drain.\n\nThe sanitary sewage and drainage from the boiler room will be conducted to a manhole chamber located 50 feet north of the east wing of the school. From thence the liquids will be conducted in two separate pipes laid in a single trench as far as the septic tank 250 feet east of the school. The sanitary sewage will empty into the septic tank and the drainage from the boiler room will be bypassed. The grade of the sanitary sewer from the school to the septic tank is set at 1/4 inch per foot, the minimum slope permitted by law.\n\nThe septic tank recommended is of similar design to that constructed at the MacIntosh Indian School in Ontario. It will be deeper to allow for greater storage of sludge. The top will be a reinforced concrete slab, as recommended by Mr. Swan, the local architect and inspector. In other respects there is no change in design from that for the above mentioned school.\n\nThe effluent will be discharged intermittently by Anthes Syphons into a six inch sewer pipe emptying upon the\nground close to the edge of a cultivated field as aforementioned.\n\nRemarks:\n\nSince the school will be ready for occupancy before spring it is advisable to have these works under construction within sixty days before the commencement of freezing weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) Merritt H. French.\n\nP.S. A complete bound report for record purposes can be prepared at the completion of the works.\n\nF.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 121-5-15.\n\nRe Muscovequan Indian School.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 18th regarding the new Indian school near Lestock, Saskatchewan, I enclose herewith a preliminary report received from Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, dealing with proposed sewage disposal system for that school. A blue line print showing the proposed layout is also enclosed.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised if the scheme proposed is satisfactory, and if so, whether it is intended to begin construction of the works before the close of the season, in which case specifications and tenders will be prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is in duplicate with copies of progress estimate as submitted by the contractors.\n\nI would point out to you the necessity of having the pump and power house started without delay as the weather is now uncertain. I have sent a telegram to Mr. French of the Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Dept. at Calgary Alta., reading thus;-\"Can you rush plans for power and pump house. Bricklayers will be away from job in two weeks and weather is uncertain.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nFunnichy, Saskatchewan\nOct. 12th 1930.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock. Report No.7.\n\nWith the exception of parapet wall on main building and walls of Chapel, the brickwork of the building is complete, so far as the exterior work is concerned. Only the bearing walls inside have been built as these have been the only inside brickwork necessary; every effort having been made to get all exterior work done before cold weather set in. All concrete roof and floor slabs, with the exception of Chapel roof, have been run, and the framing of wooden portion of roof started. Most of the waterproofing on inside of exterior walls is on, and lathers are at work on walls and ceilings. The plasterers have commenced work on the boiler Room and Kitchen etc., and have the first coat on this wing. They have also completed the plastering on the side and rear entrances so that there would be no danger from frost by leaving until rest of work was ready. They are supply and putting in place the metal corner bead at the price of 8\u00a2 a foot.\n\nSince my last report the last of the steel has been erected, by the placing of the large beams over Chapel.\n\nThe analyst's report on the water from the new well shows that it is only two thirds as hard as the present water in use. The bacteriological report states that quite a large number of bacteria are present, presumably from human or animal origin, as the well is one hundred and forty six feet deep, and with two strata of blue clay between the surface and the water we have assumed that this test results from the metal casing being left round in the yard, where cattle were running, before being placed in position. The Rev. Principal is having the well pumped for some time so that a cleaner test can be made.\n\nMay I again urge that the work on the water and electric plant building be put in hand at the earliest possible moment as the weather may be turning cold at any time now; in fact we have several inches of snow on the ground today. May I instruct the steamfitter to provide for the heating of the portion of the old building that is to remain, from the new plant?\n\nPhotographs of the work taken a few days ago are enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.of Construction.\nRA208 XU\nREGINA SASK 28 951A\nTHE SECY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA ONT\nHAS CHEQUE BEEN MAILED FOR LESTOCK CERTIFICATE NUMBER THREE WIRE\nREPLY.\nSMITH BROS AND WILSON LTD.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Report No.8.\n\nSince my report of Oct. 12th last we have had some very severe weather, and owing to the non-arrival of the storm sash the job was at a standstill for two days. The weather was so bad that six men were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning while spending a night in a car less than four miles from the city of Regina, the roads being drifted so badly that the car could not be driven in. I regret to say that one of these was from the job, and that another one of the plumbers is only just out of hospital as a result of being in the stalled car.\n\nThe bricklayers have been out on strike for a few days, but are back on the work again now. The strike was nothing to do with this job, but all of our men were called out.\n\nAll outside brickwork is now finished with the exception of the chimneys. The roofer is now at work, and today has the two wings tarred and gravelled, the wood work of the centre roof and chapel will be finished by Wednesday next.\n\nThe interior partitions are going up and the plasters are at work on the two first coats. The firescapes are up, and the heating is well ahead.\n\nThe steel stairs have been delivered at the job, and will be erected during the next two weeks.\n\nThe contractors have salamanders on the job and I am watching the plastering for frost.\n\nI have heard nothing from you as to the pump house and septic tank yet. It is getting quite late for outside concrete and brickwork unless we go to the trouble of protecting same as it is placed.\n\nThe excavation for passage between old and new building has been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch have forwarded a report from the Commissioner of Irrigation of Calgary with reference to the proposed sewage disposal system for the new Muscowequan Indian Residential School near Lestock, Sask. It will be necessary to build a septic tank and make the necessary connections to and from the tank. The cost will be approximately $2,000.00.\n\nSmith Bros. and Wilson of Regina are the contractors for the school. Will you please advise me if this work can be given to them on a cost plus 10% basis or give me the name of a firm who may be employed to carry out the work.\n\nOwing to the lateness of the season it is advisable that the work be commenced as early as possible.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOctober 18, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nI am attaching hereto a memorandum from our Departmental Architect with reference to the sewage disposal system for the new Muscowequan Indian Residential School near Lestock, Sask., and I would recommend that this work be done by the Contractors on a cost plus 10% basis. May I have the Minister's approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 1)\nSeptember 15, 1930.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to attach water supply plans for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School now under construction near Lestock, Sask.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nThe school is one of the modern standard fireproof structures similar in design and size to those at Gleichen and St Paul, Alta., and Punnichy, Sask. The number of pupils and staff will probably not exceed 150 people. The water requirements therefore should be somewhat similar to those at the other schools and not exceed one canita allowance of 30 gallons or a total of 4500 gallons per day. It is presumed that any reasonable reserve supply of water provided for domestic requirements will also be sufficient to quench any fire that may occur in the contents of the building and any ordinary blaze that may arise in the frame structure nearby used for laundry purposes etc. In the latter building complete chemical fire equipment should be installed.\n\nWater Supply.\n\nThe water supply will come from one old proven well and one new well to be drilled. The existing well was given two thorough tests and can be relied upon to give 125 Imp. gals. per hour under continuous pumping. This well is 55 feet deep and was dug by hand and lined with concrete. An attempt should be made to lower this well a few feet to provide a greater depth of water in the well. Normally about two feet of water stands in the well but this depth decreases as water is pumped out until the depth is only two inches when 140 Imp. gals. per hour are being pumped.\n\nProvision has been made to drill another well to a lower stratum in order to provide a more certain and more ample water supply. It is considered that the combined capacity of the wells should equal 600 Imp. gals. per hour.\n\nWorks.\n\nThe pump house structure will be placed just west of the school close to the existing well. It will consist of one room buried two feet underground for frost protection. The major portion of the room will be taken up by two 1500 Imp. gal. pressure tanks made by the Dominion Bridge Co. The remainder of the floor space will be reserved for two pumps, a stairway and probably a small stove. The superstructure above ground to house the stairway will be of red brick to harmonize with the school.\nThe floors, walls and part of the top will be of concrete while that part over the pressure tanks will be made of creosoted timber so that the tanks can be readily removed and replaced when in an unserviceable condition.\n\nFor the existing well a shallow well pump with a capacity of 125 Imp. gals. per hour will be required. This pump will deliver water directly from the ground into the pressure tanks. Just what machinery is needed for the other well will depend upon the nature of the water supply.\n\nAll water for laundry purposes will be obtained from rainfall and stored in a large concrete cistern which has probably already been constructed.\n\nPipeline to School.\n\nThe delivery pipe from the pressure tanks to the school should be three inches in diameter, to carry 100 Imp. gals. per minute for fire protection.\n\nRemarks.\n\nSince it is anticipated that the school will be occupied before next spring it is advisable that the construction of the works commence within the next sixty days before freezing weather sets in.\n\nThe existing well is sufficient for the operation of the school with the most rigid economy in the use of the water. Hence the pressure system and the pump for the existing well could be installed immediately. The second well could be connected when it is drilled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) M. H.

The Commissioner reports that there is some uncertainty as to the source of power required to drive the pumps so an allowance has been made which should cover the cost of either electrically driven pumps or those of another type.\n\nA blue print is also enclosed showing details of the proposed works. The general lay-out is as shown on the blue-line print enclosed with my letter of October 8th regarding proposed sewage disposal system.\n\nAn estimate of the cost is also enclosed herewith amounting to $5516.00; also for the sewage disposal system amounting to $2930.80.\n\nRegarding your letter of August 23rd last in which authority was given to drill an additional well at this school, I am advised by Mr. Tempest that this well has now been drilled to one hundred and forty-six feet. The water stands in it at thirty feet from grade and lowers to ninety feet from grade when pumping at the rate of four hundred gallons per hour. The water has been analyzed and appears satisfactory for domestic purposes, but I am awaiting further details in regard to this from the Commissioner.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions regarding this project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Well at Muscowequan Indian School, Sask.\n\nThe enclosed accounts were sent to Mr. Graham at Regina, but he has forwarded them to me to be O.K.'d and sent direct to you. The charges are based on the same rates that McPherson & Thom Co. are charging for the other wells being drilled under instructions from Mr. Graham.\n\nThe bill from the Muscowequan School is on account of moving the outfit and providing Mr. Dempsey, the driller, with board and lodging while at work. This arrangement was made with McPherson & Thom and is allowed for in their price; and I asked Father Paulet to provide this service for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\n### Estimate No. 4 of Labor Performed and Materials Supplied at the Muscowequan Indian School, near Lestock, Sask., to Oct. 31, 1920\n\n| Description                                                                 | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Setting out and preparatory work                                           | $150.00|\n| Plant and freight on Plant                                                 | $670.00|\n| Fire Insurance                                                             | $225.00|\n| Liability and Public Insurance                                             | $725.00|\n| Temporary Buildings and Scaffolding                                        | $575.00|\n| Water Supply                                                               | $145.00|\n| Travelling Expenses                                                       | $165.00|\n| Demolish Chapel and clear site                                            | $200.00|\n| Excavation, backfill and grading                                          | $1,250.00|\n| Cement Tests (At Plant)                                                    | $45.00  |\n| Concrete Footings                                                         | $1,400.00|\n| Concrete Walls and Forms                                                   | $3,900.00|\n| Reinforced Concrete Columns, Beams and Steps                              | $800.00|\n| Basement Floors                                                           | $1,380.00|\n| 4\" Weeping Tile                                                           | $100.00 |\n| Concrete Slabs on Steel Joists                                            | $4,250.00|\n| Concrete Slabs solid                                                      | $675.00 |\n| Damp-proofing                                                             | $470.00 |\n| do On site                                                                | $20.00  |\n| Face Brick, In place                                                      | $11,510.00|\n| do On site, 25 M. @ $56.00                                                 | $1,350.00|\n| Back-up Tile                                                              | $7,275.00|\n| Common Brick, In place                                                     | $6,350.00|\n| Gypsum Tile                                                               | $2,220.00|\n| Fire Brick                                                                | $130.00 |\n| Enamel Brick, In place                                                    | $1,995.00|\n| R.

All the tar and gravel work with the exception of the roof over the passage to Chapel, is finished, and the tinsmith is now putting the flashing in place. The brickwork of chimneys has been carried up and another day will see the stone cap on. All inside partitions are up and the brick lining of stairwells is complete.\n\nThe lathing is practically finished and the plasterers have much of the first coats on. The glazed brick lining of kitchen and scullery has been done.\n\nThe steamfitters will have heat on by Monday next.\n\nThe storm sash have been put in place and the job closed in for work during cold weather. The steel stairs are in place, and the millwork is being delivered.\n\nMr. Orr was here during the weekend of Nov. 2nd, and visits were made to both Gordon's School and Muscowequan. Many points were cleared up and arrangements made to rush the pump house etc., as well as arranging for the cold storage equipment.\n\nMr. French of the Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service is to be on the job next Tuesday and have a forty-eight hour test on the new well before commencing the pump and powerhouse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nLestock, Sask.\nAug.7,1930.\n\nReceived from Rev.J.Poulet the sum of Fourteen dollars and sixty cents ($14.60) for Twenty four hours labour on repairing windows.\n\nWitness:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose you a sketch of this copy of which has been approved by the Dominion Water Power Dept. This will simplify our heating problem which cannot be overcome without the use of some form of pump on the wet return and an overhead steam pipe to supply radiation. I really believe this will be a much better job, and am arranging to have the contractors go ahead.\n\nMr.French was down to put on a test, and after running a pump for the best part of a day at 500 gals per hr., the sand came up the casing about eighteen feet, and he had to stop and arrange to have the driller come back and clean this out and put in a screen. As soon as this can be done he will be back again to finish the test. There appears to be a good supply of water.\n\nI have discussed the matter of an electrically driven pump with the Lister people and they have given a figure on one of their pumps that can be run from their plant that is going in. They would put in one of their anti-freezing deep well pumps with all equipment to automatically deliver 480 gals per hr. run from the plant to be installed, for the sum of $447.85. I think Mr.French will be recommending this.\n\nI have had the Kelvinator man on the job and a complete plant for that size room will run to $260.00 installed. I have received figures from Smith Bros. & Wilson which have been submitted by the heating contractors, and I am enclosing them for your perusal. Will you return these to me with instructions? Have this work go ahead?\n\nAre you calling for tenders on the septic tank etc.?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This necessitated having the drilling machine ordered back on the job and a screen put in the bottom of the well. This has not yet been done as the machine was at work until a day or so ago on Poor Man's Reserve, but I understand that it will be down in a day or so.\n\nThe contractors are making a start on the pump & electric plant house just as soon as Mr. French finds his test satisfactory.\n\nWe have been taking up the matter of an electrically operated pump for the well, with the R.A. Lister people who are putting in the plant, and we are assured that they could put in a pump to work from their plant satisfactorily, and covered by their guarantee. Mr. French is going into this matter fully.\n\nMay I urge that steps be taken to have the work started on the septic tank and the drains running thereto.

The screen should be delivered at Lestock before the work or cleaning the well is completed in order to avoid unnecessary delay.\n\nIt is understood that your teams for hire of the rig and operators are $20 per day, the department to pay the cost of moving.

The plasterers are making good progress with the finish coat and the cement base. Several of the cement floors are now down, and the linoleum has been delivered on the job. The carpenters are putting on trim as fast as the plastering is dry. I regret to say that I have had to refuse some of the hardware; Ashdowns having shipped all plain hinges instead of ball bearing as specified.\n\nThe painters are steadily working away, and the electrician is now pulling the wires.\n\nBaths, basins, and other fixtures are being shipped and delivered on the job.\n\nThe Lister plant has arrived from Edmonton and is being stored until we have the powerhouse up.\n\nThe Kelvinator people have the cold storage plant in hand and this will be delivered in a short time. The insulating of the cold storage room has been finished with the exception of putting on the finish coat of cement plaster over the cork.\n\nFather Paulet has asked that a mastic flooring be put down in the recreation rooms and dining room in basement, and that a cement plaster dado be put on in the recreation rooms and adjoining wash rooms. I understand that he is writing direct regarding these matters, but in order that you may have more information on the matter I have secured a price from the contractors of the difference between finishing in cement and with the plain mastic; this is $3 per square foot if a minimum of 4500 sq. feet are put down. You will of course understand that if this change is to be made I must know immediately. The first coat of plaster is on the walls and this will have to be torn off.\n\nIn accordance with your telegraphic instructions this morning I have instructed the contractors to proceed with the sewage disposal system.\n\nMr. French will be on the job again on Tuesday when the test of the well will be again started.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSum Insured $87,500.00 Premium $43.75 .05\u00a2 Term 1 month\n\nFrom twelve o'clock noon (Standard Time), of the 2nd day of November 1930\nUntil twelve o'clock noon (Standard Time), of the 2nd day of December 1930\n\nThis Policy of Insurance Witnesseth,\n\nThat THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDANT GENERAL, DEPT.

Doors are not being hung yet as the butts only arrived today after being changed. The cement floors are going down, and the cement base is being put in place. The electrician has most of the wires pulled and switches in place. The fixtures are on the job.\n\nWe have had no satisfaction with the well test as yet; and the driller is now going down another fifty feet if necessary. Mr. French left on Thursday and will return as soon as the well is in shape for another test. I have asked that his Department recommend to you that we install the tank and the small pump to the present well at once so that there will be water on as soon as the plumbers have the fixtures installed, which I expect will be sometime early in January. The pump and powerhouse is ready to have the plant put in place, and the Lister company are sending a man up after Christmas.\n\nThe chief trouble with the new well seems to be that the sand chokes the supply of water after pumping for ten or twelve hours, and the rate drops to about two hundred gals. per hour. As soon as pumping stops the water immediately rises to the old level of thirty feet from top of well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSAVE FUEL \u2014 PREVENT FIRES\n\nAsbestos Products & Contracting Co.\nASBESTOS-MAGNESIA.

I would be glad to quote you a price for this work. I have had over 20 years experience in this business and can guarantee a first class job. If I could get a plan of this job or a list of material that would be required for this work I would be pleased to give you a price for this work that you will find it hard to beat as we carry our own stock of material and can do the work better than is done by steamfitter helpers as a lot is done. Hoping you will give us a chance to figure in this job.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJ. Watts\nDec. 18, 1930\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nDept. of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that from Dec. 8th to Dec. 17th I was engaged in making a pumping test of a well for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School at Lestock, Sask.\n\nBy referring to previous correspondence on file you will note that a pumping test made in this well the middle of November raised sand and gravel twenty feet in the casing and choked the pump cylinder. Arrangements were then made with Messrs. Macpherson & Co., local representatives of the Ontario Wind Engine & Pump Co. at Regina, for them to move their drilling outfit back to the well and clean out this sand and gravel. They were also instructed to order and have on hand a suitable screen for the well.\n\nThe drilling outfit left Quinton on Monday Dec. 8th and arrived at Lestock the following night. The well was cleaned out, the screen inserted and a pumping test commenced by Thursday afternoon. The test continued all night and by morning the discharge had decreased from 350 gal. to 90 gal per hour.\n\nThe screen was drawn out and examined. The narrow slits in the top two feet and bottom foot of the screen were clean while the middle two feet of the slits were partly clogged with sand. This confirmed the driller's report that the water vein was shallow and indicated that the most of the screen had been clogged with clay.\n\nA test of the well was then made with the screen removed. Three feet of screened gravel were first placed in the bottom of the casing to hold down the sand. After pumping for fifteen hours the flow had decreased to 210 gallons per hour. This was more satisfactory than with the screen but yet insufficient for the school requirements. Also a sounding of the well showed that the gravel had risen one foot.\n\nIt was then decided to widen the 2700 slits in the screen with a back saw. A charge of five sticks of dynamite was also exploded in the stratum of clay below the sand and gravel with the hope that the resulting cavity would be filled with sand and gravel from above. This would increase the depth of the porous material around the screen and also its capacity.\n\nAfter the screen was again inserted another pumping test was made. After fifteen hours the discharge had again decreased to 100 gal. per hour. This was not only...\ndisappointing but seemed to indicate that the casing had penetrated a pocket of water instead of a strong water-bearing vein.\n\nIt seemed useless to make any further attempt to develop a satisfactory well at that depth. It had been noted that a moderate flow of water had been obtained at a depth of 35 feet, a stronger flow at 90 feet and a still larger one at 146 feet. After a consultation between Mr. Swann, Inspector of Construction for the School, Mr. J. Dempsey the driller, and myself, it was decided that it was advisable to drill the same well fifty to one hundred feet deeper before trying some other location. It was hoped that a stronger flow would be encountered at a greater depth.\n\nMr. Swann said that Mr. Dempsey should make preparation to commence drilling and that he himself would take the matter up with his department at Ottawa. Mr. Dempsey telephoned his company in Regina, Messrs. Macpherson and Thom, for well casing and will probably commence drilling Monday Dec. 22nd.\n\nUpon my return to Calgary I had time for a short interview with Mr. Thom of Macpherson & Thom and suggested that he submit to our office a statement for material and services rendered in connection with this last pumping test.\n\nIn conclusion it might be mentioned that it would appear reasonable to desire a well with a tested flow of about 400 gal. per hour without any indications of future trouble from sand and gravel. This would permit us to install a pump of 350 Imp. gals. per hour capacity which in 12 hours would deliver 4,200 gals. A test recently made of the existing well at the school gave a capacity of 320 Imp. gals per hour after six hours pumping. This well will provide a very excellent auxiliary supply to use in emergency and in watering the garden, lawn and stock if so desired.\n\nMr. Swan and I consider it advisable to have a pressure tank and a pumping unit from the existing well now installed. The sewage disposal works and power plant will be in operation early in January and the school will then be ready for occupancy when completed and furnished. With regard to economy in the use of water, the existing well will enable them to operate the school in the new building. There need then be no delay in moving into the new building because of a lack of water supply, and there is no way of determining when an ample supply of water will be procured from another well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H.

We based our estimate according to Section III of the Canadian Inter-Provincial Regulations for unfired pressure vessels.\n\nIf this were estimated according to Section I for boilers with double riveted butt joints, shell would be 7/16\" and dished heads 5/8\". Both heads could be dished similar to enclosed blue print and inlet and outlet flanges would be threaded flanges instead of flanged necks, as shown on this print. Connections for water gauge would be made by means of couplings welded in the head.\n\nThis construction is similar to tank furnished to the Experimental Farm at Scott, Sask., in 1924.\n\nWe are of the opinion that a tank of this design would give better service than one having a flat head with diagonal braces, if that is what you mean by rounded end, and the braced flat head would cost considerably more than dished end.\nDominion Government - Cont'd.\n\nTo make a tank with 7/16\" shell and 5/8\" dished heads would increase our price to $870.00, F.O.B.

They have been advised that the Department approves of this arrangement.\n\nWith reference to the placing of mastic floors in the recreation rooms I regret that these cannot be authorized as there are no funds available at the present time for work of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Part of this rod can be used again if repaired.\n\nThe two charges for $26 are for moving the drilling outfit from Quinton to Lestock and return, a distance of 26 miles each way, at $1 per mile.\n\nThe charge of $135 is for the driller and drilling machine at $20 per day during the time consumed in moving from Quinton to Lestock and during operations at the well. The actual number of hours for each day were noted and divided by eight in order that the time might be reduced to a day basis. Time was not charged to the machine while it was idle. While the drilling machine was idle the driller was paid at the rate of $1 per hour for his assistance in making the actual pumping tests. This latter charge was paid by myself before leaving Lestock.\n\nIn the above charge of $135 for 6\u00bd days time for the machine the company has omitted to include 1\u00bd days for the time which will be taken for the return of the machine to Quinton at the conclusion of the work at Lestock. Since the company has further drilling to do at the Lestock school it would appear reasonable for them to move the machine back to Quinton upon their own time at our expense ($26) if the extra drilling amounts to somewhere near the minimum amount usually guaranteed to drillers for new jobs.\n\nThe work in connection with the cleaning out and testing of the well was concluded Dec. 17th. Instructions were given to the driller by Mr. Swan to drill the well deeper.\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H.

Yesterday the cement floors in the basement were started as I had heard nothing from you with regard to putting down mastic floors as asked for by the Principal and outlined in my report of Dec.6th.last. Personally I think the cement floor will be quite satisfactory.\n\nThe plasterer has gone on with the finish coat on the walls of the recreation rooms, and these are now finished.\n\nWe now have the excavating done for the sewage disposal system, and are laying the tile drains. Fortunately the weather has been very favourable for this work.\n\nUp to this date we have not yet had satisfactory results from the well. When a ten hour run at four hundred gallons per hour caused a drop to about two hundred we decided to go down deeper, and are at present down to one hundred and eighty eight feet with no water. In view of the fact that we have water at ninety five feet and at one hundred and forty six I am writing the Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau asking them to consider the sinking of another well at the one hundred and forty six feet level, and pulling the casing back to that level on the present one and using two wells should we not get water at two hundred and fifty feet or less. Of course Mr. French of the Water Power Dept., has this thing in hand and will no doubt arrive at a satisfactory solution to the problem.\n\nThe plumbers are back on the job again, and have started to put some of the fixtures in place.\n\nThe painters are steadily working away and are well up with their end of things.\n\nGenerally speaking the job is progressing very satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 121-5-15.\n\nI have received your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the water supply system for the new Muscowequan Indian residential school, and note that you approve of Mr. French's recommendation that the pressure tank and pump be provided in the existing shallow well to supply water temporarily for the building.

Should it not be convenient for you to see him on Friday, the 16th, perhaps you would be good enough to telegraph us on Thursday, at our expense, suggesting a date that will be convenient to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

He states that his Department had figures from three firms for the pressure tank, but he did not know whether an order had been placed. If this has not been done might I urge that steps be taken to have this on the site as soon as possible? I am afraid that this may hold the job up if an order is not placed right away.\n\nMr. French has a test of the new well going on now and the pump has been working for thirty-six hours throwing a stream of three hundred & sixty to seventy gallons per hour. This water appears to be somewhat hard, and this brings up the matter of going ahead with the rainwater tank at this time.\n\nI should also like to have instructions regarding the laundry machinery that you intend to install in the old building. We have a room there 40' x 13'6\" in the basement which can be used as a laundry if the old wooden floor is replaced with concrete, and the walls strapped and plastered with cement mortar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This tank we have designed for a 100 pound working pressure, using 7/16\" plate for the shell, 1/2\" and 5/8\" metal for the heads. The longitudinal joints will be of double weld type while the circumferential seams will be of the lap type. We further include in our proposal, manhole, handhole, pressure gauge, water glass and flanges to receive piping.\n\nThe work will be in accordance with the requirements of the Canadian Fire Underwriters for hydro pneumatic pressure tanks.\n\nWe wish to thank you kindly for the opportunity to tender.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHORTON STEEL WORKS, LIMITED.\n\nBy: [Signature]\nContracting Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJanuary 17th, 1931.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock.

So far as the pit for the pump goes I am having this run in as soon as the men are through with the septic tank, may I refer to my letter of the 13th inst., and ask that the pressure tanks be arranged for right away so that we may get it installed?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, January 20th., 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th instant, File No. 40752-W, enclosing an account from Messrs.

Gurney Orr, Esq.\n\nThe building is now substantially completed, as we stated previously, and is in the position where it should be taken over by the Department, and we are desirous that you take up with the proper authorities at Ottawa this question, and if possible arrange for the Mission or some Official of the Department to take over the building at the earliest possible date and provide for the heating and attendance necessary. We would like to point out that we have been doing a considerable amount of extra work during which period we have furnished the temporary heating and attendance, and we believe the Department should now take complete charge of the building and relieve us from further expense for heating, attendance, fire insurance and other overhead expenses.\n\nWe wrote the Deputy Superintendent General on January 3rd enclosing fire insurance policy No. 14081728 of The London, Liverpool and Globe Insurance Company covering for the sum of $110,000.00 on the above building; and we stated that this was the last policy which would be taken out by us. We did not get a reply to this letter, so we renewed this policy, but we would appreciate a statement from the Department that we can relieve ourselves of this expense.\n\nKindly give these matters your early attention and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nJ/B.\n\nCopy to Mr. William Swan.\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Lestock Indian School.\n\nWe have today handed to Mr. William Swan our estimate for the contract and our progress estimate for extra work. We have taken the liberty of referring to our contract estimate as the final estimate, and have shown certain holdbacks which we consider represent a fair estimate of odds and ends yet to be done.\n\nThe final cleaning up and grading may have to be held over until Spring, and the grading is somewhat involved in extra work where we have surplus earth from the connecting tunnel, from the pump house and from the pump pit. There will also be a certain amount of grading where the septic tank sewage work has been installed. The painting to finish is mostly on the exterior, which we did not think advisable to do until frost was off of the frames. The other two items are purely trivial matters to do with the electrical work and the plumbing.\n\nThe building is substantially complete, but we would prefer to do these small matters in the Spring, as we said before, and we now ask that you consider our application for the final estimate as presented with the exception of the holdbacks mentioned, and we would be prepared to leave on deposit the sum of $15,000.00 as well as the $853.00 held back as our guarantee that the work will be finally completed; and we think you will agree that the conditions would justify the payment to us of the $16,145.00 shown on our final estimate, together with our progress estimate #2 for labor and materials expended on extra work, and we would like to state that our progress estimate #2 for extra work is conservative; in fact it does not represent all the items to date, and we have only endeavoured to gather together the principal items of expenditure in order to be reimbursed for a portion of the monies we have expended.\nWilliam Swan,\nARCHITECT\n\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nFebruary 1st, 1931.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nin account with\nWm.

Muscowequan Indian School, Ledstock.\n\nMessrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, the contractors on the above work desire to finish up their contract and have a final certificate issued; although there is still quite a lot of work to do, such as finishing up Sewage Disposal, Pump and Power house, Water Supply, and work on Laundry etc., which was not included in the contract. They do not wish to continue to heat the building as soon as the painter is through with the inside work. I think that this is a fair request on their part and am preparing to issue them a final certificate as soon as the work called for by the original contract is completed as far as they can go.\n\nThe grading up outside, and the outside painting to some extent cannot be finished until Spring, but I can withhold enough, about eight hundred dollars, to cover this. I think that a week or ten days will see the contract work completed, but the water supply cannot be finished until the pressure tank, pumps etc., are on the job.\n\nThe contractors are not asking that their deposit be returned at this date, but that the building be taken over and the ten per cent holdback be paid.\n\nI have a price from the contractors on the work required to be done to make part of the old basement into a laundry. This figure of $1,453.00 does not include for painting, steam heating, plumbing, or electrical work, nor the actual installing of the machinery. The machinery will be just the same as that at Gordon's School, except that Father Paulet would like to have an ironer included. Owing to the fact that the machinery will be some distance from the source of power I would advise that each unit is run separately and this do away with any overhead shafting etc.\n\nI have had the contractors scrubbing the cement base for some days now, but the result is by no means good, and I feel that the only finished look will be obtained with two coats of paint. Two coats of paint on this base would cost 7\u00a2 per lineal foot. It would improve the job considerably to have the cement floors above the basement also painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The sewage disposal system is also complete, and the lighting plant is complete.\n\nThe contractors have vacated the building today and the keys have been temporarily handed over to the Principal, Father Paulet, who is heating the building, and having floors scrubbed etc.\n\nAt present there is nothing more that can be done towards completing the school until we can get the pressure tank delivered. I have been in communication with the Dominion Bridge Co., at Calgary who have this in hand; and on the 21st. of February they wrote stating that they anticipated being able to ship within one or two weeks from that date. The delay being caused by new Saskatchewan regulations which require that such tanks be subject to tests by the Boiler Inspector.\n\nJust as soon as the tank is delivered I will have the contractors back on the job and see that proper installation of it is made and that the plumbers connect it up with the pumps, which will be installed by the R.A. Lister Co., as arranged by the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau.\n\nI have had no instructions from you as to the laundry, but in any event nothing could be done on this until the required rooms in the old building can be vacated. At present we have not cut the doorway to connect the old building with the new, but are leaving this until the school can be moved over.\n\nDuring the past two weeks we have had splendid weather and the outside painting has been practically completed.\n\nI do not propose to make any more visits to the building until we can get the tank placed and water on.\n\nI have not yet had any instructions from you as to the painting of the cement base or any of the cement floors. Even if it is the intention to leave some of the floors natural cement finish I believe that the base should be painted in order to give a more finished appearance to the building; particularly those rooms used as living and bedrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMarch 3, 1931.\n\nSmith Bros. and Wilson,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nAs contract Lestock school completed\nyou may cancel insurance.\n\nA.

Muscowequan Indian School, Lestock, Sask. Report No.18.\n\nSince my last report on Feb. 26th., the two Beatty pumps have been delivered and set up; one in the power house to pump from the old well and the large one in the pump pit over the new well. The pressure tank arrived at Lestock on March 19th from the Dominion Bridge Co. at Calgary. It is now safely installed and the plumbers are busy connecting it up. They expect to be able to turn the water on tomorrow although there may be some adjustments to be made to the pumps. Mr. French of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau has been on the job today.\n\nSince receiving your telegram yesterday I have instructed the contractors that nothing more will be done for the present and that they can move their equipment away as soon as they have the few minor cleaning up items attended to.\n\nI have had them put in the door between the old and new building, and I have had the plumbers run an outside line from the well to the old building, which will supply this with water during the summer months, but will of course be of no use in winter weather.\n\nYou will of course appreciate that there is at present no steam pipe connection, either for heating or for laundry purposes, from the new boilers to the old building. That no demolition of the old structure has been done other than the old chapel which was necessary before starting work last July.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nApril 10th, 1931.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been carrying an account against the Indian Boarding School, Lestock, amounting to $208.21, which is for goods supplied from October last year up to the end of February.

We might mention that the freight and cartage is a proportionate charge against regular rates against material shipments for several wells, that is, we shipped enough material in each shipment, to take care of perhaps three or four wells, but we were asked to arrange freights so as each well would stand the amount of freight covering the material used in that well.\n\nRe $4.00 item, paid to M.W. Bannister, re extra team, moving outfit. This money was paid direct to Mr. J.W. Webb, the Indian Agent and we are enclosing the original cancelled cheque for $4.00, together with a copy of our letter of January 28th, which was written to Mr. Webb when the $4.00 cheque was sent out.\n\nWe are also enclosing receipt, which was O.K.'ed by Mr. W. Swan, re board of $32.35, which was paid to Mrs. L. Lemay, at Lestock, Sask. Fortunately, our well driller Mr. Dempsey came into the office this afternoon, and we had an opportunity of asking him at what rate he was charged for this board. We are advised that the rate is $8.00 per week. On several occasions Mr. Dempsey did not have the noon meal at Mrs. Lemay's, while on two or three occasions, it was necessary for him to have a helper, and the helper took his meals at Mrs. Lemay's.\n\nWe trust therefore that this explanation will be quite satisfactory.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order to avoid any chance of burning up the place I told the contractor of the new building to tear out the chimney and put in a new one which was required, it was not a very big job.

Report No.18.\n\nThe contractors have now moved all their equipment away, and the school is in the hands of the Principal, Father Faulet, who is at present carrying on with the furnishings from the old school.\n\nThe water supply plant has now been running for three weeks and appears to be satisfactory. The Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau will be giving you their detailed report on this.\n\nThe lighting plant and cold storage plant are also running satisfactorily.\n\nThe whole building is now O.K., except for some little trouble we are having with parts of the concrete floor in basement. This we have under observation for a short time and I am meeting Mr. Smith and their engineer on the job within a few days now to finally decide what to do.\n\nEnclosed with this you will find the final certificate for payment covering all extra work done on the Sewage Disposal system, the Corridor from new to old building, the Electric Plant house, and the Pump pit. As this was all done on a cost plus 10% basis I have carefully checked all invoices as well as time sheets, and have finally got the figures down to what I consider fair and reasonable. The revised copies of this final statement are enclosed with this.\n\nMost of the items on this list have been the subjects of letters and telegrams from you, and have been discussed with Mr. Gurney Orr during his visit of inspection.\n\nShould there be any items that are not clearly shown or upon which you require fuller explanation I shall be pleased to go into same in detail.\n\nMay I ask that in making payment on this final certificate you either retain $800.00, or retain the deposit cheque until the contractors have finally satisfied us with regard to the basement floors.\n\nThe guarantee of the building for twelve months as required by the specification is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMay 6, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the Muscowequan School, I would ask you to please advise me what you consider absolutely necessary at the present time in the way of demolishing the old building and connecting up of the portion which it is intended to use with the new building. I may say that there are very limited funds available at the present time and only that portion of the work that cannot be left over for another year should be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Something must be done before October in this regard.\n\n2ndly, All institutions of this size and importance must be supplied with machineries to take care of the Laundry Work - Surely, the Department cannot expect us to keep up with the old system of washboards and tubs - Therefore, I look upon you for immediate action in this connection and I trust in your ability to have these two requisitions approved and the work started on immediately.\n\nThanking you most cordially in anticipation of a favourable answer.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. F.Doll of the staff was starting a fire under the boiler in the laundry when a gas explosion started the trouble, the gas must have escaped from a small tank on the gas engine used to operate the machinery in the building, no gasoline is stored anywhere close to this place.\n\nThe laundry building contained the laundry, bakery, shoe shop, tool shed and ice house, it was two stories, 16 x 50 frame building. The water system with hose connections was put into operation at once, but the fire spread with the wind to the garage close by, a frame building one story 12 x 18 and from there to the three story frame part of the old school and this building 42 x 52 was also burnt.\n\nWe have lost all laundry equipment which included three boilers, laundry tubs, washing machines, drier; two bake ovens, bread mixer, baking pans, and equipment were burnt in the bakery. Shoe and clothes repair outfits were also burnt with stock on hand for repairs; the soft water tank and clothes drier are gone, also garden tools and other tools which were in the tool shed. Mr. Doll lived in the old school with his family, and their furniture was saved but a lot of school clothes and sport equipment are burnt. We also lost 1000 ft. of lumber and 40 sax of cement just purchased to fix up a root cellar as well as all the salvaged material saved when part of the old school was pulled down some time ago.\n\nThe new school is safe, except that the passage built to connect it with the frame part needs new plaster inside, new doors, window glass and repairs to the roof; the so called fire proof door was the first part of this place to burn out. The rest of the school is not even smoked up. A lot of school equipment is no doubt burnt, it will not be missed until it is needed, just now there is no list of it.\n\nJust now the following should be supplied:\n\n1 dough mixer, with electric motor, two sax capacity, 1 bake oven to hold dough from 2 sax of flour, pans for bread making for above. The bake shop is in the new building size about 12 x 13.\n\nWe have a high pressure tank in the boiler room for used laundry, but require a building and full equipment of laundry machinery, there is no space in the new school for a laundry.\n\nMr. Doll will require a dwelling of some sort; there is no house here for the farming instructor. I placed an item in the estimates for one but have not heard if the item passed.\n\nMr. Doll broke out of the building with all his clothes in flames, and with patches of skin and flesh burnt off. When in this state he went to the engine room and started up the pumps, attached the hose and got the fire fighting equipment in shape. He is in pretty bad shape but the doctor says not dangerously injured. The wiring connecting the school with the barns and outbuildings is burnt up and will have to be replaced.\n\n(Sgd.) J.W.Waddy\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6318, file 657-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a report that I requested Mr. Waddy to make in connection with the recent fire which destroyed the laundry building, garage and other small buildings at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will decide what is to be done with regard to this matter.

The only student attending the school, one Dichi, was said to be badly burned and taken away from the fire. No Indian children were injured as they were all away on their holidays.\n\nThe annex was in the process of construction and contained the laundry, garage and like rooms. The explosion appeared to have started in the laundry when some gasoline used for cleaning exploded.\nRA25 50 NL\n\nLESTOCK SASK 29\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER INDIAN DEPT OTTAWA ONT\n\nBAKERY CARPENTER SHOP LAUNDRY SHOEMAKERS SHOP ICE HOUSE GARAGE AND OLD FRAME SCHOOL DESTROYED BY FIRE THIS MORNING FIRE STARTED THROUGH EXPLOSION FROM SMALL GAS TANK OFF ENGINE USED FOR DOUGH MIXER ENGINEER BADLY BURNED BUT NOT IN IMMEDIATE DANGER AGENT WADDY MAILING ALL INFORMATION NO DAMAGE TO NEW SCHOOL\n\nJ POULET..\nJuly 30th, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon.

This was accounted for by your inspection trip to Birtle, and if you will look over your files you will find that you charged for a day at Birtle and at the same time you charged for a day at the Gordon's School. The Civil Service Commission made the appointment at the rate of $6.00 per day, and of course it is impossible to pay for more days than there are in the calendar month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I told the principal that I could not exceed your appropriation but he says he has to get the place constructed to accommodate this year's crop. The fire destroyed his work and made it necessary that we construct a roof on the place we had in mind, as formerly the building above it was to be the roof.\n\nUnder the circumstance I would be obliged if you would consider increasing the grant, if so kindly wire me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 22, 1931\n\nJ.

F. MacKENZIE.\n\nChg. Dept.\nI. A.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your telegram of the 22nd inst. regarding appropriation for the root cellar on the Muscowequan Residential School property, I beg to say that on receipt of your telegram I notified the principal of the request of the Department that the expense be kept down as nothing more than the original appropriation was allowed and asked him if he could arrange to store the crop in any other manner. There is no other place to store his root crop except the cellar under construction.\n\nThe principal said he would go ahead and complete the place.\n\nTo-day I went to the school and the principal told me he intended to construct a cottage on top of the cement root cellar, using the root cellar as his foundation; the cottage to be for the use of his farming instructor. He intends to ask the Department later on for refund of this expense.\n\nMy idea of writing this letter is to advise the Department as to what is going on and to point out that I have authorised nothing more than the $300.00 expense as you allowed in the first place.\n\nThere is no doubt that a cottage for the farming instructor is required at this school, however, that has not been granted as far as I know.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| Item                  | Quantity | Price |\n|-----------------------|----------|-------|\n| Varnish               |          | $1.50 |\n| Keg 2\u00bd\" Nails         |          | $5.75 |\n| 20 lbs.

On receipt of your letter I took the matter up with the Principal and he said he would put up the place complete, and from figures compiled at that time the price would have been less than the $300.00 noted. However, the fire occurred here and destroyed the work done when it was partly completed. The Department was advised about this but did not allow any increase in the grant for the work. I kept the principal advised that funds were not increased but he stated that the work would have to be completed to save his crop.\n\nIn my letter #11A R.O. of the 31st ultimo, to you, I reported on progress of the work here. The building I mentioned is built on the root cellar and the principal states that no part of the dwelling is included in these vouchers except the roof which would have been put on in any case.\n\nI am well aware of the difficulty the Department has in obtaining funds just now, but if there is any way of paying these vouchers I beg to recommend that they be settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nTO...

The chief trouble seemed to be a rather unusual amount of dust from them, but some three months ago I got the contractors to agree to treat the surface with a special oil put up by the Shell Oil Co. for just such conditions as this, and on looking over the floors a few days ago I am quite satisfied that the trouble had been stopped.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe the contractors think that I have been a little too hard on them in the matter of these floors as they have spent two hundred dollars for oil, and of course we did hold up the placing of these floors pending the decision from your office on the substitution of mastic flooring as requested by Father Paulet. Now that the thing is settled to both Father Paulet's and my satisfaction I may say that Messrs. Smith Bros & Wilson have gone to a lot of trouble to give the Department a good job on the whole school.\n\nIn case you require to have the payment of this $800.00 covered by a certificate in the usual form I enclose copy of such in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nNov. 5th 1931.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe.

We could supply this and install the larger casing which will permit the cylinder to be withdrawn, for the sum of\n\nONE HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLARS .................. $105.\n\nWe are not figuring a profit on this, as we are anxious to have the pump give every satisfaction. In addition, we will give you a credit note for any amount allowed us by the Beatty Company, when the old cylinder and casing are returned.\n\nWith regard to the thrust of the pump, we quote from their letter as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the end thrust on the present Pump, in this head one of the gears is cut right hand, and the other is cut left hand. This means when the head is in operation there is no end thrust on the worm providing the worm is floating in the exact correct position. On the electric driven unit the position of the motor holds the worm shaft in this correct position thus eliminating any necessity for end adjustment on the worm.\"\n\nThey seem to think that someone at the school is unduly nervous about the thrust, but will have their man call and report on the pump again this month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. LISTER & CO (CANADA) LTD.\nOttawa, Ont., December 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Muscowequan School,\nLestock, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to the pumping equipment for the new deep well at the Muscowequan School at Lestock, Saskatchewan, we have recently had some correspondence with the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary.\n\nIt appears that the R. A. Lister Company of Winnipeg installed a 2\u00bd inch pipe with a 2\u00bc inch cylinder. It seems that an error was made, presumably by the agent of the Beatty Pump Company at Winnipeg, in supplying a 2\u00bc inch cylinder in place of a 3 inch cylinder originally specified by the Commissioner. It has been found, however, that the 2\u00bd inch pipe is not satisfactory, and will require to be replaced by a 3 inch pipe and at the same time the 2\u00bc inch cylinder must be replaced by a 3 inch cylinder.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation took up this matter with the R. A. Lister Company, and they offer to install a cylinder of the proper size and a 3 inch pipe for $105. Copy of this offer, dated September 21st is enclosed. They also offer to allow credit for any amount allowed them by the Beatty Company when the old cylinder and casing are returned.\n\nIt now appears that Father Poulet has purchased a 3 inch pipe and the R. A. Lister Company now offer, if this turns out to be the case and the pipe is suitable, to deduct the value of it from their invoice in charging for the work.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that authority be given to have the R. A. Lister Company install the larger cylinder and the 3 inch pipe for their offer of $105, less credit for the smaller cylinder to be returned to the Beatty Company, and less the cost of the 3 inch pipe, if this has already been obtained by Father Poulet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I should also like a certificate from the architect to the effect that the additional works were duly authorized by him before being proceeded with by the contractors.\n\nI am of opinion that it would be advisable to obtain the authority of the Governor in Council for the first and third of the above payments, each of which exceeds $5,000.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Deputy Supt.

It is noted that it is advisable to obtain the authority of the Governor in Council for the first and third payments referred to in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. S. Williams.\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorges Gonthier, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nMuscowequan Boarding School R.C. 23rd Decm 1931\n\nThe class-room work is carried on in three class-rooms all supervised by Sisters. There are 36 boys in one room and the grades range from Grade 2 to Grade 7. In the girls room there are 34 pupils graded from Grade 2 to Grade 6. In the primary room there are 28 pupils enrolled and all are beginners.\n\nThe pupils were all neatly dressed, clean and tidy in appearance. These pupils all speak out well, are good readers. In the exercise books I found the work neatly set down and the work well done. I would judge progress is being made in all the class rooms.\n\nThe building throughout was clean. The dormitories were all -\nmitories were all well aired and the beds neatly made. Gowns and pyjamas are supplied for each child.\n\nThe laundry, sewing-room, and kitchen are each in charge of a sister. The children appear to enjoy their work and are happy. The girls learn to cook, bake bread, and do all kinds of sewing and washing. They also are taught to milk and do gardening.\n\nThe fire escapes are all in good condition, as is all fire equipment. The dormitory doors and fire escape doors are never locked. The fire escape doors open from one of the Sister's rooms so that no one can pass out unknown. Fire drill is observed regularly and the children get out in from two to three minutes.\n\nThe laundry work is carried on in an outside building and only a power washing machine is supplied in the line of machinery. The washing necessary for the staff and over one hundred children entails a lot of work especially with such poor equipment. The drying of the clothes is a difficult task during the cold winter weather and would be made much better if an extractor and drying tumbler could be provided.\n\nThe new root cellar appears quite satisfactory. Above the cellar a building has been erected as a house for the engineer. This is well built and makes a comfortable home.\n\nThe meals served are well cooked and the children receive all they want. The general menu is as follows:\n\n**Breakfast**\n- Rolled oats, prunes, baked apples or syrup - bread and butter - omelettes or cold meat for the working boys\n- tea or cocoa or milk\n\n**Dinner**\n- Soup - beef stew or pork roast - vegetables, bread, butter, tea or milk pudding or fruit as convenient\n\n**Supper**\n- Hash meat, potatoes, beans, omelettes, or cold meat, bread and lard, tea or milk\n\nEvery Friday is fish day - eggs, canned salmon or fresh fish.\nFresh fish as convenient.\n\nWeak or sick children receive a glass of milk or egg-nog as 10 a.m. also 3 p.m.\n\nI found no sick children and they all looked well and appeared to enjoy their meals.\n\nA large herd of cattle is kept and a good supply of milk is available at all times.\n\nThe outbuildings are all in good repair except the granary, and this is past repairing. There is no foundation and the floor and sills have rotted. The place is overrun with rats and a new granary is badly needed.\n\nThis school is well managed and the Reverend Father Poulet is ably assisted by four men and a staff of Sisters. The children are well fed and clothed and appear in good health.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

They are no doubt handicapped by not having a properly equipped laundry.\n\nYou will note that the doors leading to the fire escapes here are never locked.\n\nI understand that the Principal of this school, Father Poulet, has been transferred. This is unfortunate, as from reports I have received, the new Principal who has been appointed, Father Bousquet, is not in the same class as Father Poulet.\n\nThe two day schools appear to be carrying on in the usual way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I directed that the pump should be forwarded here for overhauling, and, being placed in the hands of the Electric Equipment Limited, it was found that all that was needed was rewinding and the installation of new bearings. This was done, as you will see, at a cost of approximately $40.00, thus a saving to the Department has been effected of $120.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. D.

P. 110 Volt Motor which was supplied by the Department for the Deep Well Pumping System at the school.\n\nI have taken this matter up with the R. A. Lister Company, and they have this to say:\n\n\"By installing the larger cylinder this of course increased the starting load of this motor; therefore when starting this motor without the use of a proper starter the safety fuses protecting the motor have got to be of a heavy enough amperage to take care of the starting current which runs approximately three times the running amperage of the motor. Therefore, with these heavy fuses in you have no protection on your motor if a short should develop in the motor or trouble arise in the equipment.\"\n\nIt seems to me the Department should authorize the purchase of this starter. The cost, I would think, would be approximately $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nW. M.

Gauthier\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that on the 4th June 1931, the Inspector of Construction at Punnichy, forwarded to the department an account (order No. 3964) from the R.A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Limited, for transfer of Lister Lighting Plants from Edmonton to Muscowequan Indian School. The account, less percentages, amounted to $1819.05, and it was paid by official cheque No. 1252 for the amount stated. In the account these two charges appeared:\n\n\"Dismantling & crating at Edmonton........$66.35\nTransportation To Edmonton freight sheds 9.75\"\n\nOn the 23rd November you forwarded a voucher to the Department for $75.94 in favour of the above named firm. It was made up of three items, viz.: $66.35, $9.35 and .24\u00a2. This voucher was paid by cheque No. 4735 for $75.94. As it seems that this payment duplicated the payment referred to above, I shall be glad to have you look into the matter, and if an error has been made I have to request that you will obtain refund from the company without delay, and forward the money to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.R.L.

A. Lister and Company (Canada) Limited, I have to state that, while this amount appears to be incorporated in an account presented by them for $1,819.02 and again submitted later and therefore duplicated, the Company claims that it is entitled to payment of a further sum of $601.19 covering charges in connection with the installation of the pumping plant at the Muscowequan School. The larger account of $1,819.02 appears to have been certified to and sent in by Mr. Swan, Superintendent of Construction, while the lesser, $601.19, was submitted to Mr. Tempest the Representative of the Department of Irrigation who should have certified to it and sent it on to Ottawa. I do not know whether the latter account reached the Department, but if it did and payment has not yet been made to the Company a deduction from it of $75.94 can be made and this will adjust the Department's account with R.

Tempest, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have spent considerable time on the account for the pumps at Muscowequan School, and are now in a position to reply more fully to your letter of February 23rd.\n\nThe copies of correspondence that you sent us were a very great help, as they were not in our Regina files.\n\nIn the detailed original account there are more than a hundred and fifty items, running from ten cents up, and it has been almost impossible to follow Mr. Doupe's trail.\n\nOn our original account for $2,420.21, Mr. Swan wrote, \"O.K., as to item of $1,800.00 for transfer, repairs, and installation of lighting plant.\" This was Regina office estimate before the work was done, and not a guaranteed amount. Later, the account was subdivided and we attach, as requested, four copies of the lighting plant account for $1,519.02, which has been passed and paid. We are also enclosing four copies of the account covering the pump, amounting to $601.19. There was an error of $1.00 in adding up the amount of out of pocket expenses for freight, wages, expenses, etc., but we are reducing your account by $1.00 to arrive at the original amount of $2,420.21.\n\nWe are also enclosing full details of the expense account of W.J. Montgomery and G. Kettering, as well as copies of the prepaid freight bills for $7.31 and $7.17.\n\nMr. Doupe apparently thought that Mr. Swan would only pass an account for the original estimate of $1,800.00 and therefore charged the additional amount to the pumpint equipment. Of all the small pipe fittings that were bought, some of them must have been used in connection with the pumps, but it is impossible to make a sharp dividing line, and it would now appear that they have been charged in to the lighting plant, as your account does not cover anything but the price of the pumps, the freight, labour and expenses.\n\nWe trust this will now put the account in shape for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Ltd.,\nG.T. Mumford.\nCOPY.\n\nWall Street,\nWinnipeg, Feb.27,1932.\n\nJ.S.Tempest,Esq.,\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nVery many thanks for your letter of the 23rd inst. and the trouble you have taken to make this account clear.\n\nThe copies of documents that you sent us were not in our Regina files, so that we could not understand clearly what had taken place. Mr. Deupe did many very strange things, and as it now turns out, we were unfairly critical of him as we did not realize that he must have been a very sick man.\n\nIt will take a little time to get the detailed information you require, but we will do so at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe account for $105.00 covering the Cylinder and Pipe installed at Lestock was in the name of Mumford, Medland, Limited, and we have received payment for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.Lister & Co.(Canada) Ltd.,\n(signed) G.T.Mumford.\nFebruary 23, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the payment of a balance of $601.19 on the installation of a lighting plant, battery and pumping equipment for the Muscowequan School at Lestock, Sask.\n\nIn order to make the matter clear to you to the extent of my own knowledge, I will recapitulate all correspondence dealing with the proceedings.\n\nI received a letter from your Regina office dated April 28, 1932, and signed by S.A. Doupe, a copy of which is enclosed. This letter was accompanied by an invoice, a copy of which is also enclosed. This was not added but the total amounted to $602.19. The letter was also accompanied by another invoice which, if I remember correctly, contained this sum and also one for $1800 for transfer and overhaul of Lighting Plant.\n\nI returned this latter invoice to you on May 15 together with a letter, a copy of which is enclosed and which is self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note the condition of the first invoice. Items Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 total $157.55. Apparently, according to the statement which was returned, the total was $175.57, a difference of $18.02. This is the reason for my reduction from $2420.21 to $2402.19. Items 1 and 3 remain unchanged. Thus $1800 plus $249.94 plus $194.70 plus $157.55 total to $2402.19.\n\nYou will also note that paragraph (6) of my letter of May 15 contained directions for supplying details of Items 5 and 6, viz: that these items should be further itemized and at unit prices, similarly to 7, 8 and 9.\n\nI received an answer from Mr. Doupe, dated May 20, 1931, in which occurred the following paragraph: \"With regard to the itemizing of the mechanics' expenses and time, we are having this prepared and will have it forwarded to you in the course of a day or two. As per your suggestion, we are having the two accounts separated.\"\n\nApparently Mr. Doupe lost sight of this portion of the negotiations in arranging for the replacement of the cylinder, as he never received the invoice for $602.19 with corrections although Mr. Swan seems to have been invoiced for the lighting plant.\n\nRe A. Lister & Co. (Canada) Limited,\nWall Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nParagraph '2' of my letter stated that several omissions and defects should be rectified before payment was made. This, together with the apparently incorrect invoice, explains the reason for delay. The cylinder has now been replaced and I have notified the Director to that effect.\n\nAs mentioned in your letter of the 13th instant you invoiced us for $2420.21. I reduced this to $2402.19 as hereinbefore explained. You state that Mr. Swan \"O.K.\"d\" the lighting account for $1819.02, and caused it to be paid. It appears that the $1800.00 account was changed to $1819.02. The $602.19 has apparently been changed to $601.19. The total has now increased to $2421.21 instead of $2420.21 if the original $602.19 be considered.\n\nIn order to clear up the question will you kindly prepare the following documents:\n\n1. Four copies of the receipted bill for the Lighting Plant as signed by Mr. Swan, for filing purposes.\n\n2. Four copies of an original invoice to our office for the $601.19 or $602.19, as the case may be, itemized as mentioned above, to be checked and sent to Ottawa.\n\nWould you kindly inform me of the reason for the apparent change from $1800 to $1819.02; and why the items 2, 4, etc., were apparently totalled to $175.57 instead of $157.55? The differences are $19.02 and $18.02 respectively.\n\nIt has occurred to me that the reason for your ignorance of conditions is due to the letters being in your Regina office. I note that your letter is signed \"R.A. Lister & Co per G.T. Mumford\". I was under the impression from a letter I received from Regina on the 26th ultimo, that Mumford, Medland, Limited, had taken over the business and that the payment of $105 for the cylinder and pipe installation was to be made payable to them.

Tempest, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn April 10th last we invoiced the Department with $2,420.21, covering the installation of a lighting plant, battery, and pumping equipment for the Muscowequan Indian School.\n\nAt the request of Mr. Swan, our Regina manager, afterwards divided this amount into two invoices, one for $1,819.02, which has been passed by Mr. Swan and paid by the Department, and the other we presume must have been for $601.19, covering the balance of the account, which would normally be passed by you. However, we cannot find copies of this as it was done by Mr. Doupe a short time previous to his death, and we are now trying to find out how we are to be paid for the balance of $601.19.\n\nWas this matter taken up with you by our Regina office and can you help us get the matter straightened out?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

The Department does not appear to have any information regarding these accounts, and I would request that you make enquiry in connection therewith. If you are of opinion that they should be paid by this Department, I would request that you prepare voucher forms, in triplicate, with accounts attached, and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The water there is so hard that the cost of water softener and other chemicals put in it comes to quite an item and the Principal states he will stand all the cost of constructing a large reservoir if the Department purchases the cement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reference to your letter 121-5-5 of the 26th ultimo regards an account of General Steel Wares Ltd., I beg to say that the $1.51 item was for repairs to stove shipped to the Muscovequan School by the firm who supplied it, the principal says it was the T.Eaton Co., of Regina, Sask. From information I have been able to get it would appear that the principal at that time asked the firm to put the new stove in good repair and they sent on these goods. The $1.51 should therefore not be paid by the Department.\n\nThere is nothing on file here about the seventy-six cent item. I cannot recall any heater being purchased, but if the company gives details the transaction might be traced up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 11, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRegarding the enclosed account for 76 cents, freight on heater from Regina to Punnichy, I have to say that the Department is unable to trace this matter.

If this is a fair charge, the Principal should arrange for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W.

Questioned as to their movements on or about the 25th August, they both stated that they could not remember as it was so far back, but whatever they were doing it had no connection with the above theft as they had at no time taken gasoline from the above named school, or in the vicinity of same.\n\nSub-Division I made enquiries at Mr. H. Stern, Lestock, as to any of these Fishers having purchased gas from him, and he stated that they sometimes bought the occasional two or three gallons but he could not remember when they had made their last purchase; but he was sure they had not bought any within the last two or three weeks.\n\nDetachment I made further enquiries but nothing was to be gained, and owing to the lateness of the enquiry it is somewhat difficult for me to place the time and dates.\n\nP.C.R. Nothing further has been mentioned by Mr. Jean in regard to his fence being broken, and therefore presumably no action is being taken in this regard.\n\nLi. - 9 - 32.

After I got his report I went to the school to see what he objects to. The equipment is the old stuff put in years ago and has served its time by all appearances, the insulation is off most of the wiring. There are long spans of wire between the buildings without any support. These sort of things go along for years and make no trouble but eventually destroy the property.\n\nI have had estimates made of the cost of necessary expense of putting this place in good condition, it amounts to about $300.00, all correspondence is enclosed.\n\nIf the work is not done the light will have to be cut off and lanterns used, this is not good business, the boys might set the barns on fire with lanterns.\n\nWill you please advise me what is to be done about this work; kindly return the papers I enclose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the condition of the electric lighting installation in the outbuildings at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. It is noted that you enclose the report of the Inspector of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, regarding the matter, together with quotations which you received for the placing of the lighting equipment in good condition.\n\nIn reply I have to say that no appropriation was provided to cover this expense, and, as our funds for other school expenditures are extremely limited, the full amount we would be able to provide towards the cost of replacing the present equipment would be $150.\n\nAs it is considered quite necessary that this lighting equipment to the outbuildings be renewed as soon as possible, it is hoped that the Principal can provide the balance of the cost, from the per capita allowance or other school receipts. You should take this matter up with the Principal at once, and, if he consents to the paying of all costs in excess of the $150 which this Department will allow, you may arrange to have the work undertaken by a firm on the list to receive consideration who quote the lowest price for supplying the material and carrying out the work required. If the Principal is unable to pay the portion of the cost over and above the amount the Department can provide, the renewing of the equipment will have to stand over until next year.\n\nAfter you have consulted the Principal, please advise the Department of the action taken. I return the correspondence which you forwarded, as requested. If the work is proceeded with, you should, when forwarding the voucher, in triplicate, for the amount of the expense that will be paid by the Department, attach thereto the report of the Inspector of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, together with the quotations received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

There is a man on the list in Lestock named Chas Haile who has a partner named S. Alex Shaw who is qualified to do the work, Mr Shaw offers to do the job relating to the large barn and the pig pen for $150.00.

The Inspector of the Province of Saskatchewan reported the present wiring as defective. The authorities of the School will furnish labor if the Department provides the materials.\n\n2- An air compressor for water pump Curtis, Model B, No. 3, 3\u00bd x 3. We understand that Aegidown's of Winnipeg are the agents for this make of pump. We consider this improvement very necessary. On four different occasions last winter, we had to haul water for the needs of the School. As the nearest supply is one mile away, considerable inconvenience is experienced every time the water system of the School goes out of order.\n\n3- Dormitories, recreation halls and dining room need to be painted and varnished. The School will provide labor if the Department will supply the paint and varnish.\n\n4- We are told that linseed oil hardens cement floors. We would like the Department to supply one barrel of good quality oil so that the floors of the School may be treated.\n\n5- There is no extractor for the laundry. As this is considered a very necessary piece of laundry machinery, we ask the Department to supply one.\n\nThe School is still without a laundry house, but in view of the present depression the School authorities will continue to use the present temporary building.\n\n(Sgd.)

If, however, the Principal and yourself consider that the supplying of the air compressor is more urgent than laundry equipment and also if other equipment or repairs are more urgent - the total cost of which should not exceed the above stated amount, I would request you advise the Department as soon as possible concerning what equipment, repairs, etc., the Principal and yourself would recommend be provided instead of the extractor for the laundry. When forwarding a recommendation, you should give full details as to cost involved. When we are advised as to the more urgent requirement, consideration will be given to authorizing the expenditure.

He says he could purchase a machine for about $500.00 in Winnipeg.\n\nI have been away on holiday or would have attended to this matter previously. On my visit to the school I find that the principal decided that the cement allowed, $150.00, will not be sufficient for his purposes, he wants the Department to change the E.R.#36 to make it read for purpose of buying two 5000 galvanized tanks. I told him he could not change anything without order from you. The two tanks would cost close to $200.00. If they will suit his purpose I would recommend that he be allowed the same as formerly viz $150.00 and let him pay the balance.

Pews are the only furniture we supply in the chapels, the remainder is supplied by the Church.\n\nI sent this letter to you to ascertain whether this Company should be on the patronage list. If it should be, I shall write them stating the above mentioned facts, and that we should be glad to receive a call from their representative, as some supplies might be required later on on which they could give us prices.\nMr Scott,\n\nReturned as requested.\nSeptember 3, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in which you ask to be given an opportunity to tender on the seating and furniture required for the chapel of the new Indian Residential School at Lestock, Sask.

Murphy,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry regarding plans and specifications for the tables, cupboards, etc., required for the Muscowequan School, I beg to say that plans and specifications for this equipment were prepared by Mr. William Swan, Architect of Punnichy, who is the Inspector of Construction on this work. Mr. Swan was instructed to consult with the Reverend Principal, prepare the plans and specifications for this portion of the equipment and obtain prices; the prices to be forwarded to the Department together with copies of the plans and specifications for consideration. When these were received here it was noted that some of the equipment was specified in oak. As it was considered that fir would serve the purpose and be more economical I requested that new prices be invited with this change. In preparing the specifications Mr. Swan was probably influenced by the Reverend Principal in specifying oak in place of fir.\nMarch 6, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of the 4th instant I beg to say that the tenderers on cupboards and fittings for the Muscowequan School at Lestock, Sask., have all been asked to revise their tenders and substitute Douglas fir for oak. Mr. William Swan, an Architect of Punnichy, is the Inspector of Construction at this school. He was previously the Inspector of Construction at the George Gordon's Church of England School. He is a highly competent man, and prepared the plans and specifications for the George Gordon School requirements, specifying that fir should be used. He was asked to prepare plans and specifications and to ask for tenders on cupboards and fittings for the Muscowequan School from firms approved by yourself. He did so and submitted the results. It was noticed by our Architect that he had specified oak instead of fir, which could not be approved by the Department.\nMarch 19, 1931.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Buskard.\n\nI beg to refer to my memorandum of the 20th of February with reference to the cupboards, tables, benches, etc., required for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nOn March 3rd the four firms mentioned in my memorandum were written to and asked to submit a detailed price for the equipment contained in their tender also to state the difference in price between oak and fir for the articles that were specified to be of oak. The purpose in asking for the detailed price on the equipment was to make it possible to try and cut down the list by eliminating some of the items. These prices have been received and the following is a statement:\n\n| NAME OF FIRM                  | ORIGINAL PRICE | PRICE OF FIR | PRICE WITH ITEMS OMITTED |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| Western Mfg.

It is represented that the furnishings and supplies in the old school can be used to advantage in the new building, and that the list on which prices are being obtained by the Department, is altogether unnecessary.\n\nThe Minister would like a memorandum from you stating:\n\n1st: At whose request the list was prepared?\n\n2nd: If any check was made of the furnishings and supplies in the old school? A report presented as to what portion of these furnishings and supplies can be utilized in the new building.\n\n3rd. What is the general practice of the Department in matters of this kind?\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nApril 7, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 1st instant with reference to the furnishing of the new Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I beg to quote from a memorandum addressed to the Honourable Superintendent General on December 22nd, as follows:\u2014\n\n\"As for the general method employed in furnishing these residential schools, I may say that it has been the practice in the past to allow the Principal, after consulting with his staff, to submit to the Department a list of the furnishings required. When this list is received here it is carefully checked in order that the equipment will conform to that furnished other schools. It is necessary to disallow some of the items asked for, and in some cases to make additions. This list is then subdivided and forms of tender prepared and submitted to the different firms for prices. The names of the firms who are asked to quote are obtained from the Minister's Office. We have furnished all our schools under this system and it has been found to work well.\"\n\nThis procedure was followed in the case of the Muscowequan School, and when the Architect of the Department made an inspection of the new building last fall he instructed the Reverend Principal to forward to the Department a list of the furnishings required with detailed instructions as to how to prepare these lists. He was also instructed to forward a list of the equipment that could be transferred from the old building for use in the new. When these lists were received from the Principal there was attached a list of the usable equipment and this was taken into account when the forms of tender were being prepared.\n\nC.S.

WILLIAMS,\n\nWill you please refer to your memorandum of the 7th instant, with regard to the furnishings of the New Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nWhat the Minister would like is a statement showing who requested the list of furnishings for the school and by whom the list was prepared. Was the equipment in the old building inspected by an officer of the Department with a view to ascertaining what articles could be utilized in the new school? Evidently the Department has been willing to accept the Principal's judgment in this matter with no check whatever by anyone representing the interests of the Department.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nApril 17th, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy -\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the interchange of memoranda with reference to the furnishings for the new Muscowequan school. I do not think you were given the full facts so I desire to supplement them with further information.\n\nThe old Muscowequan school was built and owned by the Church authorities. The older portion was erected in 1895 and additions were made in 1909. The Department purchased the property and the buildings and contents from the Church in 1924. The only furnishings that were supplied by the Department were a few desks, a dough-mixer, a bake-oven and a few beds. It can be readily understood the condition this equipment was in after all these years of hard usage in an Indian residential school. I saw the equipment myself in 1928 when we were considering the question of rebuilding, and it was apparent to even casual inspection that the equipment was worn out. I am sending a list herewith of the articles transferred from the old to the new building, and you will observe that there was considerable salvage.\n\nThe old school accommodated 60 pupils and the new school provides for 110. The new and larger building necessitated additional furnishings. The list was prepared and checked with the greatest care, as usual; every article of furniture is shown in its place on the plan of the building.\n\nFather Poulet, the Principal of the school, is a reasonable man and a good manager, and the Sisterhood of Nuns who look after the domestic part of the building are very economical and reasonable in their demands.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The quotation of the Dominion Bridge Company, in letter dated December 30th, 1930, was addressed to Mr. J. S. Tempest, the Calgary Agent of the Dominion Water Power Bureau.
