Cricket Club and F Division Cricket Club again tried conclusions with the willow. The P.A. club could hardly have got through playing cricket without having been very much puzzled since the last match, and everyone thought it would be an easy victory for the latter, but the latter\u2019s tactics were not in the least bit good that day, not that they played at all badly but every chance given by them was seized upon by the P.A. team. The bowling of the P.A.s was remarkably good with few exceptions. Way gathered in a very strong manner, and when the first came within running distance, their batting was good considering the few practice they had, and the bowling of Black Agnew was also very effective. The police were in fine trim and had quite a bit of practice after the last match. They showed some teamwork both in field and in fine style, although they did not win the game they played without any difficulty. In fact, but for the fielding, their bowlers Brown, Doug, and deservable mention. We must commend the police for their excellent fielding and their drive, and P.H. Irving have something to be proud of in their cricket team. Only one of the players was absent, the late Walter Murray, double figures\u2014McKay, of the P.A.s, and Staff-Sgt. Parker, of F Division. Going by the result of the last price list, he is having an average of nine and two-thirds runs. Parker next best with seven runs. The following is the score:\n\n| P A.

Cricket Club are the victors by one run and three wickets.\n\nMr. Geo. Northcaves and Constable Warren performed the arduous duties of umpire very efficiently.\n\nLOCAL NEWS.\n\nPermits are now being issued to all hotels in the Northwest with a capacity of twelve bedrooms and stabling for five horses, the permits carrying a tax of ten cents per cent of alcohol.

The American team scored seventy-five hundred points.\n\nThe day before the match the Canadians, at a trial at the same range, compiled an insignificant total of 177, but the midgets were able to improve on the match.\n\nINTERESTING TO PARENTS.\n\nMr. John Laidlaw, of the Ottawa Free Press, says: Our baby was so choked up she could hardly breathe. In fact she was so choked she could choke to death. However, because of the difficulty every minute, for which we could get no relief for the most part, formerly, we used to put a little bottle of Nasal Balm in the baby\u2019s mouth and set it trying, and in twenty minutes from the first application she was able to stop coughing and breathing easily, and in twenty-four hours not a sign of trouble remained. It is an invaluable remedy for children as well as grown people.\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of Advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo. P.
