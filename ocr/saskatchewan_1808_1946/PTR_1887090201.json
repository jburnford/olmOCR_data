He wrote a book called \"Birds in Manitoba,\" which appeared in the Manitoba in the spring. In the earlier part of his life he was very well informed on all topics relating to the present and past of this country as well as the habits of the Indians and culture. Last winter he made a trip north for the purpose of studying the habits of the bear, moose, and other animals inhabiting the extreme north of the continent, but had to return owing to the failure of his travelling arrangements.
