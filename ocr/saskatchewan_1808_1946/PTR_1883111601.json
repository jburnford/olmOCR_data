Goffy, Vaish,\" was painted in big letters on the valise he carried in his hand.\n\n\"Well, Jas., old man, you can't have forgotten me, Mr. Sanders\u2014your old friend. How are all the boys in Idaho?\"\n\n\"Think you see yer, glad yer see yer. I've got a present for yer bad memory, but seeing as how yer here, yer may have somethin', and the gangster.\"\n\n\"Of course you do. Coming down for a little look at the old sights. I'm going to pay you a visit. I'll see you after dinner, and we'll take a walk on the valley together. Here's my address.\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you, my boy,\" and the hayseed party much affected. \"There's the first kind words I've heard since Left home, and, with the most natural of his simple, hearty manner, took the young man in his arms and hugged him. Then, going where to meet later, he shuffled along.\n\nThat afternoon the plausible young man was down at headquarters complaining that his watch had been robbed of its watch and pocketed by a \"bootlegger\" up as an old granger.\n\n\"There wasn't nothing particular in them, but they was worth something,\" explained, \"and the watch was cruel, but I'm blessed if I want to be beat at my own game.\" Pooh!\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE Prince Albert Directory AND BUSINESS GUIDE.\n\nIt is proposed to issue a Business Directory for the Town of Prince Albert and Districts of Lloyd and Lorne which will contain the advertisements of each business establishment, (to be in serial order at separate rate) and a descriptive notice of each place.\n\nThe prospectus will contain a history of Prince Albert, its present condition and future prospects, together with a statement of this year's crops, etc., so that they can be accounted for the District of Lorne, extent of acreage, number of cattle, sheep, etc., increase over last year's crop, population of District, and other useful information, written by well known writers.\n\nAbout 500 or more copies will be published according to the encouragement received, and distributed throughout the Dominion and the Mother Country.\n\nIt is hoped that by this means, benefits will result, not only to each individual advertiser and subscriber, but that the whole country will benefit thereby and appreciate what has been done abroad and a healthy emigration encouraged to this country.\n\nPrice of advertisement, whole page, with notice on opposite page, $10; two copies gratis.
