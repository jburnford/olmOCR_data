We can quite understand the anxiety of our eastern contemporaries to keep their \"Blue bloods\" in their own country, and to those who are comfortably situated, and earning a good livelihood in their native land, we would say, stay at home. But we happen to know that there are many who desire to see the young men in the towns and country parts of Nova Scotia and the maritime provinces generally, who are barely making a start in life. Clerks at small stores, journeymen mechanics, shopkeepers, and young men tending the farms which have been worked in the same old way, for generations, by their fathers and grandfathers before them. These classes should migrate to a country like this, where, especially those brought up to farming, can obtain facilities for acquiring a home and a competency. Such a rush will make them pay long years of hard labor to acquire in their own country.\n\nWe are surprised that a journal of the liberal and broad views of the Chronicle, should descend to such mischievous and malicious following:\n\n\"While much of the country is undoubtedly very fertile, very much more of it is no better than it should be. Even in the most fertile part of it there are many drawbacks to overcome by the exertion and enterprise of settlers.\" Our contemporary appears to have his remarks upon the authority of Mr. McCready, editor of the Montreal N. B. Herald, and of the members of the Peace River district of the North West last autumn, and we enjoyed the proud distinction of being the only one of the party, who came to \"spy out the province,\" and to bring back a report with him a truly capable expert. Endorsing the unfavorable opinion of this gentleman, the Chronicle proceeds to give the following frightful picture of the hopes of the North West, which is enough to send the average Nova Scotian tremble in his shoes, and the old New-Westerner laugh in his sleeve:\n\n\"The same soil and substance of what he (Mr. McCready) said about the soil, we are now seeing having a tolerable good turn in New Brunswick was better off, and had a fairer prospect of happiness and comfort than the average Manitoba farmer. The same soil and substance of what he (Mr. McCready) said about the soil, we are now seeing having a tolerable good turn in New\nTHE SASKATCHEWAN DISTRICT.\n\nInteresting Interview with Right Rev. Bishop Brown.\n\nQuite a number of gentlemen interested in lands in the District of Saskatchewan were recently engaged in an interview with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in the parish of the Tecumseh House, and received most valuable information from that gentleman in regard to the section of country lying between Prince Albert and Edmonton. The representative of the Press having heard of the consultation was also present. After the interview, which was thoroughly characteristic of the Bishop, the right reverend prelate was interrogated as to the general condition of the district.\n\n\"There are no fine farming lands in the North West than in the section of country between Prince Albert and Edmonton. From Battleford to Edmonton on the ice, by steamboat, and by land several times, and, added to that, a better en route object in view, cannot be expected to pay as much attention to the geography of the country as a person who has been on the trip on a specific mission. I have no hesitation in saying, from personal observation, that the district is the oldest residents of that portion of the North West, that the district contiguous to both battleford and Edmonton, is well adapted for farming operations, and must before many years become thickly settled. In some localities less than five miles is occupied by a block farm, several feet in depth, whilst throughout the district will be found plots of sandy nature, and soil, but not so well suited for agricultural purposes.\"\n\n\"What railways are projected through that section?\"\n\n\"From Prince Albert, in a north-west direction, the Saskatchewan Valley line is surveyed; the Portage and West branch line is projected in a northerly course to Prince Albert, and will no doubt be continued westerly to Victoria, and Edmonton. In addition to these lines, the Canadian Pacific Railway is expected to touch the important points in that section of the country. The settlement at present is Prince Albert, near the Canada Pacific main line is Qu'Appelle, distant 15 miles, about seventy miles, this will be a market centre for the district. The line from Edmonton to Winnipeg can now be made in eight days. Whereas for years past it was impossible to travel across the road. A wonderful improvement is noticeable in the district, especially about Prince Albert, and there are every reason to believe that the section of country to which my attention has been called, although not yet settled, is for farming purposes, will be very speedily settled by a desirable class of people.\"\n\nMEDICAL HALL\n\nT.

Military tradition has built up the Guard as rigidly superior at this point, and the grandeur of the service and presented without true obstinacy that the trooper should carry out his orders and not be swayed by the dictates. The same suggestion of putting an infantry man on horseback would twenty years hence have been looked upon as a radical innovation and the red tape into a future of rage and resistance. With due respect to the traditions so esteemed, however, we must admit that the Imperial Guard has just and reasonable reverence, we fail in understanding or condemning a rigid adherence to the formulas and traditions in this great and stirring era of change for better or worse. It is akin of course to the spirit which animated the traditions of the last century through which the first Napoleon broke like a thunder bolt. In my opinion, the old Austrian, when he marched and counter-marched for a whole summer and then went back to his quarters, had but a heavy burden hanging over him. He bore a heavy load, but he carried it with dignity from Eupen to Ule and from Ule to the middle of Munster and right battle-field. The whole weight of his tactics is most abundantly shown at Wagram and Austerlitz, however, and justified by the result. We must certainly, that it should be as Bacon says, a real reform that draws on a change, and not a mere change, which is only made under compulsion, as he says again, \"the greatest innovator; and if time after time the same course and windings cannot will not alter, then it is evident what shall be altered? But Imperialist tactics are still under-going change and the appearance of the Guard is not for the better. Thanks largely to the human efforts and sagacity of the late Prince Consort, the Guard has been able to maintain its position, and thanks largely to a Canadian Author, well known for his literary attainments and theoretical views with military history, the Guard, a large number are now put on horseback, or put it in another accurate term, the trooper has been given the opportunity of fighting on horseback.\n\nThe usefulness of such a force needs no explanation like many another example, and the question is not whether the Guard is worth while, but what can be done with regard to it that the military minds of Europe did not think of in long ago, or did not adopt the system. The Guard was created by Napoleon, put out by the Canadian author, to whom we have above referred.\n\nIn 1869 the \"History of Cavalry,\" a work of great talent and laborious research, and of high literary excellence, was published in London by Lord L. E. Egerton Denison, of Canada. Lord Egerton Denison, son of a family connected with the House of Commons, was educated at Harrow School, and was educated at Cambridge University. The work was translated into several languages shortly before its publication in London, and aroused much interest and discussion on the continent of Europe. It was translated into military circles of Europe, and every military journal, according to the light, discussed the merits of the book and its bearing on strategy. It traced the history of cavalry from its infancy down to its latest development at Rossignol and Sedan, its most important characteristics being those devoted to the employment of this branch of the service in the American Civil War. Lord Egerton Denison spoke with comprehensive knowledge of the subject, aided by intimate friendships with many of the leading men of great influence in the South. But the book is delightful reading throughout; and the reader who is fond of military affairs and who wishes to acquire a good grasp such subjects have been handled by a Canadian author. Literary grace, technical accuracy, and a wealth of information are combined in this work. Some years after the appearance of this work a large prize was offered by the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia for the best work on the organization of cavalry, open to all countries. Among the entries was the work of Lord Egerton Denison, which might have secured a hold for Lord Denison, more Canadian, at attempt to compete with the works of the day was not only worthy enough of attempt, but he succeeded as well, and carried off the prize on the part of the Russian Empire. Under the political conditions then in existence it had to be handed in written in the Russian tongue. Lord Denison was sent to St. Petersburg and had translated there, under his own supervision. He was subsequently honored by the Grand Duke and other military dignitaries, and was much interested in the social and political life of the country, then as now, the center of the Russian army. After some delay in the various ways, contributions from the ablest military writers of the time had been made, and in the closest scrutiny of criticism, Col. Denison's work was considered the most convincing, the most suggestive and exhaustive, and was adopted as a guide for the Russian cavalry regiments, a thousand of which he generally handed over to local charities in St. Petersburg, and raising a balance of \u00a3500 through Toronto. This money has been translated into almost every language in Europe. This is not to say that the military mind has been changed to any certain extent, but this one convinced it, and it is largely owing to its influence that the Canadian author has been placed in the Imperial army, and that large numbers of our mounted forces are now trained in the same manner.\n\nOur limited space forbids us to enlarge upon this notable achievement, but it is that of Lord Denison, and we can but reply that he is the most illustrious member of the order of merit on the royal side this year. Of this Canadian author, a vigorous intellect, deeply versed in military history and military organization, we may say that he is the most illustrious member of the order of merit on the royal side this year. Of this Canadian author, a vigorous intellect, deeply versed in military history and military organization, we may say that he is the most illustrious member of the order of merit on the royal side this year.\n\nTHE TELEGRAPH.\n\nThe following letter written by Mr. Hartley Gibbons to Mr. H. C. Stevenson of Prince Albert was kindly furnished to us by Mr. Stevenson. It is one of the closest and most interesting letters Col. Denison ever wrote, and contains the most convincing, the most suggestive and exhaustive, and was adopted as a guide for the Russian cavalry regiments, a thousand of which he generally handed over to local charities in St. Petersburg, and raising a balance of \u00a3500 through Toronto. This money has been translated into almost every language in Europe.

Kinnear had been arrested by the police of the District Court, we must not be understood as reflecting in the slightest degree upon the character or conduct of Sergt. Kinnear, who we believe gives every satisfaction in the discharge of his duties, nor do we wish to make any personal attacks.\n\nThe two positions Deputy Sheriff and Clerk, cannot be properly held by the same person.\n\nIn our report of the surprise party held at Athabasca, Mclean's residence, we forgot to mention that Mr. John Mclean entertained the company during the dinner mission. He performed, with his usual eloquence, a very amusing sketch, a beautiful piece called \"The Jack a Tar on Board a Man of War,\" also to the sur-prise of the company, he sang and danced \"The Irish Paddy,\" \"Towards the close of the evening's amuse- ment he sang \"The Old Flag\" and \"Home Sweet Home,\" in fact he promised himself to make the surprise party a success.\n\nSome years ago we heard that the Indians were trying to prevent the cattle from crossing the border into the Dominion, by setting fire to the prairies in front of them. This year, however, the Indians, with all his cuteness, has been circum-vented this time. A change of wind drove the buffalo away from the herds, and this flack movement has driven them in large numbers to the North. Our people have taken advantage of this fact, and have sent Mr. Ellis D.L.S., who is here on his way to Vig- nals, where he will employ himself in rounding up the buffalo, and will probably return within a few weeks.\n\nMr. Charles Levery, manager of the North Western Mining Company of Toronto, who has been in Prince Albert for the last six weeks, went away by the last mail. He goes around the country lecturing the Company on the subject of exploiting the company which now lies at Cumberland, and will make additional and improved apparatus for developing for gold in the Saskatchewan River district. He expects to return about the end of January or beginning of February, when he will superintend the building of a house to receive the ma-chinery. Contracts have been made and hopes have been delivered by the late Mr. McPhee, who has been engaged to build a dam across the river, and to improve the quality of our river, and we have no doubt that Mr. Levery will succeed. Mr. Levery made himself very popular during his short stay here, by his courteous and genial manners.\n\nSTEWART AND WOOTTON,\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS.\n\nTo the Ladies of PRINCE ALBERT.\n\nWe beg to notify the ladies of Prince Albert that we have just opened up\n\nFIFTEEN CASES GENERAL DRY GOODS\n\nDress Goods Satins Silk Velvets, Velveteens, Cashmere, Taffeta, French Beige and Fancy Dress Goods.\n\nCloakings.\n\nMelton, Fancy Cloakings.\n\nShawls.\n\nTartan, Wool, Fancy Shawls.\n\nHose.\n\nLadies' Balloon Hose, Ladies' Seamless Hose, Ladies' Ribbed Hose, Ladies' Wool Hose, Mince and Children's Hose.\n\nUnderwear.\n\nLadies' Underwear, Ladies' Felt Skirts.\n\nCollars and Cuffs.\n\nWe show a Select Assortment of Ladies' Collars and Cuffs.\n\nSILK HANDKERCHIEFS.\n\nClouds.\n\nMince and Children's Hose.\n\nLadies' Winceys, Woolen Gowns, Flannel, Fancy Ornaments, Quilting Prints, Linings, Lace Curtains, Cloth Covers.\n\nQuilts.\n\nWhite and Colored Quilts.\n\nComforters.\n\nBlankets, Blankets, Blankets.\n\nOil Cloth.\n\nDouble and Fancy Oil Cloths.\n\nGREEN WINDOW HOLLAND Yarns.\n\nCanadian Yarns, Scotch Fingering, White Black, Oxford Grey, Navy Blue, Red, Gold, Silver.\n\nCarpets.\n\nTapestry and Woolen Carpets at very low prices.\n\nBoots.\n\nLadies' Warm Lined Boots.\n\nSTEWART & WOOTTON.\n\nT.
