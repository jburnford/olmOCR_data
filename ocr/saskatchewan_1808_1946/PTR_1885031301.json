The Week says: So the era in which the Republic opened her hospitable arms to the distressed and dis- tressed, to all nations appeared to be drawing to a close. The measure evidently emanates immediately from the trades unions, and is an attempt on their part to close the labor market against immigration. Their failure will certainly be blamed. Monopoly for the capitalist, competition with freely imported labor for the workman, has been the policy of Protectionist manufacturers. The measure attacks both political as well as an industrial aspect. The native Americans are becoming so alarmed by the growth of the foreign element. They have reason. Statistics of foreign birth rates are unprecedentedly high at the durance. The child of naturalized parents, while he is born to the privileges, seldom inherits the qualities of a citizen. The Irish especially, held together by their old habits, tend to Irish in the third and fourth generation. With the foreigner, Communism is on the increase; and recent events at Cincinnati and Chicago combine with the meetings of the Prince Albert Club, Irish riots in New York to fill the American mind with fears of disturbance, which, as was seen by the hard light of the Pittsburgh fires, would be most formidable in a country so densely peopled as ours. The American race itself does not increase; probably it diminishes, thanks to the prevalence among its women of ideas and habits which certain philanthropists are laboring to import into Canada. It is doubtful whether the element of the people in which the traditions of self-government resides will retain its ascendancy long enough to complete the training of the other races. A policy of industrial unionism would scarcely be practicable or consistent with human liberty. The Irish Republic, to refuse to make dumping ground for European pauperism, and to provide, if it be possible, that the naturalization law be strictly enforced.\n\nBy the dismissal of Irish workmen from English works, in consequence of the dynamic outrages, attention has been called to the fact that multitudes of Irish are domiciled in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, in the broad of the country which they are vilifying and conspiring to destroy. It must surely be deemed strange, that if the English people had been disposed cruel and inhumanly tyrants to the Irish, these Irish should choose to take up their abode in Great Britain. What would have become of them if England had not offered them shelter? If Ireland had been a free island could not have maintained itself, and their fate would have been what that of the French Canadians would be if their rapidly growing population were shot up in Quebec. The Irish in Great Britain, instead of boycotting, and expulsion are to be the order of the day, they may not be the only sufferers by that game. It is deplorable, we are told, that the crime of the Irishman would thus be visited on innocent workmen. It is deplorable, most deplorable, that hatred shall have stirred up between two races who are inseparably intermixed with each other, and mutually dependent, five under the same roof. But on whom does the blame rest? Nor, if the Irish in England generally are innocent of the dynamic outrages, are they innocent of those committed against the English people. They have on many occasions exhibited their hostility in the most irritating and insulting manner; they have broken in upon public meetings; they have held meetings of their own, often in open hostility and parallel sympathy with their enemies; and they are notoriously preparing to use the British franchise in aid of a conspiracy for the dismemberment of the British realm. Would any other nation be willing to cherish its abused enemies in its bosom? How would the Americans have treated open sympathy with rebellion in the time of the civil war? How did they treat the Irish when the Irish rose in favor of the South?\n\nA Detroit paper speaking of the recent visit of the increased number of Irish to Ottawa says, that \"as the National Policy is almost played out, Sir John will espouse the temperance cause and go to the country on the prohibition issue.\" The fact that the Irish are now free to trade freely across the border, in respect of the National Policy. The other statement may be equally correct.\n\nOwing to the great difficulty, expense and uncertainty of getting supplies and provisions to the distant district of Macdonald, the settlers there have decided to build a steamer at Fort Smith, on the Slave river, to ply between that point and Fort Simpson, on the Mackenzie. For many years past the Indians have almost impossible to procure a sufficient number of Indians at Fort Simpson, owing to the distance, and the inability to send as many boats as otherwise would have been done. The quantity of provisions brought to the Indians has been less than it ought to have been, and frequent danger of starvation has been the consequence at most of the posts through out the district.\nPRINCE ALBERT HIGH SCHOOL\n\nUnder the auspices of the PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF CANADA.\n\nThis School will be opened on TUESDAY, 10TH MARCH,\n\nWhen Classes will be formed in English, Latin, Greek, French, Mathematics, and the other Subjects taught in Public and High Schools.\n\nUntil other arrangements can be made, the School will be conducted by Rev.

An investigation showed that there had been a leak in the gas main, and the escaping gas had penetrated to the house. It had been caused by a fire in a neighboring yard, and the accident had been communicated to the gas company.
