At that time there was a rather wide spread feeling that our claims were likely to be ignored, but we have always been sanguine enough to expect that full recognition would be forthcoming in time, and the result has proved the correctness of our views.\n\nThe last mail brought notices to those who served in the Prince Albert Barracks that the Act 40 Victoria Chapter 90, setting the question at rest in a way that cannot fail to be agreeable to our volunteers.\n\nWe may now allow to congratulate all concerned on this decision of the Government, the more so as it is another, and we think a conclusive proof, that the Government are far from entertaining any feeling adverse to the interests of our settlement, and a few\u70ed\u5fc3men seem to dread. Indeed, when along with their action in connection with the Police Barracks, a report is made which will be found in the present issue, it goes to prove that the interests of the important settlement are at present having, and in future will receive ample justice from those in authority.\n\nWe have good reason to believe that the Government will be disposed to admit the Prince Albert volunteers to the benefits of the Bounty Act has been at least hastened by the exertions of Capt. Macdonald, who once and again has pled the cause of the local force, and in this he has been ably seconded by Acting-Mayor Betts, his colleague in the late deportations on the barracks matter. New difficulties may arise; but forget that thanks are also due to our member Mr. Hughes, and others who brought the weight of their influence to bear in the right direction.\n\nWe have not yet heard whether the volunteers are to receive medals as well as scrip, but we have no doubt this will follow as a natural consequence.\n\nThere seems to be little doubt that a new extradition treaty between the United States and Great Britain will be concluded, and that which there will be a reciprocity in defaulters and dynamiters between the two countries. There is no reason why there should be any more difficulty in following a similar practice between Canada and United States or between the United States and Canada, than from one province or state into another. International boundary lines should not afford a screen for crime.\n\nTHE SYNOD.\n\nThe Synod of the Diocese of Saskatchewan will meet in St. Mary's Church on Wednesday next, the 9th August, at 11 a.m., with the Bishop in the chair. His Lordship the Bishop will preach, as a rule, when at the Synod. Mr. McMillan's in the morning and the Chaplain's in the evening.\n\nSt. Catharines.\n\n10:30 a.m.\u2014Rev.
