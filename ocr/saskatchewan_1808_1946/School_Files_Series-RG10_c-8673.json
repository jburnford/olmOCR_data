This well has never been satisfactory and has not enough water to keep the school and Teacher's residence supplied.\n\nThe Teacher has requested that a new well be dug which I believe is the only solution. However I feel that we can not get a good well without going down at least 80 feet; the cost would be around $250.00. This school is located where it is very uncertain of a well which would supply a good flow of water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\nR.S.

From the information quoted above from your own communication it would appear that in 1939 you were under the impression that the well dug at that time would last for several years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.S.

The old barn which is 12 x 16 is too small and he suggests that an addition 14 x 16 be added. If approved he will endeavour to obtain the price of the material required for such an addition.\n\nAlso, Mr. Risedorf believes there are about 20 acres of land belonging to the school and he would like to get permission to work this land for his own use. As I have said in another letter, I do not know the teacher and her husband on Little Red River Reserve and was never informed of their names. Also I have not the slightest idea to what land he is referring. However, I am submitting this to our Branch for their consideration.\n\nM.

The old barn which is 12 x 16 is too small and he suggests that an addition 14 x 16 be added. If approved he will endeavour to obtain the price of the material required for such an addition.\n\n\"Also, Mr. Risedorf believes there are about 20 acres of land belonging to the school and he would like to get permission to work this land for his own use. As I have said in another letter, I do not know the teacher and her husband on Little Red River Reserve and was never informed of their names. Also I have not the slightest idea to what land he is referring. However, I am submitting this to our Branch for their consideration.\"\n\nFrom the above the Department presumes that the teacher's husband is residing on the reserve. This is the first intimation that we have had of this action on his part. It is difficult to understand why the teacher's husband should assume that he can come in on the reserve with a considerable quantity of livestock and in addition try to obtain twenty acres of land to work for his own use. Such action is bound to receive unfavourable criticism from the Indians and as a consequence will militate against any work that the teacher is doing.\"\nIt is not our intention to spend any money in fixing the barn at the Little Red River School. As a matter of fact we do not seem to have any information on our file about this barn. Mr. Riedorf should remove his goats and horses from the reserve and should be definitely informed that the Department has no intention of placing twenty acres at his disposal.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the Little Red River School, I enclose, for your information, copy of a letter which is being forwarded to Indian Agent Jones.\n\nIt is regretted that you were not informed of this teacher's appointment. As a matter of fact she was nominated by Right Reverend H.D. Martin, Bishop of Saskatchewan, and only began duties at the school on April 17.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have received a letter today from Mr. Jones, Indian Agent, Carlton Agency, with respect to the water situation on the Little Red River Reserve.\n\nIn the first case I might say this is the first time I was aware of the fact that the teacher on that reserve was Mrs. Risedorf. As usual, in the last two years we have never been informed as to the names of the teachers engaged for the various Indian Day Schools in this province.\n\nNow referring back to the water situation I understand that an Indian has been hired to haul water there but the Agent informs me this has not proven satisfactory. Mr. Risedorf, the husband of the teacher, is of the opinion that he can get a supply of water at a depth of 24 ft. and he is going to put down a test hole. If he finds water then with your recommendation we should sanction a well there. The Agent estimates that it will take about 500 ft. of lumber and this will cost around $25.00 as well as 15 lbs. of 4\" spike nails at .09\u00a2 a lb. Also Mr. Risedorf is prepared to dig the well at $1.00 per ft. We will require therefore around $50.00 in total.\n\nI would request if funds are available this expenditure be approved providing that Mr. Risedorf succeeds in finding a location with a good supply of water through preliminary tests.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina,\nSask.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant,\nwith reference to the water situation at the\nLittle Red River School. In reply to your\nletter the Department approves an expenditure\nof approximately $50, if you consider such\naction advisable.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWilliam Hunt,\nLittle Red River Reserve,\nJune 1st, 1944\n\nTo\nDept of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCarlton Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nHauling drinking water from April 15th to May 31st. $5.00\n\nWilliam Hunt *\n\nO.K.\nMrs V.M.

Smith\nTEACHER\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, October 31, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe following letter has just been received from Mr. H.A. Smith, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School.\n\n\"We cannot continue teaching in this school unless some repair work is done. We have already had a heavy fall of snow. We have completed forms but this seems to be pretty slow.\"\n\nThe Department approves you making emergency repairs in order to make the school as comfortable as possible for this teacher.\n\nYou might also let me have a report regarding conditions at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReference is made to letter 107-4-5 (W.T.l) of October 31, 1947, re: a letter forwarded to the Department by Mr. H. A. Smith, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School. Matters pertaining to this school were fully discussed with Mr. Smith some time ago. He eventually prepared a requisition for supplies which will be in the hands of the Department by this time.\n\nI visited the school on November 5th which was a day previous to receiving your letter. Mr. Smith did not mention having written the Department.\n\nDue to having been vacant for a year, this school is not in particularly good repair. Two small pieces of plaster have fallen off the wall and the whole of the plaster has loosened sufficiently to require replacement next summer, but some other type of finish would be recommended, this matter was discussed with Mr. Smith. The windows of the classroom open from the bottom, Mr. Smith complained that this was not correct and requested immediate steps be taken to correct this error in construction. I explained it would be impossible to obtain the services of a carpenter to go that distance into the country at this time of year to make these changes.\n\nMr. Smith also requested a ventilator be placed in the floor immediately under the heater. I discussed the latter with a heating expert in Prince Albert who ruled the suggestion was not practical.\nGlass has been on order for replacement for some time, this should soon be available.\n\nA range for the teacher's residence which was authorized has been purchased and freighted to the Reserve.\n\nAt the present time I am not prepared to report favourably on Mr. Smith's suitability for his present position.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/ae\nOttawa, November 17, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Saskatchewan.\n\nLittle Red River Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 1314-7-31 LRR of November 10th.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been noted.

Archdeacon Paul, Prince Albert, nominating the services of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain as teacher of the proposed new Indian day school at Little Island Lake on the Ministikwan reserve, No. 161. He states that Mr. Chamberlain has had previous teaching experience. The Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month, this being the amount that can be allowed for a teacher having the qualifications which he possesses. He is to begin duties when the new school building is ready.\n\nArchdeacon Paul states that he recently visited this place and that the Indians are going to start on the work of getting out logs and erecting the building at once. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of April 23rd, last, in which you were informed that the Department would grant the finishing lumber, hardware, etc. I shall be pleased if you will furnish a report on the progress that is being made in the erection of the building and when the work will be completed. You should also report as to what classroom supplies are required.\n\nRelative to the desks, it is thought that tables and benches could be made locally which would be satisfactory until such time as it is ascertained the success which will be made in the work and the attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Present regulations will only permit our allowing Mr. Chamberlain leave with pay for one month. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would advise me, as soon as possible, the exact date on which he was obliged to close the school.\n\nAt the same time, you should forward a medical certificate stating the date just mentioned and, also, the approximate date on which it is expected he will be able to resume duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

No information has reached the Department regarding the length of time he will be absent and, in view of this, his name should be omitted from the April paylist.\nApril 15, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\n\nRe School No. 615.\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 12th instant, the Indian Agent has advised the Department that Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, teacher of the Ministikwan Indian Day School, was able to resume duties after the Easter holidays and, in view of this, his name should appear on the April paylist, as follows:-\n\n615 - Joseph Chamberlain - Onion Lake, Sask. - $70.00\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Ministikwan Indian Day School No. 615\n\nMr. J.P.

You should therefore issue an additional cheque in his favour from Oct. 1st at a salary of $118.00 a teaching month.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n| Central Registry | P.A.

In this connection it is noted you recommend that an allowance of $20 per month be made to O-see-mee-mas, who has been performing this service since the school was started in November, last, without any question of remuneration. It is further noted that 9 of the pupils live a distance of from one to five miles from the school.\n\nThe Department will approve of the payment at the rate of $20 per month for the transporting of these children each school day to and from school. Payment at this rate will be allowed from the first of January, upon receipt of certified vouchers, in duplicate, from time to time, from you, covering the amount due. If O-see-mee-mas continues to perform this duty, it is expected he will see that all who are of school age and in good health attend regularly. The Department is pleased to note, from the quarterly return received showing the attendance for the December quarter, last, that there was an enrolment of 13 pupils, with an average attendance of slightly over 11.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It seems to be a poor affair. Perhaps if we carry out the suggestion to have a Farming Instructor placed at these reserves, we might come to some better arrangement.\n\nMr. Murison's report indicates that the school building is log, 18 x 22, with four windows on the south side. He recommends six window blinds be provided at once (two of these for the teacher's cottage).\n\nThere are two tables and four wooden benches. The teacher has no desk or chair and there is no cupboard.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Mr. Finlay\n\n**ADDRESS:** Onion Lake, Sask.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To Goods as per slip attached | $46.69 |\n|      | Supplies for Ministikwan Indian Day Schools | |\n|      | Vote 76, Allot 12-415 | |\n|      | Authority: Departmental Letter No. 115-4-5 dated November 26, 1940 to Regina | |\n\n**TOTAL** $46.69\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506**\n\n**Voucher No.:** 467\n\n**DATE:** January 3, 1941\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander Esq:\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to the attached Requisition, Mr J.P. Mullan, teacher at Ministikiwin Indian Day School, has requested that repairs to his living quarters be made.\n\nThe house is a log building and he states that it was very cold last winter, despite all efforts to chink etc.\n\nI visited Mr Mullan's house and school about three weeks ago for the first time, but waited until it was possible to speak to him on his return from vacation on 28 August.\n\nThere is only one latrine at this school, a log affair, which is used by the boys, and should be moved to a new site. It appears that the girls have been using the one at the school house. This is not right and I have provision for two new ones in the Requisition.\n\nI recommend that authority be given to carry out this work. If it is not possible to have all the repairs at the house carried out this year, at least some should be done.\n\n(H.S. Packman)\nA/Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter covering requisitions submitted by Mr. Packman, Clerk-in-Charge of the Onion Lake Agency, requesting permission for $245.19 worth of repair work to be done on the Ministikwan Indian Day School.\n\nThere was no provision made for this expenditure in the Onion Lake Estimates for this year but $300.00 was requested for Long Lake Indian Day School. Mr. Packman informs me that not over $65.00 of this $300.00 will be spent on Long Lake; therefore if he could have permission to proceed with his proposal it would mean an expenditure of $27.00 in excess of the Estimates for school repairs. If this cannot be approved could Mr. Packman be given authority to proceed with the work not to exceed the unused portion of his Estimates of $215.00. I would recommend that Mr. Packman be given authority to carry out these repairs and on account of shipping difficulties and the supply of material it would be more economical if you were given permission to make local purchases from approved sources.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMinistikwan Indian Day School.\n\nReference your letter of June 17 and feel that Mrs. Van Norman should be appointed at the Loon Lake School and Miss Krafft at the Ministikwan School.\n\nAs we can probably anticipate complaints concerning the school at Ministikwan, I would like your advice as to what we should do to put it in better condition by September first. I note our files indicate that a teacherage is the main requirement at Ministikwan. Please find attached a self-explanatory letter which I have sent to Mr. Davis concerning a teacherage we ordered for the Split Lake School. This was a prefabricated building purchased from North American Buildings, Limited, at a price of $2,037. I believe it should be quite satisfactory for Ministikwan.\n\nOn the other hand you might wish to recommend the erection of a school based on plan 888. If so, we could arrange to include an amount in our supplementary estimates due in September, 1949.\n\nI know that you will realize the necessity of making conditions at Ministikwan as comfortable for Miss Krafft as possible - otherwise we can anticipate some difficulty with Bishop Martin. I am writing to Miss Krafft today advising her of her appointment at Ministikwan.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Colonel Neary\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, File 637-1 (E), with which was enclosed copy of a personal and confidential letter to me dated July 11th, 1949, file 615-5 (E), regarding the Ministikwan Indian Day School.\n\nWith respect to the condition of the buildings at that point, I wrote Mr. Davis on June 6th, 1949, asking him to report as to what was needed to put the building in shape, and I have not had a reply. I have again brought this to his attention. However, I am definitely in favour of the erection of a combined school and teacherage on the Ministikwan Reserve, based on Plan #828, as this will eventually have to take place and it will be much more advisable than spending the amount of money which will probably be necessary to put the present building in fair shape.\n\nIf this meets with your approval I would ask that you kindly include this amount in the Supplementary Estimates due in September, 1949, in the hope that it can be rushed through and completed for opening not later than the 1st of January, 1950.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Repairs, Ministikwan Indian Day School No.615\n\nIn the 1949-50 Estimates the amount of $100.00 was allowed for the repairing of the above school. We now find that this amount will be insufficient to complete the necessary work. Would you, through your office, request Ottawa for additional monies in this respect, as well as authority to expend the estimated $100.00. This $100.00 will cover the minor repairs and banking but it is also necessary that a pump be installed which would amount to $45.00. There are no ceilings in either the school or the living quarters. This is necessary in order to make the buildings more comfortable. It would take approximately $60.00 to cover it with Kraft paper and a small amount of lumber. There are also locks required and some windows and window panes which amounts to approximately $7.00. A hinged flag pole, $6.00, and other incidentals such as paint, varnish, screws for desks, amounting to approximately $35.00.\n\nI have tried to keep the cost as low as possible in this old school and teacherage as it is not worth spending much money on, yet it is necessary to make the place habitable until a proper school and teacherage is built. I am forwarding to Ottawa school requirements necessary for the operation of this school.\n\nWould ask your assistance in getting permission to spend the above amounts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.A.

Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency, dated August 29th, 1949; copy of my letter dated September 1st, 1949; copy of Mr. Davis' letter dated October 26th, 1949; and requisitions totalling $152.83, for material to improve living conditions at the Ministikwan Indian Day School.\n\nReference is made to my letter to the Department dated August 29th, 1949, File 2-32-171, regarding the appointment of a teacher at that school, in which it was stated that if Mrs. Carl Rhinhart was appointed teacher, Mr. Carl Rhinhart informed Mr. Davis that he would be willing to perform the labour of improving the home, without cost to the Department other than the cost of actual material.\n\nI would recommend approval of the expenditure indicated in the two enclosed requisitions, and that Mr. Davis be given authority to make the purchases from Mr. A. Nolan, of Hudson Lake, Saskatchewan, also that Mr. Davis be authorized to submit a voucher in favour of Mr. Rhinhart for an amount not exceeding $50.00 for the labour, as I do not think we should expect Mr. Rhinhart to do the work without payment.\n\nJ.P.B.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 789\n\nDate: November 10, 1949.\n\nAgent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 24th, file 615-5 (El) and the attached Vouchers 759 and 760.\n\nWe were trying for some considerable time to get a teacher for this school and it looked for a while as if we would be unable to get anyone to teach this school. I did not care to make any expenditures on this school until we were sure of procuring a teacher. Eventually we were able to get the services of the present teacher and it was urgent that we get the school opened as quickly as possible before the winter set in. This teacher was prepared to move into the buildings and start school as soon as we had the supplies.\n\nThere was also a strong demand from the Indians to get this school started. To show you the response to this demand the attendance is larger than this school can accommodate. While the cost of these supplies was higher than I have authority to spend, yet the need was urgent, and I took it upon myself to get this school going as soon as possible.\n\nWhen checking Voucher 759 over we find that it should total $107.81, instead of 109.97 as we had omitted to take off the Education Tax which we do not have to pay.\n\nRe: the three brooms in paragraph 2 of your letter, This is a very old building and the very heavy stable broom is used for scrubbing the floor. The push broom, which is quite expensive, is used for daily sweeping on the part of the floor which is painted, and the third house broom is used for daily sweeping on the parts of the floor which are too rough for the hair push broom which would soon wear out if used on same. Only by using these three brooms can this building be kept clean.\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter, our Voucher No.760 in the amount of $7.50 for delivery of supplies to the school.\n\nIt is approximately 35 miles from Pierceland to the school over almost impassible roads; a round trip of 70 miles. Had we used a freighting firm to deliver these supplies the cost would certainly have been a great deal more.\n\nBy taking the short cut and more or less disregarding the rules and regulations we were able to have the school in operation by November 1st, 1949. The prices are on a parity with other supplies that we purchased for other schools where we had authority to make local purchase.\n\nHope this expenditure has been explained satisfactorily and would ask your special consideration re: the payment of this account.\n\n(J.A.

Keith,\nInd. Agent.\nOttawa, February 11, 1909.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nIn a memorandum prepared by me on November 16, 1907, on the question of Indian education I referred to the report of Mr. Inspector Chisholm, who drew attention to the school on the Mistawasis reserve in charge of the Rev. Mr. Bryden, and to the note of the Commissioner, who said that, if we had day schools like this, boarding schools might be dispensed with.\n\nA subsequent report received from Mr. Chisholm shows that Mr. Bryden is still pursuing his successful course as teacher and missionary on the reserve, and it appears to me that the Department should recognize his exceptional ability as shown in the conduct of the day school under his charge.\n\nThe present salary attached to this school is $300, the amount set apart for all the schools in the Northwest, and I think it is time that some distinction should be made between the successful and the unsuccessful teacher. Mr. Bryden's school is almost the only one that has called for special commendation from our Inspectors, and he receives no more for his good work than numbers of teachers who are admittedly failures and totally unfitted for\nfor the work in which they are engaged. If an exception could be made in his favour, it would be the means of stimulating the efforts of some of the other day school teachers to emulate his good work.\n\nI would recommend that he be given an increase of $100 from the beginning of the next fiscal year.\nOttawa, February 11, 1969.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is much pleased with the reports it has received on the Mistawasis day school, which is under your charge, and it would be glad if you would furnish it with an account of the means you have adopted to bring about such satisfactory results.\n\nThe Department would like, if possible, to follow out your methods in some of the other day schools that are favourably situated for affording a practical education to Indian children.\n\nIn recognition of your services your salary will be increased to $400.00 from April 1, next.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nFRANK PEDL...\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C. W. Bryden,\nTeacher,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nMistawasis, March 8th 1891.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your favor of the 11th ult., file No. 117004/1, I have to say, that although your letter was a pleasant surprise to me, yet, that owing to the holding of a series of evangelistic services on this Reserve and vicinity, I could not at once send you an answer. These services, which were of great interest to the Indians, and highly appreciated by them, and were not we believe without profitable results to them, were brought to a close yesterday, the 7th inst.\n\nAs to the Mistawasis School, and the satisfactory results mentioned by Inspector Chisholm, I do not know that I can lay claim to any special credit for what has been accomplished. I have done my part as faithfully and conscientiously as possible, but it is comparatively easy to build upon a good foundation, and either as the policy of our Church, or as due to fortunate circumstances, this school has had the great advantage of a succession of good teachers. Miss McTagg, Miss McIntosh, Miss Gillespie and Miss Moore, were all highly competent teachers, and most devoted to their work. As for myself, I have had normal training and many years experience in teaching.\n\nWith regard to my methods of work I may state briefly some of our daily exercises and how conducted:\n\nOpening. Usually sing a hymn and then read a few verses of the Scriptures or repeat a verse in concert. Every more difficult word is briefly explained.\n\nClass Work. The programme of studies for Indian schools is followed as closely as possible.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReading. Use the powers or sounds of the letters not the names in teaching beginners. Explain the meaning of every doubtful word, or have the pupils to explain them.\n\nComposition or expression. Question pupils about the passage read. Try to get oral answers. Write questions on the lessons, or on subjects of general knowledge, on the blackboard and have the pupils write answers on their slates. Try to get the more advanced ones to write out short, simple stories, told them or read to them.\n\nWriting. Practice first on slates then on copy-books.\n\nArithmetic. Counting, ball-frame, mental Arithmetic and slate-work.\n\nGovernment. Use gentleness and kindness as far as possible, harsher methods only when really necessary. Never inflict corporal punishment for ignorance or dulness; reserve it exclusively for viciousness, or what is morally degrading.\n\nTreat all alike, show no partiality.\n\nTry to train them in habits of industry. Have charge of work, but, if possible, allow no idleness.\n\nPraise them for good work and seek to develop their confidence in themselves and self-respect.\n\nOrder. Aim at cultivating orderly ways and prompt obedience. Have books and slates etc., taken out and put away quietly and quickly by a ring or two of the hand-bell. So also use the bell for rising out of seats, turning about and moving out of school at\nrecess or close of session. Have a little simple drill in this work occasionally. Also, occasionally, have in fine weather, a little outdoor drill in lining up in order, facing right or left and moving into school in an orderly manner.\n\nWinter Work. The best results in school work are obtained during the winter when the children are kept in the Boarding Home or Children's Home. This building which is an annex of the Manse, and nearly as large, is connected with the main building by a kitchen. Here the Indian children, especially those whose homes are at a distance, are kept during the week from Monday morning till Friday afternoon. For the maintenance of the children and the services of a woman the Women's Foreign Missionary Society of our Church allows a grant of $175. The whole of this amount is seldom used, the actual expense being scarcely $150. Besides this the same society furnishes clothing for the children, and also sends quilts, etc., for the purchase of wood for fuel for the home.\n\nIn warm weather the Indian children return to their homes, and at school at that time receive only a mid-day meal of biscuits (provided by the Department) and milk or tea. Occasionally, for a change, give them loaf bread. And on account of the nomadic ways of their parents, as the attendance falls off from the winter's average, in order to encourage attendance give now and again a treat of nuts and candy. In winter we have a regular and large attendance of the Indian pupils, and with the wholesome and ample supply of food furnished them, and careful supervision as regards cleanliness and general health and recreation, the result is seen in the general good health of the pupils.\nAnd the moral influence and home-like care they receive all tend to their improvement in manners and morals and in their acquaintance with the English language.\n\nThere are other things which might be mentioned which have no doubt had a good effect upon these children. I refer to certain improvements which were suggested and which by the prompt attention of the Agent, Mr. Borthwick and the clerk, Mr. Jackson, were soon brought about.\n\nThe School House. The outside walls were willowed and rough-cast. That is plaster with sand in it was spread over a lathing of willows. This has greatly improved the appearance of the building. The building is always kept clean by sweeping and scrubbing.\n\nThe Interior. The inside walls were whitewashed, and maps, pictures, etc., were placed around the tinted room.\n\nThe Grounds are always kept tidy.\n\nOutbuildings. Instead of one water closet with two apartments, have had two built at the rear of the school, the doors facing in opposite directions, that of the boys' closet to the south, that of the girls' to the north. These buildings are a good distance apart.\n\nFrom what is here stated I trust that the Department may have the information they desire. It is very gratifying to me to know that my work in this school and in behalf of the Indian children has met with the approval of the Inspector and of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. L. Bryden\nOttawa, March 23, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the salary of the teacher of the Mistawasis Indian day school, Rev. C.W. Bryden, has been increased to $400 per annum, to take effect from the 1st prox.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, July 31, 1908.\n\nRev. Sax:\n\nThe return from the Mistawasis Indian day school for the June quarter, last, shows that the school was closed eleven days during the quarter on account of bad roads, five of these being in the month of June.\n\nThe Department considers that this is too great a loss of time from the cause mentioned and that something should be done, either in the direction of improving the roads or making arrangements for the transport of the children at certain seasons when they are at their worst.\n\nKindly advise the Department what distance these children have to travel and as to the general condition of the roads leading to the school, with any suggestions that you may wish to make.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. C.W. Brydon,\nTeacher,\nMistawasis, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nYour letter of the 31st ult., file No. 117094/1 was received by last mail.\n\nIn reply, as regards the bad roads, I may say, that in the spring, when the snow is going away, there is always a time here when the trail is sloppy and more or less muddy; and this year, on account of the very late spring, the period of bad roads was longer than usual. Then, in June, from the 16th to the 25th, or for nearly a fortnight, we had very rainy weather. The roads were then somewhat muddy, but most feature over the long grass bordering and along the trail. The children could not then pass back and forth along the way without getting their feet and ankles wet, and the girls, when they did come to school, had their bedraggled skirts clinging to their legs.\n\nIt would not be necessary, I think, to do anything toward improving the roads, which are fairly good; and to cut down the long grass and small bushes along the way, probably, would not greatly improve the roads for those who have to walk over them in wet weather.\n\nIn my opinion, some arrangement for the transport of the children is what is most needed. I have repeatedly at such times gone for some of the younger pupils, but as I have only a buggy and one horse I could do no more than take to the school a few who were not too far away.\nThe following is a statement of the distances of the pupils from the school in summer, when some of them are with their parents, who are farming now on new lands, but who will be nearer the school in winter:\n\n3 children 4 miles distant, one living in an opposite direction to the other two.\n\n2 children 3 miles distant.\n\n2 \" 2\u00bd \"\n\n4 \" 2\n\nThe homes of the others are within one mile of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. W. Bryden.\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe returns from the Mistawasis day school show that the school was closed for several days during the June quarter, last, and the Teacher states that this was owing to the bad condition of the trails in the spring when the snow was going.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether some arrangement might be made to drive the children to school during the times that the roads are in such a condition that the children cannot reasonably be expected to walk and what would be the probable cost of doing so.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of October 5th 1909\n\nNo. 117094/1, I have the honor to state that during the summer months of the year when the children are not being boarded from Monday morning to Friday evening, the employment of one of the Indians to drive the most distant Indians to and from the Mistawasis day school would greatly assist in increasing the average attendance.\n\nUnder such an arrangement & attendance should also be made compulsory, as the Indian feels little real interest in the education of his children, and trails them off to assist in gathering berries and digging senega root during the seasons favorable to those occupations; these frequent withdrawals seriously interfering with the progress of the pupils.\n\nI attach a memo which has been prepared by the teacher which shows the distances travelled by the children attending the school. If approved by the Department I would ask authority to either engage one Indian to carry those from the South, and then those from the North to and from the school, morning and evening of each day school day during the summer @ $2 per day, or one man at each end to supply the transport at $1.00 per day. The Church will no doubt continue the winter boarding arrangements.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nDistances of Children from the Mistawasis Indian School.\n\nNorth of School:\n\n- Gilbert Wolf: 4 miles\n- John Bird: 2 1/2 \"\n- Ellen Bird: 2 1/2 \"\n- George Bird: 2 \"\n- Maggie Turner: 2 \"\n- Charlotte Turner: 2 \"\n- Alex Black: 2 \"\n- Neta Badger: 1 mile\n- Benjamin Brewer: 1/2 \"\n- Florence Brewer: 1/2 \"\n\nSouth of School:\n\n- Hannah Badger: 1 mile\n- Maria Bird: 3 miles\n- George S.

You should obtain the services of reliable Indians for this work and the Department will pay them at the rate mentioned, $1.00 per day.\n\nAttendance under these conditions must be compulsory and you will so advise the Indians.\n\nThis is an experiment in which the Department is much interested and I have to ask you to be good enough to report as to its working from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos.

If it is absolutely necessary to raise the rate you will be good enough to advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThomas Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. Referring to the transport of school pupils to and from the Mistawasis Day school, I have the honor to report that I have only been able to secure the carrying of the pupils from the North side of the school, and that only under a temporary arrangement with Chief Jacob Johnstone until the Xmas holidays.\n\nThe Indians considered the allowance too small and demanded rations in addition. This I refused as the destitutes who are worthy to become a charge upon the Department are becoming more numerous, and our supplies are insufficient for the demands upon them.\n\nThe teacher, in obedience to the wishes of the Department, abandoned the boarding arrangements, and the lack of transport to the South may leave the attendance lower than the usual winter number. With rats easy to catch and fetching 40\u00a2 apiece in cash our Indians will not work for low pay. They claim that $1.00 per day only pays for the use of the horses, and ask $2.00 per day.\n\nI would ask authority to increase the allowance to $1.50 per day; for which I will try to secure the required service.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., reporting that you have been unable to make arrangements for the transport of the children to the Mistawasis school at the rate of $1.00 per day for each of the two drivers.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to increase this rate to $1.50 a day for each, and trust that you will be able to procure the service for this sum.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Berthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, January 19th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 23rd ultimo and previous correspondence in regard to the transport of children to the Mistawasis School the Department would like to know as soon as possible whether you have succeeded in making satisfactory arrangements. In your last letter of the 17th ultimo you reported that you had made a temporary agreement with Chief Jacob Johnstone to carry the children from the north side of the school until the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe Department is watching this experiment with a great deal of interest and would like to have a full report from you as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 23rd ult.\n\nNo. 117094/1, regarding the transport of school pupils to and from the Mistawasis Day school, I have the honor to report that I have not yet succeeded in securing permanent arrangements even under the latest and quite generous offer of the Department.\n\nThere are parties with whom I could make arrangements; but they have no horses to use. I have therefore to suggest, as a means of overcoming the difficulty, the purchase by the Department of suitable driving teams which could then be supplied to the Indians doing the work on sale under terms requiring the monthly repayment of a portion of the cost until the whole was paid.\n\nThe work is being performed temporarily by Jacob Johnstone for the North, and by George Dreaver for the children from the South of the school; but the arrangement is understood to be terminable on short notice by the Indians, and I wish to be prepared to meet the exigency should either or both of these parties cease the work. The cost of a suitable team and harness would probably be not less than $328.00 and the sum of $12.50 or $15.00 could be retained from each month's earnings by the Department until the full amount was repaid.\n\nAn arrangement of this nature would be effective in securing the permanence of the transport. The ownership of the team would remain vested in the Department until paid for, and the Indian would understand that his ultimate possession of them would depend upon his faithful continuance in the work and that all payments made upon them would be forfeited by his failure to keep his contract.\n\nThe authority is only requested to meet a possible emergency. It may not be required until after the first of April, and I have therefore to ask that if the idea commends itself to the judgement of the Department, the authority be made to extend to the fiscal year 1910-1911, in case the necessity for the purchase does not arise before.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 19th January, 1910\n\nNo.117094/1., I have the honor to report that George Dreaver has temporarily undertaken the contract of hauling the children from the South of the school, and the results are now most satisfactory. Many now attend who would not be found there if the former arrangement of boarding from Monday morning to Friday evening were in vogue. The attendance has been increased to sixteen, which with the employees' children exhausts the seating capacity. I have therefore to request authority to purchase additional desks if such are found necessary.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 4th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 26th and 25th ultimo in reference to the transport of children to and from the Mistawasis school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not disposed at present to authorize the purchase of teams to be given to Indians who would be willing to undertake this work, but your suggestion will be kept in mind. In the event of a number of children from this reserve being sent home from the Regina Industrial School it may be necessary to make some arrangement such as is proposed by you.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn from your last letter that the attendance is very good, and, if you find it necessary, you may purchase two or three additional desks for the school-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Bozthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a supplementary report from Mr. Inspector Chisholm on the Mistawasis day school, which reveals a very satisfactory condition of affairs, and it is to be hoped that through the efforts of yourself and the teacher further improvements will result.\n\nMr. Chisholm recommends that Mrs. Bryden be supplied with 36 yards of ginghams, one dozen spools of cotton thread, and twelve dozen buttons, and these you will be good enough to purchase for her, as well as two scrub brushes.\n\nThe Department approves of the arrangement made by Mr. Chisholm and yourself to supply flour from the toll taken at the Agency mill to furnish bread for the children's lunch.\n\nI have also to ask you to be good enough to have a table eight feet long made for the use of the dining-room. This work can be done at the Agency work-shop.\n\nCertain primary class-room supplies are also being ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be sent to your address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nExtract from return for the Mistawasis day school for the quarter ending March 31, 1910.\n\nAll the holidays taken were at the beginning of the quarter. Owing to the difficulty and delay about securing drivers and teams for the conveyance of the children, school did not open for the New Year until January 19th. From that time onward there has been no interruption in the work and the steady attendance of the pupils has resulted, in general, in satisfactory progress.\n\nNOTE:- The average has increased from 6 in the December quarter to 16.6 in the March quarter, 1910. There was an enrolment of 20 in the former and 24 in the latter quarter.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you have already been advised the children from the Carlton Agency who have been in attendance at the Regina Industrial School are being sent to their respective homes and it is the wish of the Department that they be not recruited by other denominations for residential schools, but that they should attend the day schools on the reserves.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the wishes of the Department in reference to this matter are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nReferring to your letter of February 4th,\n\nNo. 117094/1, I have the honor to state that Jacob Johnstone who has been faithfully transporting school children to the Mistawasis day school, informs me with regret that he will have to give up the job in 10 days or a fortnight, because of the failing of one of his mares and the poor condition of the other.\n\nGeorge Dreaver has also notified me that his team will have to be withdrawn for the same reason, and his farming operations will require the use of them when they are able to work.\n\nAs the children are now returning from the Regina School, I have to request authority to provide these Indians with teams for the transport of school children to the Mistawasis School on terms of repayment 50% of each month's earnings to be returned to The Department on account of the cost. A suitable agreement binding the Indians to continue the transport until the teams are paid for being required for each.\n\nThe cost will probably be from $350.00 to $400.00 per team, as horses are high; but I will secure the best obtainable value.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 9, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in further reference to the purchase by the Department of two teams of driving horses to be given to Indians on the Mistawasis reserve for the purpose of transporting children to and from the school, on condition that re-payment of the purchase price be made.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report and the desire of the Department that there should be no interruption in these services, you are hereby authorized to purchase two teams to be given to Indians who will use them solely for the purpose of transport, on condition that re-payment is made at the rate of 50% of each month's earnings. The Department trusts that both Johnstone and Dreaver will prove thoroughly reliable and the agreement to the effect that these animals are to remain the property of the Department and are to be taken proper care of should be distinct and clear. In the event of the failure to make payments or to keep the teams in good condition provision should be made for their reversion to the Department. In the case of necessity arising for the Department taking possession all payments made would be forfeited.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to purchase these teams for not more than $350.00 a team, but\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nin any event the sum of $400.00 must not be exceeded.\n\nPayment for these horses is being made from a fund which must be recouped and the amounts withheld from the monthly payments to the drivers should be shown in your cash statement and transmitted to the Department, when credit will be given for the respective amounts.\n\nA copy of the agreement should also be forwarded to the Department to be placed on record.\n\nPlease wire to the Department the names of the persons from whom you propose to buy, with prices, before finally making purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company's Telegraph\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nAll messages are received by this Company for transmission, subject to the terms and conditions printed on their Blank Form No., which terms and conditions have been agreed to by the sender of the following message.

As the authorities of that school will desire to secure some of the pupils returned from Regina in opposition to the Department's wish as expressed in above quoted letter; and as it is very desirable to secure the largest possible attendance at the Mistawasis Day School to ensure its success, I beg to respectfully submit this matter to the Department's consideration.\n\nI should add that although the Mistawasis Day School is conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, there is no interference with the religion of children of an Alien faith. Pupils have been known to employ the moments of their recess in the study of the Roman Catholic Catechism without hindrance or any adverse notice of the fact.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in reference to the recruiting of children from the Mistawasis Reserve for the Duck Lake and other residential schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers your request reasonable and steps will be taken to have it carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, July 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has noted that pupils from the Carlton Agency are recruited for the Duck Lake Boarding School and the applications for admission forwarded through your Agency. In many instances it is necessary to have information which can only be supplied by the Agent in charge of the reserves from which pupils are drafted, as they only can be in possession of some of the details called for. I have to ask you, therefore, to request the Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School to, in future, forward the applications for admission from the various Agencies through the respective Agents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMistawasis, July 14th 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome of the statements in the Returns from this School, for last quarter, will doubtless be a disappointment to the Department of Indian Affairs, in view of the number of children who returned to this Reserve, when the Regina School was closed. A word of explanation, therefore, is necessary, in order that it may be understood why the average attendance was not so large as at first expected.\n\n1. School Accommodation was not sufficient. The attendance at the School was so increased for a few days after the return of the pupils, that not only was every seat filled, but new seats had to be provided. As it was then believed that it would be impossible to take in all who had returned, who were expected to return, it was decided to limit the attendance to just those of school age, that is, to children from six to sixteen, and to allow no whites or non-Indian pupils to attend. On account of this decision, the larger boys of seventeen years and\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nwere told that they would have to wait until some provision could be made for them. All these lads would have attended if room could have been found for them. When they found that they could not then be admitted, they did not long remain idle; they all, with the exception of one who was on the sick list, soon got employment, as there was work for them on the Reserve.\n\nThen, with only those of school age in attendance, there were causes, afterwards, tending to reduce the average, which may be here mentioned:\n\n1. An epidemic of la grippe, which lasted nearly a fortnight, and which seemed to affect nearly every Indian family on the Reserve, caused a serious reduction in the attendance at that time.\n\n2. On three days, the children living south of the School, and who form the larger number in attendance, were not taken to School on account of the absence of their usual driver, who had gone to Duck Lake to meet his own and other children, who were returning from Regina.\n\n3. A couple of children, from Roman Catholic homes, who had been in attendance for some time, left this School with the intention of entering the Indian Industrial School at Duck Lake.\n\n4. Two boys, one a particularly bright lad, had to leave School for a time on account of scrofulous sores. This was in accordance with the Doctor's orders.\n\n5. There has been, as is always the case here in summer, more or less irregularity on the part of a few, who\nI have been away with their parents Senega digging or visiting.\n\nIt may be asked, what is the prospect for attendance when the school reopens after the summer holidays?\n\nAs soon as accommodation can be provided for them there should be the following numbers in attendance, grouping them by standards:\n\n| Standard | Number |\n|----------|--------|\n| I        | 20     |\n| II       | 8      |\n| III      | 8      |\n| IV       | 2      |\n| V        | 1      |\n| VI       | 1      |\n| Total    | 40     |\n\nIn order to keep up the attendance when school reopens I would suggest that:\n\n1. There should be, for the future, more stringent regulations for the compulsory attendance of some of the children, particularly in the case of those who are taken away on visits by their parents and others, and also in the case of those who go Senega digging, though they are more excusable, as the children can then be of material help to their parents in this industry, by which they are able to earn considerable, since the dried root is worth 40\u00a2 per lb.\n\n2. An assistant teacher to take charge of the youngest children (students) is very advisable, in order to secure the best results with the least delay, and as soon as a suitable building on place for the work can be provided.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nC.V. Bryden.\nOttawa, July 22, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the attendance and other matters in connection with the Mistawasis day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks and suggestions have been carefully noted and in the meantime you might bring these matters to the attention of the Superintendent of Indian Education, who will probably visit Mistawasis at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. O. W. Bryden,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. Referring to the Mistawasis Day School, I have the honor to state in connection with the dinner which has been furnished to the pupils, that the meal has been hitherto prepared and served by Mrs. Bryden and her daughters without any charge for their labor against either the Church or the Department.\n\nMr. Bryden is now sending his daughters to Prince Albert to complete their education, and Mrs. Bryden will be unable to continue that work, as all her time and energies will be required for her own household duties. I have therefore requested authority for the payment of such assistance as the teacher may be able to secure to prepare and serve the noon-day meal to the pupils of the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nIn the past, the lack of boots and other clothing has furnished an excuse to the parents of these children to keep them at home. This has been met by the Church authorities who made provision through their teacher to supply such necessities of clothing. The Church has recently omitted to pay for those supplies, and it is understood that they are taking the matter up with the Department.\n\nFor the reason stated above, Miss Bryden will not be available as an Assistant teacher should the Department decide to concede this much needed assistance.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 22nd August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and I have to ask you to bring the matters referred to therein to the Superintendent of Indian Education, who expects to visit Mistawasis in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nThe Rev. Dr. Baird, of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church, when at the Department today spoke about the mid-day meal afforded the pupils at an improved day school on the Mistawasis reserve. Quite a number of these pupils formerly attended the Regina industrial school, and the parents have made complaint that the meal afforded at the day school is not sufficiently appetizing to satisfy them, and Dr. Baird thought that it was only reasonable that, in order to maintain the health and physical vigour of the pupils, the Department should agree to give them a more appetizing meal at this school under the circumstances. I told Dr. Baird that the matter would be looked into, and that no doubt the wishes of the Indians would be met in this case.\n\nAast. Deputy Supt.

In a previous letter you reported upon the need of help to prepare the mid-day meal.\n\nThe Department is not fully convinced as to the necessity of a permanent second teacher on this reserve, although present circumstances might justify the temporary engagement of an assistant, but it is thought that this assistant should supervise the preparation of the mid-day lunch, the work to be done by the older girls.\n\nThe salary Mrs. Gray asks is more than the Department is prepared to pay for an assistant until such time as the question has been more fully considered. Could you not secure the services of someone who, although not the holder of a teacher's license, would be competent to teach the younger children for a few months and at the same time direct the older girls in the preparation of the meal? To such a person the Department would pay $25.00 a month.\n\nIf, however, you think it unnecessary at present to have a second teacher employed you may engage someone to\n\nThos.

On the roll for the quarter ending in June there were 35 names, and there seemed to be the probability that by the coming of some of the larger pupils, who had returned from Regina, there would be at least 40 names on the roll. But as the elder boys got work on the Reserve soon after they returned, and as they seemed to prefer their freedom and an open air life to the confinement of the class room, I made no effort to secure their attendance at school. Afterwards four pupils from Roman Catholic homes left this school, in order to attend the Duck Lake Industrial School.\n\nLast quarter there were 28 names on the roll, so the average attendance was 16.39. For the quarter preceding there were 35 names on the roll and an average of 16.87. But though there were seven fewer in attendance during the September quarter, the pupils came more regularly and the percentage of attendance was higher as the following shows:\n\nFor June Quarter, 35 pupils average 16.87, percentage 48.22.\nSept. 28, 16.39, 58.53.\n\nAt present there are 25 names on the roll, though there are only 23 of school age on the\nReserve so far as I can find out. We have now a few under school age on the roll. There are quite a number under school age on the Reserve, and the probability is, that in a year or so there will be over 40 of school age.\n\nIt now seems as if the average for the present quarter will not be much over 16, or not more than enough for one teacher to attend to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Bryden during the period which he has been in charge of the Mistawasis Day School, is of the opinion that the appointment of a younger teacher with proper qualifications is desirable. Sometime ago when the question of the appointment of an assistant to Mr. Bryden was under consideration an application was received from Mrs. Ina Gray, the holder of a second-class professional certificate, who is at the present time in charge of a public school in the neighborhood of the reserve. Mrs. Gray is very highly spoken of and it is understood that she would be willing to accept the position of teacher of the Mistawasis school. It is stated that she is a member of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nNo doubt Mrs. Gray's appointment would be satisfactory to your society and, if so, the Department would like to communicate with her at once and offer her the position.

Otherwise, Mr. Brown has the confidence of his pupils who are prompt to do his bidding. He has been in poor health for some time and has been advised by his physician to give up the school if he would avoid serious complications. The condition of health naturally militates against the vigilance and vigor necessary to the oversight of a class-room.\n\nBrown is placed by his position upon the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of English. In the selection of proper attention that should be given to other subjects or the outline of studies. In this connection, the removal of the white children from the school has been beneficial. Formerly, these pupils filled the space in the school and made English the language of the school and play ground. Now this is the usual language heard. Very little English is used in the house. Only when the graduates go into homes of their own will this difficulty be obviated. The progress made by the primary classes is very slow but so the pupils rise and stand they do very excellent work. The senior classes were good. Naturally, he is more successful in the upper classes. He is only an exceptional man who is a success with beginners. On the whole, I would say, the pupil are making fair and steady progress.

I understand that Mrs. Bryden is willing to provide and care for a cow and do the milking, if the Department will provide the hay and bran for its feed, or the Department might prefer to provide the cow, and retain the calf to balance the cost of its feed.

Flour, beef, rice, biscuits and sugar may be supplied, but the Department does not consider that butter and fruit should be served.\n\nBefore deciding as to the purchase of a cow I may say that it is not considered that a supply of milk is absolutely necessary if only a mid-day meal is to be served. If, however, there are a number of pupils resident in the dormitories a whole or part of the time the Department might favourably consider the request and would like to have full information as to the number of children kept permanently or part of the time at the school. You should give your opinion as to the better arrangement, the Department or the teacher to own the cow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

As you are aware the Department decided not to extend this system until fully satisfied as to the results on the Mistawasis Reserve and in connection with your recommendation in regard to Sturgeon Lake it is necessary to have this report before anything can be done.\n\nIt is also reported by Mr. Chisholm that no use is being made of the pupils' dormitories and waiting rooms.

Whether or not they have succeeded in securing one, I am not sure, but I am writing to the West making enquiry. You are aware that the difficulty of securing competent teachers increases.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.117094/1, dated March 9/12., I have the honor to state that I have gone into the matter of the attendance at the Mistawasis Bay School, and find that prior to the introduction of the transportation of pupils, the matter stood as follows:\n\n| Year   | Quarter       | Average Attendance |\n|--------|---------------|--------------------|\n| 1909   | March quarter | 8.76               |\n|        | June quarter  | 5.10               |\n|        | September     | 5.03               |\n|        | December      | 6.03               |\n\nTransportation commenced during the latter part of the December quarter. The average number enrolled during the above period was 16.25, and the average attendance of 6.23 represents a percentage on that average enrollment of 38.\n\nThe attendance during transportation became for the last four quarters:\n\n| Year   | Quarter       | Average Attendance |\n|--------|---------------|--------------------|\n| 1911   | June quarter  | 14.09              |\n|        | September     | 15.                |\n|        | December      | 14.27              |\n| 1912   | March         | 13.07              |\n\nThe average number enrolled during this period was 23.75, and the average attendance of 14.10 represents a percentage of that enrollment of 59.36.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOf those on the rolls during the past year, several circumstances have conspired to prevent their regular attendance; as for instance, the severe illness of the following, or the menace of their disease to others:\n\nWm. LaBlanc was at home through scrofulous sore eyes for - 11 weeks\nMarie Bird through scrofulous glands - 10 weeks\nGilbert Wolf - through tubercular affection - 9 weeks\nMary Duncan - through scrofulous glands - 5 weeks\nHannah Badger - do 4 weeks\n\nThe larger girls are becoming useful to their mothers, and when the latter are indisposed or on special occasions, these girls are kept from school to assist in housekeeping. The larger boys also are frequently kept from school to assist their fathers in their work; for instance, Richard Cardinal was detained by his father to assist in chores and the cutting of wood for 32 school days. Edward Campbell was detained by his father for 7 weeks, because the parent required the boy to do chores. In the latter case the teacher sent a note to the father complaining of the boy's non-attendance. In reply Jas. Campbell enquired whether the boy belonged to the teacher or to himself, and asserted that he would keep the boy at home when he chose, and only allow him to attend school when it suited himself. In such a case there would seem to be room for a compulsory attendance law.\n\nDuring three days of severe\nDuring three days of severe cold weather and one day through the death of the Chief's wife, only George Drewer's team conveyed children to the school, and the average for those 4 days was only 3.75.\n\nAll the above circumstances took place during the past quarter ended March 31st, 1912. In previous quarters similar reasons prevented fullest attendance, and all as shown were beyond the control of the teacher. But for these, the attendance during the period of transportation would have been much larger, and the benefits of that system were much more apparent.\n\nThe results as disclosed by this investigation have convinced myself, and will I trust satisfy the Department of the great improvement in the attendance of the pupils which has followed the introduction of transport facilities for school children on the Mistawasis reserve, and which in my judgment will fully justify the extension of the same system to the Sturgeon Lake and Sandy Lake reserves.\n\nRegarding the use of the dormitories, I have to state that the teacher and his wife are most willing to keep the children of any Indians who desire to leave their homes for hunting, root-digging or berrying. The trouble is that most of the Indians who follow those pursuits desire the assistance of their children, say nothing of their intention; but simply move away with their families, and the first intimation to the teacher is the absence of the children from the school. On one occasion last summer, the teacher spoke to his wife of the great improvement which he noticed in Neta Badger through an unusually steady attendance. The next day the child was taken away by her father Philip Badger, and was absent until his trip was over. As a natural consequence, the child lost ground through that absence.\n\nNo marked success is possible with any children, Indian or white, whose...\nIndian or white, whose attendance is fitful, and unless attendance is made compulsory, no teacher can rightly be held responsible for poor results in such cases.\n\nShould the dormitories be required, some fittings will be found necessary, and I enclose herewith a requisition from the matron for articles which will be required if sleeping accommodation and farther meals are to be provided for Indian children left by their parents.\n\nRegarding this list, I would prefer single iron bedsteads instead of the folding beds asked for. The actual air space of the dormitories is only sufficient according to the usual scale for about 3 boys and 3 girls; but during the summer when the windows may be kept open about five could be accommodated of each sex.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the conveyance of children to the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department is aware that there has been an increase in the attendance at this school, it does not consider that this increase is as substantial as it should be when it is taken into consideration that two conveyances are employed. From the date of the receipt of this letter you will be good enough to request the teacher to prepare a statement daily showing the number of children conveyed to the school by each of the Indians, this statement to be submitted to the Department at the end of May and also at the end of the month of June.\n\nThe question of furnishing the dormitories will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

Bryden we do think that it would\nbe to our advantage if it could be\narranged whereby that gentlemen could\ncarry on the missionary work without\nHaving to have his time taken up by another important matter, namely that of teaching in our school.\n\nMr. Bryden has inferred to one of our members Geo. Beaver that if a younger teacher of experience was placed in his position, the arrangement would be quite satisfactory to him, providing the Church could be induced to increase his stipend sufficient enough to sustain himself and family.\n\nWe therefore feel and humbly pray that such a course can be taken and that the Department will take such steps as it deems to be to our interest in the matter.\n\nWe have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nJacob Johnstone Chief X mark\nJohn Duncan. mark\nJohn Pechawist\nThomas Micheloo X mark\nWilliam Beaver.\nJacob Badger\nGeo.

They claim that owing to the advanced age of Rev. Mr. Bryden, who has been acting for some years as Missionary and teacher on this reserve, it would be in their interests that a change should be made.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to give this matter your consideration and advise the Department of the decision arrived at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. S. Grant,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 20, 1914.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a letter dated the 20th ultimo signed by yourself and the principal men of the Mistawasis Band asking that owing to the advanced age of Rev. Mr. Bryden, who has been acting for some years as teacher and missionary on the reserve, a change should be made.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter is being dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Jacob Johnstone,\nMistawasis, Sask.\n518 Albert Ave., Saskatoon,\nApril 2nd, 1914.\n\nRev. Br. Grant,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Grant:\n\nI understand that a petition has been forwarded to you from Mistawasis Indian Reserve, asking that Rev. C. W. Bryden be removed and a younger missionary appointed. Now, it is true that at Mr. Bryden's age, he should not be expected to do both the work of teacher and missionary, but I believe that it would be hard to find a more devoted or conscientious man, and that it would be very unwise to remove him from the Reserve. I would suggest that a teacher be appointed to relieve him of the burden of the school, and that he be set free to devote all his time to missionary work among the Indians. I would also suggest that his daughter, Miss Martha Bryden, who is a fully qualified teacher, holding a Second Class professional certificate, be appointed to the school. From what I have heard the trouble has arisen not from the incompetence of the missionary, but from undue interference on the part of the Indian Agent at Mistawasis. It might be well for the Government to make some investigation in that direction, and to at least satisfy all parties interested that the rumors regarding the unwholesome moral influence of the Agent are unfounded.\n\nHoping that these suggestions may be acted upon,\n\nI am,\nYours most faithfully,\n\nColin G. Young.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nOffice of Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reference to the petition, which was forwarded to me here, for the removal of Rev. C. W. Bryden, I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have just received from our District Superintendent. I am disposed to think that this might be a solution of the situation, and would like to know whether your Department approves of appointing a qualified teacher, and our appointing Mr. Bryden for mission work exclusively.\n\nHoping for an early reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nApril 9th, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nI have your favour of the 7th instant with copy of letter addressed to you by Rev. Mr. Young, of Saskatoon, in reference to school work at Mistassini.\n\nI think it would be in the best interests of the work at this school to follow Mr. Young's suggestion and the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Martha Bryden, as teacher, and will allow her the same salary as was paid her father.\n\nIf you decide to carry out this arrangement kindly inform me so that the local Indian Agent may be advised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. A.

Kindly inform the drivers of the vans that they must arrive at the school punctually.\n\nThe teacher at the Mistawasis school should report the number of times that the vans are late, each month, so that the Department may have definite information to act on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When Rev. Mr. Young, the District Superintendent, suggested to Dr. Grant that my eldest daughter might take the School here as my successor in the work, he did not know that my daughter was then teaching in another School.\n\nAs my daughter could not accept the appointment I wrote to the District Superintendent, and also to Dr. Grant that I was willing to continue teaching here until the end of September, which would mean to me, if in the work up to that date, the completion of nine years of teaching in this School.\n\nAs it seems to be the wish of Dr. Grant and the Board of Home Missions that I should give up my position as teacher before that date, I now hereby tender my resignation as Teacher of the Mitisawinaw Bay School to the Department of Indian Affairs, the said resignation to take effect at the end of August, 1914.\n\nIn giving up the school work here I wish to express my thankful appreciation of the prompt attention given by the Department to every requisition forwarded and to every suggestion made in the interest of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Grant, Superintendent of Home Missions, Presbyterian Church in Canada. July 28, 1914.\n\nOriginal on File 178701-1\n\nMr. Bryden has resigned at Mistawasis field, and we are looking for a successor.\n\nSgd. Andrew S. Grant\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few weeks ago a paper expressing dissatisfaction with my work as a teacher, signed by the Chief and Head-Men of this Band, was sent to you.\n\nI may say that with the exception of Jacob Johnstone, the chief, and George Dreamer, the ex-Chief, neither of whom can either read or write, not one of those whose names are given has ever been inside the school while teaching, and that not one of them is capable of forming a fair judgment either as regards the teachers' work or the progress of the pupils.\n\nTrouble began when I found fault with the irregularity of the drivers in the transportation of the children. That, in my opinion, is the real cause of the action taken by the Indians. Though in all probability there was some outside influence brought to bear upon them supporting the course taken.\n\nThere was an improvement in the driving when they were told that a daily record of their arrival, etc., was being kept. This was seen especially in October, when there was fine weather, and the average attendance was the largest in the history of the school. Irregularity again became the rule when very cold weather came on. The climax of unsatisfactory work was reached in January. The school was then supposed to open at 9:30 A.M. and close at 5:30 P.M. The enclosed copy of the driving return for January will show you how the drivers did their work. In February the Chief had the document prepared.\nwhich was sent to the Department. I saw what was said to be a draft of that paper. In it there were no specific charges, it dealt in generalities, such as... The teacher was too advanced in years for the work, the children were not making progress, my teaching was not up to the standard. Remember that only two of them can read either read or write, but only three of them can speak English; I am out of the teaching work, but from what I have stated the Department may judge as to the value of the teacher forwarded by the Chief, who had been very friendly feeling for me, since I could count with the Chief as a \"third force,\" if not a fourth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCharles W.

I have the honor to report, after due investigation that such an appointment would be advisable providing that a greater effort is made by the transporting teams to get the children to school on time.\n\nThe Rev. J.E. Smith, teacher, has drawn my attention to their irregularity on more than one occasion, while I in turn have had to reprimand the transporters, but so far, with practically no results. The question in itself has really nothing to do with providing an assistant, yet it has an important bearing on the subject, inasmuch that if the Department decides to withdraw the transportation facilities on this reserve, on the grounds that the transporters themselves will not take sufficient interest either in their children or their work to fulfill their contract, then in that case the attendance would be so low that an assistant would not be necessary.\n\nTo discharge the present transporters, would practically cutting out this work altogether, for I have already ascertained that\n\nno other\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nno other Indians on this reserve desire to acquire the positions, a fact in itself, which tends to show, that the Department's efforts in this direction is not appreciated as it should be. For your perusal I am attaching Mr. Smith's transporting return for December, in order that you may have something definite from which to draw your conclusions.\n\nIn conclusion I might mention that when discussing this subject with both Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the Matron brought up the question of salary. She would be interested to know why it is she is only allowed $270.00 per annum when other Matrons get $300.00.\n\nBy way of explanation I informed her that no doubt your reason for this, was that as a Medical Attendant is stationed at the Agency Headquarters, is naturally presumed that her work is not nearly so arduous as those Matrons who have to depend more on themselves, especially in case of sickness.\n\nNevertheless, whatever view is taken, she would be grateful if the Department would place her salary on a par with those engaged on the Sandy Lake and Sturgeon Lake reserves.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 4th February, 1915.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo, relative to work done by Mrs. Smith as Field Matron at Mistawasis Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that upon consideration it has been decided to allow her salary at the rate of $300.00 a year. When sending in requisition for the payment of her salary, you may request payment at that rate. You should quote this letter and file number on the voucher as authority.\n\nWhen sending a requisition for supplies for the Mistawasis School on the 10th December, you stated there was too much work for one matron, but in your letter of the 8th ultimo, above referred to, in which you dealt with this matter, you did not make a satisfactory recommendation with regard to the services of an assistant matron. The Department notes your remark with regard to the attendance at the School which affects the work of the Matron. Mrs. Smith should not confine herself to school work, but should visit the Indians in their homes, in order to teach them to keep their homes clean, and the care of young children etc. You should inform her of the Department's wishes in this matter, and if at a later date you are of the opinion that she is carrying on the work successfully, and is in need of an assistant, who would of course be a young girl\n\nS.A.

Deputy and Secretary.\nReferring to that part of your letter No.117094-1, dated February 4th, 1915, relative to supplying the Mistawasis Field Matron with an Assistant, I have the honor to request that this matter be now given your reconsideration. Mrs Smith appears to be carrying on her work very successfully but is handicapped to some extent by having her attention taken up too much with household duties. Considering that she has to cook and prepare so many daily meals for the school pupils, it can hardly be wondered at that she has little or no time for visiting many of the Indian homes on the Mistawasis Reserve. Were she allowed an assistant, I am informed that she will be able to give more attention to this important matter, in view of the fact that the Department does not wish her to confine herself absolutely to school work but desires that she should visit the homes of the Indians also. Although I am unable to name off hand a suitable party for the position as yet, I do not think any trouble will be experienced in getting an assistance should you authorize me to engage one.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, 8th April, 1915.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn view of the report contained in your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department is willing to pay at the rate of $5.00 a month for the services of an Indian girl to assist Mrs. Smith in her household and other duties, in order that she may have more time to devote to her work as Field Matron. I may say that the amount stated is all that will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS.A.

D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. A. Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the quarterly return for the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nYou will notice I have marked the non-treaty Indians that are attending this school, not only are they taking up the teachers time, but getting their mid-day meal there, and some mornings the transporters load is composed of all non-treaty children.\n\nI also notice that the transporters are very lax in being there on time in the mornings, and are even worse in being there when school is dismissed in the evenings.\n\nThe assistant matron is attending school, and lighting fires for which she is getting $7.00 per month. It is costing the Department far too much considering the number of Indian children that are attending this school.\n\nThe Field Matron on this reserve could be dispensed with as the Doctor is a resident here, and attends to the dispensing of all medicines, visiting the sick, work that naturally comes under the duties of the matrons on other reserves.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the school be closed and the twelve Indian children now attending school be sent to a boarding school, which the Indians all favour, the following are some of the savings that could be effected.\n\n| Item                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Teachers salary       | $400.00  |\n| Matron                | $300.00  |\n| Assistant             | $50.00   |\n| Lighting fires, scrubbing etc. | $20.00 |\n| Two Transporters (about) | $500.00 |\n| Mid-day meal          | $300.00  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Milligan\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Can.\nSir:\n\nWe are in receipt of a communication from Mr. S.A. Milligan, Agent, in which he says among other things that he is writing Ottawa asking if it is their intention to dispense with the mid-day meal in connection with the above school.\n\nWe respectfully but earnestly urge the Dept. that this should not be done, because doing away with the mid-day meal would virtually mean the closing of the school, measured as this meal means a very important factor in the life of our Indian children.\n\nThe closing of this Improved Day School is neither necessary nor desirable. The school has suffered during the past year in point of attendance five pupils, three of whom were our most regular attendants; were taken to Onion Lake Boarding School and two have died. Notwithstanding this depletion we have still upon the Roll twenty (20) Indian Children. Within a radius of two miles there are nineteen. In November the school was closed for nearly a month on account of an epidemic of Measles from which every child on the Reserve was afflicted. Some of these have not been able to return to school except for a few days on account of sore eyes, convulsions and Eczema.\nNevertheless our attendance has had an average of about ten, five of whom are in standard I and are making excellent progress. (See Report of School in last Annual Report.) Mr. Graybie, the Inspector, has not yet visited the school.\n\nThe greatest item in maintenance is the cost of transportation of the pupils to and from school. This difficulty might be obviated by bringing two families living two miles south of the school, to some point north, in which case the cost of transportation would be saved by one-half. This I have suggested to the Agent.\n\nThe closing of the school would be an act of injustice to the Presbyterian Church of Canada. For nearly forty years our Church has steadily maintained balances upon this Reserve at a maximum cost. These children belong to our Mission\u2014we feel a responsibility in regard to them. The closing of the school would involve an additional cost to the Church of four hundred dollars. If anything is done by the Dept., which will render it more difficult for the Church to carry on its work unimpaired\u2014a work upon which they have spent many thousands\u2014I have little doubt but that the Church will feel aggrieved.\n\nAs teacher and missionary we are doing the work of two upon the salary of one. Our work in the Missionary as well as...\nin the Educational department has during the past year shown greater advancement financially and in other ways than for many years. The children have been comfortably clothed for school and church and present a gratifying appearance in point of neatness and cleanliness not to be excelled in ordinary white schools. The aged and destitute have also received clothing. The able-bodied, the majority of whom have attended Boarding Schools, are treated as men capable of earning their living, not as paupers. They too have endeavored to cultivate a spirit of industry and manifest self-reliance. In this mode of procedure authorized by the W.M.S. of our Church, the Indians took exception, but adhering strictly to the instructions, they are falling into line.\n\nHoping that the Dept. will favorably consider our request and thus continue the means by which we can secure great efficiency in our work,\n\nShall the honor be, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJan 25, 1917.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.E.

Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nAt a meeting of the Presbytery of Prince Albert, held in St. Paul's Church, Prince Albert, on Tuesday, the Eleventh day of February, 1917, the following resolution was passed in protest against recent actions on the part of the Indian Agent at Mistawasis and the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, which are affecting, in a most disastrous way, the work of the Church's Mission at Mistawasis.\n\nIt was moved, seconded, and unanimously carried that the Presbytery enter its strongest protest against:\n\n1. Recruiting by the authorities of Boarding Schools controlled by other denominations of children belonging to the Presbyterian Mission at Mistawasis. During the past few years, nine children, who had been cared for by the Presbyterian Church, were removed with the consent of the Agent, to either Anglican or Roman Catholic Boarding Schools, thus most seriously reducing the attendance and efficiency of the Day-School at Mistawasis.\n\n2. The reduction of grants from the Government to provide for the salary of House Matron and her assistant. The services of a House Matron are absolutely essential for the work of supervision and instruction in Domestic Science among the children on the Reserve.\n\n3. The suggested discontinuance of the mid-day meal now provided by the Department, which would be fatal to the attendance of the children at the Day-School and injurious as well to the health of the children, who in most instances, get no nourishing food other than that provided in this meal.\n\nBench Hills\nBack.\nFeb 16, 1917\n\nthe Minister\nthe Indian Department\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs clerk of the Presbytery of Prince Albert I would most respectfully submit the above communication for your favourable consideration, and trust that its fairness may be sufficient appeal. Mr. & Mrs. Smith are doing a splendid and unselfish work at Mistawasis Indian Reserve and have the fullest sympathy of the Presbytery in the hard task to which they have put their hands.\n\n(Rv) James Hamilton - Pres. Clerk\nOttawa, February 27, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant forwarding a copy of resolutions passed at a meeting of the Presbytery of Prince Albert protesting against recent actions on the part of the Indian Agent at Mistawasis and this Department, which are said to be affecting, in a most disastrous way, the work of the church at that place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that with regard to recruiting by the authorities of boarding schools of other denominations that the Department was not aware that any Presbyterian children have been placed in Roman Catholic boarding schools, as in the applications for the admission of any children to such schools it is distinctly stated that they are Roman Catholics. With regard to pupils who have been placed in Anglican schools, this has been done at the request of the parents.\n\nIn regard to the second paragraph of the resolution, I beg to say that the cost of maintaining the Mistawasis Day School for an average attendance of eleven pupils for the past year amounted to $1940.00, which is a per capita cost of $176.00. As this expenditure is out of all proportion to the work done, the Department was forced to make reductions if the school is to be kept on.\n\nThe salary of the matron has been stopped and after the\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the day school on the Mistawasis Reserve, which is under your charge.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if this school is to be continued, sweeping reductions will have to be made in the cost of maintenance, which last year amounted to $1940.00 for an average attendance of eleven pupils. In order to provide for these reductions it has been found necessary to stop the services of a matron and the transport of pupils will be discontinued after the 31st proximo and the cost of the mid-day meal, which has amounted to a fraction over fourteen cents per pupil per day, must be cut down considerably.\n\nThe Department is not desirous of closing this school, if it can be carried on at a reasonable cost, but so long as the war goes on the funds at the disposal of the Department are limited and the strictest economy will have to be exercised, if the school is to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Mr Young also called, and said the grievance of the Indians would not warrant the removal of Mr Smith, and asked me my opinion, I told him I did not want to interfere in any way with the Missionary work, as Mr Smith had even taken exception to my action in writing him on the subject, but at the same time I said it would be unwise owing to the school work to make any change before the midsummer holidays at any rate, which is only 2\u00bd months distant. I also said that...\nI also said that I would endeavour to get the Indians to allow things to stand as they were until that time, that is, to send their children to school, and attend church; they will allow their children to go to school, but they claim they will not go to church, and have already sent word to the Revd D.D. McDonald of Sandy Lake, asking him to come on Sunday, and hold services in some house, to this I do not think he will consent without first obtaining authority from the Bishop.\n\nThere has also been several questions raised upon which I am not quite clear. FIRST, Does the property on which the Mission buildings are situated belong to the Mission for all time, or only so long as they continue to be used for Mission purposes? SECOND, Can a minister of another denomination to the one first established on any particular reserve, without first getting the consent of the resident minister, hold services on the reserve? THIRD; Have the Department any voice in this matter at all?, if so, I would be pleased to hear them, or if not, any suggestions that would help to clear the atmosphere will be thankfully received, and faithfully applied.\n\nAs far as I can gather from the Indians they wish to have an English Church Minister that can talk Cree, and the few remaining children sent to a boarding school, as far as the school is concerned I quite agree with them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, May 1, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report which shows that considerable friction has existed for sometime between the Indians and the teacher of the day school on the Mistawasis Reserve. The Rev. Mr. Smith, who is in charge of this school, apparently resents any interference by the Agent in school matters. It is also stated that the Indians are dissatisfied with the ministrations of Mr. Smith as Missionary and the Department is of the opinion that the condition of affairs on this reserve should be inquired into by you. I should be obliged if you would report the result of your inquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison,\nAsst.

Mr. Smith, missionary on the Mistawasis Reserve, who is also the teacher of the day school there, and the Indians, and they have been asked to inquire into this matter and report to the Department.\n\nIn reference to your question as to the ownership of the mission property I beg to say that the Presbyterian Church has the use of this property so long as they conduct a mission on the reserve and have an Indian congregation, but they have no title in fee.\n\nThe Department is not anxious to get mixed up in a religious controversy and would rather wait the result of the inquiry to be made by the Presbyterian Church authorities before expressing an opinion on the last question in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. A. Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to say that the Revd J.F.

Upon receipt of this return a cheque for the amount due him will be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. A.

J. E. Smith, teacher of the Mistawasis Day School, called on him a few days ago and reported that there are just three children attending school and suggested that Mrs. Smith be allowed to teach them through the months of May and June, as he had been offered a position in an outside school for the summer months. The Agent recommends that this school be closed until the first of September at any rate, thus allowing Mr. Smith to accept the position offered him.\n\nMr. Milligan has been informed that this school may be closed at once.

Edmison,\n\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Edmison:\n\nAs instructed by the Board at the regular meeting in March I visited the Indian Mission at Mistawasis and beg to report as follows:\n\n(1) The church building has been greatly improved in every way since Rev. J. E. Smith took charge. The cost of these improvements has been borne entirely by the Mission.\n\n(2) The services on Sunday have not been better attended, perhaps, in the history of the Mission.\n\n(3) The progress in the Day-school of the children has been excellent and has been most satisfactory to the Government Inspector.\n\n(4) In spite of all this, there has grown a spirit of antagonism between the Mission and the agent, due largely to the indifference of the agent to any work done by the Church and also to an over aggressive attitude of the missionaries.\n\n(5) This antagonism has spread among the Indians, partly I should say, because of the attitude of the agent toward the Mission and partly because the missionaries insisted on the sale of blankets giving some return for the clothing they were demanding from the Mission.\n\n(6) Most serious of all is the threat of the agent that the School may be closed at the end of June and the few children now attending sent to Boarding Schools on other reserves. In all probability, these Schools would belong to other denominations and the children would be educated away from the Presbyterian Church into some other communion. This would effectually destroy any future prospect for our Mission.\n\nIn view of the above facts, would recommend that no change be made at present at Mistawasis, or until the policy of the Government has been stated definitely in regard to the School. Should the Government persist in the determination to close the School, there seems to be no alternative but to withdraw our Missionaries and to close our Mission. At the same time the responsibility of any such action should be thrown on the Government as through their action our Mission work would be made impossible.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n(Signed) Colin G. Young.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nWe have had several letters from you in regard to the situation at Mistawasis.\n\nSome time ago, I notified you that our Board had asked our District Superintendent Rev.

The Indians are holding Prayer meetings in their private houses, and claim that they will not attend church, so long as Mr Smith is the Missionary, personally.

The Department is very desirous that this school should be opened with a new teacher in charge as soon as possible. I may say that the Indians are petitioning the Bishop of the Church of England to send them a minister and teacher combined, as they do not desire the services of the Rev. J. E. Smith and his wife to be continued. It is hoped that you will be able to obtain a teacher for this school at an early date.\n\nMrs. Smith is still living in the teachers residence, and the Indians wish to have her leave, and it might be well for you to meet their wishes and have the residence vacant when the new teacher arrives.

I have already referred this matter to the Presbytery of Prince Albert and to our District Superintendent, Rev. C. G. Young. I expect a reply from them soon.\n\nI note that the Indians wish Mrs. Smith to leave the teachers' residence. At this distance, it looks to me a clear case of irritation on the part of your Indian Agent. From all I can learn, I think there would be as much justification for our asking you to remove the Indian Agent as for the Department to request the removal of Rev. and Mrs. Smith. I have known Mr. Smith personally for twenty years, and there is, I can assure you, no more respected minister in our denomination. He is a man who could fill one of the best pulpits we have and it was a surprise to everyone when he volunteered for work amongst the Indians. Mrs. Smith is a clever, consecrated woman, and deserves, we think, better treatment than she is receiving at the hands of the Indian Agent and the Indians.\n\nI hope to hear from the Presbytery and from Mr. Young soon.

J. E. Smith, missionary of Mistawasis Indian Reserve, be accepted and that the Home Mission Board be advised that no further appointment be made to this field.\"\n\nI may state that several reasons for abandoning the Indian work were carefully considered. While the Presbytery regrets the termination of this almost historic mission, it is obliged to adopt the present step because of official hampering and lack of scope for further profitable effort. It is a notorious fact that the Indian Agent at Mistawasis is not in sympathy with our work. The Presbytery submitted a strong protest against some of his actions to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa without any encouraging response. Further, there are so few children on the Reserve that we are hardly justified in continuing our mission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Richard C. T. Othen,\nClerk of Presbytery.\nMr. J. D.

Smith and wife.\n\nAll your communications in regard to the situation at Mistawasis have been referred to the Presbytery, and we have just received an answer, copy of which I enclose. Our Sub-Executive, at the meeting held on Thursday last, decided to approve the recommendation of Prince Albert Presbytery. We have accepted the resignation of Mr. Smith and will make no further appointment, so the way will now be open for the Church of England to send in a minister.\n\nTrusting this will find your approval,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/GMcC.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Edmison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, has forwarded a resolution passed at the meeting of the Presbytery of Prince Albert approving of the resignation of the Rev. J. E. Smith, missionary on the Mistawasis Indian Reserve, and advising the Home Mission Board that no further appointment be made to this field. The resolution states that several reasons for abandoning the Indian work there were carefully considered and that, while regretting the closing of the mission, it is obliged to take the present step because of official hampering and lack of scope for further profitable effort.\n\nThe resolution also states that it is notorious fact that the Indian Agent at Mistawasis is not in sympathy with the work and that a strong protest against some of his actions had been submitted to the Department without any encouraging response.\n\nThis is rather strong language to use against the Agent, as it is unsupported by any evidence of his antagonism to\nto the work of the missionary on the reserve.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Smith, the missionary, was also the teacher of the day school on the reserve, having been appointed to that position on the 21st of September, 1914, and it was only in connection with the school work that Mr. Agent Milligan came in official contact with him.\n\nMr. Smith failed to make a success of the school and when the attention of the Presbyterian Church authorities was called to the falling off in the attendance and the excessive cost of maintenance they came back at the Department with a report prepared by the Rev. Colin G. Young, Superintendent of Presbyterian Missions, in which he states that there has grown up a spirit of antagonism between the mission and the Agent, due largely to the indifference of the Agent to any work done by the church, and also to an over aggressive attitude of the missionaries and he blames the Agent for threatening to close the school.\n\nThe facts are that the Rev. Mr. Smith failed to win the confidence of the Indians in his mission work and they were so dissatisfied with him that the Agent wrote the Rev. Mr. Young a private letter asking him to visit the reserve and try and adjust the difference between the Indians and\nand Mr. Smith. I think this shows conclusively that the Agent was doing his best to assist the missionary. As far as the school work is concerned, the Agent was acting under the instructions of the Department, which were that, if better results could not be obtained, this school was to be closed.\n\nNeither the Department nor the Agent are responsible for the failure of Mr. Smith to secure the confidence and cooperation of the Indians in his missionary work on the reserve and it is a poor defence of his unfitness for the dual position he occupied on the Mistawasis Reserve to attribute his want of success to the Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the Rev. J.E. Smith and wife have removed from the Mission house here, taking with them everything belonging to the mission\u2014such as Cree Bibles, etc., etc.\u2014and I am informed that they made the statement that the Presbyterians did not intend sending another missionary here.\n\nMr. Edmonson of Toronto wrote me some time ago saying their representative Mr. McIntosh of Prince Albert was endeavoring to secure one.\n\nI had Inspector Crombie call up Mr. McIntosh regarding this and he stated he did not know anything about it; now it appears to me that they should have notified someone of this, as the Indian children have not been to school since last June\u2014they would like to send them to Onion Lake Boarding School.\nMEMO.\n\nif this school is to remain closed.\nThe Band would however like to have\nservices held in the Church as well,\nthey care not by what denomination\u2014\nso long as protestant.\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nJ A Milligan\nIndian Agent\n\nTo:\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 11, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant reporting that the Rev. J. E. Smith and wife have removed from the mission house at Mistanawas, taking with them everything belonging to the mission, such as Cree Bibles, etc., etc., and that you are informed that they made the statement that the Presbyterians did not intend sending another missionary there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is informed by the Rev. J. H. Edmison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, that they have accepted the resignation of Mr. Smith and will make no further appointment to this field. There will, therefore, be no objection to the Church of England sending a missionary there, if they wish to do so.\n\nThe Department would like you to take steps to try and secure a teacher for the school at this point, so that it may be re-opened. Any applications you receive for the position should be forwarded to the Department for consideration and the applicants should give full information as to their age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., and forward copies of any testimonials they may have.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. A. Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 16, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo, forwarding a copy of a resolution passed at a meeting of the Presbytery of Prince Albert accepting the resignation of the Rev. J. E. Smith, Missionary on the Mistawasis Indian Reserve, and advising the Home Mission Board that no further appointment be made to this field, I beg to say that the resolution has been noted.\n\nWith regard to the concluding paragraph of the resolution, in which it is stated that the Presbytery, while regretting the closing the mission, is obliged to take the present steps because of official hampering and lack of scope for further profitable work, I beg to inform you that there is nothing before the Department to show that any official hampering has taken place in the work of the mission on this reserve, nor is there anything to show that the Indian Agent is not in sympathy with the work.\n\nIn February of last year the Rev. James Hamilton, Clerk of the Presbytery of Prince Albert, forwarded a copy of a resolution passed at a recent meeting of the Presbytery there protesting against recent actions on the part of the Indian Agent, in which it was stated that his actions were said to be affecting the work of the church at Mistawasis.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nin a most disastrous way. This resolution referred to recruiting by the authorities of boarding schools of other denominations and to the reductions of government grants for the maintenance of this school. The Rev. Mr. Hamilton was informed that the Department had no knowledge of any Presbyterian children being placed in Roman Catholic boarding schools, and, with regard to the pupils that had been placed in Anglican schools, this was done at the special request of their parents. He was also advised of the cost of maintaining the Mistawasis School, which, with an average attendance of eleven pupils for the year then past, amounted to $1940.00, or a per capita rate of $176.00. He was also told that, as this expenditure was out of proportion to the work done, the Department was forced to make reductions.\n\nI may add that there were no specific charges made in the resolution just referred to against the Agent. As far as the Department is aware the Agent has performed his duties fairly and conscientiously and any antagonism that existed between the mission and the Agent was due more to the aggressive attitude of the Missionary, than to the Agent's indifference. There is no getting away from the fact that Mr. Smith failed to win the goodwill and confidence of the Indians and his usefulness as a teacher on the reserve was past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your marginally noted subject\u2014I have the honour to report that I called on the Rev. Bishop Newman, while in Prince Albert this week, and informed him that the Presbyterians had withdrawn from this field, and that it was now open for him to recommend a man for the position.\n\nHe said that owing to 75% of his students enlisting it would be impossible to give us a permanent man until after the termination of the war. He promised that he would write D.D. McDonald, his missionary at Sandy Lake Reserve, to come down and hold services every other Sunday. I then asked him about the School Children\u2014Eight in number of School Age\u2014and he suggested sending them to Onion Lake Boarding School\u2014\n\nJanuary 28, 1918\nHe said they had enlarged the school\nhad accommodation for them. The Indians\nare highly delighted with arrangements.\nI informed Inspector Crombie she\nthought it a good idea. I would\ntherefore recommend that the children\nof School age now here be admitted\nto Union Lake Boarding School the\nquestion of a resident Teacher Preacher\nbe left in abeyance for the present.\n\nAs Miss Swift had no stove or\nwindow Blinds and to avoid buying\nI removed those at the teacher's dwelling\nhouse for her use.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient Servant\n\nJ.A. Milligan\nIndian Agent.\n\nSeal.\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 7, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo reporting that you called on Bishop Newnham while in Prince Albert recently and informed him that the Presbyterians had withdrawn from Mistawasis and that the field was now open for His Lordship to recommend a man for this position, also that His Lordship promised to write D. D. McDonald, his missionary at Sandy Lake Reserve, to come down and hold services every other Sunday and suggested that the children of school age on the Reserve be sent to the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to send these children to the Onion Lake School and would like you to take steps to try and secure a suitable teacher for the Mistawasis Day School. Any applications you receive for this position should be forwarded to the Department for consideration, with full information as to the age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., of the applicants.\n\nIf a suitable teacher cannot be secured the school may remain closed for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

SCHOOL.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Milligan regarding Mistawasis day school I found that if the school were opened now the attendance would be very small and I suggested that as it would not be advisable to re-open the school under those conditions, it would be better to allow the Principal of the C.of E. Boarding school, Onion Lake to recruit from children at Mistawasis for his school.

If it is the Department's wish my son will continue through July-August if not he is quite willing to quit anytime. The attendance has been fair, as many as eight and as low as two or three days. One of the children was instantly killed by lighting and for two days none of the children went to school.\n\nThey appear to show progress for the short time they have been there & may attend better from now on.

A return should be forwarded showing the attendance and days taught during the month of June, when the salary due for that period will be paid. Your son should also forward a return at the end of August, showing the attendance for the two months up to that date.\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Newnham, is being communicated with and requested to endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable man for this position to begin duties on or about the first of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Please let me know if it is an \"improved\" day school, & what salary is offered, & if a certified teacher is demanded. Failing any other, would you appoint Mr. J.R.Sette, for many years teacher at Montreal Lake? He is not a first-rate teacher, but is really steady, good man, a half-breed or Indian, & needs a change. Awaiting your reply as soon as is convenient.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nJ. A. Newbarn\nBishop of Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 30, 1918.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that you have no teacher in view at present for the Mistawasis Day School and ask if the Department would appoint Mr. J. R. Settee, for many years teacher at Montreal Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to appoint Mr. Settee as teacher of the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nIn this connection I may say that on the 25th ultimo Mr. Agent Milligan was informed that the Department had decided to dispense with Mr. Settee's services as teacher of the Montreal Lake School as soon as another teacher can be secured. Mr. Milligan was instructed to communicate immediately with the Church of England authorities with a view to securing a qualified teacher for this school and it is hoped that one will be secured shortly.\n\nI have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough, therefore, to try and obtain a suitable teacher for the Mistawasis.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have carried your letter around with me in Toronto, etc., hoping that I might make opportunity to attend to it & might be able to report some prospect of filling the vacancies. But I regret to say that I can tell no prospect in the present shortage of teachers or of man-power. This means that according to your letter:\n\n1. Mistawasis Day School is vacant\u2014Mr. Selte not being accepted.\n2. Forteau Lake School is vacant, unless Mr. J.R. Selte is confirmed for the present\u2014you say \"the Dept. has decided to dispense with Mr. Selte's services, as soon as another teacher can be secured.\"\n3. I have now to inform you that Mr. Louis Thivierge wishes to resign the Kinoonootayao's School at Big River just as soon as I can replace him, Oct. Nov., Dec.\n\nHe has never been successful as a teacher, though a steady and man, & he is now tired of trying to do work that is beyond his powers. So you see there are three schools to be supplied. The only man I can think of is J.R. Selte; I know he is not a competent teacher for Forteau Lake, but the Dept. wishes him to accept it. As I think I told you, he would like to try Mistawasis, & perhaps the change...\nstir him up to a little fresh effort, he might do better work there. On failing that, he might accept Kinowmootayao's school, Big River. He would do better than Louis Shemakon, & the children there are very backward. I would like to know soon what the Dept. wishes under these circumstances. Retire these two men & close the schools for the winter, or what else? If I could only get a reliable, able, returned soldier, Indian or White-man, he might do good work. When you reply, will you please tell me what you are prepared to offer in each case for a qualified teacher. I think better & therefore have been overpaid as only \"make-shifts\" & paid accordingly. I do not think there is a very suitable residence for teacher (White-man) at either Dumont Lake or Big River.

Later on Mr. Milligan informed me that it was not intended to open the school at once. I beg now to submit to you the name of Mrs. LeClair for Mistawasis.\n\nShe was formally known to you as Miss K. Harmon & did excellent work as teacher at Lac la Ronge School & afterwards in the Sturgeon Lake Day-school. The I.D., I think, expressed regret when she resigned in order to be married to the Rev. L. LeClair. Circumstances incline her to resume work as a teacher. She has expressed herself as ready & able to take Mistawasis School after Christmas.\n\nShe is an old friend of Miss Swift, your matron there & can live with her. Her baby will then be over 3 months old & she says it will not hinder her work. I should be glad if you would appoint her & inform her as to terms, etc. I can strongly recommend her.\n\nJ. A.

Newnham, setting forth the educational requirements of the Indians in his diocese. Original on 117090/1.\n\nBishop Newnham asks for the appointment of Mrs. Leclair to the Mistawasis School. She has had experience as teacher in an Indian school, having been employed at the Lac la Ronge Boarding School and also at the Sturgeon Lake Day School. A letter has just been received from Mr. Agent Milligan regarding the Mistawasis School, in which he states that it is a question whether it would be advisable to open this school, the attendance being so small. He says that the few Protestant children there would be better if they were sent to Onion Lake, as the Catholic children are all attending the Duck Lake Boarding School.\nExtract from letter from Mr. Scott to the Right Rev. J. A. Newnham, Bishop of Saskatchewan, dated December 10th, 1918. Original on 117094/1\n\nWith regard to the Mistawasis day school, I am quite prepared to reopen this school and to provide the usual salary and other incidental expenses, as soon as Your Lordship can nominate a suitable teacher. If at all possible the teacher should have professional qualifications, or otherwise be specially adapted to the Indian work.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot concur in your recommendation to appoint Mrs. Leclair. I cannot see that it would be possible for her to give full attention to the work that would be necessary in order to insure success and at the same time attend to her domestic duties.\nI would respectfully ask you to reconsider your decision not to appoint Mrs. Leclair to Mistawasis school, on account of her baby. She insists that her baby will not prevent her giving full time and power to teaching and you will remember that Miss Swift is the matron there and looks after the health of the women. Mrs. Leclair, as Miss K. Harmon, always gave the fullest satisfaction to your Department. She is very desirous of trying and I can think of no one else.\nJanuary 9th, 1919.\n\nMy dear Bishop Newnham -\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo. In reply to that portion with which you deal with the Mistawasis School, I have, upon further consideration, decided to allow Mrs. Leclair to take this work on trial. It is to be clearly understood that her retention in the position and her continuance at this school will depend upon the attendance she can secure, and the nature of the service she will be able to render.\n\nAs I intimated in my previous correspondence, I feel doubtful of the success of the scheme, but I am anxious to meet Your Lordship's wishes in as far as possible. Mrs. Leclair will be written to officially without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, January 13, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from His Lordship Bishop Newnham, in which he recommends that you be appointed as teacher of the Mistawasis Day School.

She has also been informed that she will be allowed a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum and that she should begin her duties as soon as possible. You will be good enough to advise the Department of the date on which she takes up her duties at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. A.

At the date of writing she has not received the letter you mention having written her to Leask. She has heard from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who communicated the information of her appointment.\n\nMrs. LeClair has requested me to inform the Department that she deeply appreciates the offer, but regrets her inability to accept the position at the salary offered, viz: $400.00 per annum, and further requests me to draw your attention to the fact that she holds a 2nd Class Saskatchewan Certificate.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nAct.

Kindly ascertain whether she will accept the position at this salary and advise the Department. I may say that a salary of $400.00 per annum was all that was previously allowed at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. G. H.

I was Senior Teacher at La Loche Indian Boarding School for 2\u00bd years, from March 1914 to September 1916, and taught at Surgeon Lake School from November 1916 to July 1917. My maiden name was Kate Darman. At the last mentioned school, the Dept granted me a salary\nof $600, and since then the cost of living is much higher.\n\nMy sister has resigned her position in England, in order to come and help me with the work, but owing to the vessels being monopolised for the transport of returned soldiers, she has not yet been able to secure a passport for her passage to Canada. I regret that I might not be able to commence school this term, as I could not prepare the mid-day meal for the pupils, while I was teaching school, but would do so as soon as my sister is able to obtain her passage and come & live with me at the Teacher's Residence,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\nKate Le Clair.\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 28, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, in which you ask the Department to grant you a salary of $600.00 as teacher of the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow you a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum for your services as teacher of this school from the time you take charge.

I may say that Mrs. LeClair will not take the Mistawasis School at $500.00 but is asking for $600.00. In addition to this, she informs me that she is unable to open the School this quarter, she has quite a young baby, and no one to look after it for her. She is awaiting the arrival of her sister who is coming from the old Country, when she would then be able to take up her duties. In fact, at times I am unable to quite understand Mrs. LeClair, as she does not seem to know what she will do next.\n\nI do not wish to be unfair to Mrs. LeClair, but consider it quite necessary to give you particulars about her family affairs. She is at present separated from her husband, and from present observations, I think it possible for them to come together again, in such case, I do not know if she would stay with the School.\n\nI informed Mrs. LeClair when she made the request for $600.00 per annum, that I did not think the Department would grant it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

I have just received a letter from Mrs. LeClair, stating that she will not be able to commence duties until August 4th.

This for all I know may have been settled by now, but when I was there a fortnight ago, Mrs. LeClair was waiting for an answer to her request for $600, & there was still no school. I respectfully think that $600 is the least you should offer. Mrs. LeClair is a trained and experienced teacher & can get $100 to $120 a month at an ordinary public school but wishes to continue in Indian Work. The Snake Plain Indians have for years had an improved Day-school, with good buildings and have now been without any for 2 years. They ought to have a good dayschool at least till they are provided with a Boarding school, of which I now write.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A.

McLean Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI may say that I was surprised and disappointed, after all the Department has said in regard to keeping me posted as to appointments of officers in the field, to find that one Mrs. LaClair had been appointed last May to teach the day school on the Mistawasis reserve, and not until I was there the other day did I learn that the Department had made this appointment. This woman came to me personally to ask how she was to go about getting the school started; she stated that she had no wood; that the well was out of repair and that the school, generally speaking, required attention. She has been on the reserve since May and this is all the progress that has been made. I have been on this reserve three times during the period that the school has been closed and Mrs. LaClair has been writing for instructions. Had I known this, the school would have been opened by July 1st, and the matters referred to attended to long ago. I do not see how we are expected to get results if I am not posted as to what is going on and given an opportunity of getting these things straightened out.\n\nI told Mr. Weir to have Mrs. LaClair moved over to the school, purchase a supply of wood, attend to the cleaning of the well and give her every assistance to go on with the work. I will advise you later as to what is done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\nOctober 9th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith reference to that part of our letter of September 29, dealing with the appointment of Mrs. Leclair as teacher of the day school on the Mistawasis reserve, I have to say that I immediately looked up the case. I find that in December last, when it was decided to re-open the Mistawasis day school, His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan nominated Mrs. Leclair as teacher. She was informed on January 13 of her appointment, and Agent Milligan also advised. In reply she stated that she could not accept the position at the salary named, but would take it if a higher amount were allowed. It was later decided to pay her at the higher amount, namely, $600.00 per annum, and the agent was asked to ascertain the date upon which she could start work. She informed him that she could not start until August, the delay evidently being owing to the non-arrival of her sister from the Old Country, who would assist her with her household duties.\n\nThe Agent reported that he did not consider August a suitable time to re-open the school, as the Indians were then all camped at the hay grounds, and he was instructed to assemble the class on September 2nd, the date on which all of the schools opened.\n\nThe delay in re-opening the school was certainly owing to procrastination on the part of Mrs. Leclair in taking up the duties of teacher, not through any fault of the Department.\n\nI did not issue instructions that you were to be informed of the appointment of day school teachers throughout the West, as I did not wish to add to your office work. However, I think it would be well for you to have this information, and, in future, you will receive notification.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

I requested the Agent to inform me whether the preparation of a mid-day meal would entail the expense of engaging an assistant, and he advises me that Mrs. LeClair's sister is staying with her at present, and that the latter would consent to prepare the necessary meal, and therefore the engagement of an assistant would not be necessary. In view of the circumstances, I beg to recommend that the Department provide for a mid-day meal. This question was referred to me by you, under cover of your letter No.117094-1 of the 7th January last, to which I replied on the 14th idem.

This is a large improved day school, and midday meals are served to the pupils. There are 24 children of school age on the Reserve, within 3 miles of the school, 20 of whom are enrolled, with an average attendance of 11.\n\nMrs. Le Clair is an excellent teacher, and has a 2nd class professional permanent certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, and is also an Old Country certificated teacher. She is liked by all on the Reserve - Indians, children and the agent. Mr. Ferrier states she is devoting her life to Indian work, but finds, if more financial assistance is not given, it will be necessary for her to take up other work. She is at present in receipt of a salary at the rate of $600 per annum and bonus at rate of $150, which makes a combined salary and bonus of $750. I may say that we are paying teachers having her qualifications in the western provinces salaries as high as $900 and also the bonus. I consider that we should endeavour to keep teachers of this class in our service, and, no doubt, the salary she receives is too low for the work she is performing. I would, therefore, beg to recommend that she be given an increase of at least $200 per annum, which will allow her a salary of $800, and that such increase dates from the first of the present school year, viz: September 1st, last.\nOTTAWA, October 7th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am very pleased to be able to inform you that in view of the excellent service which you are performing as teacher of the Mistawasis Indian Day School, the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of the granting to you of an increase of $200 per annum in your salary. This increase will date from the 1st of September, last. This will make your salary from that date at the rate of $500 per annum, and you will also be entitled to the bonus allowed teachers of Indian day schools during the continuance of the present fiscal year.\n\nThis increase in salary was made on my representation regarding your services and also on my assurance that you would remain in the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

When our representative was in Saskatchewan this summer, he ascertained that Mrs. LeClair was not only giving excellent service to the Department of Indian Affairs as Teacher, but was carrying on genuine missionary work. She is devoting her life to our Indian people, and as she is of Church of England faith, I feel that you would be pleased to have this word concerning her.\n\nI was successful in raising her salary $200.00 per annum, in view of her splendid work, and I feel that the Church authorities might well recognize her, and perhaps might give her assistance in the christian work that she is doing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

There is no excuse, both are young and in good health themselves.\n\nI am not in favor of any of his children being sent to Boarding Schools, Jacob Badger approached me about two years ago on the subject, his one idea is to get rid of the responsibility of providing for his children, as he only resides about a quarter of a mile from the Day School, in fairness to the teacher, I do not think it advisable to recruit children living so near the school. The average attendance is not very high in any case, and no doubt if children like the above man's were sent to Boarding Schools, it would mean the closing down of the Day School.\n\nI am giving Jacob Badger due warning, and if he continues to neglect his children, I will advise you further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 14, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in further reference to the case of Isabel Badger, daughter of Jacob Badger of the Mistawasis reserve, which was drawn to the attention of the Department by Travelling Nurse Johnston.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you do not advise having this girl placed in a residential school at the present time. If the father, after the warning given by you, neglects to suitably provide for his children, we can then consider having Isabel sent to a residential school. You should impress upon this man his duty to provide for his children, and as he is living close to the Mistawasis Day School, he should see that they attend that school regularly.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to whether there are any improvements in the conditions at this girl's home and whether she is receiving the proper medical treatment and nourishment. If not, we will then consider what steps can be taken in her case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Day Schools in the Carlton Agency. April 4, 1923. Original on 107-9-6.\n\nMISTAWASIS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on March 29th, and found only two girls present out of an enrolment of 16. The average attendance for the quarter was 4.9. The pupils are all in the primary grades. With one exception their ages range from five to nine years.\n\nA number of reasons are given for the poor attendance; severe weather, sickness and distance from the school being the chief reasons given.\n\nI am of the opinion, however, that the real trouble can be attributed to a lack of interest on the part of the parents. At least 16 children of school age reside within a radius of three miles. The parents do not move about much during the winter months and if they were at all interested in obtaining an education for their children they could find a means of getting them to school.\n\nMrs. Kate Le Clair is in charge as teacher; she has a second class Saskatchewan certificate.\n\nTo carry on this school under the present attendance conditions is a waste of money for no good purpose. I believe that the attendance could be materially increased by engaging the services of a driver to bring in the children from the north of the agency and by engaging a teacher of more forcible character than Mrs. Le Clair.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a large frame building and one of the rooms is used as a classroom. It is very comfortable and fairly well equipped with school furniture.\n\nW. Murison,\nInsp. of Ind. Agencies.\nExtract from Letter received from Mr. Commissioner Graham, dated April 18, 1923, on file 107-9-6, commenting on Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the Day Schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nMISTAW\u00c1SIS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe attendance at this school is practically negligible, notwithstanding that at least sixteen children of school age reside within a radius of three miles of the school, and it seems to me that an unwarranted expenditure is being incurred in keeping the school open. I do not think that anything will be gained by engaging the services of a teamster to bring children to the school, which I would recommend be closed and the pupils and other children of school age referred to be sent to the File Hills or some other boarding School where they would obtain a proper training.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the report of Mr. Inspector Murison on the Mistawasis Indian Day School is so discouraging that, unless the attendance increases, the activity will have to cease. You and the teacher will please make every effort to ensure a better attendance in the immediate future. Our Act permits of compulsion, and, if you feel that some of the parents should be brought before you and fined for carelessness, in not sending their children to school, I shall be pleased to forward you formal notices which may be posted in the homes. A copy of this notice is enclosed. If you recommend such action, it may be necessary to appoint a truant officer. A responsible Indian could be offered the position.\n\nPlease give this your earnest consideration and prompt attention, as the Department will be forced to close the school unless remedial measures are taken and gratifying results follow. Kindly intimate to the teacher the nature of this letter and recommend whatever action you consider advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-5-l of the 26th ultimo informing me that if the attendance at the Mistawasis Indian Day School does not show considerable improvement in the near future, it will be necessary to close same.\n\nI have taken the matter up with the teacher explaining the circumstances to her, though I would point out that she has done her best in the past to get the parents to send the children to school more regularly.\n\nDuring the last year, there was considerable sickness on the reserve, which affected the attendance, then again the parents do not take the interest they should in the education of their children, thinking that if they do not send them to the Day School, the department will be compelled to send the children to Boarding School, and be relieved of the responsibility of caring for their children, they should be given to understand that this is not the policy of the department, especially when there is a school situated on the reserve.\n\nFrom Easter the attendance has been a little better, though quite a number are still away with their parents hunting. If you will furnish me with the forms calling upon parents to send children to school, and give me the necessary authority to prosecute those who fail to carry out my instructions, I will do my part in an endeavour to put the school on a better footing; if these measures fail, there will be no option left but to close the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 15th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the school attendance at the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the falling off in attendance is due in greater part to the lack of interest on the part of the parents, and also to the fact that they are of the opinion, if they do not send their children to the day school, they will be sent to a boarding school, and they will thus be relieved of the responsibility of their care. I may say that, on reserves where there are day schools, and where the parents are in a position to provide for the proper care of their children, we require that such children attend the day schools. It is only in cases of orphan or neglected children, or where no educational facilities are provided, that they are placed in residential schools. It might be well, if you consider it advisable, to take steps under Section 10 of the Indian Act to compel the parents to send their children who are of school age and in good health to school. It will first be necessary to appoint a truant officer to enforce the attendance. An Indian who would be competent may be appointed. He should warn the parents or guardians of the consequences of truancy, and if they refuse to send their children, he should then serve a written notice, a copy of which is enclosed for your guidance. The procedure to be adopted by the truant officer and yourself will be found in Sub-sections 2 and 3 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. After due notice has been served, you may take steps to prosecute those who fail to comply by sending their children regularly to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The Department is not, therefore, prepared to undertake the transportation of pupils to the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

You should take this matter up with the parents and endeavour to impress upon them the necessity of a regular attendance of their children who are of school age and in good health. If they neglect or refuse to have their children attend regularly, you may take the necessary action under Section 10 of the Indian Act to see that the children who are of school age and in good health be sent to school. I beg to refer you to official letter of May 15th, 1923, outlining the procedure to be followed in enforcing the compulsory attendance clause of the Act.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear that there is a more regular attendance at this school than shown by the last quarterly return, and I shall be pleased if you will use your best endeavours towards an increased attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would be able to commence work again on September 1st.\n\nI have been ill, and feel it is absolutely necessary for me to take a rest for four months away from an Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is now 10 years since I went to Lac La Ronge Boarding School as Senior Teacher, then to Surgeon Lake Day School, and I have not taken a complete relaxation from the work on an Indian Reserve.\n\nI commenced teaching at Mistawasis School Aug. 1919, and during that period have never had to be a day out of school for ill-health, until this nervous breakdown.\nI was ill for two weeks (including the Easter Holidays), then reopened school, but have been forced to close again.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nKate Le Clair.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose letter received from Mrs. K.

It is hoped that Mrs. LeClair will have completely recovered and be able to resume duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September first, next.\n\nSalary will be allowed Mrs. LeClair to the end of the present month.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I write to you on behalf of Indian Day Teachers.\n\nDuring the five years I have taught at Mistawasis School, a good deal of unrest has been caused among my pupils through Principals of Boarding Schools visiting the Reserve, or sending messages of vacancies by the children when coming for their holidays.\n\nToday I have heard of the Principal of Elkhorn (Mary) Boarding School writing to a parent asking for her daughter to go to his school.\n\nThe girl, Caroline Johnstone is 10 years of age, is the only child at home, and lives less than a mile from the school. She has a good home, and has always attended school very regularly.\n\nFourteen of my pupils have already gone to Boarding schools, nine since August 1923.\n\nA teacher can not help a decrease in the average attendance.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need of Boarding Schools for orphans, and some children over 12 years of age, it does seem more necessary.\nTo canvas children who are not attending a day school.\n\nCaroline Johnstone is now the only child on the Reserve over 10 years of age. There is one treaty boy 9 years of age. Another may return any day.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nKate Leclair.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will not interfere with this recruiting, because of the larger and more varied opportunities offered Indian children at residential schools. Those interested in the work generally are satisfied if the teachers of day schools do their best to keep the attendance as large and as regular as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

A number of children living near Mrs. LeClair's school were taken from the reserve recently, thus lowering the attendance.\n\nThe school is being conducted in the dwelling house which is quite satisfactory from every point of view and is kept in good condition. The buildings are owned by the Crown.\n\nI understand that the school building has been previously used, but since then the attendance became so small, the classes have been conducted in the dwelling house which is quite larger and affords adequate accommodation.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Murison on the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nI visited this Day School on February 10th and found two boys and three girls present out of an enrollment of seven. The following is a list of pupils enrolled:\n\n- Caroline Johnson aged 11\n- Evelyne Dreever \" 9\n- Herbert Head \" 10\n- Douglas Head \" 6\n- Rema Dreever \" 6\n- Gladys Dreever \" 5\n- Isabelle Dreever \" 5\n\nIt will be seen by the above that there are really only three children of school age in attendance. It would hardly, in my opinion, appear that the attendance of this school justifies the expense connected with keeping it in operation. After making enquiry on the Reserve I am of the opinion that very little difficulty would be met with in getting all the children of school age placed in our Boarding Schools. At the present time there are twenty-seven children attending Boarding Schools, eleven at Onion Lake, six at File Hills, one at Elkhorn, eight at Duck Lake and one at Qu'Appelle.\n\nCommissioner Graham forwarded the above under cover of his letter of February 19, 1926, and states:\n\n\"At the Mistawasis Day School the situation is unsatisfactory, and it is questionable whether the expense in keeping up this school is justifiable, especially now when these children could be sent on to Onion Lake.

I have been discussing the matter for some time past, and Mrs. Le Clair is giving up the school on May the 15th and is asking Inspector Murison to find her another appointment.\n\nWith this vacancy in Mistawasis in view, Mr. and Mrs Waite of Moose Lake have sent me in their resignation with a view to the appointment at Mistawasis on May the 15th.\n\nMr. Waite is a B.A. of Saskatchewan University and has his first class professional teacher certificate from the Saskatoon Normal School and had very good recommendations from his Inspectors for his work amongst the non-English speaking settlers before he began his Indian work. So that his appointment to Mistawasis on May the 15th ought to be a great help to that Reserve. I therefore have much pleasure in sending my nomination of him for Mistawasis School on May the 15th.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

I note your reference to the admission of Florence and Maria Bird, of the Reserve, to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. The application for these children, which was approved by Mr. Indian Agent Weir, stated that the religion was Roman Catholic. The Department, therefore, never questioned the matter.\n\nI doubt the advisability of reconsidering the closing of the Mistawasis Indian Day School.

At this time of the year the Carrot River is so low that canoe or motor launch is the only way to get there. Furniture or heavy goods can be taken.

The Mission work on the Reserve is in the hands of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. An ordained Missionary is in charge and service is regularly conducted in the Presbyterian Church on the Reserve.\n\nThere are at present on the Reserve fifteen Indian children of school age, and twenty-five who are below school age. For the past two years no school has been held on the Reserve.\n\nAs the Indian parents are anxious to have their children taught on the Reserve where they would be near their parents, the Missionary who is a fully qualified Public School teacher with Normal training, has opened a school in his home, with an enrolment already of thirteen pupils. In view of the desire of the parents and the number of children of school age, and also because of the fact that the Missionary is qualified to carry on the work, the Executive Board of the Women's Missionary Society (W.D.) of the Presbyterian Church in Canada respectfully request your Department to take into consideration the renewal of the grant formerly given by your Department to the school formerly carried on, on the Reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHelen M. Strachan\n\nOctober 28th, 1927.\nOttawa, November 2, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, urging the Department to allow a grant for the Mistawasis Indian Day School. I note that the missionary is conducting a school in his residence.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Indian Agent has recently reported there are but 11 Indian children of school age on the reserve. Of these, only 5 are in a position to attend regularly. This school was closed last year because of lack of attendance, and, in view of these facts, I regret favourable consideration to the application cannot be given at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. D. Strachan,\nEducational Secretary, W. M. S.,\nPresbyterian Church,\n103 Harland Smith Bldg.,\n320 Bay St.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMISTAWASIS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was opened on September 1st by the Rev. W. Moore, who has been appointed as missionary on this reserve by the Continuing Presbyterian Church. Mr. Moore's mother, who is 70 years of age or over, does the greater part of the teaching. She taught, she tells me, in the Portage la Prairie Boarding School 40 years ago.\n\nThe children are boarding at the school from Monday until Friday. Mr. Moore undertook to do this work if allowed the amount of the former teacher's salary, $840.00 per annum. This amount is furnished by the church. He tells me he receives some help from the people and has to bear the balance himself as he finds that $840.00 per annum does not nearly meet the expense. There were 7 boys and 8 girls in residence on the day of my visit.\n\nTwo small rooms, 14 x 14, with an 8 ft. ceiling, are used as dormitories. There are six single beds in each dormitory. The beds are very comfortable and are provided with springs, mattresses and counterpanes. In each room there is one wash basin and a separate towel for each child. These dormitories are separated by a room between them which is occupied by Mrs. Moore. Separate narrow stairways lead from each of these small dormitories downstairs, the girls' stairway terminating at the back entrance of the school. The boys' stairway lands in the room now used as a class room, and in order to get out of the building, they would have to pass through the class room and a cloakroom where there is a small heating stove installed. The main building is heated with a hot air furnace. A small gravity water tank is installed in the attic.\n\nThe dormitories do not provide sufficient air space for the number of children sleeping in them, and are, I feel, unsafe from a health standpoint. Mrs. Moore stated that she...\nMISTAWASIS DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nthat she could spare two more rooms, if necessary, to give more air space.\n\nThere is no fire fighting equipment in this building and if a fire should break out during the night time, it is very doubtful, in my opinion, if the children could be safely got out of the building. It looks like a fire trap to me, and I am reporting fully in connection with this matter as I do not know on whom the responsibility would rest if anything happened.\n\nI may mention that of the children in attendance, 4 are the children of non treaty halfbreeds. Of the children, 3 are 6, 5 are 7, 2 are 8, 1 is 9, 3 are 10 and 1 is 11 years of age. Of those attending, at least 7 are within reasonable walking distance of the school.\n\nI may say that two or three years ago, this band was in favour of closing up their day school and sending the children to boarding schools. I think they have been influenced in this new move by the missionary. In fact, the missionary takes the stand that it is through the children that they hope to get results from their work, and they are hoping to have the Department take over and assume the expense of the school. I was asked if I would recommend this, but did not give them any encouragement. I simply stated that I would report the facts to the Department as I found them.\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 23, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the five day schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's remarks in connection with the Mistawasis Day school, I think this is a decidedly bad arrangement to have children housed up in rooms of that size with no fire protection, and with no control over the feeding of them. The teacher cannot begin to feed, clothe and house children on the small amount he is receiving.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nJanuary 10, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Grant:\n\nThe Inspector of Indian Agencies reports that the missionary on the Mistawasis Indian Reserve is conducting a school in the teacher's residence. You will remember that permission to use this house as a missionary's residence was granted in official letter of July 30th, last. It appears that the Reverend Mr. Moore is caring for 15 children from Monday to Friday, and our officer reports that the dormitories do not provide sufficient air space for these. It is also stated that there might be extreme difficulty getting the children safely out of the building in the event of fire.\n\nOur experience with the Mistawasis Indian Day School is such that I cannot agree to allowing a grant for the activity at the present time. It is the opinion of our officials that the few children of school age of this reserve should be recruited for Indian residential schools.\n\nThe arrangements made by the Reverend Mr. Moore do not appear satisfactory and I should be grateful if you would so inform him and draw to his attention the fact that no permission for such an undertaking has been granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nGeneral Board of Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nRoom 121, Harland Smith Bldg.,\nToronto, 2, Ont.\nTORONTO 2, January 11th, 1928\n\nHon. Duncan C. Scott, Frsc., Litt. D.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 10th, and as far as our General Board is concerned we have not given any authority to our Missionary to carry on School work on the Mistawasis Reserve, and we have called his attention to the statement of your letter, objecting to having dormitories in the house that has been set apart for the Missionary, and also telling him that your recommendation is that these children should be recruited for some of the Boarding Schools. The W. M. S., I suppose, are the ones that are making application for a building for this purpose, but we have not taken any action in that matter, as far as our Board is concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nASG:W.\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been absent from Canada for four months on a visit to the Mission Fields of the Presbyterian Church in the Orient. On my return I found a little difficulty has arisen in regard to the Mistawasis Reserve. The facts are these:\n\nThis Reserve is in the hands of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Mission work is under the Church Board. There had formerly been a day school on the Reserve, which had been closed for two years. Rev. Mr. Moore and his mother are in charge of the Mission, and Mr. Moore being a qualified teacher, thought to reopen the day school, but found some of the children living too far away from the school and were too young to go and come each day. His house was big enough and his mother only too willing to have them stay all night. Accordingly, he wrote the Women's Missionary Society, under whose care all School work is, and they, seeing in it only an opportunity for service, agreed to lend the scheme their support. They sent in some supplies and then wrote the Department asking them to consider renewing the grant formerly given to the day school. There was no thought, I take it, to open a boarding school in the accepted sense, simply as the parents were anxious to have their young children go to school, to give them a day school and in addition care for those too young to come and go. I think perhaps our Board went the wrong way about this, but if so it was only through lack of knowledge of procedure, and quite unintentional. I regret if any mistake has occurred.\n\nI would like to ask if the Department is absolutely opposed to reopening a day school, letting those near the Mission come and go each day, and only those who are too far away and too young to come and go, remain with Mrs. Moore for the nights. Would the\ndepartment be opposed even should we ask no grant from them, provided the Indian Agent on the Reserve were satisfied that there was no overcrowding, &c.? If so, the matter will have to be dropped and I will tell the Rev. Mr. Moore so. These children are too young for the Indian Residential Schools and it does seem an opportunity.\n\nRegretting any mistake that may have been made,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Hall) Helen M. Maclean\nJanuary 27, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Weir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mrs. D.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nJanuary 27, 1928.\n\nDear Mrs. Strachan:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the school activity of the Reverend Mr. Moore on the Mistawasis Indian Reserve. Our experience with a day school there is such that I cannot ask Parliament to provide a grant. It is the opinion of our local officers that the few children of school age of the reserve should be recruited for residential schools.\n\nIn view of the recent report of one of our inspectors, I hesitate to give permission to Mr. Moore for the semi-boarding school activity that he is conducting. It is stated that the dormitories do not provide sufficient air space for the children in residence and that there might be extreme difficulty getting them safely out of the building in the event of fire. If the Reverend Mr. Moore wishes to hold a class in the building which he has been permitted to occupy, he may do so; but I have to request that children will not live there. The only exception that I can make would be in the case of a stormy evening, when three or four of the youngest pupils whose homes are distant might be allowed to remain over night.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMistawasis, Sask.,\nFeb. 2nd, 1928.\n\nThe Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, the Chief and Councillors of the Indians of the Mistawasis Band, take the liberty of writing you on behalf of the members of our band regarding matters in connection with our school here. It is of very great interest and importance to us that the school here be if at all possible re-opened.\n\nWe are aware that there has been considerable correspondence between your department and those who are endeavoring to help us have the Mistawasis School reopened. And it is with extreme regret that we learn of your refusal of permission for the use of the residence for the boarding of children wishing to attend school here, and also the refusal of a grant in order to make the carrying on of a day school possible.\n\nWe realize the validity of the reasons the Department had for closing the school formerly in operation here, viz., lack of sufficient children attending to make the required average, but we feel sure that should we be able to convince you that these reasons no longer operate your Department will accede to our request in this matter. That we can truly say that these reasons no longer exist...\nhere we hope to show by this communication.\n\nThat there are now sufficient pupils who can and will attend will be evident when we point out that though the Department had no school in operation, there were seventeen pupils of school age available, who were enrolled and attended classes held pending the decision of the Department. This temporary school was in steady operation from September last. The average was never less than nine for any month, and twelve or more most of the time.\n\nFormerly the Church in charge here seems to have had something to do with lack of interest in the school but that is no longer so and we feel that should a school be established on the Reserve the attendance will continue to be above the required number.\n\nIt is our belief that the best interests of the residents of this reserve can best be served by a school on the reserve, and that such a move on your part would be justified by the support the school would receive from the residents here.\n\nFor these and the added reason that, when the school was closed it was understood by us that when the number required was available, there would be no difficulty in having it reopened; we humbly beg on behalf of our band that this matter receive your attention and support.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nChief \u2014 [Signature]\nCouncillors \u2014 [Signatures]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We do not need to go into this question or the reasons for asking for the school, as we discussed that fully when I was in Ottawa. I spoke to my Board yesterday and they are willing to provide some sort of a van or conveyance to convey the children to and from school during the winter months.

I note that your Board is prepared to provide a conveyance to take the children to and from school during the winter months. I should be glad if you would let me know if the Rev. W.

The Chief has apparently misinformed her of the conversation I had with him regarding Mistawasis Day School. What I did mention was to the effect that I did not think the Department would object to four, or at the most six children residing with Mrs. Moore from Monday morning until Friday evening for the purpose of attending school, and who are living too far away to attend regularly. Children living within a reasonable distance of the school would have to return home each evening. If my suggestion meets with your approval, I would suggest that you write the Department direct, asking for authority for the number of children as above stated to reside with Mrs. Moore.\n\nTo date I have received no word from the Department regarding re-opening Mistawasis Day School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Signed) John Weir,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMrs. Helen M.

I hope this also meets with your approval, that I may write to Mistawasis that this can be done.\n\nIn regard to the Day School, in the personal interview with you by Mrs. Strachan, you arrived at the decision that we could open an improved day school on Mistawasis Reserve. In the pressure of affairs Mr. Weir has not yet heard that from you, but may have received this information since he wrote this letter to us. Would you kindly inform us as to whether you wish us to pay the full salary of the teacher, or will you pay, on behalf of the Government, part or all of it?\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Moore is carrying on this School for a few weeks until we get more definite word from the Department. We are seeking a teacher to carry on the work, probably from the end of October, or whenever we can find such a teacher, but did not feel like appointing a permanent teacher until Mr. Weir received notification in regard to the instructions which you gave Mrs. Strachan.\n\nThanking you very much,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. D.T.L.)

The Department is today writing to Mr. Indian Agent Weir, authorizing the Rev. Mr. Moore to keep three or four of the children over night, if their homes are distant and the weather is inclement. I cannot agree to any more than four or five remaining at any one time, as the air space is insufficient for more and there might be extreme difficulty getting a larger group out of the building in the event of fire.\n\nIf the Rev. Mr. Moore does the teaching, the Department will allow the usual grant to missionary teachers of $80 per teaching month, upon receipt, from the Indian agent, of quarterly returns showing a worthwhile attendance. If a fully qualified teacher is appointed solely for this work and there is a good average attendance of Indian children, a little larger salary could be granted - the amount to be determined by the qualifications of the one appointed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The Vicar making the presentation on behalf of the donors, spoke of Miss Harman's devoted and conscientious work in the Schools, and wished her God speed and every blessing in the new sphere of work to which she was going.

Moore, who is in charge of the Mistawasis Day School, from which you will note that assistance is asked to provide food for the children who attend. This school is, as you are aware, a Presbyterian institution which the Church authorities had the sanction of the Department to operate, and I commented on the conditions existing in my letter of the 23rd December, 1927, when forwarding Inspector W. Murison's report of a visit to the Carlton Agency. In acknowledging my letter and the accompanying report, under cover of your 107-5-1 of the 5th January, you stated that you were giving serious consideration to the situation at this point, but I do not appear to have received any further communication from you on the subject. It seems to me unwise to create a precedent by giving any grant to a school which is not exclusively under the direction and control of the Department. I am, however, forwarding the application which has been submitted so that a definite decision may be arrived at.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nA letter has come in from Mistawasis which has solved the mystery of the hauling of the logs. It seems that the Indians are planning, and are erecting a building to house those children for whom permission was given to keep them over night in the Mission house. We have every desire and wish to help these Indians in their laudable ambition to care for their children, but we are perplexed as to what should be done at this juncture. We had no knowledge of this being arranged, and do not know whether you had so notified them. We had written them most carefully that only the very limited number could be cared for from Monday to Friday, and that they must observe this ruling.\n\nThe President of our Board, Mrs. Strachan, and I, would like to go to Ottawa and confer with you about Mistawasis and one or two other matters, and would like to know if you could make an appointment with us for Thursday, the 29th November. We will arrive in the early morning, so that any time on Thursday would suit us. Should Thursday not suit you we would try and arrange for Friday, but Thursday is much more suitable for both of us. Could you make the appointment by wire to me as soon as possible?\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-1, part 1)\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, November 24, 1928.\n\nMrs. D.

A.\nNovember 29, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 303-114 of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication from the Missionary at the Mistawasis Reserve, concerning a building that is being erected and asking for an allowance for food supplies for children. I may say that I have had an interview with the President of the Board of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, and I find that they are somewhat in the dark as to the exact intention of the local people. I have asked Mr. Weir for a full report, and I should be glad also to have a recommendation from you.\n\nI find that on September 27th, when the Department authorized day school activity on the Mistawasis Reserve, you were, inadvertently, not notified. I authorized salary of $60.00 per teaching month and gave permission to the Rev. Mr. Moore to keep three or four of the children over night if their homes are distant and the weather is inclement. I added that not more than four or five should remain at one time, as the air space is insufficient for more, and further, there might be extreme difficulty getting a larger group out of the building in the event of fire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM.\nHIS NO. 303-11B dated November 29, 1928.\n\nOriginal on lll-l-10.\n\nMr. Moore's school, which, in my opinion, is not worthy of the name of a school and a mistake was made in the Department's recognizing it as such. In the opinion of the Inspector, Mr. Moore is not a man who is capable of conducting a school, to say nothing of the fact that they have not the facilities to carry on a school of any kind, and it seems to me the Department would be well advised to inform Mr. Moore that we are not going to let him take children from boarding schools, or interfere in any way with parents who have children in school.\n\nWill you kindly advise me what action the Department wish to take in connection with this matter, as I feel satisfied if the children are allowed to remain on the reserve and attend day school, parents of children from this and other reserves will want the same consideration.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for confirmation your telegram of the 29th ultimo\u2014\n\n\"Department has learned Indians are erecting building in connection with Mistawasis Indian Day School. Report by letter concerning type, size, and location of building its purpose and indicate who is responsible. Your views and recommendation.\"\n\nOn receipt of your telegram I visited the Rev. W. Moore, and find that a log building is under construction, the walls are up and ready to receive the roof. The building is to be constructed of logs, outside size approximately 20' x 18', which will make the inside of building about 19' x 17', with a 6' ceiling. The proposed building is situated about fifty yards from the Teacher's residence. As far as I have been able to ascertain the Indians of Mistawasis are erecting the building on their own responsibility.\n\nIt is the intention to use the lower portion of the building as a school room, and the upper floor as a dormitory for boys. The original school building has not been used for some considerable time as it was out of the question to put same in a good state of repair. I fail to see why the room in the Teacher's residence cannot be used for teaching, as was the case when Mrs. Leclair held the appointment. Mrs. Moore claims if she was teaching school it would be in order to hold school in the residence, though on account of having an outside teacher appointed it would not prove very satisfactory, and school is now being held in the Church.\n\nI do not know who is responsible for the feeling that is abroad amongst the Indians, but they appear to think that they are working towards the end of having a Presbyterian Boarding School on the reserve.\nPresbyterian Boarding School on the reserve.\n\nAs the Department only granted permission for four or five children to reside at Mistassini Day School, the Indians are endeavouring apparently by the erection of the proposed building to make room in order that their children may reside at school from Monday morning until Friday evening of each week.\n\nIn my opinion it may be in order to allow teaching in the proposed building when completed for a short time until other arrangements are made by the Department. I do not see that there is any necessity of allowing children to live at the school, with the exception of four or five children who live too far away from the school in order to attend regularly.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C.

I also note that you gave the Rev. Mr. Moore permission to take in three or four children over night if their homes are distant and the weather inclement.\n\nYou are aware that they are building a log house for the purpose of providing additional accommodation for the children. Of course, I think this is a very bad plan and should not be allowed by the Department. They have no control over the boys sleeping outside in the log house; there is a danger of fire, and it also would not be very hard for the pupils to escape from the school as there is only one man here and he sleeps in the other house.\n\nI may say that I had a delegation from the Presbyterian Indian Mission Board, Mrs. McAre and Mr. Moore, of Saskatoon, and they propose making a report on this matter which will be sent to you in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I have written to our officers, repeating the authority for an Indian day school, as indicated in my letter to you of September 27th, last. I have directed that children must not be housed in the log building the Indians have been constructing and have advised that work on it should be discontinued. If Mrs. Moore is to do the teaching, the class may be held in the teacher's residence; if another worker is engaged, in the church. I have also stated that the Department is not considering a boarding school on this reserve and that children who are, or should be, enrolled in one of our residential schools will not be allowed to remain on the reserve for the purpose of attending this day school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerroll,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lans St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nDecember 13, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Weir:\n\nI have your 1298-31-B of the first instant, regarding the log building which the Indians are erecting near the Mistawasis Indian Day School teacher's residence. You should at once inform the Rev. Mr. Moore and the interested Indians that the Department will not allow children to reside in this building and that they would be well advised to cease work on it. The Mistawasis Indian Day School should be conducted as at present, in the church building. The Rev. Mr. Moore may keep three or four of the school children over night in the teacher's residence, as authorized in official letter of September 27th, last. If Mrs. Moore, herself, is to do the teaching, it will be satisfactory if the class is conducted in the teacher's residence.\n\nIt should be clearly indicated to the Indians that the Department is not considering a boarding school for this reserve. Further, the children who are, or should be, enrolled at the Onion Lake, Duck Lake or File Hills Indian Residential Schools will not be allowed to remain on the reserve for the purpose of attending the day school there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nMr. W. M. Graham  \nCommissioner for Indian Affairs  \nRegina\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nKnowing that you have given much time and thought to the situation on the Mistawasis Reserve I beg to submit to you the following matters supplementing the matters contained in the longer letter that I enclose. The longer letter is addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs through you, as Indian Commissioner. I trust that this is the proper procedure. If the procedure is not correct will you give effect to the desire of the proposals made and speed forward the suggestions according to the proper method.\n\n(1) In order to know whether the Indians would endorse the proposals re the loan of the trust funds in the care of the Government I have submitted the proposal to them. On Sunday, Dec 16th the Chief and his Council unanimously agreed to the proposal that the government through the Indian department be authorized to make a loan of the necessary funds from these trust funds on the understanding that the government take advantage of the earliest opportunity to provide through the estimates for the securing of these funds in order to replace the money thus borrowed in the Indian Trust Fund account. This is a method of speeding up the work and meeting an urgent situation.\n\n(2) Chief Drever is willing that his children be replaced in the Onion Lake Boarding school of the Church of England till provision can be made to take care of them and others like them on the Mistawasis reserve along the line suggested in the letter enclosed. He makes the request that they be allowed to remain at home till after the Christmas holidays. As the holidays are almost here I imagine that there will be no difficulty in this connection. The chief has shown a good spirit in this matter and is ready to co-operate in every way in order to meet the need that he and the other Indians feel for the education of their children under the care of the Presbyterian church.\n\n(3) Mrs J. W. Moore who has been for many years on this reserve as a missionary assures me that accommodation for approximately 12 children in the readjusted present building will meet the need for the present and for many years to come and in her judgment is a better solution than the building of a large boarding school under present conditions. After having visited the school, the Indians, and gone carefully into the matter this is the way it appears to me.\n\nIt seems to me that this is all that need be added to the longer letter in the way of supplementary information.\n\nWith the best of good wishes and trusting to hear a favourable report, and with the seasons greetings, Yours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Brown\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nper Mr. W. M. Graham, Commissioner for Indian Affairs\nRegina\n\nGentlemen:\n\nA situation has arisen on the Mistawasis reserve in this Province about which I would like to write you in some detail. My own position is that of minister of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church, Saskatoon, and convenor of the Committee that has charge of all the mission work of the Presbyterian Church within this Province.\n\nOur missionary on the reserve is the Rev. William Moore who is a graduate of the University of Saskatchewan and graduate of the Provincial Normal school. Associated with him is his mother, Mrs. J. W. Moore who with her husband, was in charge of the missionary work on this reserve for a period of probably twenty-five years. At the present time there is a qualified teacher recently sent out by the Women's Missionary society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada whose headquarters are in Toronto, the President of the Society being Mrs. H. M. Strachan.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve are very strong in their convictions and are most earnest in their desire to have their children brought up in the Presbyterian Faith.\n\nOn this reserve, as you know, is a large frame building with large rooms for bedrooms, a full size basement and appears to be in a good state of repair. Last year an inspector of the department visited this reserve and made an inspection of this building. I ought to have said that the Presbyterian Church made an application to your department for a boarding school on this reserve in 1927. Our representatives reported that they had been told that this was possible at this present time, but it was agreed that we should have an approved day school and certain children were to be allowed to be taken in residence in this large frame building. Mr. Moore was then the teacher of the school. The inspector found that the children were too much crowded in their sleeping rooms, that there was not suitable protection in case of fire and certain other defects I understand.\n\nThe zeal of the Indians is now seen in the fact that they have set to work and built a log school house with sleeping accommodation for the boys upstairs and I understand that Mrs. Moore and the new teacher will be allowed to accommodate some of the girls in the large frame building in which the Moores and the teacher now live.\n\nThe children of the Chief George Drever and of William Drever his son were at the church of England school at Onion Lake last year. This year some of these children were sent to the File Hills school of the United Church. As I have already said this does not meet the earnest desire of the Indians who are most anxious to have their children brought up in their own faith. Their building of the log school house being an indication of this desire. Outside of the reserve we did not know of the building of this log school house. It does not seem to me to meet the situation.\n\nMay I just make this general observation. In the distribution of general property between the United Church of Canada and the Presbyterian Church in Canada the Presbyterian Church received, what I can only describe as a very raw deal. I will not enlarge on this nor are we going to sit down and whine about it. The condition of the Birtle school and the stripped condition of the Mistawasis reserve are sufficient evidence of the above. If we may have, as we have every reason to believe that we have, the sympathetic help of the department we intend to do some real work for our Indian fellow citizens.\n\nNow for some suggestions.\n\n(1) The large frame building lends itself I feel certain, as I have carefully examined it, to certain easily carried out repairs that will make it adequate to meet the needs of an approved day school with residence and adequate protection from fire for\na limited number of children and for all that this reserve is likely to need for a good many years. The number in residence need not be more than 10 or 12 so that it would not require more than the present staff to handle the work.\n\n(2) Provision could be made to give all the children who come to the school their mid day meal.\n\n(3) A suitable well ought to be provided without any further delay as it is now necessary for the people at the mission to bring all their drinking water from the agency which is about one mile distant. A good many years ago Mrs. Moore says that there was a suitable well with abundance of good water near the present mission buildings but for some reason it has been filled up and is of no use. This however indicates that water is probably available without great difficulty.\n\n(4) The Indians feel that even if no provision has been made in the estimates for such repairs as above suggested that there is a large fund at the command of the department for the service of this band made available through the sale of lands. They are willing if no funds are available through the regular estimates to authorize your department to borrow the necessary funds from this reserve fund to carry out these repairs in an adequate way and at the first opportunity you could secure the funds from the approved estimates and repay the loan to this reserve fund for the special benefit of the Indians.\n\n(5) In the case of the Drever children I understand that it is part of the procedure of the department that Indian children must be properly discharged from a school where they have been registered. In this case the Drever children should be properly discharged from the Onion Lake School. If you could undertake the above program after it was fully examined by some of your representatives, I believe that the Indians might agree to leave their children at Onion Lake till these repairs could be carried out if they were sure it would be done at the earliest date that would be reasonable, and when the accommodation was ready on their own reserve all their children could be handled on their own reserve.\n\nIf you could see your way to meet a situation that has caused the Indians a good deal of distress in such a way as has been suggested I believe that you will meet a real need and do a real service and in the work you will have the heartiest co-operation of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) W.

She leaves for her position on Tuesday, the 20th, and we expect that the Day School will be in full operation shortly after her arrival. She is well qualified for this work, holding second class professional certificates, having had many years' experience and having also been in charge of arranging noon luncheons in a rural school for a period of time. Her references and credentials are very good, and we are pleased to be able to report her appointment.\n\nMay I ask you if the $60.00 a month which you spoke to us about in regard to salary, is for ten months of the year or for twelve months. We shall be glad if you will send us this information. Also, does the Government supply any needed text books for the children, or do we have to do that?\n\nIn a letter which I had from Mr. Moore of Mistawasis, he mentions the Indians hauling logs for a building. No request has gone to the Reserve from Toronto for any building. Can you tell me if you have any knowledge of what this is for, as the letter I wrote inquiring has not yet been replied to, and we are wondering if the Government has asked that a School house or any other building should be built?\n\nThanking you for your interest,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

For some time, the Department had seriously considered discontinuing the activity on account of the poor attendance. On March 22, of that year, the Department wrote to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that, as from June 30th, the school would remain closed indefinitely. One week later, the Department received a letter from His Lordship, which had crossed ours, recommending a change of teachers on May 15th.

This would make a more uniform system for our bookkeeping, as now we send the cheque and Miss Mcqueen then has to return the Department's cheque to us, in order that her salary may pass through our books as well as the Department's.\n\nThanking you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nOttawa, April 12th, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI am direct to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to salary of Miss McQueen, teacher of the Mistawasis Indian Day School.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Moore from Mistawasis writes me that cheques have been reaching him from the Department for $75.00, marked April salary. May I ask if the cut has not applied to his salary? May I also enquire why a change has been made in the policy without notifying the Secretary here in that a cheque for salary has been sent direct instead of through me as Secretary of the Department? It may be that this has been an oversight or it may be a change of policy. Please send me information regarding the matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, Indian Department.\n\nMCM/MR\nOttawa, June 25th, 1934.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, I beg to say that, beginning in April, 1934, the Department is paying the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools monthly. I may, also, add that present regulations require that salaries of teachers be paid direct.\n\nOwing to the fact that the 10% deduction on salaries does not now affect those earning less than $1,000 a year, Reverend Mr. Moore is being paid his full salary of $750.\n\nI regret that you were not previously informed of these new arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerroll,\nWomen's Missionary Society\nof the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\n19 Laws St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWould you be kind enough to let me know the exact amount of salary sent to Mr. W.W. Moore, of Mistawasis, Saskatchewan. I would be obliged for an early reply.\n\nThanking you,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Mrs. D.H.) Mary C. McKee\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nOttawa, April 17, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, Rev. W. W. Moore is being allowed salary at the rate of $750 a year as teacher at the Mistawasis Indian Day School. Payment is made on the basis of ten teaching months in the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

It is noted that you state if you would get a well digging outfit to set up over the present well in order to clean same out that perhaps water could be obtained at very little expense, or it might turn out to be a dry hole, and if it would be necessary to dig a new well the approximate cost would be $129.50 for labour and lumber.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I would recommend that the services of a well digger be obtained and have him put his outfit over the present well in order to clean same out and endeavour to obtain water. If water was obtained by this method the cost would be small. However, if the hole proved to be dry, it would mean that a new well would have to be sunk at an approximate cost of:\n\nLabour $77.50\nLumber $52.00\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, in further reference to the well at the Mistawasis Indian Day School. In view of your recommendation, I have to say that you may arrange for the services of a well digger to clean out and deepen the present well. If, after this work on the present well has been completed, and a supply of water has not been obtained, you should report the matter to the Department before undertaking the drilling of a new well. All cost should be kept as low as possible. If water is obtained, and any new pump or extra pipes are required, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of same. The Department desires that an adequate water supply be provided for the use of this school at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I have had a well digger cut and it is impossible to obtain water in the old well. The cribbing is rotten and the sides are caving in all the time.

The Department will approve of your arranging to have the new well drilled, and it is hoped that an ample supply of water can be obtained without it being necessary to drill to a great depth. The cost should, if possible, not exceed your estimate of $140, including labour and lumber. Should a new pump and any new pipe be required, you may arrange for the purchase of same. You should see that the new well is properly cribbed in order to prevent surface drainage and a pump installed and the well placed in good working condition. If not too late this season to have this work carried out, I have to request that you will make immediate arrangements to have the well drilled.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Moore, the Presbyterian Minister, in charge, and was informed by him that the church authorities had recommended his appointment in place of Miss McQueen, who, I understand, taught last year and rendered excellent service.\n\nThis school was closed for a number of years, and when opened again, it was necessary to fix up the children's dining room, which is in the teacher's residence, for a classroom. The old log school was beyond repair. Mr. Moore and his mother have resided in the teacher's residence since his appointment four years ago as Missionary. Mrs. Moore provides the noon-day meal for the children, the requirements for which, I understand, are supplied by the church.\n\nThe present classroom is too small and has practically no available room for blackboard. The room is also insufficiently lighted and poorly ventilated. A new classroom is required, but I doubt if the cause\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMISTAWASIS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nif the cause, at the present time, justifies the expense of a new building. Above the present classroom are dormitories, originally built to accommodate the children at night during the week. At small cost, the partitions might be removed, giving a room 18x30, which room can be heated along with the residence, of which it forms a part.\n\nThe roll calls for 13 pupils, and all were present. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 9\n\" II - 2\n\" III - 2\n\nThe children appeared somewhat shy, and I was not greatly impressed with the work as presented by Mr. Moore. The children were clean and tidy in appearance, and in most cases, fairly well clothed.\n\nOne of the toilets is in need of repair, the board fence separating the two should be re-built. Mr. Moore could not even inform me which was the boys' toilet, so I judged he took little interest in the affairs of the school.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Carlton Agency, which was made by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nYou will note what he says regarding a new classroom on the Mistawasis Reserve. I do not think the Department would be warranted in spending anything at this school, as the time will come when these children should be removed to boarding schools.\n\nThe report on the Little Red River Day School is not very encouraging.\n\nI quite agree with the Inspector that it would be out of the question to provide vans to haul the children to the Ahtahtakoops Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, who recently visited the Mistawasis Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of one of the toilets. He states that it is badly in need of repair, and that the board fence separating the two toilets should be replaced.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the toilets at this school thoroughly cleaned out and placed in a good state of repair. You should also have the fence separating these two closets rebuilt. No unnecessary expense should be incurred by you in having this work carried out, and it should be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nAfter these repairs have been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-5-5 of the 22nd inst. granting authority to have toilets at the Mistawasis Indian Day School repaired.

In the past I have withheld asking for new desks as I thought perhaps a new school would be built as we certainly require a new building. However if a new school is out of the question on account of economic conditions I would suggest that desks be purchased if funds are available.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 18, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will ship, charges prepaid, addressed to Mr. John Weir, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask., the following New Empire Sanitary Single School Desks:\n\n6 No. 4 Single Desks,\n6 No. 5 \" \"\n6 No. 6 \" \"\n\nThe desks should be shipped knocked down, and ink wells should be supplied with the No. 4 desks.

The above firm have been requested to forward to you their account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the desks F.O.B. Leask, Sask., sales tax included. When you receive the desks, if in good condition, you should certify the account and send same, in duplicate, to the Department, retaining one copy on file in your office. The desks are to be shipped knocked down, and ink wells are to be supplied with the No. 4 size. When the desks arrive, you should arrange to have them take to the school, assembled and set up in the classroom. Any expenses in this connection will be paid upon receipt of a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of two brooms.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher requests that 75' of rope and a windlass be provided for the well, but that a pump is preferred. I shall be pleased to have an estimate of the cost of installing a pump and suitable cover over the well. You should also state whether you would recommend that this work be carried out, or if you consider the present conditions are satisfactory you may purchase the quantity of rope required, also a new windlass and have same installed.\n\nPlease report regarding the need for a wheelbarrow, as the Department does not usually supply this type of equipment for Indian schools. The pencils and scribblers will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be sent to the teacher's address.\n\nI may add that the Department will have no funds to provide a new building at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This matter was only brought to my attention ten days ago. If a new furnace is authorized the cost will be approximately $280.00, as it is a very large building to heat. If furnace has to be replaced I wish you would wire me instructions as work should be undertaken before severe weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, September 28, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant, recommending that a new furnace be supplied for use at the Mistawasis Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department is referring this matter to Mr. Inspector Murison for a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, September 28th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask., reporting that a new furnace is required at the Mistawasis Indian Day School. He states that the cost will be, approximately, $250., as it is a very large building and it is necessary that the furnace be of sufficient size to adequately heat the building.\n\nI would request that you make inquiries regarding this matter and inform the Department if it would not be possible to repair the present furnace at a minimum cost in order to place it in satisfactory condition for the coming winter's use or if it would be necessary to provide a new furnace. In the latter event, full particulars should be given as to the size and type of furnace required and the cost of same installed. You should, also, state whether you have a firm on the approved list that could supply the furnace and install same.\n\nI may add that we have no funds specially provided for the purchase of a new furnace and, unless same is urgently required, favourable consideration cannot be given to authorizing the expenditure.\n\nYour early attention to the above matter is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-5-5, dated September 28th, with reference to the request of Indian Agent Davis that a new furnace be installed at the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to advise you that I am familiar with the condition of this furnace and I am satisfied that it is burned out and should be replaced. It was installed twenty-four years ago and has already served for some years beyond the natural life of a furnace. The Mistawasis, Sandy Lake, and Sturgeon Lake School residences were all built the same year and had the same type of furnace installed. The Sandy Lake furnace was replaced in 1926 and the Sturgeon Lake in 1927, both being burned out. The Mistawasis furnace I consider no longer safe.\n\nThe type of furnace I would recommend is a wood furnace of 40,000 cubic feet capacity. This is similar to the furnaces installed at Sturgeon Lake and Sandy Lake and they have proved quite satisfactory. The cost, installed, is about $280.00. The M. and P. Plumbing Company of Prince Albert are on the approved list, and they were the firm who installed the furnaces at Sandy Lake and Sturgeon Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 303-11A of the 3rd instant, regarding the installation of a new furnace at the Mistawasis Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that the present furnace is burned out and that you recommend that a new wood furnace, of 40,000 cubic feet capacity, be installed, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a furnace, of the type mentioned, from a firm on the approved list - the price charged to include installation. I enclose encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $280 for the purchase and installation of the new furnace.\n\nAfter the furnace has been installed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. On each copy of the account, you should state that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 2533.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nW.

It will take about $15.00 to repair building which Mr. Moore is using for a school, though for your own information building in question does not belong to the Department which is one put up years ago by the Indians who intended to use it for boarding some children though which scheme the Department would not approve.\n\nI see no reason why Mr. Moore cannot use room which had been used as a school room during tenure of Mrs. McCleir, but as soon as Mr. Moore took charge he moved children into log building which is now used as a school. When Dr. McGill visited here this summer I was given the impression that it was his intention to have room in residence used as a class room this I think would be preferable to the building now in use for a school room. At present there are about fifteen children attending school but the majority are made up of halfbreed children and not members, last quarter there was only an average of 4.47 and I do not think that the Department should be called upon to educate these children which means additional expense regarding stationery etc.,\n\nIt would take about $15.00 to repair old building if work is undertaken. If this amount was spent on School Residence room I think we could manage to get through winter before making extensive repairs as suggested by Dr. McGill last summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 28, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the request of the teacher of the Mistawasis Indian Day School, that repairs, to an amount of approximately $15.00, be carried out to the building which is now being used for school purposes and which is not the property of the Department.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is considered that classroom activities should be carried on in the room formerly used for this purpose in the residence, which, it is understood, would be preferable to the building now used for that purpose. It is noted that the majority of the children attending are half-breeds and are not members of the Band. The Department cannot approve of the expenditure of $15.00 to repair the old building, but, if an expenditure to that amount is required to fix up a classroom in the school residence, you may incur the expense. If repairs in fitting up classroom in residence are undertaken, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost - which should be kept within the amount authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The average attendance for the month to date was 5.3. I remained for some time in the classroom and watched the teacher at his work. I questioned some of the children and found that they answered my questions readily. They spoke up quite audibly when reading and appeared to be making progress in their work. The Reverend William Moore is the teacher. I found conditions rather better than on my previous visit.\n\nThe classes are being held in the wing attached to the school residence. This room is not ideal for a classroom, but it is considerably better than the log building which they have been using. The lighting could be improved upon by adding more windows. They are short of blackboard space. The blackboard in use is small and practically worn out. I would recommend that they be provided with Hyplate blackboard 14 feet long, which could be placed at the end of the room and would be much easier on the pupils' eyesight than the board now in use which is placed at the side of the room.\n\nThe school residence on this Reserve was built along the lines of the residence at Sturgeon Lake and Sandy Lake Reserves. It is provided with a wing with dormitories upstairs and a kitchen with the intention of using it as a semi-residential school. With a few alterations, I think the classroom could be made to serve the purpose very well and it would be unnecessary to put up a new building for classroom purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\nOttawa, March 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Murison's report regarding his visit to the Mistawasis Indian Day School on the 23rd ultimo. He states that the lighting of the room in which the classes are held could be improved by adding more windows. Please let me know what expenditure would be required in carrying out the Inspector's recommendation.\n\nMr. Murison also recommends that a new blackboard, 14' long, be provided. An order for this is being placed with the Government Stationery Office, and, on receipt, you should arrange for its installation in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.,\nApril 16th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 107-5-5 of the 8th ultimo re Inspector Murison's report regarding Mistawasis Indian Day School. Mr. Moore has been using an old log building for a school room though last winter he moved into a room which had been formerly used for teaching purposes in the Teacher's Residence, and it was my intention to ask the Department to have the proper lighting etc., attended to during holidays. To do this work it will cost $50.00 including interior decorating of school room.\n\nLabour will be approximately $15.00\nMaterial $25.00\n\nI would also point out that a new chimney is required and beyond repair. Same will cost installed $55.00\n\nBuilding should also be painted outside I am given to understand that this building was painted last about 1916, cost would be about:\n\nMaterial $75.00\nLabour $50.00\n\nFence is in bad state of repair and will cost about $15.00 for posts and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, April 25, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to certain repairs required at the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may have the necessary repairs made to improve the lighting of the room in which the classes are held. It is noted that the cost of this, including interior decoration of the schoolroom, will be $50.\n\nYou may also supply a new cistern at a cost of $55, and have the fence repaired at a cost of $15.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the amount required for painting the exterior of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJune 4th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn a recent visit to the Mistawasis Indian Day School residence, I found the basement walls windows and verandah in a very bad state of repair. It will take about $50.00 to make temporary repairs and if funds are available I would recommend that said repairs be undertaken during holidays.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, June 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, reporting on the condition of the basement walls, windows and verandah of the teacher's residence at the Mistawasis Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may incur an expenditure, not exceeding $50, in making repairs - the work to be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter dated April 25th, last, authorizing certain repairs to the day school building. You should have all this work done, having as much of the labour as possible carried out by the Indians, during the holidays. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials required, from firms on the approved list, obtaining accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. Accounts, in triplicate, for the labour, should also be kept, showing the days or hours employed and the rate paid. All these accounts should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nThe Department will leave these repairs in your hands, to be carried out at the least possible expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-5, part 3)\nI beg to report that Indian Agent Davis overlooked inserting in his Estimates for 1937-38 an item to provide for a new day school building on the Mistawasis Reserve, Carlton Agency.\n\nI may say that the old school building has been abandoned, as it had served its usefulness. Classes are being held in one of the rooms of the teacher's residence, which is altogether unsuitable for this purpose. I would strongly recommend that the sum of $2,900.00 be inserted in the Estimates for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Robertson, D.D.S.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 303-7B of the 15th instant, recommending the erection of a new school on the Mistawasis Reserve.\n\nThe necessity of erecting a new school will be kept in mind but I regret that, at the present time, the prospects of building this school during the coming summer are rather remote. This is due to the fact that strict orders were received to keep our appropriation to the same amount as the current year and, as the matter stands now, no provision has been made for the erection of day schools during the coming summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThos.

She hoped that in future more food would be supplied in order to give the children a fair mid day meal.\n\nShe also mentioned that she was hiring a woman at $20.00 per month, to look after their own home, which is next door to the school. She suggested that this woman prepare and serve the mid day meal to the children, which would take up about half of her time, and the department pay half of her salary, namely $10.00 per month for the ten teaching months, for this service.\n\nI made no promises to Miss Moore, other than to say I would bring the matters to your attention.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nAhlatakwoop - 39 Pupils\nLast Year Middle Meals $80.00\n\nMistamasis - 29 Pupils\nLast Year $50.00\n\nNo Biscuits on Order for either School\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the supplying of midday lunches at the Indian Day Schools in the Carlton Agency it has been decided to allow the following amounts for the academic year 1938-39:\n\nSturgeon Lake Day School .................. $50.00\nMistawasis \" \" ........................... 60.00\nBig River \" \" ............................ 50.00\nLittle Red River \" \" ...................... 50.00\nMontreal Lake \" \" ........................ 60.00\nAhtahkakoops \" \" .......................... 60.00\n\nIn checking the amounts allowed in previous years it was noted that Ahtahkakoops received more than any of the other schools.

Any other procedure would involve extra work for which present regulations do not permit us to pay and special equipment which is not available in day schools.\n\nWith this in mind it is felt that the amounts authorized for midday lunches at the schools in your Agency in official letter of September 16, 1938 are adequate with the possible exception of the Montreal Lake School where, I understand, the attendance at the present time is somewhat larger than it was in past years. If you consider it necessary you may increase the amount at Montreal Lake from $60.00 to $90.00.\n\nIn forwarding accounts you should send a separate account for each school and I am, therefore, returning your voucher No. 482 in order that you may comply with these instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-5, part 3)\nLeask, Sask.,  \nJan 31st 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the new school for the Mistawasis Reserve as outlined in your letter of January 10th, file 107-5-5; this school is very badly needed. The residence that is now used for the teacher is a very poor building and one that I would not consider worth spending much money on for repairs.\n\nA single class room, about 26 x 30, would be about the right size, having a full basement that should be used for vocational training. I am returning the form which was enclosed with your letter containing the information desired. You will note that I have recommended that the school be built by contract, the reason being that it would be impossible for me to supervise the work if done by day labour owing to possible interference from Rev. Moore, the teacher, and his relatives.\n\nHowever, I would like to suggest that the present office of this Agency be utilized for this school, the cost of altering same would be about $300.00, and that the present residence of the Agent be used as a residence for the teacher. At the present time this Agency office is located in a very poor place from an administration and economical viewpoint having been placed here years ago when the nearest railway was Duck Lake or Prince Albert. The office and staff could be moved to Prince Albert and occupy offices in the Federal Building, which point is the most logical and offers better train service and would save miles of unnecessary driving in order to meet trains and make connections. Further any supplies that have to be reshipped could be distributed more economically and easier from Prince Albert, instead of paying the freight to Leask and then back over the same lines.\n\nIf the above suggestion does not meet with your approval, would the Department consider taking down the present teacher's residence and building a smaller cottage. Some of the lumber could be used on the new building. The present residence is a big barn like structure containing 14 rooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently the Department wrote to Indian Agent Davis in order to obtain information required in connection with the proposal to erect, during the coming summer, a new day school on the Mistawasis Reserve. For your information I enclose a copy of his reply.\n\nI have discussed the suggestion contained in the third paragraph of Indian Agent Davis' letter with the Superintendent of Indian Agencies who is definitely opposed to transferring the Agency headquarters to Prince Albert and consequently it is unnecessary to comment further on this matter.\n\nI wish, however, to direct your special attention to the second paragraph of Mr. Davis' letter. When you last visited Ottawa I believe that you stated that there was at least one Indian on the Mistawasis Reserve who was fully capable of supervising the erection of a school. With this in mind I am writing to you for your comments as you will note the reason that Mr. Davis gives for recommending the erection of the school by contract.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRegina, February 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 107-5-5 of February 9th,\nSchool, Mistawasis Reserve.\n\nI have again discussed this matter with Mr. Davis.\n\nWhen in Ottawa, I recommended that the old building be dismantled and a school and teacherage built, using the material contained in the old school. Mr. Davis informs me that the old building, which is a very large one, was constructed to a large extent of short ends of lumber, a surplus from the other buildings; that while quite a large amount of this lumber could be salvaged and used in a new building, the amount is problematic.\n\nIt is now my opinion that we should build a new school, allowing the old building to stand for the present and using it for a teacher's residence until such time as money is available to build a teacherage.\n\nAs I stated when in Ottawa, the Chief of the Mistawasis Band is a first-class carpenter, and there are other fairly good workmen on the Reserve. In discussing this with Mr. Davis, I pointed this out to him and he did not hesitate to admit that the school could be built by the Indians. He, however, feared interference on the part of the teacher. I informed him that he was the Agent and would be held responsible for building, consequently I could not see why he could not carry this work on, and I instructed him to prepare a sketch of the proposed school, together with an estimate of the cost, and submit same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

This plan is similar to the one used in building a white day school at Birch Hills, and is approved by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nMr. Davis points out that these figures are only estimates. It is his opinion it could be built for less than $3,000.00. It will be noted he estimates $600.00 for Indian labour and $400.00 for outside or white labour. As stated before, the Chief of Mistawasis is a good carpenter, and in addition there are several others. Mr. Davis, however, points out that when it comes to the finishing, the Indians are very slow workers, and it would be more economical to employ a white man on this work.\n\nMr. Davis asks that this plan be returned to him as it has only been borrowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\n303-11A.\n\nOttawa, March 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the new day school that the Department intends to erect this summer on the Mistawasis reserve.\n\nI have showed the plans which you forwarded, to our Engineering Branch and it is considered that from a plan prepared by us a building could be erected at as reasonable a cost as from the plan you submitted. The plans of the building that we would forward to you would provide for two doors, one into each cloakroom. It appears from the plan which you forwarded that all persons going into the school would have to enter through the boys' cloakroom. This is a minor matter, but I am inclined to feel that two entrances are preferable. Possibly a slight alteration could be made in the plan which you forwarded in order to provide for two doors.\n\nI note that your plan provides seating accommodation for only 30 children. If the figures appearing in the last census return are correct, it would appear that when building the school we should provide accommodation for 35 children, as the census figures indicate that the school population should increase. You might discuss this matter with Indian Agent Davis and let me know whether he agrees.\n\nAs you are aware, present regulations provide that purchases over fifty dollars be made by\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nEncl\nour Purchasing Branch. From the information contained on the requisition forwarded by Indian Agent Davis, it is evident that he has secured prices from several firms. Please let me know the names of the firms from whom the prices were obtained. The plan which you forwarded is returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRv. S. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 11, 1939.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Wardle\n\nRe: Indian Day School,\nMistawasis Reserve, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the last instant regarding the building proposed for the above, I am forwarding herewith, in duplicate, a sketch plan (see attached) of a building of the type which will provide the accommodation requested, namely, one classroom to seat 36 pupils with full basement.\n\nYou will note, however, that the classroom shown on this plan is for 40 pupils. I may say that a variation of 5 pupils can readily be made by eliminating one row of seats and reducing the length of the classroom by 2'6\". I would be pleased, therefore, to be advised whether accommodation for 35 pupils will be satisfactory in place of the 36 requested. If not, it is recommended that a building of the size shown be erected.\n\nThe cost of the building providing accommodation for forty pupils is estimated at about $5,100.00, and for 35 pupils at about $4,800.00.\n\nWill you kindly forward these sketch plans to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration and if the layout, as shown, is satisfactory, request them to return one set of the plans, duly signed as approved, to this office for our records.\n\nEncs.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 14, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe: Mistawasis Indian Day School, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am forwarding, herewith, a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, together with sketch plan in duplicate (Scheme A) of a building of the type which will provide the accommodation requested.\n\nYou will note that the plan provides for forty pupils, and that the estimated cost is $5100. If you consider the size which will accommodate thirty-five pupils is sufficient, the cost would be $4800.\n\nWill you kindly look over this plan and, if satisfactory, return one set duly signed.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Mistawasis Indian Day School\n\nI have your memorandum of March 14 in connection with the above enclosing sketch plan in duplicate of a building which will provide the accommodation requested in my memorandum of February 24.\n\nSince writing to you on February 24 Dr. Thos. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, has submitted an alternative proposal in connection with the erection of a school at this point.\n\nWe have written to him for further particulars and as soon as his reply is received I will communicate further with you.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 107-5-5 of March 15th,\nDay School, Mistawasis.\n\n---\n\nMr. Davis, Agent, advises that Mr. Moore, the teacher, has about 21 children on his register at the present time and an average attendance of 14. It is his opinion that a school room for 30 children would be large enough. If more space was needed later, the basement could be used for cloakroom space, thus giving more room in the classroom.\n\nMr. Davis also advises that he did not ask for prices from any firms and that the Department should be able to receive lower prices than those quoted in the Requisition. The West Lumber Company at Leask supplied him with a list of material that would be required for the proposed school.\n\nWith regard to the engineer's statement that they could erect a building at about the same cost, he states he is not able to dispute this matter, but he feels quite sure that if it was built by contract it would not be so well built.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/File\nOttawa,\nApril 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the proposed erection of a new school on the Mistawasis Indian Reserve.\n\nA recommendation is being forwarded to the Honourable the Minister that this school be built by day labour under the general supervision of the Indian Agent. As soon as I have the Minister's approval I will advise you.\n\nThe materials included on the purchase requisition forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of March 8 will be ordered by the Purchasing Branch with the exception of the furnace. More detailed information will have to be supplied in order to permit us to secure exactly what is needed.\n\nMr. Davis estimated the cost of Indian labour at $600.00 and white labour at $400.00. As soon as I am aware of the name and address of the foreman, brick layer and plasterer that will be required I will advise you.\n\nThe 65 yards of gravel may be purchased from Indians.\n\nThe building to be erected should follow the plans submitted by Mr. Davis and forwarded for our consideration in your letter of March 8. This plan was returned to you in my letter of March 15.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nFrom previous correspondence in connection with this school the Department was under the impression that it was the intention to erect it close to the present school. Recently it was brought to my attention that there was a movement to erect it on some other location. Possibly this information is incorrect but I should like to have your assurance on the matter as the Department feels that the proper place to erect this school is close to the present school. Please let me hear from you in this matter at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I do not know whether this has been the practice in the past, but it is my opinion that day schools and day school residences should be on Indian or Government property and that when a new school is erected at Mistawasis it should be so located.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThos.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 616-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for materials for a new well at the Mistawasis Indian Day School. The present well, which is 80 feet deep, is dried up. It is only 30\" square which makes it impossible to allow a man to work in it. Further the cribbing is in very poor shape and in a dangerous condition.\n\nAs this well cannot be repaired the only alternative is to build a new one. The proposed well would have to be at least 90 feet deep, and possible 100 ft., and 4 feet square. I have included the amount of $200.00 in the requisition to cover the cost of labour in digging and cribbing this well. If a well digging machine was employed it might be a little cheaper to dig the well but it would only be 30\" square and so it would be impossible to clean it out when required or to dig further down when it dried up. The most satisfactory job is accomplished by digging the well by ordinary labour.\n\nThere is no water supply at this school at the present time so that it is imperative that this well be completed as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 27, 1939.\n\nEXD.\nA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant you may arrange for digging a new well at the Mistawasis Indian day school. It is noted that an amount of $200.00 will be required to pay for Indian labour in digging and cribbing the well.\n\nYou may purchase from a firm on the approved list the spruce lumber and the keg of nails.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

His Lordship also states that Mr. Louis Ahenakew wishes to resign as teacher of the Big River School just as soon as he can be replaced.\n\nHis Lordship has been informed that the Department considers it advisable that the Big River and Montreal Lake schools should be closed at the end of this quarter at the latest and that, if Mr. Ahenakew wishes to leave before then, he may do so.\n\nAs you are aware, the Mistawasis school is not now in operation.\n\nThe Bishop has been requested to inform Mr. Settee and Mr. Ahenakew that it has been decided to close these schools.\n\nHis Lordship has also been informed that the department will be prepared to re-open these schools when he is in a position to secure suitable teachers and that a salary of $700.00 per annum will be allowed to teachers with the necessary qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. A. Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMontreal Lake Reserve\n\nSir - We just got word from the Bishop of Sask. telling us that the Indian Department is going to close our School (Dec. 31). Since the undersigned are writing to say that we don't wish the Department to take such action. Mr. Settee our present teacher is doing well enough considering the amount of work he has to do every day. Under present conditions the Department should consider that it is not so easy to find a man that can do any better than Mr. Settee. To tell you the truth, Mr. Settee is doing good work, and all the Indians like him. He can speak both languages and that is the kind of man we like to have in our midst. Of course we don't mean to tell you that the children are have a first class qualification, and the reason is that it is impossible for the Indians to keep their families on the reserve. They have to leave for hunting grounds and take their children away. The only way it could be done to get satisfaction is to have a place of residence for the pupils where they could be by their parents to attend School. So we request the Department to change their plans and not to close the School. It is not right for any Department to take such action and to put Mr. Settee in such a position this time of year after him being so faithful to the work for so many years.\n\nSigned: William Bird\nPatrick Bird\nDuncan Bird\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on 160370-26F, Sask.\n\nMy sphere of labour is quite large and I have to work hard every day to make ends meet. My salary is too small considering all the work I have to do especially during these times of high cost of living. If the Department could only allow me a certain amount of rations which is done for other men acting as farm instructors it would indeed be a great help to me. I have six hours school work every day during each week and visiting each dwelling house very often for sanitary purposes, dispensing medicine when people are sick and a lot more to do every day.\n\nJ. R. Settee\nTeacher.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nJ. R. Settee, teacher of the Montreal Lake School in the Carlton Agency, applies for an increase in his salary.\n\nMr. Settee is a half-breed, 39 years of age, and is married. At the time of his appointment he received a salary of $300.00 per year, which was increased to $400.00, his present salary, on July 1st, 1913. Besides the salary he has also received the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum and is allowed $60.00 a year as dispenser of medicines and rations. He states that he is also in receipt of $75.00 per annum from the Anglican Church for missionary work. He has no professional qualifications.\n\nIt was the intention to close this school in 1918, but, at the request of the Bishop of Saskatchewan and also on receipt of a petition from the Indians, the school was kept open and the services of Mr. Settee retained. There is an enrolment of 25 pupils, with an average attendance of 16.\n\nThe Bishop states that, while he is not very successful as a teacher, still he is faithful and satisfactory to the Indians.\n\nThere is no doubt that a salary of $400.00 is very small, and, as the Department has retained him so long in the service, I consider that he should be granted an increase, in view of the fact that he has only received one increase in twenty years' service and is a married man with a family. I would recommend that he be allowed $100.00, if he is continued on as teacher. The Bishop states that it would be difficult to obtain the services of another man for this school who would be as satisfactory to the Indians.\n\nOttawa, April 30, 1920.\nOttawa, May 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your annual report on the Montreal Lake School, for the year ended March 31st, last, in which you apply for an increase in your salary as teacher, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to grant you any increase at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

During the past school year - September first, 1921 to June 30, 1922, this school was in operation only 143 days out of a total number of 200 teaching days required. The reason given by the teacher was ill health.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive a report from you on the work being performed by Mr. Settee, the Teacher of this school. It would appear that he is not making much progress in the work, and it is a question whether it would not be advisable to dispense with his services. You should state whether you consider that the school should be continued in operation and whether you would recommend that a new teacher be engaged. As full a report as possible regarding this school should be forwarded by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-6-1 of the 1st inst., asking for a report on the work being performed by Mr. Settee of the Montreal Lake Day School.\n\nThis is a difficult school to handle, on account of none of the Indians farming, all depending upon hunting and trapping for their livelihood, which means than when the parents leave in the Spring and Fall they take all the children with them, as they have not the means to leave them behind. When paying treaty this year, the Band took up the question of having the school close April and October of each year, instead of July and August, if the Department approves of this step, I think it will help the attendance.\n\nIf it is possible to get another teacher, I would recommend same, Mr. Settee has been at Montreal Lake for about 20 years; he has done good work in the past, and no doubt if he were moved to a new field, he would continue to do so, though I consider a change would be better for all concerned if at all possible. Being practically an Indian himself, he cannot now commend the respect that he should for the position he is holding.\n\nIf the Department consider putting in a new man, I would suggest that a man be at Montreal Lake before any change is made, as it is essential that one be at that point to look after the rations etc., on account of the very bad roads during the summer it is impossible for me to make frequent trips.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 17, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nReports which have been received from the Indian Day School at Montreal Lake show that during the past school year this school was in operation only 143 days out of a total number of 200 teaching days required in the year. The reason appears to have been that the Indians and their families were absent from the reserve.\n\nMr. Settee, the Teacher, has been at Montreal Lake for about 20 years. He has, no doubt, done good work in the past; but it is now considered that a change of teachers at this school would be better for all concerned as, from reports received, he is not now commending the respect from the Indians that he should, for the position he is holding. Our agent suggests that, if the Department considers putting in a new man to take charge, the person appointed should be at Montreal Lake before any change is made, as it is essential that someone be at that point to look after the rations, etc.\n\nIn view of Mr. Settee's long and faithful services, the Department does not desire to deal hastily in dispensing with his services, and I shall be pleased to have your views as to whether it would not be advisable to make a change in the teacher at this point. It may be that Mr. Settee's services could be used elsewhere and that the change would be beneficial, both in the interests of the school work at Montreal Lake and to Mr. Settee himself.\n\nThe agent considers that there would be a more regular attendance if this school was closed during April and October of each year, instead of July and August, as at present, as the Indians would not then be absent for their spring and fall hunts.\n\nYou are, no doubt, fully aware of the situation at Montreal Lake, and I would be pleased to have your opinion regarding the making of a change of teacher at this school, also whether you consider that a change should be made in the time the annual holidays are taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We are referring the matter to Ven. Archdeacon MacKay, Prince Albert, under whose auspices the school is conducted. He is being requested to give us his views, regarding the obtaining of another teacher and whether he would advise that Mr. Settee should be transferred to another school or his services dispensed with.\n\nAs soon as we have a report from Ven. Archdeacon MacKay, we will be prepared to further consider the situation at Montreal Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The chief cause of the irregular attendance is the frequent absence of the Indians with their families. The Agent's idea that there would be more regular attendances if this school was closed during April and October of each year, instead of July and August as at present, is I think, a very good one.\n\nIt will be very difficult to find a really suitable teacher for Montreal Lake and almost impossible to make a change before winter. I would suggest that Mr. Settee be allowed to continue his duties until next summer, when a change can be made in the way that your Agent suggests.

It is hoped, however, that a change can be made next summer, and that the services of a qualified teacher can be obtained when the school re-opens at the beginning of the next school year.\n\nThe matter of holidays will be referred to our Indian Agent.

He suggests that Mr. Settee be allowed to continue his duties until next summer, and a change of teacher could then be made. We have approved of the retention of Mr. Settee for the balance of the present school year, namely to June 30th, 1923. It is hoped that the church authorities and yourself will be able to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to take charge after next summer.\n\nArchdeacon MacKay agrees with your suggestion that there would be a more regular attendance if this school were closed during April and October of each year, instead of July and August, as at present. In view of a change being contemplated in the teacher, it might be well to make no change in the holiday period during the tenure in office of Mr. Settee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Veir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nBy\n\nBishop Floyd suggests Mr. Setter go to Big River to equal tracked be secured for Montreal Falls.\n\nThis would be Oct.\n\nR.W.\nSir,\n\nWill you please advise me if Mr. John R.

I am in receipt of a letter from him wherein he states that it is his intention to leave Montreal Lake shortly.\n\nThis is the first intimation I have had of any contemplated change, as we have considerable supplies and equipment at Montreal Lake, if Mr. Settee is leaving I think the Church authorities should be made to appoint a successor to Mr. Settee before he is allowed to leave. On account of the distance it would be very inconvenient to look after this reserve, during the summer months the roads are nearly impassable on account of muskegs, and there is no person whom I would care to trust to look after things, unless some of the Traders would do the work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, informing the Department that you have been advised by Mr. John R. Settee, teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, that he is being transferred to take charge as teacher at the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, at the time of his recent visit to the Department, suggested that Mr. Settee be transferred to Big River, and that a qualified teacher be secured for the Montreal Lake Indian Day School. He was informed that this arrangement would be satisfactory. We have not been informed as to the action taken by His Lordship to carry out the above suggestion, and we are communicating with him in the matter. As soon as we hear as to the arrangements he has made for the transfer of Mr. Settee and the appointment of a teacher to succeed him at Montreal Lake you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department will approve of the transfer of Mr. Settee to Big River. Kindly state the date on which this transfer will take place, and also furnish particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you have secured to succeed him at Montreal Lake.\n\nOur Agent states that there are considerable supplies and equipment at Montreal Lake, and that a successor to Mr. Settee should be at Montreal Lake before he is allowed to leave. He also states that on account of the distance it is very inconvenient to attend to matters on the Montreal Lake Reserve during the summer months, as the roads are nearly impassable on account of muskegs. He further states that there is no person whom he would trust to look after the supplies and equipment, unless some of the traders would do the work.

I belong to the Fellowship of the Maple Leaf, and I think you would find me an enthusiastic and willing worker.\n\nI don't believe the simple life would damp me, because I warn you that I am fond of music and have in my truck a violin\u2014I hope to learn to play it some day. My other qualifications are as follows:\n\nFirst Class Academic standing\n15 weeks' Normal Training\nSpeak, read and write French and German\n\nP.T.O.\nFirst Aid Certificate (St. John's Ambulance)\n6 months' experience in Sunday School teaching.\n\nI may add that I am keen on learning languages, so that it will be no hardship to learn Cree. I understand that the total salary offered is $950. The inspectors at Normal have urged us, in consideration for our fellows, not to underbid each other and to ask for not less than $1000 per annum.\n\nTherefore I ask that if at all possible you will fix the salary at that figure. I hope you will not conclude, because of this request, that money is by any means my chief concern. Believing that I can be of service to you and to Christianity, (I enclose Miss Bashford's letter)\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. L.

Austin wishes to apply for the position of Teacher at the Montcalm Lake Indian Day School. He has first class academic standing, and has taken 15 weeks Normal Training in Saskatoon. He is keen on learning languages and is willing to take up Cree, which would be useful at Montcalm Lake where little English is spoken. He has the St. John's Ambulance First Aid Certificate, a qualification which will also be of service to him there. He is a married man with no children. I hope that the position if held vacant will be given to his wife.\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\nSYNOD OFFICE\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nHe will be available to start for Montreal late on May 15th.\n\nI enclose his letter herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E.J.

Austin through Canon Paul, who has charge of all that district for appointment as teacher and field matron to Montreal Lake in place of Settee.\n\nIf this is accepted will you kindly wire me to that effect because they ought to start for Montreal Lake not later than May 1st owing to the nature of the road, muskeg and bog, if left too late.\n\nWe have to send in a waggon load of furniture and supplies for them at the same time. I think from what I can hear that this is a good man and his First Aid ought to be a great help.\n\nBy the way the figures you gave me at Ottawa were $800 for a fully qualified teacher together with bonus and something for any other work he is called upon to undertake, and that I wrote from Ottawa to Canon Paul to look out for a man.\n\nA letter yesterday from Mr MacLean quotes $750 and bonus. My understanding put down at the time was $800 and $150 bonus.\n\nWith kind regards\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSettee stays until Austin arrives to shew him round and take over when Settee goes at once to Big River otherwise White Fish school.\nOttawa, April 15, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the application of Mr. W.

He has an English certificate as Wood and Metal work instructor besides some other certificates such as Shorthand, Bookkeeping, Typewriting, which will be less useful at Montreal Lake than the Wood and Metal work, but still an advantage.\n\nMrs. Pereira is qualified for the post of Matron, having been trained as a children's Nurse in a London Doctor's family. She holds no professional certificate but understands the care of children and has doctored children in his present school very efficiently. His contract with his present school trustees, calls for thirty days notice and if he is accepted for Montreal Lake would like to know soon.

Weir,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in this letter applying to the Ind. Dept. for an increase on my salary.\n\nWhen I applied for the position as Field Matron, I was informed by the Dept. that owing to the fact, that I had no certificates, I was rated as Assistant Field Matron.\n\nI naturally expected to find a Matron here, I was surprised to find that although rated, and paid, as an assistant, I was still expected to do a Field Matrons work alone.\n\nMy training in England, under a doctor as nurse to his children, fitted me to supervise the children here, and to issue simple medicines to all and sundry. I had no idea that I was also expected to cook dinners in addition for round about 40 children daily, or I certainly would not have considered accepting the position at so small a salary.\n\nI find plenty of calls upon my time and experience, as they are terribly backward here, a good number of the children being in a dreadful state with sores.\n\nIt needs whole hearted interest to do any good at all, and at present, though doing my utmost, I am suffering from a sense of injustice.\n\nI find previous to my coming, that a sum of Ten dollars per month was paid by the Dept. to an Indian woman \"Mrs. Settee\" for cooking the mid-day meal and I think that I am justly entitled to ask for that extra 10 dollars per month.\n\nI should be glad if you will take this matter up with the Department, and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Mrs. Maude Pereira.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose letter which I received from Mrs. M. Pereira, Assistant Field Matron, Montreal Lake Reserve No. 106, who is asking for an increase in salary.\n\nWhen I visited Montreal Lake Reserve during the early part of the month, I found Mr. and Mrs. Pereira taking a great interest in the school and the general welfare of the Indians, and I have no doubt that considerable improvements will be made under their supervision.\n\nRegarding the statement \"that a good number of the children are in a dreadful state with sores,\" there are a number suffering from common sores, though it is through the neglect of the parents not keeping the children clean.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nWould you please let me know something about this women's affair. If she is paid from school vote?\n\nHOD\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDecember 31st, 1924.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMiss O'Donahoe.\n\nMrs. M. Pereira, the Assistant Field Matron at Montreal Lake, began duties September 1, 1924. Her duties have been classified by the Civil Service Commission as that of Assistant Field Matron, part time. The salary allowed her is at the rate of $120 per annum, without bonus. Her husband was appointed teacher, and he is allowed salary at the rate of $800 per annum and bonus. Besides he is allowed $60 per annum for his services as overseer. Both Mr. and Mrs. Pereira are paid from the appropriation for Indian Education. It might be advisable, in view of the services which Mrs. Pereira is performing, to grant her an increase of $80 in her salary from the first of the new year. This will allow her $200 per annum.\n\nPlease advise the action taken in this regard.\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDr. J.D. Duncan\nLease\nEast\nAllerich on the\nCull system\nMontreal Lake\nJanuary 7, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, your File 185-31-A, with enclosed communication from Mrs. Pereira, Assistant Field Matron at the Montreal Lake Indian reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the contents of both these communications have been noted, but, before giving consideration to Mrs. Pereira's request for increased remuneration, I would like to have a full report from you regarding the matter. I note she states that she has to cook dinners for about 40 children, whereas the last quarterly return we have for the Montreal Lake school shows an enrolment of 31, with an average attendance of 21, so that her contention would hardly seem correct. I would like to know what the dinner Mrs. Pereira cooks for the children consists of and what other duties she is performing. Her predecessor, Mrs. Settee, was paid salary at the rate of $100.00 per annum, Mrs. Pereira is being paid $120.00, but it is possible that she is doing more work than Mrs. Settee did.\n\nThe statement Mrs. Pereira makes as to the backward condition of the children and their affliction with sores is considered of a very serious nature, and I would like to have a fuller report regarding this, and, if necessary, we would have a thorough investigation and report from the physician for these Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-6-1 of the 7th inst. wherein you ask for a report on Mrs. Pereira, Assistant Field Matron at the Montreal Lake Reserve, who recently made application for an increase in salary.\n\nWhen I visited Montreal Lake reserve early during the month of December, there were thirty-five children attending the day school. The meals which are prepared by Mrs. Pereira are made up of supplies as furnished by the department, such as flour, biscuits, bacon, tea and rice; no vegetables are on hand on account of the late teacher Mr. Settee not growing any, and which cannot be procured in the district.\n\nIn addition to Mrs. Pereira preparing meals, she also looks after the sick on the reserve, and gives particular attention to the welfare of the school children. There is no comparison between the work she is doing and that of which Mrs. Settee did, all that Mrs. Settee did was to prepare the noon day meal when the school was open, and as far as I know she never attended to the ailing.\n\nRegarding Mrs. Pereira's statement that the children are backward and afflicted with sores, I would mention that this is her first experience in Indian work, and no doubt she finds conditions very different from what she has been used to in the white settlements. Every year I have had Dr. J.D. Duncan, of Leask, visit this reserve, and he has always found conditions very satisfactory, that is with the exception of minor ailments which all are subject to, conditions as I find them on Montreal Lake reserve compare very favourably with other reserves of this Agency.\n\nI have to visit Montreal Lake reserve during the early part of February, when I will take particular note of the condition of the children and again write you on my return, as I am fully convinced that conditions are not as serious as Mrs. Pereira would give the impression.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 6, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, your File 212-31-A, with reference to the application of Mrs. Pereira, Assistant Field Matron, Montreal Lake reserve, for an increase in salary. In view of your statements as to the work she is performing, it has been decided to increase her salary to $180.00 per annum from February 1, this being the maximum of the position Assistant Field Matron, (Part time). I note with pleasure that she is taking an interest in the welfare of the Indians, and trust that her appointment may be productive of much good.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your report with reference to the health conditions among the children after you visit the Montreal Lake reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 6, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of June 28, last, advising you of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Pereira as Teacher and Assistant Field Matron, respectively, at the Montreal Lake Indian day school, in the Carlton agency, I beg to say that a short time ago we received an application from Mrs. Pereira for an increase in her salary. We obtained a report from the Indian Agent, who states that in addition to cooking a noon-day meal for the children, she looks after the sick on the reserve and gives particular attention to the welfare of the school children. He states that there is no comparison between the work that she has done and that done by her predecessor, Mrs. Settee.\n\nIn view of this report, we have decided to increase Mrs. Pereira's salary to $180.00 per annum, the maximum for the position Assistant Field Matron, (Part time,) from February 1. The Indian Agent has been advised to this effect today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 6, 1925.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nYou will note that the salary of Mrs. Pereira as Assistant Field Matron at the Montreal Lake reserve, is to be increased to $180.00 per annum, the increase to be effective from the 1st instant.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-6-1 of the 6th inst., informing me that the salary of Mrs. Pereria, Assistant Field Matron, Montreal Lake reserve has been increased to $150.00 per annum from February 1st.\n\nRegarding health condition among the children on my recent visit to Montreal Lake reserve I found nothing to be alarmed about. The children were in a healthy condition, and compare favourably with the children on other reserves of this Agency. A few were suffering from minor skin sores, though with the application of proper ointments (which are on hand) should heal without any trouble. A number were suffering from colds, which can be expected at this time of year.\n\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pereria are taking a great interest in the school and general welfare of the reserve, when I arrived thirty-five children were in attendance, as many as forty-three have been registered, and the average can be taken at about thirty-five. Mrs. Pereria obtained yarn and had socks knitted, she also got suitable clothing for all children attending school.\n\nThe parents of the children are taking an interest in the school, this year they left the women on the reserve instead of taking them off on the hunt, in order that the children could attend school. The parents informed me with what progress the children have made during the few months Mr. Pereria has been in charge, it will not be long before all children will be able to speak English.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Weir\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan G.

Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have discussed with the Band here the question of school attendance. They say that it is difficult for them to keep their children at school while they are hunting (although some have managed to do it). The question of opening school in August while all the children are here, was raised and they would like that to be done. It would free them for the month of December when they want to be out and the children would lose no schooling.\n\nIf you are agreeable to the above suggestion perhaps you would be good enough to recommend it.\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) F.J. Fereria.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose copy of letter received from Mr. F.J. Fereria of Montreal Lake Reserve regarding opening the day school during the month of August and closing same November 30th, instead of December 31st. I would recommend that the school be re-opened as he suggests as the children of school age are at present practically all home whereas during the month of December most of them will be away with their parents hunting and trapping.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Weir\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 19th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. F. J. Pereira, teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, in which he requests permission to open the school during the month of August, as all the children are on the Reserve, and close the school during the month of December, next, when the children are away with their parents for the hunting season.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of the teacher conducting this school during the month of August and closing same during the month of December, next. This arrangement is for the next school year only, and, should it be found successful, a request should again be made for any further continuance of this change in the holiday period.

I talked things over very fully with him because he has been such a splendid success and those children in the school are totally different from what I saw before. He wants to return to England on account of the teachers' pensions. I greatly regret their going. This might be an opening for Lowe of John Smith's if one could be sure that he did not let the work down and it is the only opening that I can see at the present time.\n\nG. E.

I am very pleased to learn that satisfactory progress is being made generally and I wish to assure you that the Department will cooperate in effecting improvements whenever a school gives reasonable promise of success. I hope that Your Lordship will be in Ottawa in the not distant future and that we can have an interview regarding the future of the work.\n\nI note that Mr. Lowe will have to leave the John Smith School, as he has outlived his usefulness on the reserve. The appointment of the Rev. G. J. Waite to this school as from January first has already been approved by the Department. Your Lordship might suggest that Mrs. Waite apply for the position of field matron. She should indicate what domestic duties she has and how much time could be given to visiting.\n\nI learn with regret that Mr. and Mrs. Pereira are leaving the Montreal Lake Indian Day School. Mr. Pereira taught this school during August and has permission to close on November 30th. This should be kept in mind when Your Lordship is arranging for a successor. If you wish to try Mr. J. L.

There are seven Day Schools altogether, namely, Montreal Lake, Little Red River, Sturgeon Lake, Wahpaton Sioux, Big River, Sandy Lake, and Mistawasis. I visited all these schools, but with the exception of the Montreal Lake School they were not in operation. I accompanied the Agent when he was making his annuity payments, and the children had been given a holiday for the occasion. I, however, made inquiry into the conditions pertaining to each school, when on the different reserves.\n\nMONTREAL LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on June 24th., and found 14 boys and 7 girls present, out of an enrolment of 27. The average attendance for the quarter was about 58% of the enrolment. The teacher complains that the parents take away their children when they go off hunting and trapping. It will be hard to prevent this condition, owing to the fact that the Indians depend upon hunting, trapping and fishing solely, as a means of livelihood, and this\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInspector Murison's Report on Carlton Day Schools.\n\noccupation necessarily takes them away from their reserve a great deal of their time. Mr. John L. Lowe has been in charge as teacher for two years. Previous to his taking charge, a Mr. Pereira taught for three years, but for twenty years previous to the latter teacher taking over, the school was taught by Mr. Robt. J. Settee, at least it was kept open by him. I can find very little evidence of his having taught the people anything, inasmuch as none of the younger men and women who attended his school can speak English. Conditions have been better during the last five years, but really satisfactory results cannot be expected with such an intermittent attendance.\n\nThe school is built of logs, and is 21 x 32, with a 13 ft. ceiling. The walls and wainscoting inside are whitewashed, and are fairly clean. The shingles on the roof are tin and are leaking badly and should be replaced.\n\nThe children looked fairly healthy, and their faces were clean, but I noted that they were poorly clothed. They are given a midday lunch of oatmeal, rice, biscuits and tea. When the teacher, who has a good garden, can spare the vegetables they are given potatoes. They have no milk and no soup. I would suggest that if they could be supplied with Dri-Milk it would form a beneficial addition to their midday meal. Moose meat can be obtained very cheaply at this point to make soup, and the Indians have permission to kill game the year around for their own consumption.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report by Mr. Inspector Murison dealing with the various schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nUnfortunately the schools were closed for summer vacation at the time of the Inspector's visit, with the exception of Montreal Lake School. At this point out of an enrolment of 27 children he found an attendance of 21. The average attendance for the quarter was poor, being only 59%. You will note that the teacher complains the parents take the children away during hunting. It would be impossible for them to do otherwise. These Indians depend entirely on hunting as a means of earning a livelihood and they could not leave the children at home when they go off on hunting trips. It would appear that there is a good recruiting field here for a boarding school. This school has not been very outstanding, and how could it be otherwise, having a man of the type and ability of Robert Settee as teacher for such a long period. You will note that the young men and women who were at school during his regime cannot speak English, so that this type of school and teacher does not bring results to the department. The mid-day meal at this school is not a very substantial one.\n\nAt the Little Red River Day School the average attendance is 12.35, which is poor.\n\nAt the Sturgeon Lake Day School the average attendance is poor, being only 10%. Here also is a point where we might recruit for a boarding school.\n\nThe Round Plain Day School is a very small institution, the average attendance being 3.7%.\n\nThe Big River Day School was visited twice\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nduring the month by the Inspector and on both occasions he found the school closed. I do not think we will ever get any results here. You will note that Mr. R. J. Settee has been in charge of this school. This is the same man who was in charge of the Montreal Lake School above referred to.\n\nThe Ahtahtakeops Day School is taught by Mr. R. B. Goodman and improvement is noted. The average attendance here for 22 children enrolled is 14.77%, which is not good. The Inspector states that there are 42 children of school age on the reserve, but a large number reside too great a distance from the school to attend. I question very much whether the Department should employ a man to drive the children to this school. However, if the school is to be kept open, something will have to be done. We pay $2.25 a day for doing like work at the Assiniboine Agency. I would hesitate to ask the Department to build a new school at this point. The time will come when a residential school will be built in the northern part of the Province.\n\nAt the Mistawasis Day School you will note Miss McQueen, the teacher, is leaving owing to lack of harmony between herself and Mrs. Moore. Miss McQueen is a good teacher and interested in her work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSchool conditions on Montreal Lake Reserve are very poor. Mr. Lowe has been at this point for the last nine years, and appears to have gotten into a rut which is not at all desirable. I found the Indian homes very dirty also the school children. Mr. Lowe does not set an example to them, as he takes no pride in his own appearance and that of his home. The only building belonging to the Department is the school, other buildings practically falling down. The house Mr. Lowe is living in belongs to the church, and would be a fairly comfortable building if cleaned up. From observations I certainly would recommend that Mr. Lowe be transferred to some other reserve, as we should have someone who would be an example to Indians, as there is considerable traffic to this point now as the reserve is on the edge of the Prince Albert National Park and tourists will get a wrong impression of our Department.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn his November report, Mr. Agent Davis writes as follows:\n\n\"School conditions on Montreal Lake Reserve are very poor.

It is a very isolated place. I have visited the school and can very well imagine that nine years existence in a place like Montreal Lake would have a deteriorating effect on anyone. I am taking the question up with the Rt. Rev. Walter Burd, D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan, requesting him to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the Montreal Lake school for the academic year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReferring to Department letter No. 107-6-1, dated the 14th instant, regarding conditions at Montreal Lake, I beg to advise you that I have taken the matter up with the Right Reverend Bishop of Saskatchewan with a view to having Mr. Lowe moved to some point where he would be under regular supervision and inspection, and a suitable teacher transferred to Montreal Lake.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from his Lordship stating that he agrees with me that a change is desirable, but before taking any action he would like to be quite clear on the following points:\n\n1. If a certificated teacher is appointed to Montreal Lake school will he receive the proper stipend for his qualifications?\n\n2. Will the Department be willing to grant sufficient money to put the school into good shape or, preferably, to build a new school?\n\n3. Will the Department be willing to appoint Mr. Lowe to another school in this Diocese?\n\nThe Bishop has in mind what he describes as a splendid young couple just married, who are at present at the school at Red Earth, Mr. and Mrs. Plunkett. They are willing to go to Montreal Lake, provided the Department is willing to act on points 1 and 2 as noted above. I have known Mrs. Plunkett for some years and agree that she is a fine woman and would set an example in housekeeping to the Indians. I have reports regarding Mr. Plunkett which are very good. I have met him, but am not well acquainted with him. I note that the present incumbent at Montreal Lake is receiving\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLake is receiving $765.00 per annum. I would suggest that, if the Department gives favorable consideration to the appointment of Mr. Plunkett, he be started at $810.00 per annum, which is in line with the salaries paid at several of our day schools in the Province which I consider of no more importance than Montreal Lake.\n\nMr. Plunkett is at present teaching at Red Earth. I might respectfully suggest that Mr. Lowe be transferred to that point in the meantime.\n\nWith regard to the condition of the school, I would suggest that this matter be held in abeyance until I can get a report on the cost which would be entailed in putting this school in good condition. It is over four years since I have visited the Montreal Lake School. I note in my report dated August 2nd, 1930, I made the following remarks:- \"the school is built of logs and is 21' x 32', \"with a 13' ceiling. The walls and wainscoting inside are white-washed inside and fairly clean. The shingles on the roof are tin \"and are leaking badly and should be replaced\". Speaking from memory I am of the opinion that the walls are spruce logs and should be in fair condition. It may not be necessary to incur a great deal of expense other than that of placing a new roof on the building and some minor repairs. However this might be held in abeyance until I can get a further report on the condition of the school at the present time. I have in mind visiting the Carlton Agency at an early date and will go into this matter then. I will call on the Bishop personally on my way through Prince Albert, if I find him at home, as I would like to have a personal interview with him regarding the whole situation in connection with our schools in the North.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nOttawa, February 4th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the Montreal Lake Indian Day School and it is noted that you suggest transferring Mr. Lowe to Red Earth and Mr. and Mrs. Plunkett to Montreal Lake.\n\nAfter carefully considering the contents of your letter, the Department considers that it would be advisable to let the matter stand until the end of the current academic year. In the meantime, you should call on the Bishop when you are passing through Prince Albert and discuss the whole matter with him. Following this interview, you should again report to the Department in order that any change in teachers may be brought to the attention of the Superintendent General for his approval.\n\nFrom reports received, it is doubtful if the Department should continue to employ Mr. Lowe. It is considered that a better qualified teacher could be secured.\n\nFor your information, I may add that salary at the rate of $850 a year is being paid to both Mr. Lowe and Mr. Plunkett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 107-6-1, dated the 14th instant with reference to the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, I beg to report that I had a conversation with his Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Archdeacon Paul at Prince Albert on the 13th instant in this connection and other matters in the Diocese of Saskatchewan.\n\nWe discussed the situation at Montreal Lake very fully and I will endeavor to place each problem before you separately.\n\n1. With regard to replacing Mr. Lowe, his Lordship is in accord with me as to the advisability of doing so and it is his desire that Mr. Plunkett be transferred from Red Earth to Montreal Lake at the end of the academic year. From reports I have regarding Mr. Plunkett, I believe he is well fitted to take up the work there. His Lordship informs me that he has had a serious talk with Mr. Lowe and pointed out to him where he has been remiss in carrying out his duties; and he feels that, if Mr. Lowe is given a chance to make good at Red Earth, he will profit by his past mistakes. Mr. Lowe has taught in Indian Day schools for about twenty years and there has been very little, if any complaint regarding his ability as a teacher. Where he has fallen down is in carelessness in connection with his personal appearance and untidiness in his home and school premises. His Lordship appears quite anxious that the Department will consent to the transfer of Mr. Lowe to Red Earth to replace Mr. Plunkett. If the Department decide to consider his Lordship's request, I am of the opinion that unless Mr. Lowe is under regular supervision, there will be a recurrence of conditions such as we have at Montreal Lake. Another complaint I have had regarding Mr. Lowe is that he meddles in business which does not concern him. In the event of his being given another chance, he should be warned to confine his efforts to the proper discharge of his own particular duties.\n\n2. Regarding the building accommodation, there is no question but that something should be done as soon as funds are available. After giving the matter due consideration, I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to erect new buildings rather than to spend money in attempting to repair present buildings. The school building, as I have already reported, has been up for a number of years. The foundation logs have rotted and would have to be replaced. The tin roof is rusted out and would have to be reshingled, and the whole building placed in a state of repair. Logs can be obtained cheaply at Montreal Lake and rough lumber can be obtained from local mills at about one half the price.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nhalf the price it can be secured in Prince Albert and with about one-half the cost in freight charges. I am enclosing a snap shot of the school building, which shows the condition of the foundation but not the roof, although you will see by the snap shot that the roof is tin. The snap shot really flatters the building. The old teacherage belonging to the Department has been torn down and the teacher is residing in a small shack which is the property of the Church. His Lordship says he will gladly hand this building over to the Department. This building also is in a poor state of repair. I am enclosing a snap shot of it and you will readily see that it is not an attractive residence and has very limited accommodation. It is not a building that a teacher would take any pride in or would feel like taking up as a permanent residence.\n\nAt an isolated point such as Montreal Lake, it is very desirable that there should be at least one spare bed-room provided to accommodate visiting officials.\n\nThe drinking water is at present obtained from the lake and has to be hauled to the buildings. If the question of erecting new buildings at this point is given favorable consideration, I would suggest that before doing so a new location should be selected where a water supply can be secured by digging a well. I am of the opinion that water can be obtained very easily at no great depth in the vicinity of this lake. His Lordship concurs with this suggestion. The cement, finishing lumber, shingles etc. would have to be taken in from outside, but good spruce logs can be obtained very cheaply locally as well as the rough lumber required. I am of the opinion that new buildings are badly needed at this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\nOttawa, March 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 303-11 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to a change in teaching services at the Montreal Lake Day School. It is noted the Bishop of Saskatchewan desires that Mr. Plunkett be transferred from the Red Earth Indian Day School to the Montreal Lake School, after the end of the present academic year, and that Mr. Lowe, the present teacher at Montreal Lake, replace Mr. Plunkett at Red Earth.\n\nIn this connection I would say the Department considers that, as Mr. Lowe's services are not satisfactory at Montreal Lake, there would be recurrence of similar conditions if he were transferred to Red Earth. However, we are placing the matter before the Superintendent General, for his direction, and, when same is received, you will be advised.\n\nRegarding the condition of the present school buildings and teacher's living quarters at Montreal Lake, and your recommendation that a new building be erected on a site where a water supply can be secured, I have to say, for your private information, that it is understood there will be further funds provided under the Public Works Construction Act, and a request has been made to include the amount required to erect a new school and teacher's residence at this point. If so, the work of erecting the building would be carried out during the coming summer. However, at present I am not in position to state whether a further appropriation under the above Act will be made by Parliament at this session. I may add that the Department will not lose sight of the need for a new school building and teacher's living quarters at Montreal Lake. From the snapshot forwarded by you, it would appear that the present buildings are not worth any expense for repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 19, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nIn the past, the Department has permitted Right Reverend Walter Burd, D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan, to nominate the teachers for the Montreal Lake Indian Day School (Reserve No. 106 - Federal District of Prince Albert), Sask., and the Red Earth Indian Day School (Reserve No. 29 - Federal District of Melfort), Sask.\n\nAt the present time, Reverend Mr. Lowe is the teacher at the Montreal Lake School and Mr. B. T. Plunkett is the teacher of the Red Earth Indian Day School. Bishop Burd now requests that Mr. Plunkett be transferred to Montreal Lake and Mr. Lowe, from Montreal Lake to Red Earth. These transfers would be effective from the beginning of the next academic year, viz.: September 1st, 1935.\n\nI should appreciate your concurrence in the transfer of the teachers mentioned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nLeask, Sask.,\nApril 3rd, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 107-6-1 of the 25th ultimo advising me that the Department has decided to transfer J.L. Lowe, teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, to the Red Earth Indian Day School in the Pas Agency, and that Mr. B.T. Plunkett will take charge at Montreal Lake.\n\nWill Mr. Plunkett take over the duties of Overseer at the rate of $5.00 per month?\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Plunkett from the Red Earth Day School to the Montreal Lake Day School, I may advise you that I am in receipt of a letter from the Lord Bishop of Saskatchewan in which he desires to be informed if, in view of the fact that Mr. Plunkett does not desire a change and he is being moved solely for the benefit of the school at Montreal Lake, it would be possible to secure the cost of his travelling expenses from the Indian Department. I presume the bishop means the cost of Mr. Plunkett's removal expenses, but he does not state what these will amount to.\n\nI would be glad to know if the department would consider his Lordship's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 30th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your 303-11 of the 24th instant regarding the transfer of Mr. B.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nLeask, Sask., July 16th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report on my recent treaty payments to Montreal Lake, lac la Ronge and Stanley.\n\nMontreal Lake\n\nThe school was clean and on this visit also the teacher, Mr. Lowe. I believe the transfer may do this man some good. Building is a very old log one with a tin roof which is in poor shape and I would not recommend very much money being spent on repairs. If the building was whitewashed and plastered and a fence put around it would look better and would do for this year. Cost would be about $35.00. The teacher's residence which belongs to the church is a log building in very poor condition and not fit for habitation unless the Church spends some on it for repairs.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 29, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the 6th instant on the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding $35.00, in having the building plastered and white-washed and a fence erected. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible - you to purchase any materials required. This work should be completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. Please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials, and accounts, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 107-6-1, dated March 11th, last, in regard to the change in teaching services at the Montreal Lake Day School, and with particular reference to the last paragraph commenting on the condition of the present school building and teacher's living quarters in which it was stated that the Department would not lose sight of the need for a new school building and teacher's living quarters and that an effort would be made if funds could be secured to have the work carried out during the coming summer, I may advise you that I am today in receipt of a letter from his Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan on the subject.\n\nThe Bishop points out that he made the nomination of Mr. Plunkett, the present teacher, on condition that provision was made for a suitable residence and school so that the place would be a credit to both the Church and the Department. He states that he has just received a letter from Mr. Plunkett informing him that the residence in its present state is not fit to live in for the winter and that he cannot stay unless something is done. The Bishop asks if I will kindly advise him what the Department's intention is in providing a suitable residence, so that he will be in a position to advise Mr. Plunkett as to his future action.\n\nI fully endorse all that is said about the residence at Montreal Lake. In my opinion it is beyond repair and unfit for habitation and it should be replaced if at all possible at once. Provision has been made in the Estimates for 1936-37 for this work, but it should not be left until next year. The school building might be allowed to stand over. I would be glad to know if anything can be done, so that I may advise his Lordship.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 303-11 of the 27th ultimo regarding the Montreal Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department has no funds available at the present time to provide a new school and teacher's residence.\n\nIt is noted that you are requesting that provision be made for this in our estimates for the next fiscal year and, when preparing our estimates, your request will be further considered.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that Mr. Plunkett was transferred to the Montreal Lake School at the special request of the Bishop of Saskatchewan. It was our desire to dispense with the services of Mr. Lowe but, in order to meet the Bishop's wishes, we consented to Mr. Lowe and Mr. Plunkett interchanging schools.\n\nIt should, also, be noted that, in reporting on the Montreal Lake School last July, Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, wrote as follows:\n\n\"The teacher's residence, which belongs to the church, is a low building in very poor condition and not fit for habitation unless the church spends some on it for repairs.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nApril 23rd, 1936.\n\nWITH CHEQUE\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith cheque No.A31274, for $60, in payment of your salary for April. In explanation of the amount at which the cheque is drawn, I have to inform you that a deduction of $25 has been made on account salary as Dispenser Red Earth Residential School paid you in error for September and December quarters 1935.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMcAllen\nRepresentative of the Treasury\n\nB.T. Plunkett, Esq.,\nMontreal Lake,\nSask.\n\nEMCL/B\nLeask, Sask.\nMarch 30th. 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Montreal Lake Reserve No. 106\nBig River \" 118\nIndian Day Schools.\n\nI would suggest that the above mentioned schools be operated as follows in future. Indians of these reserves are very backward and we are not getting results so should for money we are expending on education.\n\nThat male teachers be appointed to these schools having a knowledge of manual training and other qualifications. Schools could be operated for half days during summer months teaching reading, writing and arithmetic and not bothering with other subjects. Balance of time could be spent instructing old and young gardening, home and furniture building. During winter months Indian craftsmanship could be taught with the assistance of practical workers. Practical training along these lines will accomplish far more than is being done at present, and in years to come as they advance more attention can be given to class room work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.\nMarch 29th. 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn my recent visit to Montreal Lake Reserve No. 106 on the 23rd. instant, I arrived via plane at 9.50 a.m. and went direct to Day School which I found in a dirty and hopeless condition.\n\nDoor of school was unlocked and no school was being held. Later I met Mr. Plunkett on the road dressed in overalls and he looked more like a labourer than a school teacher. He informed me that he had loaned the school for a dance the previous night and it was not his intention to hold school on the 23rd. A number of the seats were broken when I inspected the toilets I found them full of snow in a very dirty condition and children had been using play ground as a lavatory. Gates were down and things were just being let go to pieces.\n\nOn inspecting house he vacated a few months ago I found in one of the rooms a quantity of department drugs and supplies thrown all over the floor amongst rubbish. Some of the drugs were frozen and bottles broken.\n\nOn my last visit in January I had supplies sent in for a mid-day meal, but Mr. Plunkett did not bother to see that children got the meal. On my previous visits I could see that this man was slipping and asked him to fix up different things but nothing has been done.\n\nI would recommend that the department dispense with his services as from June 30th. 1937 as he is of no use to the department and is a very poor example to these Indians.\n\nWe should have a first class man at this point as it is near the Prince Albert National Park and will be on the main highway which is being completed this year. Beside teaching we should have a man who will see that homes are cleaned up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-1, part 1)\nSee Dr. Robertson's letter to Secretary dated Feb. 28/37 on same subject.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 19, 1937.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report indicating that the work of Mr. B. T. Plunkett as teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian Day School is very unsatisfactory.\n\nUnder these circumstances, you should inform Mr. Plunkett that his services will not be required at the Montreal Lake School after the end of the current academic year, viz., June 30th, next.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would select two or three qualified teachers and have them report to Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask. Mr. Davis is fully conversant with local conditions on the reserve and is in a position to decide which of your nominees is the best qualified to take charge of this school.\n\nAs the main highway to the Prince Albert National Park is being completed this year, the Indian Agent considers that it is advisable to have a first class man at Montreal Lake. In making your nomination for this position, you should keep in mind that, in addition to being a qualified teacher, the Department desires to obtain someone who will take an active interest in community work and, if required, be able to give the boys some instruction in manual training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nCOPY OF THIS LETTER SENT TO INDIAN AGENT DAVIS.\nSir:-\n\nWhen in Ottawa the services of the Teacher at the Montreal Lake Day School were discussed and I left with you a copy of a report received from Indian Agent Davis, setting out very unsatisfactory conditions there.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Plunkett's services be dispensed with on June 30th next. The new appointment should be a man capable of acting as teacher and overseer on the Reserve. The Montreal Lake Reserve is situated near the Prince Albert National Park and it is important that we should have a well qualified man at this point. I think a suitable man could be obtained at no additional expense than the salary now paid. He should only be allowed three weeks vacation in the summer so that he will be on hand to supervise gardening operations on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 5th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your 303-11 of the 29th ultimo, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of the 19th ultimo, addressed to Ven. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul. A copy of our letter of the 19th ultimo has also been forwarded to Indian Agent Davis.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nMy Dear Lord Bishop:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th. instant and have again written to the Department urging the necessity for providing a residence at once for the teacher at Montreal Lake.\n\nThe Department in their letter last March stated that they hoped to be able to carry this work out during the coming summer, but to date I have heard nothing further from them. The school building might be left in abeyance until next year, but I have pointed out to the Department in my letter yesterday that the erection of a residence for the teacher should not be left over and I have urged that some action be taken at once. I will communicate with you immediately I hear from the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) W. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Walter Burd,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMy dear Inspector Murison:\n\nMontreal Lake.\n\nYou will remember that in acceding to the Department's request for change of teacher at Montreal Lake I made the nomination of Mr. Plunkett on condition that suitable provision was made for the residence and school so that the place could be a credit to both the Church and the Department. I agreed to hand over the Mission House to the Department if they would make the necessary alterations. The change of teacher has been made and the Diocese has had to bear the expense of moving Mr. Plunkett as he was quite satisfied with his position at Red Earth. These expenses amount to $38.90 and I feel that the Department should meet at least part.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Plunkett in which he states that the residence in its present state is not fit to live in for the winter and that he cannot stay unless something is done. Will you kindly advise me what the Department intends to do for the provision of suitable residence for the teacher at Montreal Lake so that I can advise Mr. Plunkett as to his future action.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Walter Saskatchewan.\n\nInspector W. Murison,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nection of a residence for the teacher should not be left over and I have urged that some action be taken at once\".\n\nHowever, no action was taken by the Department, but $30 was provided from a Church source, with which Mr. Plunkett made what improvements he could on the house. I believe a small amount of material was afterwards provided by the Department.\n\nDuring the winter a child was born to Mr. and Mrs. Plunkett in Prince Albert Hospital, and was later taken to Montreal Lake. In the Spring Mrs. Plunkett was taken ill, and had to go to Winnipeg for an operation. But Mr. Plunkett carried on at the school, and all went well there, and Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent was pleased with his work. Still the Department did nothing about building a house. But before winter, when the Hudson's Bay Co. took over the Revillon Co.'s buildings, Mr. Davis arranged for the Department to rent the old Hudson's Bay residence for the Plunketts. This house is a mile and a half from the school. Mrs. Plunkett was ill, and was finally ordered by the Doctor to go to bed for three months. And if was then that Mr. Plunkett's work suffered.\n\nMr. Davis himself has told me about the faults he had to find, and no doubt he had occasion to complain that things that should have been done were not done. But, Sir, do you think that under the circumstances, remembering that no house near the school was built for the teacher, and that his wife was seriously ill, and so his energy was divided between his work and his home, that Mr. Plunkett is really so much to be blamed because his work was not satisfactory last winter?\n\nIt seems to me quite possible that had a suitable residence been provided during that first winter when the baby was born, Mrs. Plunkett's illness might have been prevented, and I am sure that Mr. Plunkett's work would then have been as satisfactory as it was during his year at Red Earth and his first year at Montreal Lake.\n\nJust at present I cannot communicate with Montreal Lake, as the mail is carried by airplane, and the planes are now being equipped with pontoons in Prince Albert, and will be unable to proceed to the North until there is sufficient open water in the Northern lakes.\n\nIf you still think that Mr. Plunkett's services should be dispensed with, I must notify him when the mail starts running again, but I do hope the Department will see its way to provide suitable accommodation for the Teacher, whoever he may be.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. L. J. Paul.\n\nCommissary for Bishop of Saskatchewan.\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter (107-6-1) of April 18th., forwarded when I was away, and waited to reply till I could look up past correspondence in this office. I note that the Department wishes to remove Mr. B.T. Plunkett from Montreal Lake after June 30th, next; but I should like you yourself to know all the circumstances which have led up to this decision.\n\nOn Dec. 20th, 1934, at which time Mr. Plunkett was teaching the Indian Day School at Red Earth, and was giving good satisfaction, Inspector Murison wrote to the Bishop of Saskatchewan (file no.303-11) saying that the Department were not satisfied with conditions at Montreal Lake, and asking the Bishop to nominate a new Teacher to take charge of the Day School for the academic year 1935 to 1936. On Jan. 3rd, 1935 the Bishop replied to Inspector Murison saying that if the Department would provide suitable buildings at Montreal Lake, he would advocate moving Mr. Plunkett from Red Earth to Montreal Lake. In Feb. 1935 Inspector Murison interviewed the Bishop at Prince Albert, and I was present at the interview. The Bishop offered to pass over the Mission House, which belonged to the Church, to the Department, if the Department would repair it.\n\nOn March 15th, the Inspector wrote to the Bishop (303-11) saying that the Department were keeping the matter of new buildings in mind.\n\nMr. Plunkett was happy at Red Earth, and was doing good work there, and did not want to leave, but consented to do so at the Bishop's request, because the Department wished for a change at Montreal Lake.\n\nAccordingly in August 1935 Mr. and Mrs. Plunkett moved to Montreal Lake, and as soon as they arrived Mr. Plunkett wrote to the Bishop saying that the residence in its present state was not fit to live in for the winter. On Sept. 25th, the Bishop reported this to Inspector Murison, who replied on Sept. 28th. \"The school building might be left in abeyance until next year, but I have pointed out to the Department in my letter yesterday that the er-\nOttawa, May 13, 1937.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to state, by way of comment, that I have studied very carefully the statements you made in respect to conditions confronting Mr. Plunkett when he took charge of the Indian Day School at Montreal Lake.\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of a report sent forward to the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Saskatchewan by Indian Agent R. S. Davis.\n\nIn view of the statements contained in Mr. Davis' report, it is exceedingly difficult for the Department to reconsider this case with the object of having Mr. Plunkett remain at his present school. It is just possible, of course, that the conditions to which you refer contributed to the present very unsatisfactory situation. In view of this fact, I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to discuss the matter with Mr. Davis and come to an arrangement whereby Mr. Plunkett might be transferred to another school. If this were done, it would have to be on the understanding that Mr. Plunkett's work would be reviewed at the end of a year, and, if found unsatisfactory, his services would be dispensed with.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn April 19th, last, we wrote to Venerable Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul, of Prince Albert, intimating that he should inform Mr. Plunkett that his services would not be required at the Montreal Lake Indian Day School after the end of the current academic year. We are now in receipt of a letter from Archdeacon Paul, in which he claims that the conditions confronting Mr. Plunkett when he began his duties at Montreal Lake, such as housing accommodation, distance from school, illness of his wife, etc., have temporarily discouraged him and are responsible for the existing conditions.\n\nIn our reply, we have pointed out to Archdeacon Paul that, in view of the statements contained in your report of March 29th, addressed to Dr. Thomas Robertson, it would be impossible for us to permit Mr. Plunkett to continue in charge of this school. We did suggest, however, that he might, by discussing the matter with you, arrange to have Mr. Plunkett transferred to another school, on the understanding that his work would be carefully reviewed at the end of a year, and, if found unsatisfactory, his services would be dispensed with.\n\nWe shall appreciate it very much if you can find it convenient to discuss the matter with Archdeacon Paul at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He stated that he had forwarded a letter to us a few days previous and had enclosed a check for $95.00, his salary for the month of September, this we were to deposit to his account. Up to date the letter has not arrived. I wrote to the Bank of Montreal at Prince Albert, with whom he intends to deal, explaining the situation. I also spoke to the Post Office authorities, and they are trying to trace it. We would be pleased if you would do everything possible to stop payment on the check, by any person other than Mr. Campbell.\n\nOwing to the poor mail service, and no telephone service, we are unable to communicate with Mr. Campbell, and are at a loss to know what to do.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\n(Yours truly,\n(Mrs.) S. Campbell)\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1939.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant our records show that cheque 13251 for $95.00 in payment of the September salary of Mr. Robert Campbell, teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian day school, was forwarded from here on September 30.\n\nThe cheque has not yet been cashed. You should continue your endeavours to locate it and if it is not found you should advise me later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. S.

When the accounts for $718.81 and $61.54 were received in the Department, there were no funds available to pay them, and so far we have received only part of our appropriation. It is expected, however, that the balance of the money will be available shortly and the payment of these accounts will then receive immediate consideration.\n\nWith regard to the account for $47.17, our records indicate that cheque No. 97074 was forwarded to the North Star Lumber Company on February 2, last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, July 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, you may expend a total amount not exceeding $135.00 in connection with necessary repairs to the teacher's residence on the Montreal Lake Reserve. It is noted from your letter that the above amount will build a chimney; fill in the basement; improve the heating system and redecorate the walls. It is hoped that this is the last large amount that will have to be spent on this building for some time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly forward an advance cheque for $60.00 to pay the labour repairing the Teachers residence at Montreal Lake Reserve; This refers to Authority No. 107-6-5, dated July 19th, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nR.S.

Anderson, Esq.,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Treasury,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to Departmental letter No. 107-6-1 of February 20th last, regarding the teacher's residence and school at Montreal Lake. I also wish to refer to my letters of last Winter which Mr. Waite, the School teacher, wrote to me, copies of which I forwarded to the Branch.\n\nI now wish to state that I visited Montreal Lake on the 12th ultimo in company with Mr. R.S. Davis, the Indian Agent, and as we stayed overnight at Waskesiu, we were at the Reserve between 9.00 and 10.00 o'clock in the morning, and stayed there until 10.00 o'clock in the evening.\n\nI am sure you will wonder why the School was built where it is, allegedly one half mile from the teacher's residence. I am drawing a sketch showing where the teacher's residence is and also the highway and the school. I stepped this distance between the school and the teacher's residence and found that it was 1000 ft., in other words, less than one fifth of a mile. The reason the school was built on its present site was that it had to be this distance to keep the children away from the road, as there is a gravelled highway running past the teacher's residence as far as the Hudson's Bay store, which is one mile north from the teacher's residence.\n\nRegarding the heating of the school, I am sure you will realize that up in a place like Montreal Lake, which is quite a large body of water, the weather becomes pretty cold in the Winter time and the furnace that heats the school is not large enough to heat it during the extreme cold weather. Also, the furnace was made out of a box stove. To remedy this a large stove should be placed right in the school, such as the Lumberman's Heater, which has a flat shelf on top of the stove where the mid-day meal could be kept warm. It would only be necessary for the teacher to keep this stove going during the cold weather.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nThe teacher's residence.......\nThe teacher's residence is also very cold and storm windows are required. You cannot expect a house in that part of the country to be habitable without storm windows. Also, the window frames need caulking with oakum and a fine wire nailed over the frame for about a foot from the frame on to the logs and then plastered. If this is done I can see no reason why the house will not be warm.\n\nA 25 barrel tank for soft water is also required as the teacher has to carry the water from the lake, a distance of about a mile. I understand that it is impossible to get a satisfactory well, or at least this is what I was told. The teacher also has a garage that needs repairing. Mr. Waite has a car and I deem it absolutely necessary to fix this garage up and have a stove put in it. I believe Mr. Davis said that he could furnish a small stove for this purpose. Mr. Waite is a long distance from Prince Albert and the Park is closed up in the winter time, but the highway is kept open. You will realize how necessary it is for him to keep his car running in the winter time so that it will start at a moment's notice in case of sickness and so forth. To repair the garage would cost about $40.00. To make the necessary repairs to the house, such as fitting the window frames with storm windows, etc., it will be necessary to have Mr. Davis bring in a carpenter from Prince Albert as there are no Indians capable of doing this work at Montreal Lake. The storm windows can be purchased from Prince Albert from an approved source, and fitted by the carpenter.\n\nI would therefore, suggest that Mr. Davis be given the necessary authority to buy all material required and hire a carpenter to do the above mentioned work. He should also be given authority to make arrangements for a soft water tank and the repairing of the garage, and be authorized to purchase the necessary stove for the school, and stove pipes. If these repairs are brought about I am sure that Mr. Waite's difficulties will be over and he will be able to live comfortably in the winter. These people have been with us for quite a number of years and they have always done their work well, helping us out in every way possible, not only in the school but with outside work on the reserve, and they are still doing this work for us.\n\nIn conclusion I might bring to your attention that Mr. Waite gives out the rations to the Indians and more or less acts as an Overseer for Mr. Davis, as well as looking after a school garden, which will necessitate his staying there for most of the holiday. Still he is only paid a school teacher's salary.\n\nThe question of holidays was discussed with me while I was there and as the Indians are away in November and December, often taking their children with them, and the same applies in April, we all thought that probably it would be better to have, say two months' holidays during the winter and only one month during the summer. I advised both Mr. Davis and Mr. Waite that I did not think the Branch would have any objection to the teacher taking the two months during the winter and one month during the summer as long as the school is only taught nine months of the year.\n\nM.

However, in spite of this last Winter they had to close up the front of the house because the weather was so terribly cold with temperatures as low as 60 degrees below zero. The only thing we can do to improve matters now is to put a box stove in the front room. There is a stove pipe hole in the fireplace.\n\nI do not know where we are going to get a box stove but if you will give me the authority to buy one together with eight pipes, one elbow pipe, and a stove board I shall endeavour to secure one.\n\nM.

The money otherwise spent on flour could be saved or used to give a better meal of more variety.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J. Kerley.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nIn addition to the food stuffs)\n\nThe above schedule should be enough for the mid-day meals. I am of the opinion that this mid-day meal business should be carefully checked. I am forwarding you a form that used to be used a number of years ago and should again be used.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos.

Before the mid-day meals were stopped a number of years ago, I understand that 4\u00a2 per child per meal was allowed and this included $100.00 for a woman to look after the meals, which works out to 1.8\u00a2 per child per meal.\n\nWhen these mid-day meals were started again, a few years ago, I was of the opinion that biscuits would not be supplied for the meals when they were receiving other food. We have not received these biscuits since that time; I understand that the other Agencies are getting the biscuits in addition to the food stuffs.\nLeask, Sask.,\nAugust 31st 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - Your letter of August 27th, 303-11B.\nMid-day meals for Indian Day Schools.\n\nAs suggested in your letter of August 27th, I took the matter of mid-day meals for Indian day schools up with Mr. Goodman and the following is the list of supplies that he feels should be ample for a school with pupils from five to thirty. These figures are based on 200 school days in the year. I feel that bacon should be substituted for beef at certain times in the year, if half bacon and half beef were supplied it would be a lot more satisfactory; at certain times of the year beef is hard to get.\n\nFor five pupils:\n100 lbs beef @ 6\u00a2 6.00\n100 lbs flour $2.80 cwt 2.80\n35 lbs sugar 7.00 cwt 2.50\n5 lbs cocoa @ 20\u00a2 1.00\n20 lbs rice @ 5\u00a2 1.00\n20 lbs beans @ 4\u00a2 .80\n10 lbs klim @ 75\u00a2 7.50\n7 lbs salt @ .20 .20\n5 lbs raisins @ 10\u00a2 .50\n10 lbs syrup @ 10\u00a2 1.00\n1 lb baking powder .25\n2 pks. yeast .10\n10 lbs lard @ 18\u00a2 1.80\n\nTotal 25.45\n\nFor 15 to 18 pupils:\n250 beef @ 6\u00a2 15.00\n300 flour $2.80 8.40\n100 sugar 7.00\n12\u00bd cocoa 20\u00a2 2.50\n50 rice @ 5\u00a2 2.50\n50 beans @ 4\u00a2 2.00\n25 klim 12.75\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Mid-day Meals, Day Schools.\n\nOwing to the fact that I consider these meals absolutely necessary, not only in the interests of the health of the children, but also for the purpose of securing attendance, I have strongly advocated their necessity. I now find, however, that some of our teachers are asking for a considerable increase in their allowance.\n\nWe have in Saskatchewan Mr. Kerley, clerk, Pelly Agency, who prior to taking that position spent 12 years teaching in one of our schools; also Mr. Goodman, teacher on Sandy Lake, has many years' experience. From my own personal knowledge, I know that these two teachers have always supplied good nourishing meals, many times paying for them out of their own pockets. I have therefore asked them to submit what, in their opinion, should be sufficient to supply a good nourishing meal, not taking into consideration vegetables, which in my opinion should be grown in a school garden, or where this is impossible, supplied from the Community farm.\n\nI am now in receipt of their replies, which I am enclosing. You will note that there is very little difference in their estimates. I am attaching also a form which Mr. Kerley states was formerly used and should be used again.\n\nI would recommend that the Department, from this information, adopt a fixed amount per pupil for each school, and thus get away from leaving the matter to the will of the teacher.\n\nIt might be noted that at some schools it is practically impossible to secure beef, and they have to use bacon instead. This would of course increase the cost a little.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of September 19 with reference to midday meal supplies for the schools in the Carlton Agency. There appears to be a tendency to endeavour to turn our day schools into semi-residential schools. It was never the intention to supply what might be considered a full meal at midday at the day schools. Day schools are not equipped for this purpose and besides it would involve either a great deal of extra work on the older pupils or it would require the employment of someone to prepare the midday meal and present regulations do not permit our expending funds for the latter purpose.\n\nThe lunch at midday at day schools while nutritious should be as simple as possible. We appreciate the suggestions offered by Mr. Kerley and Mr. Goodman.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the requests from the schools in the Carlton Agency and it is considered that only a light lunch should be served. With this in mind we are writing to Indian Agent Davis regarding the amount he can expend at each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nR.

There appears to be a tendency to endeavour to turn our day schools into semi-residential schools. It was never the intention to supply what might be considered a full meal at midday at the day schools. Day schools are not equipped for this purpose and besides it would involve either a great deal of extra work on the older pupils or it would require the employment of someone to prepare the midday meal and present regulations do not permit our expending funds for the latter purpose.\n\nThe lunch at midday at day schools while nutritious should be as simple as possible. We appreciate the suggestions offered by Mr. Kerley and Mr. Goodman.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the requests from the schools in the Carlton Agency and it is considered that only a light lunch should be served. With this in mind we are writing to Indian Agent Davis regarding the amount he can expend at each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nStatement of biscuits supplied to Indian day schools in the Province of Saskatchewan for the academic year 1938-39.\n\n| School                  | No. of Lbs. |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| **BATTLEFORD AGENCY:**   |             |\n| Little Pines            | 1,500       |\n| Red Pheasant            | 900         |\n| Thunderchild            | 700         |\n| **CROOKED LAKE AGENCY:**|             |\n| White Bear's            | 600         |\n| **DUCK LAKE AGENCY:**    |             |\n| Fort-a-la-Corne South   | 500         |\n| John Smith's            | 500         |\n| Jas.

As soon as you have made a decision in this regard you should advise me in order that we may have your views before placing any order next spring. For your information I may say that the biscuits are costing us this year 10.07\u00a2 a pound plus transportation charges.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nA recent report received from the Public School Inspector regarding his inspection of the Montreal Lake Indian day school refers to the poor condition of this building. This is a matter about which you have reported on previous occasions.\n\nWould it be possible to construct a new school in a manner similar to that followed in the construction of the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake during the past summer? Please let me know if one or two class rooms would be necessary and, if so, you might comment on which of the under-mentioned kind of building could be erected most reasonably.\n\n1. One class room (or two class rooms) with basement underneath for vocational purposes.\n\n2. One class room (or two class rooms) without a basement and a separate small building erected for vocational purposes.\n\nWhichever you recommend you should let me know if the Indians would do the necessary work provided food was supplied. At the same time you should advise as fully as possible the quantities of lumber, hardware etc. that would be necessary in order that we may have all the information required for our Purchasing Agent.\n\nIt is quite possible that we can provide the funds to purchase the materials before the end of March and the building could be erected next summer. If it is\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nnecessary to secure logs it is possible that you could secure them during the winter months.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you not later than January 15, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The logs for the building would cost in the neighborhood of $100.00. I believe that it would be better if we would purchase about 40 bags of flour, the price being about $2.50 at Montreal Lake and pay them in kind. They could also get out some logs to saw for lumber for the rough work, such as rough inch lumber, 2nd dimensions. The sawing of this would cost us about $5.00 a thousand.\n\nI have been very busy and have not had time to complete the estimate on the building but will forward same in the near future. Roughly, I would estimate that the building will cost about $1700.00 including a heating system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

One item is for the amount of $300.00 for stuccoing the outside of the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake. This will not be necessary this year but, as I neglected to insert any amount for repairing and decorating the schools and residences, this amount could be used to advantage for this work.\n\nI would appreciate knowing the amount that will be allowed for this Agency for repairs to the schools and teacher's residences so that I could distribute the amount properly. The Sturgeon Lake School and residence is in need of a lot of repairs. Little Red River School also is in need of some repairs inside the school. The fences at Sturgeon Lake, Little Red River and Ahtahkakoops Schools all need repairing. The amount asked for in the estimates, $456.50, should cover the necessary expenditures.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant it was only found possible to include an amount of $350.00 in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the day schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nWe have already authorized an amount of $100.00 for painting the Ahtahkakoops school. Therefore, the balance available is $250.00.\n\nYou might let me know in what manner you consider this amount should be expended and in the event of any material being required you should let me have full particulars in order that if necessary purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.

(RG 10, Volume 6290, file 617-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder Purchase Order No. 9948, issued last February, 40 sacks of flour were purchased for the Indians of the Montreal Lake Reserve No. 106 to get out logs for the building of a new Day School on the Reserve this summer. No further word has been received in regard to the erection of this school.\n\nThe present school is unfit for use this winter. I am enclosing a requisition covering the materials that will be required to erect a building that would be suitable for use as a school this winter. The building could be completed next year when funds become available. You will notice in the requisition that the dimension lumber can be purchased at the Montreal Lake Reserve. At the present time there is a mill operating in the vicinity and this rough lumber could be purchased from them at a very considerable saving; the freight to the Reserve from Prince Albert would be saved and the price would be much cheaper. The cost of this lumber would be about $15.00 per M at the Reserve.\n\nThe labour required for this school would cost about $600.00. The Indians of the Montreal Lake Reserve could do most of the work but it might be necessary to hire a good carpenter for a few days. I could send one or two Indian carpenters from another Reserve for this purpose. If the erection of this building is authorized I would appreciate receiving an accountable cheque for the amount of the labour so that work could begin as soon as the materials are purchased. We have the logs for the walls already, as stated above, and the Indians could begin building these walls.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated so that this school could be built before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: September 29, 1939\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Carlton Indian Agency Trust Account | $600.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nR.

It is noted from your letter that the rough lumber can be secured at a cost of approximately $15.00 a thousand. The other items on the requisition should be purchased from firms on the approved list.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $600.00 for labour will go forward under separate cover. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible. Quite recently you were informed regarding the person to consult if any white labour is necessary.\n\nIt appears from the second paragraph of your letter that even though the items shown on the attached requisition are supplied it will not complete the building. If an additional expenditure of two or three hundred dollars would complete it this fall I believe it would be advisable for you to do so.

Settee, who has been teaching faithfully for fourteen years at Moose Lake and at Montreal Lake, is living in a log house belonging to the Church, twenty-four years old and now unfit for use. The I.D. has never had any expense here for the teacher's residence. He is not a brilliant teacher, but he plods along faithfully, working under considerable difficulties. I think the I.D. ought to have a teacher's house there. The Indians there promised to get out the logs and to square them as their gift. Mr. Gunville, a trader there, will take the contract for building and haul out his own lumber for it. As the Indians are about to build a church there, much of which they will have to do themselves, I think it is very good of them to offer to give the logs for the teacher's house.\n\nJ. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, July 11, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan reports that the house occupied by J. R. Settee, teacher of the Montreal Lake School, which belongs to the church, is now unfit for use and His Lordship states that the Indians have promised to get out logs for a new house and to square them. His Lordship asks the Department to furnish the material necessary to complete the house.\n\nThe Department would like to have a report from you as to whether you consider it necessary that a new house should be built and, if so, what would be the probable cost of the labour and material required. The Department would like you to enclose a rough sketch of the building it is proposed to put up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSilas Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6291, file 617-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th., ultimo, No.118793/5, re the house occupied by Mr. J.R. Settee, teacher of the Montreal Lake school. I have the honor to report that I found that his Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan was perfectly right when he reported that the house in question was unfit for habitation.\n\nWhen at Montreal Lake, I had a few photographs taken of the building, as I wished to submit a copy to Head-quarters. These however have not yet come to hand, immediately they do a copy will be submitted for your inspection.\n\nI would suggest that the Indians offer to get out logs for a new house be accepted, in fact I advised Mr. Settee, to see that this was done. As instructed I am enclosing a rough sketch of the proposed new building.\n\nTaking into consideration the cost of freighting lumber sufficient for floors, partitions, roofing and gable ends, windows, building paper and other incidentals from Prince Albert, the whole cost of the undertaking could be accomplished by the expenditure of $500.00.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nof $500.00. Should the Department undertake to furnish the material necessary to complete the house, I would suggest that authority be granted to have the walls of the building erected now, so that when the cold weather sets in, the necessary material can be hauled, so that the building can be completed before the spring of 1915 opens up.\n\nThe Department of course understand that heavy loads cannot be hauled over the roads leading to Montreal Lake at any other time, other than in the winter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan in a letter addressed to you on the 2nd ultimo stated that the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake is 24 years old and now unfit for use. His Lordship called attention to the fact that the Department had never been at any expense in connection with this house, as it belongs to the church, and thought that a suitable house should be provided. The Indians have promised to get out the logs and square them as their gift and all that remains for the Department to do is to furnish the necessary material to complete the house.\n\nMr. Agent Milligan was asked for a report as to whether he considered it necessary that a new house should be built and, if so, what would be the probable cost of the labour and material required. He has now sent in his report stating that he had a few photographs taken of the building which he will forward later on and he agreed with the Bishop of Saskatchewan that the house in question is unfit for habitation. He recommends that the Department accept\naccept the offer of the Indians to get out the logs. He says that the cost of the labour and material to be furnished by the Department would be $500.00 and he suggests that authority be granted to have the walls of the building erected now, so that when the cold weather sets in the necessary material can be hauled, so that the building can be completed before the spring of 1915 opens up. He encloses sketches of the proposed building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will furnish the necessary material to complete the house to the extent of $500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. A.

Although only a portion of the building is visible, it is nevertheless sufficient to show that a certain amount of improvement could be made to advantage. The roof of the building it will be noticed is covered with striped bark.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 15, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing a photograph of the teacher's residence at Montreal Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you were authorized in official letter of the 4th instant to accept the offer of the Indians to get out the logs for a new building and informed that the Department would furnish the necessary material to complete the house to the extent of $500.00. In view of the delapidated condition of the building the teacher at present occupies this work should be attended to as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

It is a disgrace expecting the Teacher to have to live in his present residence.\n\nA road is now under construction from Wasksiu Lake to Montreal Lake and will run past school and residence.

As our Teacher's Residence at this point belonging to the Church Authorities is in very poor condition, would the Department consider leasing the Manager's residence for an annual rental of $24.00 per year, so to leave house in same condition as we get it in case our Departments builds a new residence at a future date.\n\nI would recommend leasing said building as it will save us building and settle house question for some time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, it is noted you consider that the residence of the former manager of the Hudson's Bay Company at Montreal Lake would be very suitable for a teacher's residence.\n\nThe Department approves your leasing this building at an annual rental of $24 a year, it being understood that the lease will be cancelled at the Department's pleasure, as the necessity of providing a new teacher's residence at this point is receiving attention and whenever funds are available the necessary building will be erected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

He also states that if it is the intention to build arrangements could be made with the Indians to get the logs out this winter, and payment could be made after March 31st. The cost of getting the logs out would be about $100.00.\n\nI can endorse Mr. Davis' remarks on this house and would recommend that if possible a new house be built.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

We are securing this for \u00a324.00 a year\u2014reference your letter of November 5, 1936 and official reply of November 16, 1936. As it was considered that this rented building would serve for another year at least, and as there were so many demands, no provision was made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1935-39 for a new residence at Montreal Lake.\n\nWould you consider it advisable to buy the building from the Hudson's Bay Company that we are at present using as a teacher's residence? Possibly this would be cheaper than erecting a new building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to your letter of Jan. 28th., file 107-6-8, in connection with the Teacher's residence at Montreal Lake, the house we are renting from the Hudson's Bay Co. is an old building of log construction. The logs are sitting on the ground and are rotted.\n\nThis building has very poor floors. It is very cold in winter, and not fit to spend any money on it to repair it, if it had been the Hudson's Bay Co. would have used it and repaired same last year instead of building a new home for their employee.\n\nThis Reserve is practically on the edge of the National Park and now has a highway as far as the Reserve and will be visited by many tourists and I feel that if at all possible something should be done to provide decent living quarters for the Teacher, and also build some Indian homes and clean this Reserve up. If this is not done the tourist trade will get a very poor impression of our Department.\n\nIt will be necessary, this summer, to see that these Indians get some kind of relief work and they could be put to work at getting out logs, building homes for themselves, and also do most of the work on a Teacher's residence.\n\nAt the present time we have a good couple on this Reserve and they are working hard in trying to clean up the Reserve and if we do not give them some encouragement they will soon become discouraged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the teacher's residence at the Montreal Lake Day School. I note you report that the building, which is rented from the Hudson's Bay Company, is in bad condition. This report is considerably different from that contained in your letter of November 5, 1936, the last paragraph of which read \"I would recommend leasing said building as it will save us building and settle house question for some time\". Our difficulty in administering schools is increased when such divergent reports are received within a comparatively short space of time.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of January 28 no special provision has been made for the erection of a new teacher's residence at Montreal Lake during the fiscal year 1935-39. However, it is found that an amount of $100.00 can be made available for securing the logs for a new building. Please arrange with the Indians to bring out these logs before the end of March.\n\nIn the second last paragraph of your letter of the 12th instant you state that most of the work on a new teacher's residence could be done by the Indians. Is it your opinion that the Indians at Montreal Lake are competent to erect a teacher's residence? You might let me know the approximate cost of the doors, windows etc. that would be required. When forwarding this information you should give full details regarding the articles necessary and the quantities in order that we may have sufficient information.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nto place the order here. If, however, any of the articles required for a new teacher's residence could be secured near the school you should give this information stating the name and address of the firm from whom you would recommend purchases be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I have advanced them food supplies, which will be paid out of the proceeds from the logs.\n\nMost of the work on a teacher's residence, particularly the rough work, can be done by the Indians; but I would recommend that a carpenter be hired as a foreman while the work was being done. Any work that the Indians do on this building, I would recommend that they be paid by food and clothing.\n\nA building 30 x 32 with an 8' verandah, one storey, cottage roof, would be large enough. Would it be possible to get the Engineering Branch to make a plan that would be suitable. The house should have two bedrooms, kitchen, and living room and a small bath room. The frame work will be of logs, using plaster board on the inside.\n\nRequisitions for the material required are enclosed. I have estimated the amount needed without a plan and adjustments may be made by the Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in regard to the proposed erection of a new residence for the teacher of the Montreal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nAs I previously informed you no special provision has been made for the erection of this building in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-39. However, it may be possible to secure the amount required for the material mentioned on the requisitions forwarded with your letter. The total cost of these would be approximately $713.00.\n\nWould it be necessary to pay wages in the event of the construction of this building proceeding or would the Indians be willing to do the work if rations were supplied by the Welfare Division? If it is necessary to pay wages you should let me have an estimate of the total amount required.\n\nIt is rather difficult to obtain a plan at this season of the year from the Engineering Branch as they are extremely busy.

Indian Agent Davis has urged the erection of a new teacher's residence. A suitable building can be erected under the supervision of Indian Agent Davis as the Indians will do the work free of charge. The material for the building will have to be supplied and this will cost approximately $713.00.

The funds at their disposal will not allow a full basement, it is my opinion that if possible sufficient funds should be allowed for a full basement otherwise it will be almost impossible to keep the house comfortable in that severe climate. Arrangements should be made to have the logs for a school taken out this winter and a school erected next summer. There are about 46 children at this school.\n\nThos.

This information should be furnished at the earliest possible date, in order that the purchase of the supplies may not be delayed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

Instead of paying wages in this case, we are issuing rations to them.\n\nThe supplies mentioned will be required at an early date in order not to delay the erection of the building. However, I am not exactly certain that the agent requested the proper quantities of the various articles. In order to save time, I would suggest that you obtain prices on the articles shown on the attached purchase requisition, and, in the meantime, I am communicating with the Indian agent to check the quantities. As soon as he replies, I shall advise you and the order can then be placed.\n\nT. R. L.

Out of the requisition for supplies, as submitted, for the amount of $254.00, there is only a balance of $74.00, approximately, for putting on the roof, flooring, shingling, and plastering.\n\nI consider that this is a reasonable figure as, if this work was done in any other way it would cost over twice as much.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo the Purchasing Agent is being requested to forward to you at the earliest possible date the rations requested in your letter of July 5.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

It will be necessary to attach to the account pay lists receipted by the Indians. These pay lists should show the number of days employed etc., and in signing the pay lists the Indians will acknowledge receipt of the supplies which have been purchased for their use.\n\nI also find it necessary to return the account which you forwarded covering the cost of a furnace. No authority appears to have been given you to purchase this. In addition you are fully aware of present purchasing regulations. If the furnace was necessary you should have reported the matter to the Department and purchase would have been made by the Purchasing Branch.\n\nWith reference to your purchase order of August 20, copy of which is enclosed, you may purchase from firms on the approved list the articles mentioned at a cost not exceeding $47.40. It is hoped that this is the last expenditure that will be necessary on this building. It has already cost considerably more than we anticipated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Also I note that you have had a fire in your residence and the floor in the front room was damaged, making it impossible for you to use that room or the bedroom which joins it.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that you may take steps immediately to repair the floor. If the joists were burned under the fire place you may only be able to make a temporary job of the repairs but it will serve for the time being. I do not know how you get lumber at Montreal Lake but I suppose there is a sawmill or someone in that vicinity who handles lumber. However, as the quantity of lumber will not be great you may take steps to procure it and I presume someone in that neighbourhood will be able to help you bring about the repairs to make the house habitable.\n\nWhen this repair work is completed you may send the bills here and I shall forward them to Ottawa. In the meantime I am sending a copy of your letter to our Branch so that they may learn of the conditions under which you people are living.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nRev. G.J. Waite,\nMONTREAL LAKE, Sask.\nMontreal Lake, Sask.,\nJany 25/1941\n\nM. Christianson Esq.,\nFederal Building\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI thought I had better notify you that we have had a fire in the house. There is not a great deal of damage except to the floor in the front room. There is an open fire place and I believe that the floor joists run right under the fire place. I believe that they burnt through under the fire place and worked along under the floor. There is a bit of damage to the floor but there was no other damage. It means we cannot use that room or our bedroom which joins that room. The house is very cold because there are no storm windows. This week with the so called furnace, the cook stove and the open fire going, Mrs. Wait sat around in a fur coat. It is not very convenient now.\n\nThe school is heated with an overhead furnace. Mr. Davis thinks it works but to be candid it does not. This week the children sat in school in their hats, coats and mitts. The school fire is always alight by 8 o'clock in the morning and yet on Friday you could see the frost on the inside walls when I closed school in the afternoon.\n\nI have put in 16 years service in the Department but this is hard place I have ever tackled. The school work is behind simply because the children have not been taught.\n\nI have not notified Leask for I cannot seem to get an answer from them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) G. J. Waite.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith attaching a letter that I have just received from the Reverend G.J. Waite, teacher at Montreal Lake, which speaks for itself. I am also attaching copy of a letter that I have written to him authorizing him to go ahead with what repairs are necessary to the floor in the front room of the teacher's residence, which was damaged by fire. I trust this is in order.\n\nIt is regrettable that the Reverend and Mrs. Waite are living under conditions such as he describes, as they have rendered splendid work in the Indian Department in years past on the John Smith Reserve. I advised you some time ago that I intend to visit this Agency during the coming Spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

As you are no doubt aware a new teacher's residence was erected at Montreal Lake under the direction of Indian Agent Davis in the summer of 1938. This building cost $1253.27 of which amount $240.55 was for labour and the balance for material and hardware. As Mr. Davis was supposed to have personally supervised the construction of this building it is difficult to understand why Rev. Mr. Waite considers it so unsatisfactory. I note that you intend to visit the Carlton Agency during the coming spring and at that time you will no doubt go to Montreal Lake and you can then report to the Department regarding the teacher's residence and the school, both of which were built under the Agent's direction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.
