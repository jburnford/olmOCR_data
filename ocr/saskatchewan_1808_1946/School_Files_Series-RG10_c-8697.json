Could you let me have about three copies of the first two plans of the set.\n\nIn regard to electric lighting for the Stony Plain School, will you please advise if this is to be installed as per your letter of June 23rd, to Mr. Gooderham, copy of which he has forwarded to me. There would not appear to be any provision in the plans or specifications for wiring of this school.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 15, 1947.\n\nMr. E. A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWainwright, Alberta.\n\nNew Schools - Highwood and Stony Plain.\n\nThese new sets of plans were forwarded to you, as requested in your letter of October 15, 1947.\n\nWe are not in a position yet to advise if funds will be available to the extent of the $3,500.00 required to install electricity and running water at the Stony Plain Day School.\n\nThe specifications and blue-prints for the standard one-room school do not call for electrical wiring. However, we have had this school wired elsewhere during the course of construction. We are quite prepared to leave this matter for decision between the contractor and yourselves. It would be appreciated if we could be informed as to the approximate cost of having this school wired suitably. It may be possible that we could have it wired this year and then arrange for the installation of the poles and lines next year, when funds are available.\n\nBernard F.

This well hit the water bearing quicksand at 45 feet and is three feet into the strata, giving about four feet of water in the three foot hole. We have found that the quicksand wells will eventually fill in with sand but in the meantime it should provide sufficient water for a few years.\n\n\"The cement work for the basement of the Stony Plain school has now been completed and the contractors are at present working on the basement for the Michel School in an endeavour to finish all the cement work before the cold weather sets in.\n\n\"The road in to the Stony Plain school, approximately 200 yards, has also been put through but will require a little more grading when the bulldozer is finishing up the levelling of the school site.\"\nOttawa, December 1, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A.

These should be approximately the same but through an error in billing from one of the lumber subcontractors, some lumber delivered to Michel School was billed as delivered to Stoney Plain School. Adjustment will be made on the next progress report.\n\nIf road conditions would permit both schools could be finished up in about one week but all roads are blocked with snow at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.

However, although the contractor has to date earned $17,410.99, he has been paid the sum of $14,257.37 only. The difference is due to the fact that when dealing with the fourth claim you authorized a payment of $1,600.00 against an amount of $4,753.62 as claimed.\n\nAttached is an interim audit report made by our Cost Inspection and Audit Division which was carried out for the purpose indicated in letter dated July 5, copy of which is also attached.\n\nIn view of the cost findings, it is assumed that, prior to making final settlement to the contractor, you will now consider further payment on account.\n\nWL/S\nChief Treasury Officer.\nCOST INSPECTION AND AUDIT DIVISION\nOFFICE OF THE\nCOMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n375 Wellington Street\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 5, 1948\n\nMr. W.

Robertson.\n\nLABOUR AND LABOUR CHARGES: $6960.71\n\nPayroll charges aggregating $6960.71 are distributed as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Labour                       | $6453.33 |\n| Holiday Pay                  | 193.62   |\n| Workmen's Compensation       | 289.34   |\n| Public Liability & Property Damage | 18.81 |\n| Unemployment Insurance       | 35.61    |\n| **Total**                    | **$6960.71** |\n\nPayrolls have been examined in detail and compared with the original paysheets. Daily time records were not available for examination as these are destroyed once they have been transferred to and balanced with paysheets.\n\nThe rates of pay observed on the job were in accordance with those approved on the agreement and based on a 44 hour week with overtime at time and a half. Travelling time was paid at regular hourly rate, and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\nSuperintendent $1.87\u00bd per hour\n(based on fixed salary of $75.00 per week, 40 hour week)\nCarpenter foreman 1.40 per hour\nCarpenters 1.25 - 1.35\nCarpenter Apprentice .63\nLabour foreman .90\nLabour .80\nIndian labour, approved by Indian Agent .55 - .75\nInstrumentman 1.05\n\nOn payroll # 47 for the period end October 16/47, an error of $2.00 has been noted in the computation of L. Gabrielson's wages which are shown as $37.20 instead of $39.20. As this employee terminated his services with the contractor in January, some difficulty may be experienced in adjusting this amount.\nHOLIDAY PAY has been computed throughout at the rate of 3% with all employees including Indians being covered. As in the Michel Reserve School contract, some adjustment will be necessary to bring the charges in line with the actual rates applicable to each employee. Holiday Pay should also have been added to the payrolls in calculating workman's compensation and Public Liability and Property Damage charges.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION charge has been calculated at 4% of normal payroll throughout the project. Adjustments arising out of assessments on individual earnings over $3000 will be credited on the final claim.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE Insurance is carried by the Contractor and is in good standing. Charges levied against this project were calculated at .31% of the gross payroll from the commencement of the project to Payroll #2 for the period ending January 15th, 1948, and at .230% on the remaining payrolls included to date. The current year's rate has since been established at .22%, and the required adjustment will be included in the final claim.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE contributions have been deducted from all employees with the exception of Superintendent H.G. Ellanwood, who receives a fixed salary of $75.00 per week. The employer's portion was calculated on the basis of 75% of employee's contribution.\n\nINCOME TAX - The records were examined for compliance with income tax regulations and evidence of deductions and remittances were produced to the examiner's satisfaction.\n\nINSURANCE covering fire risk on the project is contained in Asta Insurance Co. Policy #7860 for $11,000 in the names of the Department of Indian Affairs and Poole Construction Co. Ltd. The original policy has been lodged with the Department through the Indian Agent. The duplicate copy of the policy has been examined and payment of premium verified.\n\nMATERIALS - $5765.06\n\nInvoices for materials, small tools, either purchased by the contractor or supplied from their own stock, have been checked to purchase orders and requisitions and also certified by the Indian Agent. Evidence of payment by the contractor to the suppliers has been verified in all cases.\n\nTransfers of materials from the Winterburn School to the Michel School or vice versa, and items distributed between the two schools were found to be properly accounted for with the exception of a 50\u00a2 error on Invoice #1439, where the amount of $51.69 was transferred instead of $51.69. This is to be adjusted on the final claim.\n\nSMALL TOOLS\n\nA joint inventory of small tools amounting to $71.82, which were purchased and charged to the Michel and Winterburn Schools, has been set up.\nTRAVELLING EXPENSES - $294.00\n\nTravelling expenses have been paid to A.C. Emsen, job foreman, who provided conveyance to his crew in his personally owned car at the rate of $8.00 per round trip, which in this instance represented 26 miles. Evidence of payment has been ascertained and the number of trips checked with the number of days worked during each period.\n\nHired Equipment - $27.00\n\nCharges recorded under this caption represent services of G. Morin, with team, at the rate of $1.50 per hour, which compares closely with the minimum rate approved.\n\nTRUCKING - $156.00\n\nTrucking charges on the Company's equipment were set at $3.00 per hour, including operator, and approved by the Indian Agent. Daily time cards were examined and found to correspond with the invoices submitted and carried the foreman's signature.\n\nSUB-CONTRACTS\n\nMillwork - W.M. Clark Lumber Co., have agreed to supply all millwork at an estimated price of $1859.00. This was the lower of two submissions received by the Contractor and was found acceptable by the Indian Agent. So far, invoices amounting to $1565.15, have been submitted on this project.\n\nPainting & Decorating - The firm of Jack Mason was the only party interested in this job and has agreed to complete painting and decorating for $1050. To date accounts have been rendered for $840, representing 80% of the work completed.\n\nElectrical - Al's Electric, 12130 - 95A Street, have been authorized to supply and install electrical wiring and outlets at the price of $515 and to supply and install standard fixtures in the classroom and residence for $195. To date accounts have been rendered for $490.40.\n\nPlumbing & Heating - The sub-letting of this work has been carried out on a cost of labour and material basis, as no firm appeared interested in submitting estimates.\n\nThe firm of Dow & Scott have to date rendered accounts for $94.15 of which $9.50 represents labour.\n\nThe firm of Press & Maxwell have agreed to supply and install furnace and heating system on the same basis, and have submitted accounts for $410.56 to date. Completion of this phase of the work is estimated to cost approximately $450 more. The General Contractor has a sufficient hold-back against these two firms and a detail audit will be performed when all work has been completed.\nCOMMISSION OR FEE - $1568.64\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Poole Construction Company have charged a 10% commission or fee on all costs incurred to date, omitting any commission on any earnings of the Company arising out of rental of Company owned equipment.\n\nENCLOSURES:\n\nProgress Certificates - 3 copies\nSummary of Charges - 3 copies\nPayrolls, Suppliers Invoices and Vouchers - 1 copy\nAuditor's Report - 5 copies\n\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nJune 26th, 1948\n\nApproved:\n\nJ.L.

Robertson and the report therein follows:\n\n**LABOR AND LABOR CHARGES - $16,829.47**\n\nThis amount represents the balance of wages and related charges to the completion of the contract and brings the total labor cost for the project to $63,529.47.\n\nThe payrolls submitted have been examined in detail and calculations have been found correct. Transfers from original time cards to the payrolls have been found in order.\n\nThe scale of wages paid by the Contractor was in accordance with rates that have been approved and set out in the Agreement. The rates observed were based on an 8 hour day, 44 hour week with time and a half for overtime. Travelling time was paid at the regular rate and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\nEffective April 1st, 1948, the following rates were paid by the Contractor in compliance with an Agreement reached between the Edmonton Building Exchange and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America:\n\n- Carpenter foreman - $1.50 per hour\n- Carpenters - $1.40 per hour\n- Laborers - $.70 per hour\n- Superintendents - $2.00 per hour, based on fixed salary of $60.00 per week, with approval of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nIndian labor has been paid at 75\u00a2 per hour, with approval of Indian Superintendent.\n\nAn underpayment of $2.00 noted on payroll #47 for Oct. 14, 1947, appearing in Claim #5, in connection with L. Gabrielson has not been possible to adjust as this former employee could not be located. No further action is contemplated by the Contractor.\nHOLIDAY PAY - $64.05\n\nDiscrepancies in the calculation of Holiday Pay in Claims 1 to 4 inclusive have been adjusted in this claim by a debit voucher for $13.72 which has been added to the charge of $40.34 applicable to the payrolls submitted with the present claim, making a total charge of $54.05.\n\nThe Employees' Holiday Pay Books have been examined and proof of payment established.\n\nHoliday Pay charges have also been taken into account in the computation of the other payroll charges.\n\nHOFMANN'S COMPENSATION - $20.79\n\nThe Contractor's assessment rate by the Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board has been 4% for the years 1947 and 1948.\n\nThe amount presently claimed represents charges of $48.73 applicable to the payrolls submitted with this claim less a rebate of $27.94 received by the Contractor on 1947 payments in connection with employees whose earnings exceeded the maximum assessable amount of $2000 for that year.\n\nA further examination of the Contractor's records will be made on receipt of the returns from the W.C.B. for 1948 in order to secure any further credit that may accrue.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE - $2.70\n\nThe Contractor has maintained adequate coverage against the above risks throughout the Contract. The payment of premiums which were based on .15% of the estimated gross payroll for 1947 and on .22% for 1948, has been established.\n\nThe calculations have been reviewed in connection with the present and previous claims and the amount charged has been found sufficiently accurate.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE - $4.96\n\nThis amount represents the Contractor's portion of contributions paid on behalf of insurable employees listed on the payrolls submitted herewith. The Unemployment Insurance Books for the current fiscal year were produced for examination and satisfactory evidence given that the above Act has been complied with throughout the contract.\n\nINCOME TAX\n\nThe Contractor has complied with the Income Tax Act and Regulations in retaining the necessary deductions from taxable employees and remitting same to the Receiver General regularly.\n\nMATERIALS - $244.66\n\nInvoices for materials purchased or supplied from the Contractor's stock have been compared with purchase Orders and requisitions as well as checked for calculations and extensions. A discrepancy of 10\u00a2 in listing Invoice # 7745 on Claim # 1 has been adjusted. Also Invoice # 1382 for $5.30 which was charged in error on Claim # 4 has now been deleted.\nAlthough the Contractor did not have delivery slips to establish proof of delivery of materials, the Indian Agent was able to confirm in most instances that the materials charged had actually been used on the project.\n\nMaterials divided between the Stony Plain and Michel Schools have been checked closely for possible duplication and found correctly recorded.\n\n**SMALL TOOLS - $24.97 Credit**\n\nA joint inventory of small tools maintained in connection with the Stony Plain and Michel Schools has been reviewed and a credit of $24.97 has been obtained to cover items retained by the Contractor. The entire amount has been credited to this school in view of the relatively small amount involved.\n\n**FIRE INSURANCE**\n\nAn Insurance Policy with the Aetna Insurance Co. for $11,000 has been maintained on the school while under construction. On advice from the Agency Superintendent the Policy has not been renewed by the Contractor since it expired in October 1948.\n\n**TRAVELLING EXPENSES - $36.00**\n\nThis amount has been paid to employees of the Contractor for providing transportation to the men in their personal car. The round trip covered some 26 miles and the rate of $2.00 per round trip which has been charged appears fair and reasonable.\n\n**SUB-CONTRACTOR**\n\n**MILLWORK - W.H. Clark Lumber Co. - $14.03**\n\nInvoices for millwork supplied by this sub-contractor and submitted in the present and previous claims amount to $1579.19 although they have not all been listed under sub-contracts. This amount is well within the approved tender for $1629.00.\n\nThe above charge of $14.03 represents an invoice for $13.73 for finishings and a 30\u00a2 undercharge in Claim #4 where credit invoice #1439 has been listed as $11.89 instead of $11.59. The details pertaining to invoice #1439 have been explained in the audit report covering Progress Claim #5 for the Michel School.\n\nThe millwork and other materials supplied by this Company have been paid by the prime contractor on the basis of the invoices submitted and full settlement thereof has been verified.\n\n**PAINTING & DECORATING - $210.00 - Jack Mason**\n\nThis amount represents the balance of the account for painting and decorating performed by Jack Mason at the agreed price of $1050 which has been settled in full by the prime contractor.\n\n**ELECTRICAL - Al's Electric 12130 - 95 A Street - Edmonton**\n\nThis sub-contractor has supplied and installed the electrical wiring and standard fixtures in the school and living quarters at a total cost of $490.40, which charges have been included in previous claims. An estimated cost of $310 had been approved by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nAlthough this sub-contractor has not provided a Statement Declaration, as requested, it has not been found necessary to hold up the claim as the owner has performed most of the work himself and prime...\ncontractor has a sufficient hold-back on other projects to be protected against the liability for any unpaid accounts of the sub-contractor.\n\nPLUMBING - Dow & Scott Ltd. - $576.23\n\nThe above firm has supplied and installed the plumbing of materials and fixtures required at a total cost of $151.40 including $10.00 for labor. The above charge represents the balance of the account which has been fully paid by the prime contractor.\n\nHEATING - Freeze & Maxwell Co., Ltd. - $676.99\n\nThe prime contractor was not able to secure competitive bids for the completion of this portion of the work and consequently has had the work completed at current market rates.\n\nThe firm of Freeze & Maxwell agreed to perform the work on this basis. The total cost has been $1087.95 and the above charge of $676.99 represents the balance of the accounts submitted in this claim. The costs are distributed as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Shop labor            | $172.16|\n| Job labor             | $164.45|\n| 729B Furnace          | $404.66|\n| Sales tax             | $33.05 |\n| Registers & other materials | $33.63 |\n\n$1087.95\n\nAn approximate mark-up of 40% has been added to the subcontractors' actual costs for labor and materials. Thus the furnace which cost the sub-contractor $323.75 has been billed at $404.66. Similarly the total labor cost to the sub-contractor amounted to $75.46 for both schools or $37.73 each, whereas $33.61 has been charged for each school.\n\nThe Prime contractor (Poole Construction) and the Indian Superintendent have pointed out that they had no alternative but to award the sub-contract to a firm that would agree to do the work at their regular rates, which the firm of Freeze & Maxwell have followed in this case.\n\nPRIME CONTRACTOR'S COMMISSION OR FEE - $260.20\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Agreement the Poole Construction Co., Ltd., have claimed a fee of 10% on the cost of the work completed since the previous claim. The amount of $260.20 claimed in this application is accurate and brings the total fee on the contract to $1378.64.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe payrolls and accounts submitted by the Contractor in the present and previous claims have all been checked and proof of payment established for all amounts claimed.\n\nThe sub-contractors have received full payment from the prime contractor and have in all, but one case, (All's Electric), furnished Statutory Declarations to the effect that all their accounts pertaining to this contract have been fully paid.\nThe Contractor has produced the necessary statement from the Indian Superintendent to confirm the completion of the contract in a satisfactory manner and in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nSubject to the foregoing remarks, I certify that, in accordance with the provisions of the above contract, I have examined the accounts and records of the contractor's invoices as they pertain to this contract and I have received all the necessary information and explanations and the amount of $20275.24 is the fair cost thereof as shown by the accounts, records and data given me.\n\nJ.

However, letters of\nclearance from the Workmen's Compensation Board to cover the\nsubcontractors have not been received. As the Contractor is\nanxious to receive payment, he has submitted this claim\nwithout the necessary clearance from the Board in the belief\nthat the balance owing on the Michel School project has\nsufficient holdback against any W.C.B. charges.\n\nThe\nThe Contractor has credited this final claim with the value of the small tools that are surplus to both schools i.e. the Michel and Stony Plain Reserve. A further credit appears in this claim as a result of adjusting W.C.B. charges on salaries in excess of the maximum rate.\n\nSubject to the remarks contained in our Cost Auditor's report and to those set out herein we report that the total cost to construct the school and residence at the Stony Plain Reserve amounted to $20,273.24.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.T.

Simpson Western Limited,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Purchase Order 33648\n\nThe above Purchase Order was forwarded to you on 31st August, 1948, ordering supplies for the teacher's residence at the Stony Plain Indian Day School.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, our Superintendent at Winterburn Alberta, advises us in a letter dated 7th March, 1949, that the articles ordered on the above Purchase Order have been received, but you have not yet forwarded him an Invoice. Please forward your Invoice covering the articles ordered on the Purchase Order to Mr. Robertson at once, so that he can certify it and send it to this office for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Col. Murray,\n\nIn February I visited the Sioux Plain Day School and was impressed particularly with the number of boys in attendance. It was a blizzard day and I found 41 pupils in attendance. The young teacher, Mr. Laddie, appeared to be a capable teacher and had his classes well organized.\n\nI learned that the average attendance for June 30 had been 27, and the highest attendance for the term was 58. Superintendent Robertson, who accompanied me, stated that there will be another in the fall of school\u2014a new hall. It is, therefore, necessary to find space for another classroom.\n\nAs you may know, it is proposed to move the agency headquarters from Wainwright to the City of Edmonton, and, for your information, I am attaching copy of a letter which I have written to Mr. Pratt in this regard.\n\nThe agency office is about a mile to the east of the school and would, in our opinion, make a very suitable school to take 30 or 35 pupils. It is well constructed, well heated by a furnace in good condition and, so far as I can see, it will be necessary only to remove some partitions and change certain windows to make it a very suitable classroom.\n\nAs stated in the letter to Mr. Pratt, the cottage across the road could, in turn, be made the home of the teacher and I believe this would be a real inducement for a good, able minded teacher to apply. The total cost of turning the office into a school should not exceed $1,000.00.\n\nFor various reasons, therefore, it is hoped that the agency headquarters are moved into the city in the early summer and that this building can be made ready for a class before the fall term.\n\nYou will be advised of progress.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nMarch 16th, 1949.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt, Esq.,\nGeneral Executive Assistant,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Agency Administrative Office\n\nOn my return from Ottawa I got in touch with the District Architect, Department of Public Works, and advised him that it was the wish of the Director of Indian Affairs that he obtain office space in Edmonton for the headquarters of the Edmonton Indian Agency, and that this space would be required as soon as possible, preferably early in the new fiscal year.\n\nI also informed the Superintendent of the Agency, Mr. Robertson, and the present Fur Supervisor, Mr. W. B. Skead. It was known that the District Architect would be glad to have any leads or assistance that these men could give in locating office space in that city, as space there is very scarce.\n\nSpace is required for the Superintendent and his staff of three clerks, also the Fur Supervisor. I hope you agree that the latter should be established at the Edmonton Agency office. This office should also be the headquarters of the Welfare Officer, Inspector of Schools and Building Supervisor, when these officials are working in or out of Edmonton. In our opinion the space should not be less than 600 sq. ft.\n\nI have to report that D.P.W. officials are finding it very difficult to locate any office space. Oil companies are offering large rentals for any available space in the city, and it is understood that good space is costing as high as $4.00 a sq.ft.\n\nThe District Architect has been advised that location is not of first importance to Indian Affairs. He stated this week that he is constantly surveying the whole situation and following any possible leads, and has hopes that suitable space will be located.\n\nIn the meantime, a Clerk, Grade 3, with a homes in Edmonton, has been detailed by the Civil Service Commission to fill the vacancy at the Agency. This man is boarding with the Superintendent at Winterburn.\nW. J. F. Pratt, Esq.\n\nMarch 11/49\n\nThe Superintendent and members of his office staff, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Sims, know that they must find their own living quarters when and if the office is moved into Edmonton.\n\nOn a recent visit to the present Agency, consideration was given to the disposition of the buildings when vacated. The office proper will make an excellent day school with very few changes. Another day school is badly needed, and I am writing to Col. Neary, sending you a copy, explaining the local situation in this respect.\n\nTo house the teacher of this school, the cottage, now occupied by the clerk and immediately across the road from the office, could be used. The warehouse, which is at the rear of the office, must be retained and it will only require a new entrance to definitely separate it from the school.\n\nThe Superintendent's house would be turned over to the Assistant Indian Agency, Mr. Callihoo. The house, which he is now occupying, is the property of the Stoney Plain Band of Indians, and it is believed that the Health & Welfare Department might make some arrangements with the Band to use it for a nursing station, if the Band do not wish to make use of it in some other manner.\n\nYou will, therefore, understand, Mr. Pratt, in moving from Winterburn to Edmonton there is no wastage, and in fact there would be a distinct saving in capital outlay.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nOttawa, 9th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nWith reference to telephone conversation with the Education Division this morning, we have now decided to transfer $2,300.00 from the Louis Bull Day School to the Stony Plain Day School. This transfer will permit payment of the balance due the contractor and will leave some funds on hand for minor local expenditures in connection with the completion of the school.\n\nPlease cancel our memorandum of 5th March, 1949, in regard to this matter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. W.J.F. PRATT,\nGeneral Executive Assistant,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nStony Plain Indian Day School.\n\nBy now, you will have received Mr. Gooderham's letter of March 11 outlining his plan for having the present agency buildings at Wintersburn used as a second room for the Stony Plain Indian Day School.\n\nThis day school was erected as an experiment a year ago and its attendance has proven a pleasant surprise. At the time of our educational survey we had hoped that the attendance would warrant its continuance as a one-room Indian day school but now we find that at least a two-room school will be required next year.\n\nWe had intended to make temporary arrangements for this second classroom but are most interested in the possibility of obtaining the former agency buildings as a second classroom.\n\nBernard E.

Do you wish me to secure estimates from some of the local contractors as to cost of removing partitions and changing windows in the present office in order to fit it for a classroom?\n\nI understand that the dead-line for Alberta teacher's contracts for the coming school year is July 20th. Should advertisements be placed now for the teacher for this second classroom here and for the teacher for the school at Alexis Reserve. There is also a possibility that Mr. Leskiw will not return for the coming year and if so we will require another teacher at Stony Plain Reserve. Mr. Leskiw has promised to let me know definitely in a week or ten days.\n\nIf Miss Dandanesu's application for the Alexander's school is not accepted or if she does not accept the position at the salary which can be offered, we will also need a teacher at that point.\n\nIf the advertisements are placed, will you please send me a supply of application forms.\n\nE.

He has decided to return to Stony Plain School next term and asks that he be given the senior grades to teach.\n\nThe attendance at the two schools should be about as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number of Pupils |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| Grade 1 | 7 plus 12 new pupils...19 |\n| Grade 2 | 14              |\n| Grade 3 | 7               |\n| Grade 4 | 7               |\n| Grade 5 | 4               |\n| Grade 6 | 4               |\n| Grade 7 | 2               |\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Leskiw and we would suggest that Grades 1 and 2 be left in the No.1 School and that Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, attend the new school to be set up in the office building. This would leave the older children under Mr. Leskiw's supervision which I think would be advisable.\n\nI have not as yet been able to secure tenders on the alterations required in the office building but will try and get them away to you in a day or two.\n\nE.

Day School #2\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of our wire to Col. B. F. Kearny requesting authority as soon as possible to purchase a new furnace for the Stony Plain Indian Day School #2 at a cost of approximately $200.00.\n\nWe have been having considerable trouble with this furnace and before Mr. Robertson left for the North Country he instructed Keeler's Sheet Metal and Vacuum Service to inspect the furnace and make any minor repairs that were necessary. Mr. Keeler inspected the furnace today and immediately phoned this office to say that in his opinion, the furnace was completely worn out and no repair would be involved. Mr. Keeler is considered to be a very reliable furnace expert and it was felt that in this case his advice should be followed.\n\nAs it is too cold to operate the school at this time of year without heat the children have been released until the middle of next week when it is hoped that authority will have been received and the new furnace installed.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nC.

It is a condition of this Builders' Risk Insurance, wherein the rate and premium are based on an average amount of liability during the period of construction, that at any date while this policy is in force, the actual amount of insurance thereunder is that proportion of the provisional amount that the actual value of the described property on that date bears to the value at the date of completion, but shall not in any case exceed the provisional amount.\n\n4. In consideration of the reduced rate at which this policy is written, it is a condition of this insurance that in the event of loss, this Company shall be liable for no greater proportion than that the provisional amount of insurance under this policy bears to the value of the described property at date of completion.\n\n5. Permission is given to do such work and to keep and use such materials as are usual in the erection and completion of buildings.\n\n6. In event of loss, the amount of such loss shall be automatically reinstated and in consideration of such reinstatement the insured shall pay this Company an additional premium computed at pro rata of the rate at which this policy is written for the unexpired term of this policy on the amount of loss paid.\n\n7. Other insurance concurrent in form, range and wording herewith permitted.\n\n8. This policy also covers direct loss or damage by lightning to the property insured (meaning thereby the commonly accepted use of the term \"lightning\", and in no case to include loss or damage by cyclones, tornadoes or other causes whether fires, waters or storms, but if dynamo, electric motor, generator, boiler or other electrical appliance or devices are insured it is made a condition of this contract that any loss or damage to them such as may be caused by lightning or other electrical currents artificial or natural is expressly excluded, and that this Company shall likewise be exempt from loss or damage to any part of the property insured by lightning striking outside the machines themselves. It is also understood and agreed and made a condition of this contract that if there is other insurance upon the property damaged, this Company shall be liable only for such proportion of any direct loss or damage by lightning as the steps above provide that the property hereby insured bears to the whole amount insured therein, whether such other insurance is with a similar clause or not.\n\n9. If this policy is divided into two or more items, the foregoing shall apply to each item separately.\n\nLoss, if any, payable to:\n\nAttached to and forming part of policy No. 7860 of Aetna Insurance Company.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe; Day Schools, Michel and Stony Plain Schools.\n\nI am enclosing herewith original policies of the Aetna Insurance Company Nos. 7859 and 7860, covering fire risk on the above two projects, which have been turned over to me by the Poole Construction Co.\n\nE.A.

They are minimum rates only and nothing herein contained shall be considered as exempting contractors and subcontractors from the payment of higher rates in any instance where, during the continuance of the work, such higher rates are fixed by provincial legislation, by agreements between employers and employees in the district or by changes in prevailing practice.\n\nWhere, by provincial legislation, or by agreement or current practice, the working hours of any class of workers are less than 44 per week, such lesser hours may be permitted provided they are not used as a means of emergency as may be approved by the Minister of Labour and then only subject to the payment of overtime rates as specified by the Minister of Labour.\n\nA. I. (See next page)\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages and overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees all wages for services performed or for any hours of service at wages and rates of wages set forth in the schedule or fixed hereafter by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this clause, and also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and no book or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed prior to execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the contract and labour remain in arrear; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with. In the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the provisions herein contained to secure the payment of wages have been complied with, and that the workmen named and as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed under said work and if a claim, demand therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished by the Contractor he may such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as the workmen are payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subcontracting other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained. Subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the provisions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister, except portion of the work to be performed shall be done by the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA. 1.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\nENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICE\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nFOR STANDARD COMBINED\nONE CLASSROOM INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nWITH TEACHER'S QUARTERS\nAND\nTWO CLASSROOM INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nWITH TEACHER'S QUARTERS\n\nCONTENTS\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS ........................................

It may be possible that we could have it wired this year and then arrange for the installation of the pole line next year, when funds are available.\n\nBernard F.

These should be approximately the same but through an error in billing from one of the lumber sub-contractors, some lumber delivered to Michel School was billed as delivered to Stoney Plain School. Adjustment will be made on the next progress report.\n\nIf road conditions would permit both schools could be finished up in about one week but all roads are blocked with snow at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.A.

NEARY,\n\nConstruction of Indian School and Residence,\nStony Plain Reserve\nPoole Construction Co., Ltd. - Contractors\n\nYour file will indicate that you have already handled four progress claims in connection with the above. However, although the contractor has to date earned $17,410.99, he has been paid the sum of $14,257.37 only. The difference is due to the fact that when dealing with the fourth claim you authorized a payment of $1,600.00 against an amount of $4,753.62 as claimed.\n\nAttached is an interim audit report made by our Cost Inspection and Audit Division which was carried out for the purpose indicated in letter dated July 5, copy of which is also attached.\n\nIn view of the cost findings, it is assumed that, prior to making final settlement to the contractor, you will now consider further payment on account.\n\nWL/S\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nCOST INSPECTION AND AUDIT DIVISION\nOFFICE OF THE\nCOMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n375 Wellington Street\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 5, 1948\n\nMr. W.

Ltd. - Contractor\n\nAudit report for Progress Claims Nos. 1-4 inc.- $17,410.98\n\nThe Audit of Progress Claims 1 to 4 inclusive has been performed in the Contractor's Head office in Edmonton, and in conjunction with the records and information obtained from the Indian Agent, Mr. E.A. Robertson.\n\nLABOUR AND LABOUR CHARGES: - $6960.71\n\nPayroll charges aggregating $6960.71 are distributed as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Amount   |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Labour                       | $6453.33 |\n| Holiday Pay                  | 192.62   |\n| Workmen's Compensation       | 259.54   |\n| Public Liability & Property Damage | 18.61 |\n| Unemployment Insurance       | 35.61    |\n| **Total**                    | **$6960.71** |\n\nPayrolls have been examined in detail and compared with the original paysheets. Daily time records were not available for examination as these are destroyed once they have been transferred to and balanced with paysheets.\n\nThe rates of pay observed on the job were in accordance with those approved on the agreement and based on 44 hour week with overtime at time and a half. Travelling time was paid at regular hourly rate, and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\n| Position                        | Rate per hour |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| Superintendent                  | $1.87\u00bd        |\n| Carpenter foreman               | 1.40          |\n| Carpenters                      | 1.25 - 1.35   |\n| Carpenter Apprentice            | .63           |\n| Labour foreman                  | .90           |\n| Labour                          | .80           |\n| Indian labour, approved by      | .55 - .75     |\n| Indian Agent                    |               |\n| Instrumentman                   | 1.05          |\n\nOn payroll # 47 for the period end October 16/47, an error of $2.00 has been noted in the computation of L. Gabrielson's wages which are shown as $37.20 instead of $39.20. As this employee terminated his services with the contractor in January, some difficulty may be experienced in adjusting this amount.\nHOLIDAY PAY has been computed throughout at the rate of 3% with all employees including Indians being covered. As in the Michel Reserve School contract, some adjustment will be necessary to bring the charges in line with the actual rates applicable to each employee. Holiday Pay should also have been added to the payrolls in calculating Workmen's Compensation and Public Liability and Property Damage charges.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION charge has been calculated at 4% of actual payroll throughout the project. Adjustments arising out of assessments on individual earnings over $2000 will be credited on the final claim.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE Insurance is carried by the Contractor and is in good standing. Charges levied against this project were calculated at .31% of the gross payroll from the commencement of the project to Payroll # 2 for the period ending January 25th, 1948, and at .230% on the remaining payrolls included to date. The current year's rate has since been established at .250%, and the required adjustment will be included in the final claim.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE contributions have been deducted from all employees with the exception of Superintendent H.G. Ellenwood, who receives a fixed salary of $75.00 per week. The employer's portion was calculated on the basis of 75% of employee's contribution.\n\nINCOME TAX - The records were examined for compliance with Income Tax regulations and evidence of deductions and remittances were produced to the examiner's satisfaction.\n\nINSURANCE covering fire risk on the project is contained in Aetna Insurance Co. Policy # 7860 for $11,000 in the names of the Department of Indian Affairs and Poole Construction Co. Ltd. The Original Policy has been lodged with the Department through the Indian Agent. The duplicate copy of the Policy has been examined and payment of premium verified.\n\nMATERIALS - $5703.08\n\nInvoices for materials, small tools, either purchased by the contractor or supplied from their own stock, have been checked to purchase orders and requisitions and also certified by the Indian Agent. Evidence of payment by the contractor to the suppliers has been verified in all cases.\n\nTransfers of materials from the Winterburn School to the Michel School or vice versa, and items distributed between the two schools were found to be properly accounted for with the exception of a 30\u00a2 error on invoice # 1459, where the amount of $51.59 was transferred instead of $51.59. This is to be adjusted on the final claim.\n\nSMALL TOOLS\n\nA joint inventory of small tools amounting to $71.89, which were purchased and charged to the Michel and Winterburn Schools, has been set up.\nTRAVELLING EXPENSES - $294.00\n\nTravelling expenses have been paid to A.C. Butson, job foreman, who provided conveyance to his crew in his personally owned car at the rate of $2.00 per round trip, which in this instance represented 26 miles. Evidence of payment has been ascertained and the number of trips checked with the number of days worked during each period.\n\nHired Equipment - $57.00\n\nCharges recorded under this caption represent services of G. Morin, with team, at the rate of $1.50 per hour, which compares closely with the minimum rate approved.\n\nTRUCKING - $156.00\n\nTrucking charges on the Company's equipment were set at $3.00 per hour, including operator, and approved by the Indian Agent. Daily time cards were examined and found to correspond with the invoices submitted and carried the foreman's signature.\n\nSUB-CONTRACTS\n\nMillwork - W.M. Clark Lumber Co., have agreed to supply all millwork at an estimated price of $1829.00. This was the lower of two submissions received by the Contractor and was found acceptable by the Indian Agent. So far, invoices amounting to $1565.16, have been submitted on this project.\n\nPainting & Decorating - The firm of Jack Mason was the only party interested in this job and has agreed to complete painting and decorating for $1050. To date accounts have been rendered for $840, representing 80% of the work completed.\n\nElectrical - Al's Electric, 12130 - 9th Street, have been authorized to supply and install electrical wiring and outlets at the price of $315 and to supply and install standard fixtures in the classroom and residence for $195. To date accounts have been rendered for $400.40.\n\nPlumbing & Heating - The sub-letting of this work has been carried out on a cost of labour and material basis, as no firm appeared interested in submitting estimates.\n\nThe firm of Dow & Scott have to date rendered accounts for $94.15 of which $9.50 represents labour.\n\nThe firm of Freese & Maxwell have agreed to supply and install furnace and heating system on the same basis, and have submitted accounts for $410.96 to date. Completion of this phase of the work is estimated to cost approximately $450 more. The General Contractor has a sufficient hold-back against these two firms and a detail audit will be performed when all work has been completed.\nCOMMISSION OR FEE - $1568.64\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement, the Poole Construction Company have charged a 10% commission or fee on all costs incurred to date, omitting any commission on any earnings of the Company arising out of rental of Company owned equipment.\n\nENCLOSURES:\n\nProgress Certificates - 3 copies\nSummary of Charges - 3 copies\nPayroll, Suppliers Invoices and Vouchers - 1 copy\nAuditor's Report - 5 copies\n\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nJune 25th, 1948\n\nJ.L.

Lushkin,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFrom J.L. Villeneuve, Treasury Auditor, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nFor Construction of Indian Day School & Residence\nStony Plain Reserve - Edmonton Agency\nPaulo Construction Co., Ltd. - Contractor\n\nPROGRESS CLAIM #5 - $8222.63 (Final)\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim #5, in connection with the above contract has been completed by the undersigned at the Contractor's office in Edmonton and in conjunction with records and information furnished by the Superintendent of the Edmonton Agency, Mr. R.A. Robertson and the report therein follows:\n\nLABOR AND LABOR CHARGES - $1264.32\n\nThis amount represents the balance of wages and related charges to the completion of the contract and brings the total labor cost for the project to $8222.63.\n\nThe payrolls submitted have been examined in detail and calculations have been found correct. Transfers from original time cards to the payrolls have been found in order.\n\nThe scale of wages paid by the Contractor was in accordance with rates that have been approved and set out in the Agreement. The rates observed were based on an 8 hour day, 44 hour week with time and a half for overtime. Travelling time was paid at the regular rate and was not taken into account in the accumulation of overtime.\n\nEffective April 1st., 1946, the following rates were paid by the Contractor in compliance with an Agreement reached between the Edmonton Builders' Exchange and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America:\n\nCarpenter foreman - $1.50 per hour\nCarpenters - $1.40 per hour\nLaborers - $.90 per hour\nSuperintendent - $2.00 per hour, based on fixed salary of $50.00 per week, with approval of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nIndian labor has been paid at 75\u00a2 per hour, with approval of Indian Superintendent.\n\nAn underpayment of $2.00 noted on payroll # AV for Oct. 16, 1947, appearing in Claim #5, in connection with L. Gabrielson has not been possible to adjust as this former employee could not be reached. No further action is contemplated by the Contractor.\nHOLIDAY PAY - $24.65\n\nDiscrepancies in the calculation of Holiday Pay in Claims 1 to 4 inclusive have been adjusted in this claim by a debit voucher for $13.79 which has been added to the charge of $10.86 applicable to the payrolls submitted with the present claim, making a total charge of $24.65.\n\nThe Employees' Holiday Pay Books have been examined and proof of payment established.\n\nHoliday Pay charges have also been taken into account in the computation of the other payroll charges.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION - $25.75\n\nThe Contractor's assessment rate by the Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board has been 45\u00a2 for the years 1947 and 1948.\n\nThe amount presently claimed represents charges of $46.75 applicable to the payrolls submitted with this claim less a rebate of $20.96 received by the Contractor on 1947 payments in connection with employees whose earnings exceeded the maximum assessable amount of $2000 for that year.\n\nA further examination of the Contractor's records will be made on receipt of the returns from the W.C.B. for 1948 in order to secure any further credit that may accrue.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE - $2.75\n\nThe Contractor has maintained adequate coverage against the above risks throughout the Contract. The payment of premiums which were based on .25% of the estimated gross payroll for 1947 and on .225% for 1948, has been established.\n\nThe calculations have been reviewed in connection with the present and previous claims and the amount charged has been found sufficiently accurate.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE - $14.50\n\nThis amount represents the Contractor's portion of contributions paid on behalf of insurable employees listed on the payrolls submitted herewith. The Unemployment Insurance Books for the current fiscal year were produced for examination and satisfactory evidence given that the above Act has been complied with throughout the contract.\n\nINCOME TAX\n\nThe Contractor has complied with the Income Tax Act and Regulations in retaining the necessary deductions from taxable employees and remitting same to the Receiver General regularly.\n\nMATERIALS - $244.45\n\nInvoices for materials purchased or supplied from the Contractor's stock have been compared with purchase Orders and requisitions as well as checked for calculations and extensions. A discrepancy of $59 in listing Invoice # 7745 on Claim # 1 has been adjusted. Also Invoice # 1232 for $8.30 which was charged in error on Claim # 4 has now been deleted.\nAlthough the Contractor did not have delivery slips to establish proof of delivery of materials, the Indian Agent was able to confirm in most instances that the materials charged had actually been used on the project.\n\nMaterials divided between the Stony Plain and Michel Schools have been checked closely for possible duplication and found correctly recorded.\n\nMILL WORK - $24.97 Smith\n\nA joint inventory of small tools maintained in connection with the Stony Plain and Michel Schools has been reviewed and a credit of $24.97 has been obtained to cover items retained by the Contractor. The entire amount has been credited to this school in view of the relatively small amount involved.\n\nFIRE INSURANCE\n\nAn Insurance Policy with the Aetna Insurance Co. for $11,000 has been maintained on the school while under construction. On advice from the Agency Superintendent the Policy has not been renewed by the Contractor since it expired in October 1948.\n\nTRAVELLING EXPENSES - $36.00\n\nThis amount has been paid to employees of the Contractor for providing transportation to the men in their personal car. The round trip covered some 26 miles and the rate of $2.00 per round trip which has been charged appears fair and reasonable.\n\nSUB - CONTRACTOR\n\nMILLWORK - H.M. Clark Lumber Co. - $14.03\n\nInvoices for millwork supplied by this sub-contractor and submitted in the present and previous claims amount to $1579.19 although they have not all been listed under sub-contracts. This amount is well within the approved tender for $1829.00.\n\nThe above charge of $14.03 represents an invoice for $13.75 for finishings and a 30\u00a2 undercharge in Claim # 4 where credit invoice #1439 has been listed as $13.89 instead of $13.75. The details pertaining to invoice #1439 have been explained in the audit report covering Progress Claim # 5 for the Michel School.\n\nThe millwork and other materials supplied by this Company have been paid by the prime contractor on the basis of the invoices submitted and full settlement thereof has been verified.\n\nPAINTING & DECORATING - $210.00 - Jack Mason\n\nThis amount represents the balance of the account for painting and decorating performed by Jack Mason at the agreed price of $1050 which has been settled in full by the prime contractor.\n\nELECTRICAL - Alfa Electric - $25.00 - Standard - Edmonton\n\nThis sub-contractor has supplied and installed the electrical wiring and standard fixtures in the school and living quarters at a total cost of $490.45, which charges have been included in previous claims. An estimated cost of $510 had been approved by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nAlthough this sub-contractor has not provided a Statement Declaration, as requested, it has not been found necessary to hold up the claim as the owner has performed most of the work himself and prime\ncontractor has a sufficient hold-back on other projects to be protected against the liability for any unpaid accounts of the sub-contractor.\n\n**PRIME - Roy & Sons Ltd. - $672.83**\n\nThe above firm has supplied and installed the plumbing of materials and fixtures required at a total cost of $152.40 including $10.00 for labor. The above charge represents the balance of the account which has been fully paid by the prime contractor.\n\n**PRIME - Froese & Maxwell Co., Ltd. - $676.93**\n\nThe prime contractor was not able to secure competitive bids for the completion of this portion of the work and consequently has had the work completed at current market rates.\n\nThe firm of Froese & Maxwell agreed to perform the work on this basis. The total cost has been $1087.93 and the above charge of $676.93 represents the balance of the accounts submitted in this claim. The costs are distributed as follows:\n\n- Shop Labor: $172.16\n- Job Labor: $164.48\n- Furnace: $404.66\n- Sales Tax: $35.05\n- Registers & Other Materials: $121\n\n$1087.93\n\nAn approximate mark-up of 40% has been added to the sub-contractors' actual costs for labor and materials. Thus the furnace which cost the sub-contractor $123.79 has been billed at $404.66. Similarly the total labor cost to the sub-contractor amounted to $79.46 for both schools or $237.73 each, whereas $356.61 has been charged for each school.\n\nThe Prime contractors (Poole Construction) and the Indian Superintendent have pointed out that they had no alternative but to award the sub-contract to a firm that would agree to do the work at their regular rates, which the firm of Froese & Maxwell have followed in this case.\n\n**PRIME CONTRACTOR'S COMMISSION OR FEE - $260.20**\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Agreement the Poole Construction Co., Ltd. have claimed a fee of 10% on the cost of the work completed since the previous claim.

However, letters of\nclearance from the Workmen's Compensation Board to cover the\nsubcontractors have not been received. As the Contractor is\nanxious to receive payment, he has submitted this claim\nwithout the necessary clearance from the Board in the belief\nthat the balance owing on the Michel School project has\nsufficient holdback against any W.C.B. charges.\n\nThe\nThe Contractor has credited this final claim with the value of the small tools that are surplus to both schools i.e. the Michel and Stony Plain Reserve.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nMarch 11th, 1949.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt, Esq.,\nGeneral Executive Assistant,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nRef: Edmonton Indian Agency Administrative Office\n\nOn my return from Ottawa I got in touch with the District Architect, Department of Public Works, and advised him that it was the wish of the Director of Indian Affairs that he obtain office space in Edmonton for the headquarters of the Edmonton Indian Agency, and that this space would be required as soon as possible, preferably early in the new fiscal year.\n\nI also informed the Superintendent of the Agency, Mr. Robertson, and the present Fur Supervisor, Mr. W. B. Skead. It was known that the District Architect would be glad to have any leads or assistance that these men could give in locating office space in that city, as space there is very scarce.\n\nSpace is required for the Superintendent and his staff of three clerks, also the Fur Supervisor. I hope you agree that the latter should be established in the Edmonton Agency office. This office should also be the headquarters of the Welfare Officer, Inspector of Schools and Building Supervisor, when these officials are working in or out of Edmonton. In our opinion the space should not be less than 600 sq. ft.\n\nI have to report that D.F.W. officials are finding it very difficult to locate any office space. Oil companies are offering large rentals for any available space in the city, and it is understood that good space is costing as high as $4.00 a sq.ft.\n\nThe District Architect has been advised that location is not of first importance to Indian Affairs. He stated this week that he is constantly surveying the whole situation and following any possible leads, and has hopes that suitable space will be located.\n\nIn the meantime, a Clerk, Grade 3, with a homes in Edmonton, has been detailed by the Civil Service Commission to fill the vacancy at the Agency. This man is boarding with the Superintendent at Winterburn.\nThe Superintendent and members of his office staff, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Sims, know that they must find their own living quarters when and if the office is moved into Edmonton.\n\nOn a recent visit to the present Agency, consideration was given to the disposition of the buildings when vacated. The office proper will make an excellent day school with very few changes. Another day school is badly needed, and I am writing to Col. Henry, sending you a copy, explaining the local situation in this respect.\n\nTo house the teacher of this school, the cottage, now occupied by the clerk and immediately across the road from the office, could be used. The warehouse, which is at the rear of the office, must be retained and it will only require a new entrance to definitely separate it from the school.\n\nThe Superintendent's house would be turned over to the Assistant Indian Agency, Mr. Callihoo. The house, which he is now occupying, is the property of the Stoney Plain Band of Indians, and it is believed that the Health & Welfare Department might make some arrangements with the Band to use it for a nursing station, if the Band do not wish to make use of it in some other manner.\n\nYou will, therefore, understand, Mr. Pratt, in moving from Winterburn to Edmonton there is no wastage, and in fact there would be a distinct saving in capital outlay.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe: Stony Plain Day School\n\nIn February I visited the Stony Plain Day School and was impressed particularly with the number that there in attendance. It was a blizzardy day and I found 41 pupils in attendance. The young teacher, Mr. H. S. Leslie, appeared to me to be a capable teacher and had his classes well organized.\n\nI learned that the average attendance for January had been 37.8 and the highest attendance for the term was 52. Superintendent Robertson, who accompanied me, stated that there will be another 12 to 15 pupils of school age next fall. It is, therefore, necessary to find space for another classroom.\n\nAs you may know, it is proposed to move the Agency headquarters from Winterburn to the City of Edmonton, and, for your information, I am attaching copy of a letter which I have written to Mr. Pratt in this regard.\n\nThe Agency office is about a mile to the east of the school and would, in our opinion, make a very suitable school to take 30 or 35 pupils. It is well constructed, well heated by a furnace in good condition and, so far as I can see, it would be necessary only to remove some partitions and change certain windows to make it a very suitable classroom.\n\nAs stated in the letter to Mr. Pratt, the cottage across the road could, in turn, be made the home of the teacher and I believe this would be a real inducement for a good single married teacher to apply. The total cost of making the office into a school should not exceed $1,000.00.\n\nFor various reasons, therefore, it is hoped that the Agency headquarters are moved into the city in the early summer and that this building can be made ready for a class before the fall term.\n\nYou will be advised of progress.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 9th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nWith reference to telephone conversation with the Education Division this morning, we have now decided to transfer $2,300.00 from the Louis Bull Day School to the Stony Plain Day School. This transfer will permit payment of the balance due the contractor and will leave some funds on hand for minor local expenditures in connection with the completion of the school.\n\nPlease cancel our memorandum of 5th March, 1949, in regard to this matter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. W.J.F. PRATT,\nGeneral Executive Assistant,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nStony Plain Indian Day School.\n\nBy now, you will have received Mr. Gooderham's letter of March 11 outlining his plan for having the present agency buildings at Winterburn used as a second room for the Stony Plain Indian Day School.\n\nThis day school was erected as an experiment a year ago and its attendance has proven a pleasant surprise. At the time of our educational survey we had hoped that the attendance would warrant its continuance as a one-room Indian day school but now we find that at least a two-room school will be required next year.\n\nWe had intended to make temporary arrangements for this second classroom but are most interested in the possibility of obtaining the former agency buildings as a second classroom.\n\nBernard E.

Do you wish me to secure estimates from some of the local contractors as to cost of removing partitions and changing windows in the present office in order to fit it for a classroom?\n\nI understand that the dead-line for Alberta teacher's contracts for the coming school year is July 20th. Should advertisements be placed now for the teacher for this second classroom here and for the teacher for the school at Alexis Reserve. There is also a possibility that Mr. Leskiw will not return for the coming year and if so we will require another teacher at Stony Plain Reserve. Mr. Leskiw has promised to let me know definitely in a week or ten days.\n\nIf Miss Dandanesu's application for the Alexander's school is not accepted or if she does not accept the position at the salary which can be offered, we will also need a teacher at that point.\n\nIf the advertisements are placed, will you please send me a supply of application forms.\n\nE.

He has decided to return to Stony Plain School next term and asks that he be given the senior grades to teach.\n\nThe attendance at the two schools should be about as follows:\n\n| Grade   | Number of Pupils |\n|---------|------------------|\n| Grade 1 | 7 plus 12 new pupils | 19 |\n| Grade 2 |                   | 14 |\n| Grade 3 |                   | 7  |\n| Grade 4 |                   | 7  |\n| Grade 5 |                   | 4  |\n| Grade 6 |                   | 4  |\n| Grade 7 |                   | 2  |\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Leskiw and we would suggest that Grades 1 and 2 be left in the No.1 School and that Grades 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, attend the new school to be set up in the office building. This would leave the older children under Mr. Leskiw's supervision which I think would be advisable.\n\nI have not as yet been able to secure tenders on the alterations required in the office building but will try and get them away to you in a day or two.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 19, 1949.\n\nMr. E.A.

Neary requesting authority as soon as possible to purchase a new furnace for the Stony Plain Indian Day School #2 at a cost of approximately $200.00.\n\nWe have been having considerable trouble with this furnace and before Mr. Robertson left for the North country he instructed Keeler's Sheet Metal and Vacuum Service to inspect the furnace and make any minor repairs that were necessary. Mr. Keeler inspected the furnace today and immediately phoned this office to say that in his opinion, the furnace was completely worn out due to fire hazard involved. Mr. Keeler is considered to be a very reliable furnace expert and it was felt that in this case his advice should be followed.\n\nAs it is too cold to operate the school at this time of year without heat the children have been released until the middle of next week when it is hoped that authority will have been received and the new furnace installed.\n\nEnclosure\n\ncc/G.H.

I myself wrote on December 8 to our Indian Agent, Mr. Landry, at High Prairie, concerning this school and made certain suggestions to him. It is possible that by now he has the information contained in your letter. In any event, I have sent him an extract of the part dealing with the lumber and the winter freighting of materials. I hope that we can make satisfactory arrangements in regard to this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Y. M.

Landry, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of December 8 concerning the above Day School, I have now received a communication from the Reverend Father Flock with regard to the lumber required. He states in part as follows:\n\n\"To get the lumber, we have to come to Grouard. The manager of a sawmill offers to us a special price; he will let us have the rough lumber at Grouard, 43 miles from Whitefish L. for thirty dollars, a thousand feet; it seems they can be planned there quite cheap. No sawmill has been established on the Metis colony, as it was thought.\n\n\"The freighting may be done quite easily from Grouard to Whitefish Lake in winter; but the road is so bad in summer that it is very expensive to carry some goods in summer.\n\n\"So to build the school next spring or summer, it is very important that the freight be done before April at least.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letters of December 8th and 15th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.) having reference to the construction of the above noted school.\n\nI have recently interviewed Right Reverend Bishop Routhier and I am advised that he has found a suitable man to act as foremen for this construction. I know the man personally. He has erected several buildings in this district and has always shown himself most reliable and efficient. I am confident that with him acting as foreman we would have no trouble with the school building at that point.\n\nAs I understand a good deal of local lumber such as spruce will be required in this construction. This lumber, as noted by Father Floch's letter to you, is available in the vicinity of Grouard which is approximately 43 miles from Atikameg. The price that he quotes however at $30.00 per thousand is for rough lumber. As you are no doubt aware the biggest part of this lumber will have to be planed and would therefore cost an estimated additional $6.00 per thousand. The transportation of that lumber imposes a problem and as noted by Father Floch it is hardly feasible after March. The roads to that point are now in the better condition than it is expected that they will be in the course of the winter. I would very much appreciate if all freighting to be taken to that point were done by Indians. The standard of living of the Indians of the Whitefish Lake Reserve (Atikameg) is very low. Most of them have horses and sleighs and would very much appreciate whatever freighting we would give them. I am not yet certain of the exact cost of freighting lumber from Grouard to Atikameg but I would estimate that it will be in the neighborhood of $20.00 per thousand.\n\nIf it is your intention that I place an order with local lumber mills and take charge of the freighting of lumber it would be appreciated if I were notified at your earliest opportunity. It would also be appreciated if I were furnished with the quantity and type of lumber that will be needed. On receipt of same it will receive my prompt attention.\n\nA. Lancy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 27, 1947.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nReference your 6-6-4 of December 23 -\n\nIt is noted that you are prepared to recommend a foreman for the construction of this school. Although it will be some time before construction can actually begin, if you will let us have his name, address and wages per hour requested, we will obtain the necessary authority for his employment from the Minister's office. With regard to the building itself, we have today sent you, under separate file, the following documents:\n\n(a) One blueprint of our standard one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence,\n\n(b) One set of specifications for the above school,\n\n(c) Three copies of the bill of materials required to construct the above school.\n\nWe can send you extra copies of any of the above documents as required.\n\nIt is suggested that you now take the following action:\n\n(1) Prepare, from the bill of materials, a requisition for the lumber which can be supplied by the Grouard mill.\n\nAt the foot of the requisition, state the price for rough lumber and for planed lumber, as quoted by the mill. It would be preferable to separate the requisition into two parts, one for rough lumber and the\nother for planed lumber. You should also state the name and address of the mill quoting on this lumber. We can then have our Departmental Purchasing Agent proceed with the placing of this order at once.\n\n(2) Return to us one of the bills of material which we are sending to you and from which you have deleted all lumber items listed on the requisition above and which can be supplied locally. You should also delete the broken and crushed stone which we hope can be obtained locally. It would be very expensive to freight these masonry items in to Atikameg. We can then prepare another requisition to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for items which will have to be purchased in Edmonton, or elsewhere. If you can recommend a source of supply for the bricks, flue lining, tile and tile pipe, this would help to speed up delivery.\n\nWe can arrange for the purchase of the cement by carload lot.\n\nWe will expect to hear from you further with regard to our recommended action as above.\n\nBernard F.

Neary.\nRe: Atikamek Day School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 27th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.), having reference to the building of the above mentioned school.\n\nReceipt is also acknowledged of the following documents:\n\n(a) One blueprint of our standard one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence,\n\n(c) One set of specifications for the above school,\n\n(c) Three copies of the bill of materials required to construct the above school.\n\nSince receiving these documents I have attached great importance and priority to this matter. I have succeeded in locating an experienced and reliable builder to act as foreman. The party is Alfred Blouin, whose address is Jousard, Alberta. This man is 36 years of age and well reputed as a very good carpenter and builder. So far he has built 4 military barracks at Grande Prairie, 1 church at Jousard, 1 ware-house at Peace River, 1 residence at Fairview and 3 residences at Peace River. He gives as reference Mr. Charles Turner, Contractor, Grande Prairie, Alta., and also Ray Lehey, Contractor, Peace River, Alberta. I know this man personally and I have seen some of the work that he has done. I am of the opinion that he is fully qualified to undertake the building of our school there. In view of the remoteness of the area however, he is demanding $150 per hour. Considering the wages paid for common labour and for skilled labour I do not think that Mr. Blouin is over estimating himself by demanding these wages.\n\nIn your letter of December 16th in which you quote part of a letter from Father Floc'h of Atikameg, I wish to report as follows: When Father Floc'h approached the Grouard saw-mill which is operated by the Basarab Brothers, it would appear that the firm really quoted him $30.00 per thousand for rough lumber. They were under the impression however that the lumber was required for the church authorities and in that respect they always make it a point to sell lumber at times ever lower than cost price.\nWhen I interviewed the Bassarab Brothers they would not consider anything less than $42.00 per thousand for rough lumber and an additional $6.00 per thousand for plain lumber. Furthermore they will not undertake to prepare this lumber for me before June. Since it would be impossible to freight that lumber into Whitefish Lake in the spring it is obvious that we cannot consider purchasing our lumber from them.\n\nI have also approached a second small firm, Walker and Sons, who operate a portable saw-mill within 35 miles of Atikameg. They are willing to fill my order at $45.00 per thousand feet for lumber dressed on three sides and the same price for lumber dressed on four sides. The transportation of this lumber from the mill to Atikameg could be done by Indians and I do not think that the cost would be more than $20.00 per thousand feet.\n\nIt is to be noted however that your requisition calls for all lumber to be yard seasoned and dry. In that respect I can only say that it is absolutely impossible to obtain such lumber in this district and in fact I am absolutely unaware as to where it could be obtained. There are numerous constructions going on in this district and all native lumber that is used is lumber sawn in winter, allowed to dry for approximately four months and then used in the buildings. Due to the shortage of lumber there is no alternative. While it does not make the best of buildings it would appear to be satisfactory and this system has always been followed in the district.\n\nStudying the matter more fully I find another angle that we possibly could undertake. Last spring a portable saw-mill was purchased from Welfare and sent to me at Driftpile, where I intended to use it mainly for the bands of Driftpile and Sucker Creeks. This mill is now set up in Driftpile and is powered by the band tractor. It works very nicely and does a very nice job. I have just returned from Atikameg after going through the spruce timber available on the reserve there. I find that while this timber is quite scattered there would be enough logs available within four miles of the school site to fill our requirements of native lumber. A good sawyer is available and under his leadership most of the work in this connection could be done by Indians. A small portable planer would have to be rented and moved on the premises. The tractor could be rented from the Driftpile Band and brought there as a means of power.\n\nAfter consulting experienced saw-mill operators, I am told that in spite of the cost of wages we could safely fulfill our requirements for an estimated maximum of $90.00 per thousand feet right on the premises.\n\nA copy of this report is being forwarded to Supervisor Gooderham for any recommendations that he may wish to make as there is no doubt that Mr. Gooderham as well as myself, would like to see this saw-mill operated. If the saw-mill is brought there I also intend to apply to Welfare for sufficient funds to saw additional lumber to be used for the building and the improvement of Indian homes of the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nA further point has also entered my mind. No provisions seems to have been made for a shed to store the material at Atikameg. There is no storage available\nthere for the material. It would therefore appear that we have no alternative but to build one. This shed could be built with one ply of lumber with a suitable roof. I would recommend the size to be 20 X 40 feet. This would require an additional 9000 feet of lumber. When the building of the school is completed I would recommend that this shed be taken apart and the lumber used for the building and improvement of Indian homes.\n\nA.

Neary.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nAs requested in your letter of December 27th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.), I am enclosing herewith Requisition for local lumber available at the nearest possible point from Atikameg.\n\nAs requested I have deleted from the Bill of Material all the lumber included in my Requisition. I have also deleted the broken and crushed stones as well as the sand as this is available at Atikameg within a few miles of the school site. I am not sending a Requisition for these as I understand that this will be charged to common labour.\n\nAlso enclosed is a Requisition for bricks. These are available locally.\n\nWith reference to the flu lining, weeping tiles, and the clay tile pipe, I am informed by the Frontier Lumber Company here that in all likelihood they will be able to fulfill our requirements by March 1st. This however is not a certainty. I have therefore not deleted these from the Bill of Material.\n\nAll material shipped by freight for delivery is to be shipped to Emilda, Alberta.\n\nA. Landry\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: B.F. Neary.\n\nRe: Atikames Day School\n\nIn previous correspondence, in regards to the above noted school, no mention is made as to its exact location at Atikameg. Am I correct therefore in assuming that it is to be built on the property recently purchased from A.R. Morden by Right Reverend Bishop Henri Routhier?\n\nAs you are no doubt aware this property is adjoining the Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve and at the spot where the Indians are mostly located. There is a nice elevation on that property approximately 300 yards from the small Whitelish Lake.\n\nI also note that no provision is made for the water supply. In that respect I can only say that there are no wells at Atikameg. The population of that area use the lake for their water supply. While that water appears to be good I have been informed by the Post Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company that the analysis of the water revealed that it should be chlorinated.\n\nA.

It will not be possible to interest a contractor in the construction of this school, therefore, we requested Mr. Indian Agent Landry to try to locate a suitable building foreman. He has done so and has now reported as follows:\n\n\"I have succeeded in locating an experienced and reliable builder to act as foreman. The party is Alfred Blouin, whose address is Jeussard, Alberta. This man is 36 years of age and well reputed as a very good carpenter and builder. So far he has built 4 military barracks at Grande Prairie, 1 church at Jeussard, 1 ware-house at Peace River, 1 residence at Fairview and 3 residences at Peace River. He gives as reference Mr. Charles Turner, Contractor, Grande Prairie, Alberta, and also Mr. Ray Lahey, Contractor, Peace River, Alberta. I know this man personally and I have seen some of work that he has done. I am of the opinion that he is fully qualified to undertake the building of our school there.

Landry, Indian Agent, High Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School.\n\nWe are now able to report progress from here with regard to the construction of this school:\n\n(a) The requisitions are now in the hands of the Departmental Purchasing Agent and it is hoped that Purchase Orders can be issued in the near future. I understand that Father Beuglet would do everything possible through his business contacts in Edmonton to obtain scarce items of building materials. We are now buying similar building materials for two schools in the Norway House Agency and have experienced great difficulty in buying millwork and some hardware items. If firms in Edmonton cannot promise delivery of certain scarce items, then we will write you immediately requesting you to contact Father Beuglet in an attempt to have him expedite such delivery.\n\n(b) Your recommendation concerning Mr. Blouin is now at the Minister's office with a request that approval be given for hiring him at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\n(c) Approval is given to your recommendation concerning the building of a storage shed near the site of the school. We will try to get authority for you to buy the lumber necessary by local purchase.\n\n(d) The matter of the site of the school was discussed at some length with Father Beuglet. The Indian Act requires that day schools be situated on an Indian reserve. We would be prepared to accept your recommendation with regard to the location of the school but it should be\nlocated on property owned by the Department. If necessary we could consider the purchase of a small plot of land from Bishop Routhier. We will expect to hear further from you with regard to this matter.\n\n(e) We have asked in our estimates for the sum of $14,000.00 for the construction of this school. A lot depends on the cost of materials, freighting, etc., and as to what provision can be made for water and other extras. Therefore, we are not in a position to give you a definite answer insofar as these items are concerned, until we know how great an expenditure has been made for other necessary supplies, etc. In any event, we cannot exceed $14,000.00.\n\nBernard F.

It is also suggested that you obtain an ample stock of Labour Return forms. By now, you will have received the purchase order for the cement required at this school.\n\nBernard F.

While the purchase order has not been received here yet I have made an arrangement with a good number of Indians to freight that cement into Atikameg as soon as it arrives in Emilda. As previously stated it is very important that this be freighted in immediately and by all means not later than by the end of March. The same would apply to all other material required for the construction of this school. The road to Atikameg in the summer time is practically impassable with loads.\n\nI am not aware as to the exact weight of the material that will have to be taken there but considering 28 tons of cement and 30,000 feet of lumber, I would request an accountable advance of $1,500.00 to cover such freighting. If the material comes in sufficiently early I shall have no trouble in accounting for this advance by March 31st.\n\nA.

Landry, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your Credit Voucher No. 446, I have\nto advise you that you have been credited with $2,450.06 on the\nbasis of this account. The sum of $10.00 was deducted from\nthis, since you advanced J. Willier $10.00 on freighting as per\nreceipt #99313 which was not accounted for by details in the\nsame way as the other advances.\n\nI have also to advise you that you have had advances\nre this school to the extent of $4000.00 - $1500.00 as per\nCheque No. 96664, dated Mar. 13th and Cheque No. 99380 amounting\nto $2500.00 so that you still have to account for $1519.94.\n\nIt is noted that you have several other balances out-\nstanding as follows:\n\n| Item       | Amount   |\n|------------|----------|\n| Trust Funds| $9047.59 |\n| Vote 511   | $60.00 (Firewood) |\n| Annuities  | $890.00  |\n| Vote 515   | $700.00 (500.00=Freighting) |\n|            |          |\n|            |          |\n\nIt is not known in Treasury if these are in process\nof being passed for payment by the Department but it is\ndefinitely not understood why these advances have not been\nadjusted by Credit Vouchers or refunds before this. The end\nof the Government Fiscal Year is March 31st, and since none of\nthis money can be expended after that date, certainly sufficient\ntime has elapsed to have these advances completely cleaned up.\n\nAn impression seems to have developed that these\naccountable advances do not have to be accounted for until the\nend of the year. This is definitely not the case. Accountable\nAdvances should be liquidated by Credit Voucher or refund or\nunexpended balances immediately after the money has been spent.\n\nWill you please give this matter your immediate\nattention.\n\nN/W\n\nW. Lauchlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI am attaching hereto Voucher No. 446, covering the cost of freighting building material, etc., for the Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that the Trust A/c here has an overdraft of $990.06 in the Freight A/c, Whitefish Lake. It would be appreciated if the Department would forward in Trust to this office a cheque covering this overdraft.\n\nA.

Neary\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nThe foreman and three carpenters have now proceeded to Atikameg with a view of building the above mentioned school. While there it is anticipated that a good number of Indians will also be employed as the foreman, Mr. Blouin, is very eager to see that this building is completed as soon as possible.\n\nIt is not known here exactly how much money will be required for the total labour of this construction. Meanwhile however, it would be appreciated that a temporary advance of $4,000.00 could be sent to the Indian Agency Trust Account, where it will be accounted for in the usual manner.\n\nI have reasons to believe that in all likelihood you will require a progress report as the construction goes on. In that respect it would be appreciated if I could be in receipt of the required forms for this report if they exist. It would also be appreciated if I could be instructed as to any procedure.\n\nA. Landry,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 9, 1948.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Superintendent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 26th, we are arranging to forward you an accountable advance for $1,000.00 for labour in connection with the erection of the Atikameg Indian Day School. As soon as this cheque is expended you should account for it in the proper manner and apply for a further advance.\n\nWhile the construction of the building is in progress you should visit it weekly, if possible, and let us have a letter stating the progress that is being made.\n\nBernard F.

I regret however, that the cost will exceed considerably the $14,000.00 allotted. The freighting to that point by Indian teams constitutes a major item.\n\nThe rough part of the building is now completed. That is to say, the walls and floor, ceiling and roofing and all partitions are completed. The chimney is also nearly finished. All excavation is completed. The outside finish of the cement wall is also completed. Work is also progressing nicely on the interior finish of the basement floor and walls. One out-house is completed.\n\nThe hauling of rocks, gravel and sand proved costly. These were only available at a considerable distance from the building site and a road had to be built to get there.\n\nThe $1000.00 advance already received for labor has now been used up. A remaining $2435.00 in wages is unpaid as of July 31st. It would therefore be appreciated if an accountable advance of $3000.00 were received here to pay such wages.\n\nDue to.........\nDue to the difficulty in obtaining skilled labor to work at such a remote point it is somewhat hard to estimate how much longer it will be before the building is completed. Mr. J.A. Blouin, the foreman, expects to have it completed by September 1st.\n\nA.

At the present time there is a debit balance of some $1300.00 in the Atikameg Day School account at Lesser Slave Lake; in addition to this there are work sheets on hand covering labor already performed but yet to be paid for, in the amount of some $750.00.\n\nThe carpenters are at present on location presumably putting the finishing touches on this building. The Superintendent, Mr. Lapp has been trying to obtain the services of a plasterer but it is not known whether he has been successful as yet. I understand that there is still some plumbing to be done - I gathered that the plumbing had been roughed in but that there was some finishing to do. These additional expenditures may amount to some $750.00 to $1000.00.\n\nIn order to clear the debit balance in this account and to provide the addition funds required to pay outstanding wages, and to complete the school, an accountable advance of at least $2500 should be provided as soon as possible.\n\nG.

I hope that it will be agreeable to you too.\n\nBelieve me, dear sir,\n\nThankfully yours,\nMother Superior\nfor S.A. Fields\nOctober 29, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Man.\n\nThe attached voucher No. 933 (131) was submitted by the former Superintendent, Mr. Landry, to account for advances forwarded to him in connection with the construction of the Atikameg Day School. The Treasury Branch has asked that this voucher be returned for clarification and revision if necessary.\n\nThey point out the following:\n\n(1) For the week ending July 10th the Agent wrote one cheque to J.A. Blouin. For the second and third and fourth names there is no evidence that Blouin paid out this money. Please obtain this information.\n\n(2) Deductions have been made for income tax and unemployment insurance but no indication is given as to what disposal was made of the money. The former Agent has not submitted an accounting for either employer's or employees' share of unemployment insurance.\n\n(3) For the week of July 17th it would appear that the net amount required was handed to the foreman but there is no receipt from the persons whom the foreman paid.\n\nThe same applies to the rest of the credit vouchers. To be complete, the credit voucher should contain receipts for all payments made.\n(4) The income tax deductions should be forwarded to the Income Tax Department by cheque. If this has already been done, we would like to know the cheque number, amount and date.\n\nThe same applies to both the employer's and employees' share of the unemployment insurance.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThere are quite a number of errors in the letter.\n\nOn the second page, Agent wrote the date to R.A. Blans... On the second page, he wrote the name here. No evidence was shown to have been made for income tax & tax. In fact, no indication as to what he had done remains. Agent has submitted no accounts for either Employer or Employee shown & tax.\n\nOn July 7th, he has handed the account to the foreman, but we have no record of what the agent has done with it.\n\nThe same applies to the receipt of the credit.\n\nTo complete the letter, please contain receipts for all payments made.\n\nHanding the money to someone is not sufficient. The income tax deductions should be forwarded to the Income Tax Dept by Oct. 31st. We have not heard from the taxes perhaps checked through his cash book. The same applies to both Employer & Employee shown & tax.\n\nThe letter is returned herein.\nOctober 25, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account covering the cost of materials purchased in connection with the erection of the Atikameg School.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

This is made difficult because the workmen here left and will not return.\n3: Some of the desks are still at Grouard.\n4: The kitchen stove, which was ordered C.O.D. from Simpson, is at Eilds and the Agent says that he has no money to have it freighted to the Mission.\n5: The Agent would like us to open the school on November 22nd, but as stated above, only part of the desks are in the school and moreover there are no chairs and tables or bedding for the sisters who will be in charge of the school.\n6: Apparently the school books and other school material have not yet been shipped or are delayed somewhere in transit.\n7: The cocoa milk and sugar have arrived, but there are no biscuits.\n\nThe above report, as stated, was forwarded to me by the Reverend Father Floc'h who is in charge of this Mission and should in my estimation be inquired into.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have a report from you as soon as possible regarding the progress of the work at the Atikameg School and we would like to know the approximate date on which you consider it can be opened.\n\nWe have been advised that there is considerable work that has to be done and that the workmen have left.\n\nWe have also been told that some of the desks are still at Grouard and that the kitchen stove is at Enilda. Possibly you have already arranged for delivery of these articles to the school.\n\nHave the furnishings for the residential portion of the building arrived yet?\n\nWe are ordering vitaminized biscuits from Paulin Chambers in Winnipeg and it is hoped that these will reach you in the near future.\n\nWhen replying you should also let us have an idea of the approximate cost of finishing the building. Funds are provided in the current year's appropriation for this building and we want to have it completed so that we will not have to provide funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F.

The floor registers had not been installed owing to the\nfact that registers are not available. We put in a telephone call\nto Edmonton in an endeavour to secure registers but none were av-\nailable of the size desired. We also communicated with a plumbing\nsupply firm in Peace River with similar results. At present we\nhave an order for registers with a High Prairie welding firm but\nthere has been a delay owing to lack of material. The only subtit-\nute available is mink wire which Mr. J. A. Bluin, the carpenter,\nwill put on when he goes to Atikameg on December 6th.\n\nThe kitchen sink had not been installed because a pipe thread-\ner was not available. Mr. Bluin will endeavour to borrow such a\ntool and install the sink.\n\nSome of the hot air pipes that connect the living quarters\nwith the furnace were not available. We have attempted to get\nthese pipes in High Prairie but they are not in stock here. Mr.\nBluin will take measurements and we will have them made as soon\nas possible.\n\nThe windows had not been put in the toilet as they too were\nnot shipped from Edmonton. The air vents and urinal were not put\nin but Mr. Bluin has promised to do this work during the week of\nDecember 6th.\n\nAll except three or four of the desks were at the school on\nNovember 22nd. A few of the desks had been damaged in transit.\nbut I believe that Father Floch will arrange for repairs.\n\nThe storm windows had not been put on the building as they had not yet arrived in Atikameg.\n\nOn December 1st, we arranged with a truck driver to have the storm windows taken to the school. The remaining desks were to be taken in at that time also.\n\nI believe that all the furnishings for the residential part of the building will have arrived at Atikameg at this date. On Nov. 22nd, the kitchen stove had not yet arrived owing to the fact that it was shipped C.O.D. to Enilda. The station agent at Enilda wrote to Simpson's of Regina and asked to have the stove released but that was not done. We sent a telegram from this office and asked that the stove be released but no answer arrived. Rev. Father Tessier of Grouard secured the stove by giving a personal cheque. It has now gone to Atikameg but is much too small for preparation of a noon meal for school children.\n\nMr. Bluin estimates that it will cost approximately $200.00 to finish the school. I believe that amount will be sufficient although the cost of floor registers will be high.\n\nIn a telephone conversation today Rev. Father Beuglet of Mo-Lennan told me that the Atikameg Day School was to open on Monday, November 29th. I might add that the delay seems to have been mainly the result of shortage of building materials.\n\nG. S. Lapp\n\nG. S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nDecember 16, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nReference your 131-6-3 of December 4.\n\nWe note the progress being made with regard to equipping the above school for opening. Can you please advise me whether you wish an accountable advance of $200.00 forwarded to you or whether you have sufficient funds on hand to meet future costs.\n\nIf there are any other details which can be attended to from here, can we please be advised.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/MGD\nDecember 16, 1943.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nIn your letter of November 22nd you advised concerning the delays encountered in opening this school.\n\nThe main reason for the delay has been in the non-delivery of supplies from firms in Edmonton. They have been particularly slow in delivering plumbing and heating supplies.\n\nI understand that the desks have now arrived and that the building should be finished in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nTHE ROBERT SIMPSON REGINA LIMITED\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nDominion Government,\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\n| Oct. | Item          | Price |\n|------|--------------|-------|\n| 21   | Pail         | .59   |\n|      | Percolator   | 1.55  |\n|      | Pillows      | 5.98  |\n|      | Potato Masher| .19   |\n|      | Pyrex Oven Bowls | 1.49 |\n|      | Kitchen Range | 94.60 |\n|      | Roaster      | 2.39  |\n|      | Bugs, Large  | 5.70  |\n|      | Saucepan     | 1.60  |\n|      | Saucepan     | 2.25  |\n|      | Coal Shovel  | .89   |\n|      | Sink Strainer| .85   |\n|      | Skillet      | 2.75  |\n|      | Spoon Basting| .55   |\n|      | Desert Spoons 6 at $1.25 | 1.85 |\n|      | Tea Spoons    | .95   |\n\n2405-R-ICM-9-14WPA\nTHE ROBERT SIMPSON REGINA LIMITED\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nDominions Government,\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\n| Oct. | Item          | Quantity | Price |\n|------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 21   | Brooms       | 2        | .89   |\n|      | Curtains Blu | 1        | 1.65  |\n|      | Curtains Red | 1        | 1.65  |\n|      | Curtains Gold| 1        | 1.65  |\n|      | Glassware    |          | 3.59  |\n|      | Dishpan      |          | 2.68  |\n|      | Double Boiler|          | 2.65  |\n|      | Dresser      |          | 23.20 |\n|      | Flour Sifter |          | 1.19  |\n|      | Food Chopper |          | 2.10  |\n|      | Fork         |          | .35   |\n|      | Forks 6 at .25|        | 1.25  |\n|      | Garbage Can  |          | 2.10  |\n|      | Grater Set   |          | .49   |\n|      | Knives 6 at .30|       | 1.65  |\n|      | Kettle       |          | 1.00  |\n\n2405-R\u201410M-9-48WPA\nTHE ROBERT SIMPSON REGINA LIMITED\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nDominion Government,\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch;\n\n| Oct. | Item          | Amount |\n|------|--------------|--------|\n| 21   | Measuring Spoon | $1.50  |\n|      | Teapot       | $6.98  |\n|      | Wash tub     | $1.98  |\n|      |              | $173.71|\n|      | Less 10%     | $17.37 |\n|      |              | $156.34|\n\nSent C.O.D. in error on Order #33379\n\nShipped to Mr. A.

Has all of the furniture arrived by this time?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSt. Benedict's Mission Atikameg, Alberta December the 14th 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Superintendent,\nWelfare Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLet allow me to wish you a \"Very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\" I ask God to Bless you and to assist you in your work. Will you also offer my Wishes to Mr. Neary, who is doing so much for our school at Whitefish Lake, Atikameg.\n\nIndeed we are grateful to the Department of Indian Affairs for the nice school built at Atikameg for our Indian children.\n\nHowever I feel it is not true what is the most advisable in a place like ours; most of the people lead a nomadic life and cannot afford to stay around to have their children go to school. It happens that some have sent back the children to Grouard and it may partly be the reason why some Catholic children have been put at the Anglican school. Besides others have come from the district of Ilebocon or Prairie Lake and stay here; the inconvenience is that far away from their families they can hardly maintain their families; in fact they have build some kind of houses to shelter themselves, but they are so poor that they cannot afford to have a floor. I take the liberty to mention it that it can be understood the condition of life in our district. It is very different as it is around Edmonton and Calgary; the Indians have a chance to farm, here it is entirely a wild country, with bush, swamps, etc.\n\nYou may be interested to know how the school building stand; it is not completed; the heating system is not finished, lack of material requisitioned; there is no register fixed on the floor. The sink is not fixed; the man who came did not have the tools to fix it. There are some storm windows not brought in yet and none is set up, and some other things, which are finished. It has taken quite a time to have the school built; the carpenters were away twice for about a month every time. They are supposed to come back at any time, but I am afraid that we may have to wait quite a while.\n\nThe teacher, Sister Helene will appreciate very much, if the school furnitures, requisitioned to the Department, can be shipped in the nearest future; for till now she has to go on what was begged or borrowed here and there, and she is short of everything useful to make the school go; it is known the attention always by the Department to supply everything needed.\n\nShe did not receive any school register nor any form for monthly or quarterly returns.\n\nWill not be advisable too to have the National Flag supplied and some \"Fire Extinguishers\".\nIt will be appreciated also, if different things for games can be supplied as footballs, baseball sets, etc.; our children are very fond of sports and it is a way to have them busy at recess time or after school.\n\nSurely you will excuse me to be such a bother; but I do so think it necessary for the welfare of our Indian children.\n\nWith my Wishes of the Season and my sincere thanks,\n\nI am Yours very truly.\n\nY.

The weather became very severe at that time so that Mr. Bluin did not make the trip.\n\nOn January 5th Mr. Bluin went to Atikameg by truck to continue work on the school. He was accompanied by Brother Bosse, a tinsmith and carpenter from the Grouard Mission. I went to Atikameg at that time also in the Agency car.\n\nThe following information was given to me today by Brother Bosse:\n\nMr. Bluin and Brother Bosse installed the floor registers and fitted the storm windows. They attempted to complete connections to the sink but some of the fittings were missing. The hot air connections to the living quarters are not complete but the living quarters are sufficiently warm even in sub-zero temperatures. One hot air elbow leading to the classroom was of very light material and is damaged beyond repair. A substitute elbow may be found at Grouard and sent to Atikameg. The air vents and urinal have not been installed in the toilets.\n\nThe attached letter lists some work which should be done on the school building. All the improvements which are requested by the Reverend Mother Superior are necessary and I recommend that the work be done as soon as possible. At present there is no storage space in the class-\nIf shelves with sliding doors were built under the large windows the storage problem would be partially solved. The warehouse to which Reverend Mother Superior refers is the building in which the cement and other building materials were stored. The cement was piled on one side with the result that the floor joists are broken. At present snow blows through the broken floor so the building is not suitable for storage.\n\nAll the furniture for the school has arrived at Atikameg. Included in the shipment were two couches (chesterfields) and two buffets. One of each is sufficient in the small quarters. Reverend Mother Superior is waiting for instructions as to the disposition of the extra couch and buffet for which there is insufficient storage space. Some parts of the broken desks are in the office here. When a capable workman is found the desks will be repaired and returned to Atikameg. At present there are sufficient desks for the pupils enrolled.\n\nMr. Bluin left Atikameg on the afternoon of January 8th. He plans not to return before May although he is aware, I believe, that the building should be completed by March 31st. He is also aware of the fact that the roads to Atikameg are much more passable in the winter than during the spring and summer. At present the temperature is above +32\u00b0F so that the work still unfinished on the out-buildings could have been completed.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nAtikameg Indian Day School,\nAtikameg, Alberta,\nJan. 6, 1949.\n\nMr. J. Lapp,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Atikameg Indian Day School, Catholic Mission, requires the following improvements:\n\n1. A folding table attached to the wall at the back of the room in the class.\n2. Chains on 2 upper windows in the classroom.\n3. Shelves for books (with doors & locks) under the 5 big windows in one side of the class.\n4. Shelves made in the basement in the storeroom.\n5.

Four screens for the basement windows and three for the class room are asked for, as well as sufficient screens for the living quarters.\n\nI would recommend that the above request receive your consideration.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nAttached hereto please find our Voucher No. 99, covering the final accounting of the advances received from the Department to pay wages in connection with the construction of the Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nThe total advances received from the Department to pay wages in connection with the building of the school amounted to $6500.00. In all, this office disbursed in cash for labor a total of $7027.14, thus leaving an overdraft of $527.14 in our Trust Account Ledger. It would be appreciated if a cheque could be forwarded at an early date in order this overdraft may be cleared from our ledgers.\n\nThere is a further amount of $455.02 which is outstanding covering income tax and unemployment insurance remittances. As we already have an overdraft of $527.14, it is felt advisable to have the Department forward an accountable advance of $455.02 in addition to the $527.14, therefore a total of $982.16 will be required. The $455.02 will be accounted for by receipts covering the tax and insurance payments.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. J.A. Blouin, foreman, was overpaid in the amount of $22.00. We have written Mr. Blouin requesting him to remit this amount to this office which will be remitted to the Receiver General. Mr. Blouin has a further $33.00 owing him for recent work he had done at the school, therefore in the event he is unable to remit the $22.00 overpayment, collection maybe made from what is still owing him.\n\nG.S. Lapp (Superintendent)\n5th February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $140.29 covering the cost of vitaminized biscuits purchased for use at the Atikameg Indian Day School. This school was opened after we placed the first order for biscuits, and therefore, it was not included on the original list. Please issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.

The procedure followed in this office until Sept. 20th was to make deductions from wages for income tax and unemployment insurance but deductions were not forwarded to the Income Tax Branch nor to the Unemployment Insurance Office. The plan was to forward the deductions, in one sum, to offices concerned, when the school was completed. Since the school was presumably very near completion on September 20th, it was thought best to continue that procedure. The receipt from the Unemployment Office is attached. The receipt from the Income Tax Branch is not attached as it has not yet been received here but it is hoped that the cheque number will be acceptable to the Treasury Branch.\n\n(3) With regard to the week ending July 17th: It is not understood why the Return of Labor with cheque number and signatures of recipients is not acceptable to The Treasury Branch. Perhaps the difficulty is that the recipients have placed their signatures in the \"Witness Column\" rather than in the \"Received\npayment\" column. It will be impossible to obtain receipts covering payments for labor for the week ending July 17th before May 1st as the Indians who worked at the Atikameg Day School are for the most part trappers and some will not receive their mail before April 15th.\n\nAttached hereto is our Credit Voucher No. 262(131) dated March 3rd, accounting for $7482.16, the total advances received from the Department for wages building the school. I might point out that you will not find all the labor sheets attached hereto as a number of them are attached to our voucher number 619, dated July 19th, 1948, and voucher No. 99, dated January 19, 1949. These labor sheets are no doubt on file in your office.\n\n(Sgd.)\nG.S.

Neery,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n31st March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lepp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nWe have the requisition of 16th March, 1949, which you forwarded from the teacher of the Atikameg Indian Day School. We do not see the necessity for supplying so many articles to the janitor, and consequently, no authority is being given for the purchase of the items mentioned on the requisition.\n\nWith regard to the second requisition for certain classroom supplies, we approve purchase of the following:\n\n- 5 window shades, cream, 36\" x 70\"\n- 1 thermometer\n- 3 wash basins\n- 1 large kettle\n- 4 sheets masonite, 4 x 7\n\nWe will send the teacher 2 playground balls and 2 playground bats, but we do not supply the other athletic equipment requested on the requisition.\n\nPlease let us have an explanation of the purpose for which the 36 plates, 36 spoons and 1 ladle are required. The standard list of furnishings was forwarded to the teacher and on returning the list to our office the set of dishes which we usually supply was deleted, and, therefore, were not given to her.\n\nBernard F.

Eaton Company, Winnipeg, Manitoba, regarding two cheques received in payment of supplies furnished under authority of Purchase Order No. 33678.\n\nOn checking our vouchers at this office we find that these accounts should have been made payable to the T. Eaton Company, Edmonton, Alberta, and not to the Company at Winnipeg. It is suggested that the two cheques which I presume are for $25.10 and $145.41 be forwarded to the T.

Lapp\nSuperintendent.\nAtikameg, Alberta,\nJune 15th, 1949.\n\nTo Mr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAllow me to tell you that the packing of the dirt along the walls of the school has sunk in and now there is a real canal around the house, so that some places in the basement are always wet. While the Indians have nothing to do and complain that they be starving if they do not go elsewhere, it might help you to give them a little job before the frosts set in as it is not good for the foundations to be wet all the time.\n\nThank you for the information you gave us about the closing date, and believe me\n\nYours very much obliged,\n\nSr. Alfred de la Trinite\nJune 29, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S.

Sugar\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Atikameg Day School.\n\nAttached please find a copy of a letter from the Rev. Sr. Superior, Atikameg Day School. As is indicated by the letter there is considerable work yet to be done at the school before the building will be completed. Could authorization be obtained to secure the services of a competent worker who would finish the work at the school? The expense would be covered by return of labor. I have not been able to visit the school since early in January and so it is difficult to estimate the cost of the work but I believe that the labor involved would amount to no more than $100.00. The materials including paint, varnish, and some furnace pipes would probably cost approximately $25.00.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nAtikameg, July 14, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp, Superintendent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for sending me the blank forms for the requisition of drugs.\n\nI am sending you my list completed.\n\nMay I recall to your mind that the gutters are still in the shed, and so are the pipes for the cistern. It will be wasteful to pack the dirt around the house and have the water from the roof ruining the work done.\n\nIt seems to me also that the floor or the classroom would need a coat of varnish, and so would the desks.\n\nI am sorry to have to ask for so many things, but to be kept in good condition, a house needs constant care.\n\nI remain, dear Sir, much obliged,\n\nSr. Alfred de la Trinite, f.d.l.s.,\n\nP.S.

H. Routhier, O.M.I., and he advised me the intention of the Indian Department to build a school for the Indians at Whitefish Lake, Atikameg, P.O.\n\nHe asked me to give you some information about the conditions of the country.\n\nTo get the lumber, we have to come to Grouard; the manager of a sawmill offers to us a special price; he will let us have the rough lumber at Grouard, 65 miles from Whitefish L. for thirty dollars, a thousand feet; it seems they can be obtained there quite cheap. No sawmill has been established on the Metis colony, as it was thought.\n\nThe freighting may be done quite easily from Grouard to Whitefish Lake in winter; but the road is so bad in summer that it is very expensive to carry some goods in summer.\n\nSo to build the school next spring or summer, it is very important that the freight be done before April at least.\n\nWith my thanks and my Best Greetings of the Season,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\ny.

It is possible that by now he has the information contained in your letter. In any event, I have sent him an extract of the part dealing with the lumber and the winter freighting of materials. I hope that we can make satisfactory arrangements in regard to this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Y. M. Floch, C.M.I.,\nSt. Benedict's Mission,\nAtikameg, Alberta.\nOttawa, December 15, 1947.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of December 8 concerning the above Day School, I have now received a communication from the Reverend Father Flech with regard to the lumber required. He states in part as follows:\n\n\"To get the lumber, we have to come to Grouard. The manager of a sawmill offers to us a special price; he will let us have the rough lumber at Grouard, 43 miles from Whitefish L. for thirty dollars, a thousand feet; it seems they can be planed there quite cheap. No sawmill has been established on the Metis colony, as it was thought.\n\n\"The freighting may be done quite easily from Grouard to Whitefish Lake in winter; but the road is so bad in summer that it is very expensive to carry some goods in summer.\n\n\"So to build the school next spring or summer, it is very important that the freight be done before April at least.\"\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letters of December 3rd and 15th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.) having reference to the construction of the above noted school.\n\nI have recently interviewed Right Reverend Bishop Routhier and I am advised that he has found a suitable man to act as foreman for this construction. I know the man personally. He has erected several buildings in this district and has always shown himself most reliable and efficient. I am confident that with him acting as foreman we would have no trouble with the school building at that point.\n\nAs I understand a good deal of local lumber such as spruce will be required in this construction. This lumber, as noted by Father Floch's letter to you, is available in the vicinity of Grouard which is approximately 48 miles from Atikameg. The price that he quotes however at $30.00 per thousand is for rough lumber. As you are no doubt aware the biggest part of this lumber will have to be planed and would therefore cost an estimated additional $6.00 per thousand. The transportation of that lumber imposes a problem and as noted by Father Floch it is hardly feasible after March. The roads to that point are now in the better condition than it is expected that they will be in the course of the winter. I would very much appreciate if all freighting to be taken to that point were done by Indians. The standard of living of the Indians of the Whitefish Lake Reserve (Atikameg) is very low. Most of them have horses and sleighs and would very much appreciate whatever freighting we would give them. I am not yet certain of the exact cost of freighting lumber from Grouard to Atikameg but I would estimate that it will be in the neighborhood of $20.00 per thousand.\n\nIf it is your intention that I place an order with local lumber mills and take charge of the freighting of lumber it would be appreciated if I were notified at your earliest opportunity. It would also be appreciated if I were furnished with the quantity and type of lumber that will be needed. On receipt of same it will receive my prompt attention.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nA. Lavery\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, December 27, 1947.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nReference your 6-6-4 of December 23 -\n\nIt is noted that you are prepared to recommend a foreman for the construction of this school. Although it will be some time before construction can actually begin, if you will let us have his name, address and wages per hour requested, we will obtain the necessary authority for his employment from the Minister's office. With regard to the building itself, we have today sent you, under separate file, the following documents:\n\n(a) One blueprint of our standard one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence,\n\n(b) One set of specifications for the above school,\n\n(c) Three copies of the bill of materials required to construct the above school.\n\nWe can send you extra copies of any of the above documents as required.\n\nIt is suggested that you now take the following action:\n\n(1) Prepare, from the bill of materials, a requisition for the lumber which can be supplied by the Grouard mill.\n\nAt the foot of the requisition, state the price for rough lumber and for planed lumber, as quoted by the mill. It would be preferable to separate the requisition into two parts, one for rough lumber and the\nother for planed lumber. You should also state the name and address of the mill quoting on this lumber. We can then have our Departmental Purchasing Agent proceed with the placing of this order at once.\n\n(2) Return to us one of the bills of material which we are sending to you and from which you have deleted all lumber items listed on the requisition above and which can be supplied locally. You should also delete the broken and crushed stone which we hope can be obtained locally. It would be very expensive to freight these masonry items in to Atikameg. We can then prepare another requisition to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for items which will have to be purchased in Edmonton, or elsewhere. If you can recommend a source of supply for the bricks, flue lining, tile and tile pipe, this would help to speed up delivery.\n\nWe can arrange for the purchase of the cement by carload lot.\n\nWe will expect to hear from you further with regard to our recommended action as above.\n\nBernard F.

Neary.\n\nRe: Atikameg Day School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of December 27th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.), having reference to the building of the above mentioned school.\n\nReceipt is also acknowledged of the following documents:\n\n(a) One blueprint of our standard one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence,\n\n(b) One set of specifications for the above school,\n\n(c) Three copies of the bill of materials required to construct the above school.\n\nSince receiving these documents I have attached great importance and priority to this matter. I have succeeded in locating an experienced and reliable builder to act as foreman. The party is Alfred Blouin, whose address is Jussard, Alberta. This man is 56 years of age and well reputed as a very good carpenter and builder. So far he has built 4 military barracks at Grande Prairie, 1 church at Jussard, 1 ware-house at Peace River, 1 residence at Fairview and 3 residences at Peace River. He gives as reference Mr. Charles Turner, Contractor, Grande Prairie, Alta., and also Ray Lahey, Contractor, Peace River, Alberta.\n\nI know this man personally and I have seen some of the work that he has done. I am of the opinion that he is fully qualified to undertake the building of our school there. In view of the remoteness of the area however, he is demanding $1.80 per hour. Considering the wages paid for common labour and for skilled labour I do not think that Mr. Blouin is over estimating himself by demanding these wages.\n\nIn your letter of December 18th in which you quote part of a letter from Father Floch of Atikameg, I wish to report as follows: When Father Floch approached the Grouard saw-mill which is operated by the Bassarab Brothers, it would appear that the firm really quoted him $30.00 per thousand for rough lumber. They were under the impression however that the lumber was required for the church authorities and in that respect they always make it a point to sell lumber at times even lower than cost price.\nWhen I interviewed the Basarab Brothers they would not consider anything less than $42.00 per thousand for rough lumber and an additional $6.00 per thousand for plain lumber. Furthermore they will not undertake to prepare this lumber for me before June. Since it would be impossible to freight that lumber into Whitefish Lake in the spring it is obvious that we cannot consider purchasing our lumber from them.\n\nI have also approached a second small firm, Walker and Sons, who operate a portable saw-mill within 35 miles of Atikameg. They are willing to fill my order at $48.00 per thousand feet for lumber dressed on three sides and the same price for lumber dressed on four sides. The transportation of this lumber from the mill to Atikameg could be done by Indians and I do not think that the cost would be more than $20.00 per thousand feet.\n\nIt is to be noted however that your requisition calls for all lumber to be yard seasoned and dry. In that respect I can only say that it is absolutely impossible to cut in such lumber in this district and in fact I am absolutely unaware as to where it could be obtained. There are numerous constructions going on in this district and all native lumber that is used is lumber sawn in winter, allowed to dry for approximately four months and then used in the buildings. Due to the shortage of lumber there is no alternative. While it does not make the best of buildings it would appear to be satisfactory and this system has always been followed in the district.\n\nStudying the matter more fully I find another angle that we possibly could undertake. Last spring a portable saw-mill was purchased from Welfare and sent to me at Driftpile, where I intended to use it mainly for the bands of Driftpile and Sucker Creek. This mill is now set up in Driftpile and is powered by the band tractor. It works very nicely and does a very nice job. I have just returned from Atikameg after going through the spruce timber available on the reserve there. I find that while this timber is quite scattered there would be enough logs available within four miles of the school site to fill our requirements of native lumber. A good sawyer is available and under his leadership most of the work in this connection could be done by Indians. A small portable planer would have to be rented and moved on the premises. The tractor could be rented from the Driftpile Band and brought there as a means of power.\n\nAfter consulting experienced saw-mill operators, I am told that in spite of the cost of wages we could safely fulfill our requirements for an estimated maximum of $60.00 per thousand feet right on the premises.\n\nA copy of this report is being forwarded to Supervisor Gooderham for any recommendations that he may wish to make as there is no doubt that Mr. Gooderham as well as myself, would like to see this saw-mill operated. If the saw-mill is brought there I also intend to apply to Welfare for sufficient funds to saw additional lumber to be used for the building and the improvement of Indian homes of the Whitefish Lake Reserve.\n\nA further point has also entered my mind. No provisions seems to have been made for a shed to store the material at Atikameg. There is no storage available\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nJan. 15\n\ntherefor the material. It would therefore appear that we have no alternative but to build one. This shed could be built with one ply of lumber with a suitable roof. I would recommend the size to be 20 X 40 feet. This would require an additional 9000 feet of lumber. When the building of the school is completed I would recommend that this shed be taken apart and the lumber used for the building and improvement of Indian homes.\n\nA.

Neary.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nAs requested in your letter of December 27th, file 131-22-1 (W.T.), I am enclosing herewith Requisition for local lumber available at the nearest possible point from Atikameg.\n\nAs requested I have deleted from the Bill of Material all the lumber included in my Requisition. I have also deleted the broken and crushed stones as well as the sand as this is available at Atikameg within a few miles of the school site. I am not sending a Requisition for these as I understand that this will be charged to common labour.\n\nAlso enclosed is a Requisition for bricks. These are available locally.\n\nWith reference to the flu lining, weeping tiles, and the clay tile pipe, I am informed by the Frontier Lumber Company here that in all likelihood they will be able to fulfill our requirements by March 1st. This however is not a certainty. I have therefore not deleted these from the Bill of Material.\n\nAll material shipped by freight for delivery is to be shipped to Enilda, Alberta.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention: B.F. Neary.\n\nRe: Atikameg Day School\n\nIn previous correspondence, in regards to the above noted school, no mention is made as to its exact location at Atikameg. Am I correct therefore in assuming that it is to be built on the property recently purchased from A.R. Morden by Right Reverend Bishop Henri Routhier?\n\nAs you are no doubt aware this property is adjoining the Whitefish Lake Indian Reserve and at the spot where the Indians are mostly located. There is a nice elevation on that property approximately 300 yards from the small Whitefish Lake.\n\nI also note that no provision is made for the water supply. In that respect I can only say that there are no wells at Atikameg. The population of that area use the lake for their water supply. While that water appears to be good I have been informed by the Post Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company that the analysis of the water revealed that it should be chlorinated.\n\nA.

It will not be possible to interest a contractor in the construction of this school, therefore, we requested Mr. Indian Agent Landry to try to locate a suitable building foreman. He has done so and has now reported as follows:\n\n\"I have succeeded in locating an experienced and reliable builder to act as foreman. The party is Alfred Blouin, whose address is Jeussard, Alberta. This man is 36 years of age and well reputed as a very good carpenter and builder. So far he has built 4 military barracks at Grande Prairie, 1 church at Jeussard, 1 ware-house at Peace River, 1 residence at Fairview and 3 residences at Peace River. He gives as reference Mr. Charles Turner, Contractor, Grande Prairie, Alberta, and also Mr. Ray Lahey, Contractor, Peace River, Alberta. I know this man personally and I have seen some of work that he has done. I am of the opinion that he is fully qualified to undertake the building of our school there.

Considering the wages paid for common labour and for skilled labour, I do not think that Mr. Blouin is over estimating himself by demanding these wages\".\n\nYour approval is requested for the hiring of Mr. Blouin at the rate of $1.50 per hour to supervise the construction of this school by Indian labour.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, January 27, 1948.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Indian Agent, High Prairie, Alberta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School.\n\nWe are now able to report progress from here with regard to the construction of this school:\n\n(a) The requisitions are now in the hands of the Departmental Purchasing Agent and it is hoped that Purchase Orders can be issued in the near future. I understand that Father Beuglet would do everything possible through his business contacts in Edmonton to obtain scarce items of building materials. We are now buying similar building materials for two schools in the Norway House Agency and have experienced great difficulty in buying millwork and some hardware items. If firms in Edmonton cannot promise delivery of certain scarce items, then we will write you immediately requesting you to contact Father Beuglet in an attempt to have him expedite such delivery.\n\n(b) Your recommendation concerning Mr. Blouin is now at the Minister's office with a request that approval be given for hiring him at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\n(c) Approval is given to your recommendation concerning the building of a storage shed near the site of the school. We will try to get authority for you to buy the lumber necessary by local purchase.\n\n(d) The matter of the site of the school was discussed at some length with Father Beuglet. The Indian Act requires that day schools be situated on an Indian reserve. We would be prepared to accept your recommendation with regard to the location of the school but it should be\nlocated on property owned by the Department. If necessary we could consider the purchase of a small plot of land from Bishop Routhier. We will expect to hear further from you with regard to this matter.\n\n(e) We have asked in our estimates for the sum of $14,000.00 for the construction of this school. A lot depends on the cost of materials, freighting, etc., and as to what provision can be made for water and other extras. Therefore, we are not in a position to give you a definite answer insofar as these items are concerned, until we know how great an expenditure has been made for other necessary supplies, etc. In any event, we can not exceed $14,000.00.\n\nBernard F.

While the purchase order has not been received here yet I have made an arrangement with a good number of Indians to freight that cement into Atikameg as soon as it arrives in Enilda. As previously stated it is very important that this be freighted in immediately and by all means not later than by the end of March. The same would apply to all other material required for the construction of this school. The road to Atikameg in the summer time is practically impassable with loads.\n\nI am not aware as to the exact weight of the material that will have to be taken there but considering 25 tons of cement and 30,000 feet of lumber, I would request an accountable advance of $1,500.00 to cover such freighting. If the material comes in sufficiently early I shall have no trouble in accounting for this advance by March 31st.\n\nA.

Landry, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your Credit Voucher No. 446, I have to advise you that you have been credited with $2,480.06 on the basis of this account. The sum of $10.00 was deducted from this, since you advanced J. Miller $10.00 on freighting as per receipt #59313 which was not accounted for by details in the same way as the other advances.\n\nI have also to advise you that you have had advances re this school to the extent of $4000.00 - $1200.00 as per Cheque No. 96664, dated Mar. 13th and Cheque No. 99380 amounting to $2500.00 so that you still have to account for $1529.94.\n\nIt is noted that you have several other balances outstanding as follows:\n\n- Trust Funds = $9047.59\n- Vote 511 = $600.00 (Firewood)\n- Annuities = $1890.00\n- Vote 515 = $1700.00 (500.00-Freighting) (1200.00-Bldg. homes)\n\nIt is not known in Treasury if these are in process of being passed for payment by the Department but it is definitely not understood why these advances have not been adjusted by Credit Vouchers or refunds before this. The end of the Government Fiscal Year is March 31st, and since none of this money can be expended after that date, certainly sufficient time has elapsed to have these advances completely cleaned up.\n\nAn impression seems to have developed that these accountable advances do not have to be accounted for until the end of the year. This is definitely not the case. Accountable Advances should be liquidated by Credit Voucher or refund of unexpended balances immediately after the money has been spent.\n\nWill you please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nN/W\n\nW. Leachlan\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI am attaching hereto Voucher No. 446, covering the cost of freighting building material, etc., for the Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that the Trust A/c here has an overdraft of $990.06 in the Freight A/c, Whitefish Lake.

Neary\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nThe foreman and three carpenters have now proceeded to Atikameg with a view of building the above mentioned school. While there it is anticipated that a good number of Indians will also be employed as the foreman, Mr. Blouin, is very eager to see that this building is completed as soon as possible.\n\nIt is not known here exactly how much money will be required for the total labour of this construction. Meanwhile however, it would be appreciated that a temporary advance of $4,000.00 could be sent to the Indian Agency Trust Account, where it will be accounted for in the usual manner.\n\nI have reasons to believe that in all likelihood you will require a progress report as the construction goes on. In that respect it would be appreciated if I could be in receipt of the required forms for this report if they exist. It would also be appreciated if I could be instructed of the work progress in that matter.\n\nA. Landry,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 9, 1948.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Superintendent,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 26th, we are arranging to forward you an accountable advance for $1,000.00 for labour in connection with the erection of the Atikameg Indian Day School. As soon as this cheque is expended you should account for it in the proper manner and apply for a further advance.\n\nWhile the construction of the building is in progress you should visit it weekly, if possible, and let us have a letter stating the progress that is being made.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F.

The freighting to that point by Indian teams constitutes a major item.\n\nThe rough part of the building is now completed. That is to say, the walls and floor, ceiling and roofing and all partitions are completed. The chimney is also nearly finished. All excavation is completed. The outside finish of the cement wall is also completed. Work is also progressing nicely on the interior finish of the basement floor and walls. One out-house is completed.\n\nThe hauling of rocks, gravel and sand proved costly. These were only available at a considerable distance from the building site and a road had to be built to get there.\n\nThe $1000.00 advance already received for labor has now been used up. A remaining $2435.00 in wages is unpaid as of July 31st. It would therefore be appreciated if an accountable advance of $3000.00 were received here to pay such wages.\n\nDue to.........\nDue to the difficulty in obtaining skilled labor to work at such a remote point it is somewhat hard to estimate how much longer it will be before the building is completed. Mr. J.A. Blouin, the foreman, expects to have it completed by September 1st.\n\nA.

At the present time there is a debit balance of some $1300.00 in the Atikameg Day School account at Lesser Slave Lake; in addition to this there are work sheets on hand covering labor already performed but yet to be paid for, in the amount of some $750.00.\n\nThe carpenters are at present on location presumably putting the finishing touches on this building. The Superintendent, Mr. Lapp has been trying to obtain the services of a plasterer but it is not known whether he has been successful as yet. I understand that there is still some plumbing to be done - I gathered that the plumbing had been roughed in but that there was some finishing to do. These additional expenditures may amount to some $750.00 to $1000.00.\n\nIn order to clear the debit balance in this account and to provide the addition funds required to pay outstanding wages, and to complete the school, an accountable advance of at least $2500.00 should be provided as soon as possible.\n\nG.

I hope that it will be agreeable to you too.\n\nBelieve me, dear sir,\n\nThankfully yours,\nMother Superior\n[Signature]\nOctober 29, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Man.\n\nThe attached voucher No. 933 (131) was submitted by the former Superintendent, Mr. Landry, to account for advances forwarded to him in connection with the construction of the Atikameg Day School. The Treasury Branch has asked that this voucher be returned for clarification and revision if necessary.\n\nThey point out the following:\n\n(1) For the week ending July 10th the Agent wrote one cheque to J.A. Blouin. For the second and third and fourth names there is no evidence that Blouin paid out this money. Please obtain this information.\n\n(2) Deductions have been made for income tax and unemployment insurance but no indication is given as to what disposal was made of the money. The former Agent has not submitted an accounting for either employer's or employees' share of unemployment insurance.\n\n(3) For the week of July 17th it would appear that the net amount required was handed to the foreman but there is no receipt from the persons whom the foreman paid.\n\nThe same applies to the rest of the credit vouchers. To be complete, the credit voucher should contain receipts for all payments made.\n(4) The income tax deductions should be forwarded to the Income Tax Department by cheque. If this has already been done, we would like to know the cheque number, amount and date.\n\nThe same applies to both the employer's and employees' share of the unemployment insurance.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThere are quite a number of them\nworking with Mr. Brown.\n\nOn the week ending July 18th, Agent wrote\none check to Mr. Brown... On the second and third\nweek there is no evidence that Brown has\npaid out the money. Since then, he has\nbeen made for income tax & tax. In\nbut no indication as to what he has paid.\nRemuneration. Agent has submitted\nno accounting for either Employer\nor Employee share & tax.\n\nOn week July 27th, he has landed the\ncheck to the foreman. But we have\nno record of what the Agent has done\nwith it.\n\nThe same applies to the rest of the weeks.\n\nTo be complete, the book should contain\nreceipts for all payments made.\nHanding the money to the foreman was\nnot sufficient. The income tax deductions\nshould be forwarded to the Income Tax Dept.\nby check. If he gave the check to the foreman,\nthen we cannot perhaps check\nthrough his cash book. The same\napplies to both Employers & Employees\nshare & tax.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nReverend Father Floc'h of Saint Benoit Mission, Atikameg Alberta, wishes me to call your attention to the present conditions in regard to the new school building which the Department is erecting at Atikameg, as well as the other matters pertaining to the school itself.\n\nHe states that:\n\n1: The building is not yet completed.\n2: The heating plant, the toilets for the children and the double windows still have to be finished or installed. This is made difficult because the workmen here left and will not return.\n3: Some of the desks are still at Grouard.\n4: The kitchen stove, which was ordered C.O.D. from Simpson, is at Enilda and the Agent says that he has no money to have it freighted to the Mission.\n5: The Agent would like us to open the school on November 22nd, but as stated above, only part of the desks are in the school and moreover there are no chairs and tables or bedding for the sisters who will be in charge of the school.\n6: Apparently the school books and other school material have not yet been shipped or are delayed somewhere in transit.\n7: The cocoa milk and sugar have arrived, but there are no biscuits.\n\nThe above report, as stated, was forwarded to me by the Reverend Father Floc'h who is in charge of this Mission and should in my estimation be inquired into.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have a report from you as soon as possible regarding the progress of the work at the Atikameg School and we would like to know the approximate date on which you consider it can be opened.\n\nWe have been advised that there is considerable work that has to be done and that the workmen have left.\n\nWe have also been told that some of the desks are still at Grouard and that the kitchen stove is at Enilda. Possibly you have already arranged for delivery of these articles to the school.\n\nHave the furnishings for the residential portion of the building arrived yet?\n\nWe are ordering vitaminized biscuits from Paulin Chambers in Winnipeg and it is hoped that these will reach you in the near future.\n\nWhen replying you should also let us have an idea of the approximate cost of finishing the building. Funds are provided in the current year's appropriation for this building and we want to have it completed so that we will not have to provide funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F.

The floor registers had not been installed owing to the\nfact that registers are not available. We put in a telephone call\nto Edmonton in an endeavour to secure registers but none were av-\nailable of the size desired. We also communicated with a plumbing\nsupply firm in Peace River with similar results. At present we\nhave an order for registers with a High Prairie welding firm but\nthere has been a delay owing to lack of material. The only substi-\ntute available is mink wire which Mr. J. A. Bluin, the carpenter,\nwill put on when he goes to Atikameg on December 6th.\n\nThe kitchen sink had not been installed because a pipe thread-\ner was not available. Mr. Bluin will endeavour to borrow such a\ntool and install the sink.\n\nSome of the hot air pipes that connect the living quarters\nwith the furnace were not available. We have attempted to get\nthese pipes in High Prairie but they are not in stock here. Mr.\nBluin will take measurements and we will have them made as soon\nas possible.\n\nThe windows had not been put in the toilet as they too were\nnot shipped from Edmonton. The air vents and urinal were not put\nin but Mr. Bluin has promised to do this work during the week of\nDecember 6th.\n\nAll except three or four of the desks were at the school on\nNovember 22nd. A few of the desks had been damaged in transit.\nbut I believe that Father Floc'h will arrange for repairs.\n\nThe storm windows had not been put on the building as they had not yet arrived in Atikameg.\n\nOn December 1st, we arranged with a truck driver to have the storm windows taken to the school. The remaining desks were to be taken in at that time also.\n\nI believe that all the furnishings for the residential part of the building will have arrived at Atikameg at this date. On Nov. 22nd, the kitchen stove had not yet arrived owing to the fact that it was shipped C.O.D. to Enilda. The station agent at Enilda wrote to Simpson's of Regina and asked to have the stove released but that was not done. We sent a telegram from this office and asked that the stove be released but no answer arrived. Rev. Father Tessier of Grouard secured the stove by giving a personal cheque. It has now gone to Atikameg but is much too small for preparation of a noon meal for school children.\n\nMr. Bluin estimates that it will cost approximately $200.00 to finish the school. I believe that amount will be sufficient although the cost of floor registers will be high.\n\nIn a telephone conversation today Rev. Father Beuglet of McNamara told me that the Atikameg Day School was to open on Monday, November 29th. I might add that the delay seems to have been mainly the result of shortage of building materials.\n\nG. S. Lapp\n\nG. S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nDecember 16, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nAtikameg Indian Day School\n\nReference your 131-6-3 of December 4.\n\nWe note the progress being made with regard to equipping the above school for opening. Can you please advise me whether you wish an accountable advance of $200.00 forwarded to you or whether you have sufficient funds on hand to meet future costs.\n\nIf there are any other details which can be attended to from here, can we please be advised.\n\nBernard F.

They have been particularly slow in delivering plumbing and heating supplies.\n\nI understand that the desks have now arrived and that the building should be finished in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Lapp,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 4th ultimo with reference to the Atikameg Day School.\n\nHas it been possible to complete this building since your previous letter? Has all of the furniture arrived by this time?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSt. Benedict's Mission Atikameg, Alberta December the 14th 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Superintendent,\nWelfare Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLet allow me to wish you a \"Very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I ask God to Bless you and to assist you in your work. Will you also offer my Wishes to Mr. Neary, who is doing so much for our school at Whitefish Lake, Atikameg.\n\nIndeed we are grateful to the Department of Indian Affairs for the nice school built at Atikameg for our Indian children.\n\nHowever I feel it is not true what is the most advisable in a place like ours; most of the people lead a nomadic life and cannot afford to stay around to have their children go to school. It happens that some have sent back the children to Grouard and it may partly be the reason why some Catholic children have been put at the Anglican school. Besides others have come from the district of Athabasca or Prairie Lake and stay here; the inconvenience is that far away from their traditions they can hardly maintain their families; in fact they have build some kind of houses to shelter themselves, but they are so poor that they cannot afford to have a floor. I take the liberty to mention it that it can be understood the condition of life in our district. It is very different as it is around Edmonton and Calgary; the Indians have a chance to farm, here it is entirely a wild country, with bush, swamps, etc.\n\nYou may be interested to know how the school building stand; it is not completed; the heating system is not finished, lack of material requisitioned; there is no register fixed on the floor. The sink is not fixed; the men who came did not have the tools to fix it. There are some storm windows not brought in yet and none is set up, and some other things, which are finished. It has taken quite a time to have the school built; the carpenters were away twice for about a month every time. They are supposed to come back at any time, but I am afraid that we may have to wait quite a while.\n\nThe teacher, Sister V\u00e9line will appreciate very much, if the school furnitures, requisitioned to the Department, can be shipped in the nearest future; for till now she has to go on what was begged or borrowed here and there, and she is short of everything useful to make the school go; it is known the attention always by the Department to supply everything needed. She did not receive any school register nor any form for monthly or quarterly returns.\n\nWill not be advisable too to have the \"national Flag supplied and some Fire Extinguishers\".\nIt will be appreciated also, if different things for games can be supplied as footballs, baseball sets, etc.; our children are very fond of sports and it is a way to have them busy at recess time or after school.\n\nSurely you will excuse me to be such a begger; but I do so thinking it necessary for the welfare of our Indian children.\n\nWith my Wishes of the Season and my sincere Thanks,\n\nI am Yours very truly.\n\nY.

The weather became very severe at that time so that Mr. Bluin did not make the trip.\n\nOn January 5th Mr. Bluin went to Atikameg by truck to continue work on the school. He was accompanied by Brother Boss\u00e9, a tinsmith and carpenter from the Grouard Mission. I went to Atikameg at that time also in the Agency car.\n\nThe following information was given to me today by Brother Boss\u00e9:\n\nMr. Bluin and Brother Boss\u00e9 installed the floor registers and fitted the storm windows. They attempted to complete connections to the sink but some of the fittings were missing. The hot air connections to the living quarters are not complete but the living quarters are sufficiently warm even in sub-zero temperatures. One hot air elbow leading to the classroom was of very light material and is damaged beyond repair. A substitute elbow may be found at Grouard and sent to Atikameg. The air vents and urinal have not been installed in the toilets.\n\nThe attached letter lists some work which should be done on the school building. All the improvements which are requested by the Reverend Mother Superior are necessary and I recommend that the work be done as soon as possible. At present there is no storage space in the class-\nIf shelves with sliding doors were built under the large windows the storage problem would be partially solved. The warehouse to which Reverend Mother Superior refers is the building in which the cement and other building materials were stored. The cement was piled on one side with the result that the floor joists are broken. At present snow blows through the broken floor so the building is not suitable for storage.\n\nAll the furniture for the school has arrived at Atikameg. Included in the shipment were two couches (chesterfields) and two buffets. One of each is sufficient in the small quarters. Reverend Mother Superior is waiting for instructions as to the disposition of the extra couch and buffet for which there is insufficient storage space. Some parts of the broken desks are in the office here. When a capable workman is found the desks will be repaired and returned to Atikameg. At present there are sufficient desks for the pupils enrolled.\n\nMr. Bluin left Atikameg on the afternoon of January 8th. He plans not to return before May although he is aware, I believe, that the building should be completed by March 31st. He is also aware of the fact that the roads to Atikameg are much more passable in the winter than during the spring and summer. At present the temperature is above +32\u00b0 F so that the work still unfinished on the out-buildings could have been completed.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nAtikameg Indian Day School,\nAtikameg, Alberta,\nJan. 6, 1949.\n\nMr. J. S. Lapp,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Atikameg Indian Day School, Catholic Mission, requires the following improvements:\n\n1. A folding table attached to the wall at the back of the room in the class.\n2. Chains on upper windows in the classroom.\n3. Shelves for books (with doors & locks) under the big windows in one side of the class.\n4. Shelves made in the basement in the storeroom.\n5. Floor repaired in the warehouse.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Four screens for the basement windows and three for the class room are asked for, as well as sufficient screens for the living quarters.\n\nI would recommend that the above request receive your consideration.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nAttached hereto please find our Voucher No. 99, covering the final accounting of the advances received from the Department to pay wages in connection with the construction of the Atikameg Indian Day School.\n\nThe total advances received from the Department to pay wages in connection with the building of the school amounted to $6500.00. In all, this office disbursed in cash for labor a total of $7027.14, thus leaving an overdraft of $527.14 in our Trust Account Ledger. It would be appreciated if a cheque could be forwarded at an early date in order this overdraft may be cleared from our ledgers.\n\nThere is a further amount of $455.02 which is outstanding covering income tax and unemployment insurance remittances. As we already have an overdraft of $527.14, it is felt advisable to have the Department forward an accountable advance of $455.02 in addition to the $527.14, therefore a total of $982.16 will be required. The $455.02 will be accounted for by receipts covering the tax and insurance payments.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. J.A. Blouin, foreman, was overpaid in the amount of $22.00. We have written Mr. Blouin requesting him to remit this amount to this office which will be remitted to the Receiver General. Mr. Blouin has a further $33.00 owing him for recent work he had done at the school, therefore in the event he is unable to remit the $22.00 overpayment, collection maybe made from what is still owing him.\n\nG.S. Lapp (Superintendent)\n5th February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $140.29 covering the cost of vitamized biscuits purchased for use at the Atikameg Indian Day School. This school was opened after we placed the first order for biscuits, and therefore, it was not included on the original list. Please issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.

The procedure followed in this office until Sept. 20th was to make deductions from wages for income tax and unemployment insurance but deductions were not forwarded to the Income Tax Branch nor to the Unemployment Insurance Office. The plan was to forward the deductions, in one sum, to offices concerned, when the school was completed. Since the school was presumably very near completion on September 20th, it was thought best to continue that procedure. The receipt from the Unemployment Office is attached. The receipt from the Income Tax Branch is not attached as it has not yet been received here but it is hoped that the cheque number will be acceptable to the Treasury Branch.\n\n(3) With regard to the week ending July 17th: It is not understood why the Return of Labor with cheque number and signatures of recipients is not acceptable to The Treasury Branch. Perhaps the difficulty is that the recipients have placed their signatures in the \"Witness Column\" rather than in the \"Received...\"\npayment\" column. It will be impossible to obtain receipts covering payments for labor for the week ending July 17th before May 1st as the Indians who worked at the Atikameg Day School are for the most part trappers and some will not receive their mail before April 15th.\n\nAttached hereto is our Credit Voucher No. 262(131) dated March 3rd, accounting for $7482.16, the total advances received from the Department for wages building the school. I might point out that you will not find all the labor sheets attached hereto as a number of them are attached to our voucher number 619, dated July 19th, 1948, and voucher No. 99, dated January 19, 1949. These labor sheets are no doubt on file in your office.\n\n(Sgd.)\nG.S.

Lapp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nWe have the requisition of 16th March, 1949, which you forwarded from the teacher of the Atikameg Indian Day School. We do not see the necessity for supplying so many articles to the janitor, and consequently, no authority is being given for the purchase of the items mentioned on the requisition.\n\nWith regard to the second requisition for certain classroom supplies, we approve purchase of the following:\n\n5 window shades, cream, 36\" x 70\"\n1 thermometer\n3 wash basins\n1 large kettle\n4 sheets masonite, 4 x 7\n\nWe will send the teacher 2 playground balls and 2 playground bats, but we do not supply the other athletic equipment requested on the requisition.\n\nPlease let us have an explanation of the purpose for which the 36 plates, 36 spoons and 1 ladle are required. The standard list of furnishings was forwarded to the teacher and on returning the list to our office the set of dishes which we usually supply was deleted, and, therefore, were not given to her.\n\nBernard F.

Could authorization be obtained to secure the services of a competent worker who would finish the work at the school? The expense would be covered by return of labor. I have not been able to visit the school since early in January and so it is difficult to estimate the cost of the work but I believe that the labor involved would amount to no more than $100.00. The materials including paint, varnish, and some furnace pipes would probably cost approximately $25.00.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nAtikameg, July 14, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S.

The success of the former has, in no degree, equalled that of the one at Whitefish Lake. This want of improvement is easily traceable to the teachers. Had those schools been conducted by trained and qualified teachers, of whom there is no dearth, the progress made might have been conspicuous, as that which the teacher at Whitefish Lake can show.\n\nExtract from A.G.

In this report Mr. Markle says that the attendance here has not been what might be expected. He states that the teacher intends to provide a mid-day meal with a hope of improving conditions in this respect.\n\nThe Department will be glad to give Mrs. Waters assistance to do this, and I have to ask you to be good enough to communicate with her and furnish her with the necessary utensils of a serviceable nature, and to supplement the supply of biscuits with a reasonable allowance of rice, salt, tea, soup meat, flour, beans and bacon. The meat may be purchased and the other articles issued from the Agency storehouse, but your voucher should show the amounts of each given to the school.\n\nMr. Markle also refers to certain articles of stationery needed, and you will be good enough to have the teacher make a requisition on the forms provided for the purpose and forward it to the Department, when it will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Batty, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Good Fish Lake Day School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to see a better attendance at this school and is prepared to assist Mrs. Waters to give a mid-day meal, which has in a number of instances proved to be an effective means of securing a better attendance. Mr. Agent Batty has been instructed to have her supplied with the necessary articles for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

A short time ago her step Daughter died leaving two small children in her care, and the day she was buried Mrs Waters own son, a boy of about 9 years of age died suddenly. Since then she has been suffering from nervous prostration and heart trouble.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of 7th instant, granting Mrs Waters a months leave of absence, with salary.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company's Telegraph\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll messages are received by this Company for transmission, subject to the terms and conditions printed on their blank Form No. 2, which terms and conditions have been agreed to by the sender of the following message.

Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding somewhere between the Dept. and the Mission concerning the teaching at the Indian School at Goodrich Lake, and I want an explanation. I was given the school to teach for one year by Rev. Mr. Turner, Sup't of Indian Schools, and I got my report Oct. 1st, 1910, Aug. last. After I had taught the school for 2\u00bd months, an objection was raised, viz., my home was not on the reserve. I wrote to Rev. Turner and explained how it was that all this my home was not on the reserve.\n\nI lived there close to my school and boarded myself in the same house as other teachers have done when teaching the school. Later another objection was raised that I did not have a qualified certificate. Now when I was hired I was not asked a single question as to my qualifications but was given the school for a year solely on the recommendation of the last teacher who taught the school. True I have not a certificate, but I have taught on permit and I have acted in that capacity quite a good deal have filled vacancies on the reserve. When I engaged the school last Sept. and I was considered competent or I would not have been recommended by the last teacher. Now I wish to know what is that is doing the objecting. The Methodist Mission or the Department. I was hired for the year which will expire June 30th, 1911. I have not been paid yet which gave me the school for the year. Can I not teach the year out? If not please let me know why. As I was not the one to break the contract first and I want redress for damage it has been to me for I hired the school in good faith and have...\nOttawa, February 10, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in reference to your appointment as teacher of the Goodfish Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the objection to your remaining in charge of this school was taken by the Department based upon information contained in a letter written by you to the Rev. Mr. Perrier on November 3rd, last, in which you state \"my home is only six miles from the school so it is quite handy for me\". The Department was not aware that you were boarding upon the reserve. I may say, however, that it is the desire of the Department to obtain, if at all possible, a qualified teacher for this school, but, in view of the circumstances, your services will be continued till June 30th, next, provided future reports upon your work are satisfactory. I may add for your information that the Department reserves the right to make all appointments to Indian day schools, although the privilege of nominating teachers for schools conducted under the auspices of any church is given to the authorities of the church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Ada Webster,\nTeacher,\nBoyne Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, February 10, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the appointment of Mrs. Webber as teacher of the Goodfish Lake school I beg to say that Mrs. Webber now writes the Department and states that she was nominated by you for a period of one year, that no questions whatever as to her qualifications were asked her when she was engaged and that she was given the position solely on the recommendation of the last teacher. Mrs. Webber further states that she is living upon the reserve and, in view of these circumstances, the Department has consented to her remaining in charge till June 30th, next, provided future reports as to her work are satisfactory.\n\nIn future the Department would like you to submit all nominations for consideration and no permanent engagement for a stated period should be made without approval. In cases where you have no personal knowledge of the qualifications of an applicant the necessary inquiry should be instituted.\n\nI may say that the reports received on Mrs. Webber's work are not satisfactory and it is hoped that you may be able to nominate a competent teacher to take charge after next summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nRev. T. Verrier,\nDept.

The facts which you are already in possession of. And I notice in your answer to me you state that under the circumstances my services will continue until the 30th of June of this year. Will you kindly notify Rev. Porter of this and also the lady they have put in there to teach in my place and give her her dismissal as she was put in by fraud and moreover I did not even have all of my furniture removed from the house when I was boarding before.\nshe moved in. I did not receive notice to quit teaching but I did receive a letter from Rev. Ferrier that the Dept. made a two-fold objection and that he could do nothing for me. But as I had been granted the school for a year I determined to write to him again and also to the Dept. Meanwhile I closed school until I should hear from both parties and while I was anxiously awaiting a reply another person has been installed there by the name of Miss Addy. Said person living right here in the neighborhood whose qualifications are not better than mine and whose home is 9 miles from the school whereas my home was only 6 miles from the school. I received last letter from Rev. Ferrier Jan 18th and I had taught three weeks on the New Year before I knew that there was any kicking being done. I have certainly done the best I could to make the school a success. Have labored to please all parties concerned and I loved my work among these poor people.\nOttawa, March 15, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in further reference to your services as teacher of the Goodfish Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department was informed that you resigned your position on January 18th and that Mrs. Alldritt was placed in charge; however, the matter will now be taken up with Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Ada Webber,\nBoyne Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, March 15, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of March 2nd, last, in reference to the appointment of Mrs. Alldritt as teacher of the Goodfish Lake day school.\n\nAs you were informed on February 10th the Department consented to Mrs. Webber's remaining in charge until June 30th, next, provided the reports as to her work were satisfactory. Nothing further was heard in this matter until the Department was indirectly advised of the appointment of Mrs. Alldritt. It was presumed by the Department that when the change of teachers was made mutually satisfactory arrangements had been made, but in a letter dated the 27th ultimo just received from Mrs. Webber she claims that she has not been fairly dealt with. She states that she did not even receive notice to quit the position. In view of the fact that the Department consented to Mrs. Webber's remaining in charge till June 30th, next, some explanation would appear to be necessary. If she resigned the position before action was taken to appoint Mrs. Alldritt the Department should be so advised at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt.of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nPoyne Lake\nTo the Dept of Indian Affairs,\nApril 9th 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter at hand.\n\nAt present I must say the matter I wrote you about concerning the teaching of the Indian School at Good Fish Lake seems enveloped in a mystery. Your letter says that the Dept was informed that you resigned on the 17th of last Jan., you did not say by whom you had been informed. But I infer that it was thru Rev Ferrier of Brandon. Now there is a serious mistake somewhere because I did not resign my position of my own accord. But Rev Hodgins of Vermillion wrote me the 18th of Jan. that he was informed thru J Ferrier that my term terminated the 30th of Dec.\nNow wasn't that a great time to notify me that my time was up after I had taught 8 weeks on the New Year. Why did he not let me know this before? The same day I received this word from Mr. Hodges, I also had a letter from Mr. Ferrier stating that the Indian Dept. made a two-fold objection to my keeping the school, first that my home was 6 miles from school (although I resided near my school during the time I was teaching as I informed you later) and that I did not possess a qualified certificate and he said further than that that he could do nothing for me. He carried the idea to me that the Dept. was the ones who were doing all the objecting. After noting contents of both letters I decided it would be best to close the school until I could hear from you and Mr. Ferrier. I heard from the Indian Dept. and they said it had been the wish...\nof the Dept to obtain a teacher who had a qualified certificate but in view of the circumstances that my services would continue until the 31st of June next I positively deny the fact that I resigned because I did not give the school up of my own free will and to prove my statement I even wrote Mr Turier that if he would use his influence with the Dept to let me keep the school for the remaining 6 months of the year I would teach for the consideration of $8.00 per year. One cannot do justice to a school of this kind for less than a year and I took it for a year I would not have taken the school for a shorter period anyway. The lady who has the school at present is no better qualified than myself if she had been she might have taught the school in this settlement but she was objected to because she had no certificate and her\nhome is farther from the school than mine is. Now if the Dept takes the matter up I hope a thorough investigation will be made because I want justice. I think I am entitled to my salary for the remaining 6 months. If the mission would rather keep Mrs Aldritt all right, providing they pay me for the remainder of the year awaiting a reply I am\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nMrs Ada Webb\nOttawa, April 12, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has communicated with Rev.

She is a woman of about forty years of age, and I believe properly qualified, and was teaching at Boyne Lake, a White School about ten miles distant, when I wrote her concerning the Indian School. If further information regarding her is required by the Department I will try to secure it.\n\nTrusting you will overlook the delay in replying to the above communication.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 27, 1911.\nSec. of The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of March 2nd and March 15th\n#-116959/1 re the appointment of Mrs. Alldritt, as teacher\nof the Good Fish Lake School, I have delayed answering these\nletters until I could visit Alberta. It is true that she\nhas been appointed to the position, in place of Mrs. Webber.\nWhen I received your communication re the necessity of dis-\npensing of Mrs. Webber's services, I at once communicated with\nRev. E. J. Hodgins of Vermillion, Alta., who is the Chairman\nof that District for the Methodist Church. Good Fish Lake\nis in his District, and I have always made a point of con-\nsulting the Chairman, if he is interested in the appointing\nof teachers in the Schools on his District, and he recommended\nthat Mrs. Alldritt be appointed. I then wrote to Mrs.\nAlldritt and offered her the position. In the meantime a\ncorrespondence started between Mrs. Webber and myself, and she\ndesired that she be left there until the end of June, notwith-\nstanding I had given her notice that her services would not be\nrequired after the end of 1910. However I was favorably dis-\nposed to continue her services, and I sent all the information\nI had to Mr. Hodgins, who was on the ground, and asked him\nto do whatever he thought was just and write to all parties\nOttawa, May 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of April 12th, last, in which you were asked for information in reference to the resignation of Mrs. Webber, teacher of the Goodfish Lake day school, and to state that the Department would like to have a reply to that communication at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Department is now advised by the Indian Agent that Mrs. Webber, the former teacher, taught the school from the 2nd to the 19th of January. A portion of the salary is, therefore, due to Mrs. Webber. The school was open 52 days in the quarter and she should receive 14/52 of $75.00 or $20.19.\n\nThere has been some misunderstanding between the resident missionary and Mrs. Webber with regard to her resignation and I would ask you to see that her share of the quarter's salary is sent to her at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Don't what I ask is this that the Dept pay me for the 3 weeks I taught in Jail at the rates I hired for in the beginning viz $4.50 per year and also let me know whom I can apply to for same.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nMrs Ada Webber\n\nBoyne Lake.\nIf there is any doubt in the mind of the Dept let them examine the Register it is all there in black & white the time I taught.\n\nMy Neighbours can all testify to my honesty and Integrity and all know that I was shamefully used about the school and was shocked at the trickery that was practised to put me out of it and there wasn't one of them but thought I ought to have had the school the year out.\n\nPlease write me at once.\n\nMrs Ada Webb.\nOttawa, July 5, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that on the 26th ultimo the Department was advised by the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society that your salary for the March quarter, last, was being sent you. No doubt you have received it by this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Ada Webber,\nBoyne Lake, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nWill it meet with the approval of the department to engage Miss Aldritt at Good Earth to take school for the coming year. If so what is the salary? I would suggest $450.\n\nYours sincerely,\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, August 18, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to continue the services of Mrs. Aldritt as teacher of the Good Fish Lake School and will pay her at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nI desire, however, to point out that while the enrolment at this school is large the average attendance has been very poor and if better results are not obtained during the coming year the question of closing the school or obtaining the services of another teacher will have to be considered. The success of the school must to a very large extent depend upon Mrs. Aldritt's efforts and I would ask you to impress upon her the necessity for using her influence with the parents to obtain a more regular attendance. This is one of the reserves in the northern district in which there should be a very fair attendance as the Indians live in close proximity to the school and it is hoped that future reports will show a decided improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nAst. Deputy and Secretary,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, August 15, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has decided to continue the services of Mrs. Aldritt as teacher of the Good Fish Lake School at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nThis is one of the reserves in your Agency in which the day school should be most successful as the Indians are so located that there is no reason why the children should not attend the school. The Department will expect better results during the coming year in the way of attendance and I have to ask you to co-operate with the teacher and give her every assistance in your power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am not teaching at present, however, as the Indians are scattered all over, having, and I am preparing for the Sept. exams, but I am certain this average can be maintained.\n\nThe Goodfish Lake school should never have been closed and should be supplied with a teacher again as soon as possible.\n\nI do not know what Mrs. Watters did at Hobbema but have an idea that she gave them some kind of a hot lunch. It would not matter so much in what form she expressed her hearty interest in the children's welfare so long as the parents saw she had such an interest in them. Obtain the goodwill of the parents and the children will appear at school or any other place you wish.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear that you are sending a teacher right away.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd.

The sick were averaged 15. I managed alone for the first week but found the work far too much for me to handle. I have to cook dinner on my range & have it carried over to school.\n\nI feel sure the Dept will see how impossible it is for one person to attend to the cooking or to carry on the proper attention to all the branches of the classroom work. I was obliged to engage help. I have secured quite capable help at $2.50 per month & board. The Dept will understand that it is impossible for me to keep my family & pay an assistant out of $500 per annum. I still the work cannot be carried on successfully single handed. I expect when the term starts that there will be at least 25 children attending. Will you kindly let me know what you are willing to do in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor more information, visit www.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIf I am allowed an assistant I will take up the work among the mothers, hold a weekly meeting and instruct them in dressmaking, quilt making etc also in home keeping. In the spring I will have a good garden in connection with the school; the vegetables grown to be used for school dinners.\n\nThe girls could also be instructed in cooking. I have a sewing class but am obliged to bring the girls to my home not having any machine in school. If the Dept cares to purchase my machine I will move it over to the school & it could also be used for the mother's meetings. The machine is a Singer & has only been used a few months. I paid $56.25 for it, would sell for $50.00.\n\nI am glad to know we are to have a new school in the spring. The work is progressing wonderfully & is very encouraging but our accommodation is very limited. I hope the Dept will allow me an assistant so I can give proper attention to all the branches of the work.\n\nFlorence Watters\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMrs. Watters, teacher of the Goodfish Lake School, writes the Department asking it to assume payment of the wages of an assistant, who is engaged to attend to the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils in her school. The last return shows that she has an enrolment of 23 and an average of 14, which, she states, will be increased to 30 in the near future. Mrs. Watters says that if she is allowed an assistant she will take up field matron work on the reserve, hold weekly meetings and give instruction in dressmaking, etc. She states that she is paying $20.00 a month and board for this assistant and I should be glad to know whether the Department is to assume the payment of her wages at this rate; $10.00 a month is the amount usually allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, February 11, 1914.\nOttawa, February 13, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo stating that you have engaged an assistant to attend to the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils in the Goodfish Lake School at $20.00 a month and board and asking the Department to assume payment at this rate.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow this amount on the understanding that the Agent and Inspector report favourably on the work being done at your school. These officers will be communicated with.

D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nThere is no well in connection with this school or with the teachers new residence. Mrs. Waters stated that one was required and may have so informed the Department direct. If it is decided to get a well sunk I respectfully suggest that the crib is carried up about 30\" or 34\" above the grade and the required water elevated with a rope and a bucket. If a pump is supplied it is likely to be out of repair about half of the time and the agent called upon frequently to supply repairs and keep it in order\u2014almost an impossible task with so many operators of the pump.\n\nI was shown the plan of the proposed new school plan, calling for a building 28'x 36 and a lean-to 20'x 40'. The Indians claim that logs sufficiently long cannot be obtained for such a building, not easily, anyway. Moreover, the saw carriage is limited to about 24'. The roof of the lean-to has very little fall.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a report, on a form, of an inspection made of the Good Fish mid-day meal day school. This school was recently re-opened as the Department knows and changed from a regular day to a mid-day meal, and the transportation of the pupils to and from school.\n\nMy impression is that it would be prudent to decide as to the kinds of food to be furnished to the children and not to leave this to the teacher, or the supervisor, to decide. When so left they are liable to be making requisitions on the agent for various supplies, according to notions and fancies of individual teachers, and the agent is at a loss to know just what to give and what to refuse. The Indians at Good Fish lake have cows and I see no reason why they should not send in a little milk daily if it is their wish that the children get milk, or cream, in their tea. Indians, as a rule, do not use milk in tea and I fail to see why canned cream should be purchased and sent in at considerable expense unless it is that the Department and the teacher desires to educate them to live more expensively than do their parents at home. Poor people, too, very frequently are obliged to use tea without sugar. It's largely habit and my notion is that these pupils might as well form the habit in their mouth to use tea without sugar. I did.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 1, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector Markle on the Goodfish Lake Day School in which he calls attention to the supplies issued for the mid-day meal.\n\nThe Department, while willing to furnish a liberal quantity of plain, wholesome food for this meal, wishes you to be careful to see that the issues are strictly limited to such articles as are given to other schools where a mid-day meal is furnished, that is beef or bacon, flour, rice, tea and sugar. The Indians should be able to furnish milk for their tea if they need it and in no case should cream, milk or cream be given them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nWhitefish Lake Alta\nJune 29/14\n\nThe Sec.\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was to write about the Whitefish Lake day school. While the team was conveying the pupils to school our average was about 35. This last quarter the average is down to half. I believe with suitable accommodation as we expect to have in our new school that we can average nearly 40.\n\nThere are to be two classrooms & an assistant will be needed as one person cannot handle so many children & different branches of the work successfully. While the team is engaged I am practically running two schools in one; as the Whitefish children attend this school. I know the Dept considers $5 per day prohibitive as a driver's salary, but if all the facts of the case are considered, possibly it would be considered as quite reasonable.\n\nThe driver has to leave home about 7 am. & gather all the children from Whitefish Lake end of reserve bring them to school, then he goes east & brings the children from Reed lake. After school the long drive has to be repeated. He has to board himself & team & keep his family & he says he cannot possibly\ndo it on less than $3.00 per day. On review\nthe matter there is every prospect of a very\nsuccessful school being conducted here.\nTwo teachers, one driver, one good school building,\none teacher's residence answers for the whole\nreserve & it seems a pity to cripple the whole\nprospect by discontinuing the conveying\nof pupils until I know what the Dept\nintends to do re the drivers I do not know\nwhat supplies to ask for in connection with\nthe school this fall. Will the Dept kindly\ntry to have our new school ready for the fall\ntime; the old building is very unsanitary\nwill not accommodate all the children who wish\nto attend. I was unable to have a school garden\nthis year on account of the fencing not being\nsupplied that I purchased some time ago;\nbut hope another year to have a good\nschool garden. The vegetables would improve\nthe dinners & be more healthy for pupils than\nso much meat. It was my intention this fall\nto announce sewing meetings for the women of\nthe reserve. The object of meetings to be the making\nof clothing & quilts for the aged & needy, but I\ncannot carry out this plan or teach pupils to\nsew without a sewing machine. I came here with\nthe intention of building up the work & making\na success of the school, but my efforts cannot\nprove successful unless I have the equipment\nto work with. Hoping that the Dept will\nconsider the matter in every form & assist me\nin my efforts by providing necessary. I am your\nobliged,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWatts\nOttawa, August 14th, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to various matters connected with the work at the Good Fish Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that repairs are being made to the school and teacher's residence.

A letter has now been received from Mrs. H. Howard, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. The Department is at a loss to know whether it is Mrs. Waters or Mrs. Ross Moore who is married again.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. Howard,\nTeacher,\nGoodfish Lake School,\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received word from Mrs. Waters, the teacher at Good Fish Lake that she intended to resign her position as teacher of the school, and the reason she assigned was that she was going to get married. Since then she has been married to Mr. Howard, and has continued teaching the school and now writes me that she would like to remain on and have Mr. Howard as her Assistant, a position that was recently held by Mrs. Ada Webber.\n\nMrs. Howard informs me that her husband is a good Christian worker and that they plan to visit the pupils in their homes and keep in touch with the parents, and will try to keep up the best interests of the school, that Mr. Howard will have a school garden, and being a carpenter, he will give the boys instruction in the use of tools, and Mrs. Howard promises to instruct the girls in sewing and cooking, and intends to hold weekly Mother's Meetings.\n\nIt looks as though this arrangement would be very acceptable and I think it would be better to retain the services of Mrs. Howard as they have always been very satisfactory, and give her husband the position of Assistant. She has not said anything, nor has he mentioned the question of salary, but I press me $20.00 per month for him, and the Six Hundred per year for her will be satisfactory.\n\nMr. Howard in writing me stated that Chief Pakan has recently gone blind. He can see the sun and the moon and tell day light from darkness, and has the idea that he can be cured by a specialist as there appears to be a fog before him when he attempts to look around. He wants to know whether the Department would pay to have the opinion of a specialist on the condition of his eyes, to know whether anything could be done for them?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTP/JM.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of the 12th No. 116959/1.\n\nI wrote you the other day re Mrs. Howard continuing on in the work. It is Mrs. Waters who is married again, and is now Mrs. Howard. She resigned before her marriage but since, wrote me that she would like to continue on for at least a year.\n\nAs I stated in my last letter, I would be quite agreeable to Mrs. Howard continuing on as her services have always been very satisfactory in the past, and I presume will be in the future. While I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Howard, from what she says of him and from the letter that he has written me, I presume we would be safe in appointing him as her Assistant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was rather surprised that the Dept would ask him to work for $20 which is like working for his board. The only way I kept Mrs. Webber on so long was by paying her extra. I paid her at the rate of $32 a board. I would find it hard to find anyone who would work for less.\n\nThere is more than the cooking of the dinner for an assistant to attend to. The new plan we have adopted of individual work in the classroom calls for extra work. We find that the pupils learn much quicker by individual work than in classes. Then the sewing & knitting call for extra work. Mr. Howard is able to help much more than a lady assistant could. He had planned to teach the boys gardening & carpentering; also to do any repairs etc. that were needed around the premises that the Dept would otherwise have to pay extra for. All the clay from the well needs hauling away & there is quite a lot of fixing needed around the place. Mr. Howard could of course earn much more elsewhere but would rather help me with the school. He says he would be willing to do any repairs & help build it in shape if the Dept will add the boa...\nmoney to his salary of $250. I hope the Dept will consider this matter; it hardly seems fair to ask him to work for less than a former assistant, when he is helping more in so many ways.\n\nThe work is progressing well; the Indians are well pleased with the way the school is being conducted.\n\nIf the Dept decides to convey the Whitefish Lake children to school it will mean an attendance of from 35 to 40 & will require both Mr. Gb & I constantly in the classroom. The dinner would need to be planned out of school hours; but we could handle the work even with an attendance of 40 quite nicely.\n\nI hope the Dept will re consider their offer to Mr Howard & make it worth his while to continue as assistant.\n\nYrs resp.\n\nMrs H H Howard\nOttawa, April 19, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to the amount of salary allowed Mr. Howard as assistant at the Goodfish Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should have forwarded this communication through the Agent, as the Department will require a report from him before dealing with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have written to him again today asking him to take up the matter & you will no doubt hear from him soon. I hope the Dept will not delay the finishing of the school as the building we are now in is in very poor shape.\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs H H Howard.\nOttawa, May 11, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to finishing the Goodfish Lake School and conveying the children to school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Hughes will be written to in regard to these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

My impression is that the first requirement is the completion of new buildings and not crowd the old one with more pupils. The staff of this school seem to be impressed with the idea that they are doing a wonderful work. They are probably holding the children and parents in check to some degree but there is still a wide field for advancement, I think, in more than one direction.\n\nEnclosing herewith a sketch of the reserve and showing the location of homes of the children, also about the numbers of school age at locations shown.

Mr. Howards salary.\n\nAll the Dept. offered him was $20 per month, which is like asking him to work for his board. This amount is twelve dollars less than Mrs. Webber received from the Dept. I paid her extra to keep her as long as I did. I am sure you will agree that Mr. Howards work is worth as much or more than Mrs. Webbers was.\n\nHe has offered to do any odd jobs around the place; such as building the kitchen & keeping the buildings in repair etc., of the Dept.\nwill add the board money to his salary. Mrs. Webber was only here five days a week & they allowed $12.00 for her board. I will leave the matter with you whether you recommend the payment of $3.00 per week or $4.00 board. I feel you can truthfully say that the work is in better shape since Mr. Howard came. We are working together & giving individual instructions to each child; which keeps us both busy, & the children are making quite rapid progress. As I said in my letter to the Dept. It doesn't seem fair to ask Mr. Howard to work for less than the former assistant when his work is of better class.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. Howard\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, a letter received from Mrs. H. H. Howard, teacher at Goodfish Lake, regarding Mr. Howard's salary, and stating that Mr. Howard is not being paid at the same rate as the former assistant Mrs. Webber.\n\nI might state that there has been a marked improvement in the work at the school since Mr. Howard was engaged as assistant.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, June 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mrs. H.H. Howard, teacher of the Goodfish Lake Day School, regarding the salary paid Mr. Howard as assistant.\n\nIn connection with this matter I have to inform you that at the time of his appointment the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, stated that he considered that a salary of $20.00 per month for him and $600.00 per year for Mrs. Howard, a combined salary of $800.00 per year would be sufficient.\n\nThe Department, therefore, cannot grant an increase in Mr. Howard's salary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas. E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nMr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nI understand that Mrs. Howard of Goodfish Lake, Alberta, is desirous of having a school built with the idea of accommodating the children from Whitefish Lake, and is requesting the Department to provide for their being taken over by stage. We are depending on the children from Goodfish Lake, Whitefish Lake and Saddle Lake, as well as Hobema, for recruits for the Red Deer Institute, and the type of school on any one of these Reserves has a bearing upon the policy that should be adopted for the Red Deer Institute. If the question of building or of transporting the pupils has been placed before the Department, I would like to know the nature of the same before any definite steps are taken by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./ M.C.E.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nBrandon June 1st, 1915.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Rev. Mr. Ferrier's statement that Mrs. Howard of Goodfish Lake, Alta., is desirous of having a school built with the idea of accommodating the children from Whitefish Lake and arrangements made for having the children from there driven to her school I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Markle, who visited the Goodfish Lake School last month, says that the school is kept in an old log building, which is used for the mid-day meal as well as the class-room and is not suitable for the work.\n\nThe Indians agreed a year or more ago to erect the walls for a new class-room and kitchen, provided the Department completed the same. This was agreed to by the Department and the log wall of the class-room building is now up, but Mr. Markle states he is informed by Mrs. Howard and the Indians claim it will be too small and should be enlarged. This could be done at an outlay of about $650.00.\n\nThe enrolment at the Goodfish Lake School for the last quarter was 30, with an average attendance of 17.\nThe Whitefish Lake School was closed for lack of attendance in June, 1910.\n\nMr. Markle, with his report, has sent in a sketch showing the location of the homes of the Indian children and giving the numbers of school age on the locations as shown. This shows that there would be approximately 40 children who could attend from the vicinity of Whitefish Lake and Goodfish Lake, but it would entail a drive of at least ten miles to bring in five children who live at the north end of Whitefish Lake. If these five children were sent to Red Deer the drive for the others would be shortened by about four miles. At the lower end of Whitefish Lake Mr. Markle says there are seven children of school age. This would give the total number of children of school age around Whitefish Lake as twelve. The other children all live within walking distance of the Goodfish Lake School. If the children around Whitefish Lake were sent to Red Deer there would be no need of making a semi-boarding school of the Goodfish Lake School, which would seem to be the wish of Mrs. Howard.\n\nMr. Markle thinks that the first requirement is to complete the new building and not crowd the old one with more pupils. He says that Mr. and Mrs. Howard seemed to be impressed\nimpressed with the idea that they are doing a wonderful work. He states that they are probably holding the children and parents in check to some degree, but there is still room for advancement in more than one direction.\n\nIt seems to me that the Howards have all that they can attend to at the Goodfish Lake School without taking in the children from around Whitefish Lake.\n\nMr. Markle, in his report on the Saddle Lake School, which he visited last month, says that if a day school is to be maintained on this reserve he thinks that a new building is required. He recommends that before providing a new building the Indians should sign an agreement promising to send their children between the ages of seven and twelve to this school. He gives the number of children that should attend there as 23, the number at present enrolled being 13, with an average attendance of only 6. The school at present conducted on their reserve is in charge of Mrs. Seller, the wife of the missionary. Mr. Markle thinks she would make a successful teacher if conditions were in her favour. He says that it is a question, however, whether a married woman with a family and house of her own to care for is in a position to devote her whole time to the work. This school was re-opened as an experiment and has\nhas not been in operation long enough to show whether the Indians really want a school or not. School is held in the parlour of the parsonage, which is too small and not otherwise suited. I am sending you Mr. Markle's report herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, June 19, 1915.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say that Mrs. Howard, teacher of the Goodfish Lake Indian School, has expressed a wish to have a new building erected with the idea of accommodating the children from Whitefish Lake and arrangements made for conveying the children to school.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle, who visited the Goodfish Lake School last month, has sent in a report accompanied by a sketch showing the locations of the homes of the Indian children around Whitefish Lake and Goodfish Lake and giving the numbers of children of school age on the locations as shown. According to Mr. Markle there would be approximately 40 children who could attend from the vicinity of Whitefish Lake and Goodfish Lake, but it would entail a drive of at least ten miles to bring in some of the children from the north end of Whitefish. There are only 12 children altogether around Whitefish Lake and the Department does not consider that it would be justified in undertaking their transport, as the distance is too great and the expense would be more than the results would justify. If these children could be recruited for the Red Deer School there would be no necessity for engaging transportation for the Goodfish Lake children, as all live within reasonable walking distance of the school.\n\nA new building is under construction at Goodfish Lake.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nLake and when finished will furnish all the accommodation necessary for the children there. If a building of the kind Mrs. Howard suggests were put up it would have to be in the nature of the a semi-boarding school, as at certain seasons of the year it would be impossible to take the children back and forth from Whitefish Lake. There is enough work to be done by Mr. and Mrs. Howard at Goodfish without taking in children from Whitefish.\n\nIn regard to the Saddle Lake School, Mr. Markle recommends that, before providing a new building, the Indians should sign an agreement to send their children between the ages of seven and twelve to this school. He gives the number that should attend as 25; the present enrolment is 13, with an average of only 6. Mrs. Seller, the teacher, is doing her best to make a success of this school and if conditions were more favourable Mr. Markle is of the opinion that she would obtain better results. He says that it is a question whether a married woman with a family and a house of her own to care for is in a position to devote her whole time to the work. The Department will take up the question of providing a building for the Saddle Lake School, if the Indians will consent to the agreement as suggested by Mr. Markle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The biscuits on hand will only last about a week & we will need rice in a few weeks. I have no requisition forms on hand, please send some. Received all I asked for on last requisition except slates & these are needed badly. I was obliged to buy spoons from Sam Bull & am enclosing the statement of same.\n\nWill you please write the Dept that Nathaniel Shirt has offered to take the contract of conveying the children to school for $2.25 per day by the year. I think this is a very reasonable offer & hope you will recommend it. The Whitefish Indians are dissatisfied because their children cannot attend school. Nathaniel is a good reliable man; therefore he mentions by the year is when he had the work before it only lasted three months & he means he would like to work steady.\n\nThe Indians are working at the new school buildings, the main one is up & they will soon have the other one ready. They feel that they should be allowed to earn whatever money is spent on finishing seeing they have done the first part of the work. There are some good carpenters here who graduated from Red Deer & I think they are capable to do the work.\n\nIf the Dept wishes Mr Howard could oversee the work during vacation & help.\nthe men's time. They think the work could all be done for \u00a3300. They say that if the Dept will allow a reasonable sum for finishing that they will stay within the allowance. Mr. Howard can figure up the lumber bill if you wish. Will you kindly write the Dept about these matters soon. We are anxious to have the school completed for fall opening.

I think the decision the Department has arrived at regarding the type of school at Goodfish Lake is all that can be expected. I will send this letter on to Rev. Mr. Woodsworth with the request that he take up the question of recruiting these 12 children at Whitefish, or as many as possible, for the Red Deer Institute. I think it would as well if the Department would instruct Mr. Markle to assist in this work of recruiting.\n\nI also note what you say regarding the Saddle Lake School. I do not think that Mrs. Seller should be engaged permanently as teacher, but they have opened this school as an experiment and she is doing the best she can do under the circumstances. If the people will sign an agreement to send their children, and the Department puts up a proper building, then the question of sending in a teacher can be considered on its merits.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.H.\n\nJUL 10 1915\nOttawa, July 14, 1915\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to finishing the Goodfish Lake School enclosing list of materials required therein and in reply, to inform you that you may purchase and deliver at the school the material necessary for its completion.

H. Howard for 306 pounds of beef supplied during the month of December for the mid-day meal to the pupils of the Goodfish Lake Day School, I beg to state that this account cannot be paid as the expenditure is considered excessive and was incurred without authority. The letter of the 10th June 1915, No. 462,920-1 that you quote, does not authorize beef for the day schools but for the destitute Indians.\n\nWhen the Department authorized a mid-day meal for the pupils it was not intended that it would be an elaborate dinner. A small quantity of beef will be allowed for soup etc., but it cannot be authorized in such quantities as you purchased in December for a school having such a small attendance as Goodfish Lake. The voucher is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Hughes Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nGood Fish Lake Day School.\n\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nRed Deer, May 18, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a report on the Good Fish Lake day school.\n\nI observed that this school was not in operation for about 4 months last year - between June 25th and October 25th. The reason given is that the new building was not completed until about the end of October. The old building in which school has been held for years was available. I refer to this because I fail to be satisfied that Indian children can make progress at studies in a foreign language unless they are kept pretty steady at the work before them. They forget too quickly and after such a long term of idleness makes it about necessary to start where they first begun.\n\nThe new school building is now open for use the entire 12 months of the year and the reason advanced last year will not suffice for this season.\n\nA mid day meal is served to the pupils so the parents have few valid reasons for keeping their children at home when they should be daily under tuition.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Goodfish lake School for the month of June, 1916. Original on 116959-7.\n\nVisited this school June 21st. Found everything going along fair. School fairly clean. The children do not seem to make much progress, the school going for three years and only six in Second standard.\n\nSgd. C. E. Hughes,\nAgent,\nOttawa, July 13th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your June report on the Goodfish Lake day school you report that there does not seem to be much progress at this school.\n\nJudging from your statement that only six are in the second standard, after being in school two years, the Department agrees with you.\n\nKindly point out to the teacher that the Department expects her to put forth renewed efforts in her work, and it is hoped that, if she does this, there will be a more marked improvement, in this school, in the immediate future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nWhitelish Lake Alta\nSep 27/16\n\nMr Hughes:\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been thinking over what you were speaking of & have decided that if the Dept will provide a range for the school, I will handle the work with the aid of the older girls. This cannot be done unless I can have the cooking done in the school.\n\nI believe it would be a good training for the girls, several of them are very anxious to learn to cook. I still have my large range that you valued at $25. I find it too large for our small home & will let the Dept have it at the price they offered before if they care to take it. It would come cheaper than buying a new one & is in very good condition.\n\nI have looked into the matter of grading & find I have not graded the pupils as I really should by the Programme of Studies on register. This defect is how the Dept wishes to have them graded.\n\nI will take this matter up on my next returns.\n\nWill you kindly have the matter of cooking attended to as soon as possible; as I cannot handle the work without help until the cooking can be done in the school.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs H H Howard\nWhitefish Lake Alta\nSept 27th\n\nTo Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr Hughes spoke to me about the Dept not being satisfied with the progress made by my pupils nor the time they have been attending school.\n\nI find I have not been grading them by the P.O.S prescribed by the Dept, but more by the grading for white schools.\n\nI find the pupils are much in advance so the way I have graded them according to the P.O.S on register. I will in future grade them according to the P.O.S prescribed on the register. If the children are doing quite well when we consider that the only English they hear or use is in school.\n\nI have been making a special effort lately to persuade the parents who understand English to use it more in their homes.\n\nI am also studying the tree so I will be able to explain lessons more fully in the classroom.\n\nI have tried hard to make this school a success. Use the atlas primer to commence with, then the atlas first reader. Will you kindly explain how the Dept wishes to have the reading graded. Should a child go through the entire primer before being counted in second grade or then through the entire first before being counted in third grade? The P.O.S. calls for the 1st part of 1st reader for 1st grade & the 2nd part of 1st reader for second grade.\n\nI have several girls who are anxious to learn.\nto cook & I agree with the Dept that it would be a good training for them. I am willing to handle the work alone if the Dept will provide a range to cook the dinner on.\n\nAs long as the dinner has to be cooked in my home the work cannot be handled alone.\n\nThe range I have offered cost me $60.00 landed here $55.00; this was freight.\n\nIt is a large range too large for my use now & is in good condition. I am willing to accept the offer made by the Dept before for the range, as I would much rather have a smaller one.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter I am mailing to the Agent today.\n\nI hope this matter can be settled soon. Thanking you in advance for your reply to the grading of the reading.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs H H Howard.\nOttawa, October 5, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in regard to the progress of the pupils of the Goodfish Lake School and enclosing a copy of a letter you have sent to Mr. Agent Hughes in regard to the purchase of your range by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you have previously been informed, all communications of this kind should be forwarded to the Department through Mr. Agent Hughes.\n\nBefore dealing with the question of purchasing the range the Department will wait the receipt of a communication from the Agent in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. H. Howard,\nTeacher,\nGoodfish Lake Indian School,\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.\nWhapish Lake\nAlberta\nJan. 27th, 1917\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBeing, more or less, known to the Dept. of Indian Affairs' officials, as one who is interested in the welfare of our Indian people, I make bold to write you regarding a matter closely connected with, and affecting the development of, the Indians in this Reserve. I refer to the Day-School here.\n\nMrs. Howard came to this Reserve in\nThe year 1913, I take up the work of the Day school; she was then Mrs. Butler.\n\nAfter three years of her administration at the Day school, and judging by the results of her work, alone, I feel constrained to say that her being there \u2014 or anywhere else, for that matter \u2014 as teacher of the school, is a farce. By giving a hot noon-day meal, by giving them clothing etc., she secures a very good attendance; but not any better, really, than has been attained without these things; for the three months immediately preceding her arrival, the average daily attendance was 17.8%.\n\nHowever, these things are good in themselves, and, as a means to an end, are excellent, but when they become the sum and substance of the whole matter, the school becomes a farce. Such is the condition prevailing at this school.\nMrs. Howard is a motherly woman and a very nice person. Personally, I have nothing whatever against her. But I feel that all parties concerned in the efficiency of the school are being imposed upon, because she is not competent to teach school subjects. The children are fed, lodged (partly), and amused. If genuine teaching, there is none.\n\nYou wonder why I write to you, what it is the church which is responsible for her being there. I write to you as a last resort, to see if you dept. cannot have her removed. I approached the church on this subject a year ago, but was informed that Mrs. Howard should have the school as long as she wanted it. I can do nothing in that direction. Mrs. Howard's brother has risen in the ranks of the Methodist Ministry, and holds a responsible position in this Province. I would point out to you, however, that\nThis does not qualify her to teach school. I beg of you, if she cannot be got rid of in any other way, to close the school. It can easily be opened again when a suitable teacher is obtained.\n\nPlease do not let it be known to my Church that I have written you in this strain: a man in my position has enough to contend with without having all his 'betters' down on him.\n\nIf you care at all for the welfare and progress of our Indians, act immediately.\n\nI have no doubt but that Charles Hughes, the Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, and Mr. Muckle, Inspector of Indian Schools, will substantiate my statements, should you apply to them.\n\nI have the honour to be, Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMethodist Missionary, Saddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, February 12, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the work being done by Mrs. Howard as teacher of the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that inquiries are being made in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. L. Dineen,\nWhitefish Lake,\nAlta.\nOttawa, February 12, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is advised that Mrs. Howard has not made a success as teacher of the Goodfish Lake Day School. It is stated that she secures a very good attendance by giving the children a hot mid-day meal and also clothing, but that she is not competent to teach school subjects.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you as soon as possible in regard to this school and the work being done by Mrs. Howard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, February 12, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department is advised that Mrs. Howard has not made a success as teacher of the Goodfish Lake Day School. It is stated that she secures a very good attendance by giving the children a hot mid-day meal and also clothing, but that she is not competent to teach school subjects.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you as soon as possible in regard to this school and the work being done by Mrs. Howard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant and in reply beg to say that I shall visit this school at the earliest opportunity.\n\nMy view however is that this school is largely kept together by the free mid-day meal and that the pupils are making very little progress. Mrs. Howard lost the confidence, to an extent at least, of the Indians when she married Mr. Howard. I have heard that one of her girls very frequently has charge of the classes, in fact think I heard that she asked the Department to have her daughter employed as assistant.\n\nIn one of my reports I suggested that Mrs. Howard should keep a record showing the time the children arrived at the school each morning and also the hour of departure. I suspected that some of the pupils barely arrived in time for the mid-day lunch. No action was taken, as far as I learned, on the suggestion referred to.\n\nIn my opinion there is little to show for the expenditure incurred quarterly at this school.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nInsp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 7, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI wish to call your attention to the very unsatisfactory work being done by Mrs. Howard, teacher of the Goodfish Lake Day School. She took charge of this school in September, 1913, with an enrolment of 23 pupils. The last quarterly return shows that she has an enrolment of 24, with 18 pupils in the first standard, 9 of whom were on the roll when she took charge.\n\nThe Department made inquiries as to Mrs. Howard's lack of success as a teacher and has been informed that the school is largely kept together by the free mid-day meal and the issue of clothing and that the pupils are making very little progress. Mrs. Howard has no qualifications as a teacher and there is little to show for the expenditure incurred at this school.\n\nThis being the case, I have to request that you will take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays, as the Department does not feel that it would be justified in continuing it under the present teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, March 7, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in regard to the Goodfish Lake Day School and stating that your view is that this school is largely kept together by the free mid-day meal and that the pupils are making very little progress and that there is little to show for the expenditure incurred.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, is being requested to take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays, as the Department does not feel that it would be justified in continuing it under the present teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nUnder present conditions, I do not think that any teacher \"even if fully qualified and competent to teach all school subjects\" could make a success of teaching in the Day schools at this agency.\n\nMy candid opinion is, that the operation of the Day schools here is a farce. Since the opening of the Day schools, it has been a very hard matter to secure pupils for the Industrial schools as the attendance of the children at the Day schools furnishes the parents with a good excuse in refusing to send their children to an Industrial school.\n\nIn regard to securing a good attendance by giving the children a hot mid-day meal and clothing, I might say that I believe it to be quite true.\n\nIt appears to me that in some cases, the children attend school fairly regular, not so much for the purpose of learning as from a desire to eat, and I would therefore respectfully recommend that the furnishing of the mid-day meals be discontinued.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nAs requested in your letter of the 12th ultimo No. 116959/1, I have the honour to submit herewith, a report regarding school matters in connection with the Goodfish Lake Day School.\n\nI have just returned from a trip to Whitefish Lake reserve and while there I made a special examination of this school and I regret very much to have to report that very slow progress is being made by the pupils.\n\nIn regard to Mrs. Howard's qualifications as a teacher, I might say that she has no certificate and while she may not be competent to teach school subjects, I am under the impression that even if she were, the results would be much the same.\n\nThe attendance at the Day schools is very irregular owing to the fact that whenever the Indians go hunting or visiting, they usually take the whole family along and they sometimes keep their children away from school for a considerable length of time.\n\nAs the children spend the greater part of their time at home, they hear very little English spoken outside of the school room, and as the Indians do not appear to have any great desire to have their children learn the English language, it is obvious that their home life is a detriment to their learning.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, April 2, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 7th ultimo, in which you were requested to take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of the Goodfish Lake Day School after the summer holidays, as the Department does not feel that it would be justified in continuing it under the present teacher.\n\nKindly state whether you have advised Mrs. Howard, the present teacher, that her services will not be required after the 30th of June, next, or whether you would like the Department to notify her direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, April 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department wrote the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools, asking him to take steps to secure the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of the Goodfish Lake Day School after the summer holidays, as, in view of the reports received, it did not feel that it would be justified in continuing the school under the present teacher, Mrs. Howard.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a reply from Mr. Ferrier, in which he states that he will advise Mrs. Howard that her services will not be required after the 30th of June, next, and that he will try and secure an acceptable teacher for the coming year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She has also had training as a nurse and is a graduate of the Deaconess Home, Toronto. She has had experience in our Indian work for some years.

Cantlon,\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.\n\nDear Mrs. Cantlon:\n\nWhen I was in Edmonton the work that you were doing for the people on the reservation was mentioned to me in a very favorable way. I presented the matter to the authorities of the Indian Department when in Ottawa this week, and asked that it receive financial recognition to the extent of $300 per year. This was agreed to by the Department, so that your work will be as a field matron and nurse. You had better make out the reports and send them to the government Indian Agent.\n\nThe vote of the General Board of Missions for Whitefish Lake as a missionary and teacher is $1,000; horse keep $75; $80 for moving expenses. I merely mention this for information.\n\nI trust that I have not gone contrary to your wishes in placing your case before the government, and securing you the above remuneration, but knowing your work in the past I am sure it is nothing more than what is just and right.\n\nWishing you and Mr. Cantlon every success in your work,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTP/H.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter of the 1st No. 116959/1 you state:\n\n\"The question of appointing Mrs. Cantlon as nurse and field matron will be taken up with you when you are in Ottawa.\"\n\nIn harmony with this I discussed the matter with Mr. Benson and Mr. Sutherland when in Ottawa on the 9th. It was agreed that Mrs. Cantlon should have a salary of $300.00. She is a deaconess nurse and has taught among our Indian people in the past. She is well qualified in every way for the work. After returning to Toronto I wrote Mrs. Cantlon and am enclosing you a copy of the letter. Under the circumstances I would like a re-consideration of yours as October 16th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nOttawa, October 29, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in further reference to the proposed appointment of Mrs. Canton as nurse and field matron on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, when you were in Ottawa on the 9th instant, a memorandum was made at your request, which reads as follows: \"Rev. Mr. Ferrier recommends the appointment of Mrs. Canton as field matron and nurse at Goodfish Lake at a salary of $300.00 per annum\".

ALTA.\n\nSo many pupils have gone to the Residential School at Edmonton that it might be suggested that they all be sent there another year. Great interest is taken in the residential school by both parents and pupils in the last few months particularly.\n\nThe progress of children whose parents have attended a residential school is very marked. I understand most of the children are planning on attending at Edmonton in September.\n\nElizabeth B. Ryckman,\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 27, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Miss E. B. Ryckman, the teacher, recommends that the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School be closed and the pupils all sent to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. She states that several of her pupils have already gone to Edmonton, that the parents on the reserve are quite interested in the residential school and that she believes it would be advisable to recruit all physically fit children on the reserve. The teacher adds that many of the children are planning on going to Edmonton in September, next.\n\nI should be pleased if you would comment on the advisability of closing the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School and if you would also inform the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School that he would be well advised to make extraordinary recruiting efforts at Goodfish Lake during the next few months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferriday,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI beg to enquire whether it is the intention of the Department to re-open the Goodfish Lake Indian day school.\n\nIt is my opinion that the children who have been attending this day school could be recruited for the residential schools. The result would be favourable, both financially and educationally, in that the attendance at day schools is seldom very regular on account of the irregular habits of the parents. From observation of the register of this school, it is no exception.\n\nMy reason for enquiring is in the fact that there is a considerable amount of equipment at the school which should be brought to the Agency for safe-keeping if the school is not to be re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn March, last, I asked for a recommendation concerning the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School. At that time the teacher recommended that it be closed and the pupils recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Ostrander is of the opinion that it would be unwise to re-open the Goodfish Lake Day School.

Mr. Ostrander's letter recommending the closing of this school reads as follows:\n\n\"It is my opinion that the children who have been attending this day school could be recruited for the residential schools. The result would be favourable, both financially and educationally, in that the attendance at day schools is seldom very regular on account of the irregular habits of the parents.\"\n\nThere were at that time four day schools in operation in the Edmonton, Hobbsma and Saddle Lake Agencies,-\n\n(a) Paul's, (b) Samson's, (c) Goodfish Lake,\n(d) Saddle Lake.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would draw the above to the attention of Mr. Laurie. We are quite prepared, however, to have you investigate further the possibility of re-opening this school on a temporary basis.\n\nBernard F.

Would a \"half-day\" system be justified, some attending mornings? No lunch served! Some attending afternoons?\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files, File 7084-1, part 1\nColonel Neary:\n\nProposed school at GOODFISH LAKE\nSaddle Lake Agency:\n\nWith Mr. Supt. Taylor I looked over possible sites on the reserve on the 10th inst. We had discussions with Councillor Thomas Jackson (father of ten) and a senior Indian, Peter Shirt, who is the local medicine dispenser.\n\nMr. Taylor is going to ask the heads of families on July 2nd to vote on two sites.\n\nThe top photo shows the more likely site. Mr. Taylor is shown at one corner of the United Church, looking across the road to a field used by an Indian, Charlie Hunter, who lives close by. The road curves around the fence beside the lake which is no more than thirty yards away. A shallow well seems possible.\n\nCharlie Hunter, two of whose children are at school in Edmonton, professed his willingness to let the land be used for school purposes.\n\nThis site would serve more families more conveniently than the site shown in the lower pictures.\n\nThe site shown in this photo is about three-quarters of a mile north-west of the one above. It is on much higher ground, distant from the lake, and a deep well would likely be necessary. Its chief supporter is Mr. Peter Shirt who has no young children. The buildings shown are a granary and an implement shed. The projected farm instructor's house may be erected near here.\n\nIn the bottom photo the camera is pointed back toward the first site which is nearly a third of a mile to the left of the Catholic Church which appears in the background.\n\nI did not see any gravel deposits nearby, but gravel is said to be available at reasonable cost.\n\nThere are several competent contractors and builders in St. Paul and neighbouring towns. Unskilled Indian labourers could be obtained.\n\nThere is a minister's house not far from the United Church, but the missionary lives in Saddle Lake. The teacher will definitely be isolated. There is a post-office (Goodfish Lake) off the reserve about two miles west, but communications are not good.\n\nAppended is a statement of children of the band showing ninety-\nAIRMAIL\n\nJune 18, 1946.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School\n\nWe have now received Major Clark's report concerning educational facilities required on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve. We understand from his report that a vote will be held on July 2 to determine the site for the school.\n\nHere again, we would make similar recommendations with regard to the construction of this school as for Alexander. It is noted from our official's report that there are several competent contractors and builders in St. Paul and other neighbouring towns. It is possible that Mr. Superintendent Taylor might interest one of them in the construction of this school. The normal rate which we pay for foremen-carpenters is $1.50 per hour. The blue-prints and specifications are very clear and we have had success with this mode of construction elsewhere. The Department would buy all materials and labour would be that provided locally or by using Indians. The other alternative again is that of interesting contractors in submitting a labour tender for the building. The Department would be responsible for the provision of all material. I might add for your information that similar labour tenders for this standard school have been obtained in Saskatchewan and Manitoba in amounts varying from $4,200.00 to $4,990.00, depending upon location.\n\nI would suggest that you send two copies of the blue-prints and specifications for the standard school to Mr. Taylor so that he can discuss the matter with local builders.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 21, 1948.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are fifty-one (51) Indian children of school age on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve, in the Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Province of Alberta, for whom educational facilities are required;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 218, 1948-49, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve, in the Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Province of Alberta, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, to be known as the \"Goodfish Lake Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOTTAWA, June 21, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nEstablishment of Goodfish Lake Indian Day School,\nin the Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Province of Alberta. Two extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nOttawa, June 21, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Goodfish Lake Indian Day School,\nAlexander Indian Day School.\n\nThe attached Memoranda to Council are for schools which we intend to construct this summer.\n\nEducational surveys have just been completed by our officials and we are now negotiating for the erection of the buildings. Both these schools are included in our Main Estimates for 1948-49.\n\nDirector.\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\n\nTUESDAY, the 29th day of JUNE, 1948.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there are fifty-one (51) Indian children on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve, in the Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Province of Alberta, for whom educational facilities are required; and\n\nThat funds are available in Vote 218, 1948-49, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school for these children.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, 1927, is pleased to establish and doth hereby establish a day school on the Goodfish Lake Indian Reserve, in the Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Province of Ontario, to be known as the \"Goodfish Lake Indian Day School\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nJuly 15, 1949.\n\nMr. G. H. Goodwin,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n207 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGodfish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nAn agreement has been reached with Indian Health Services, whereby we will have a small extension built on the proposed school at Godfish Lake to provide for a nurse's residence and dispensary.\n\nPlease find attached the photostatic drawing made of this extension.\n\nThis extension is designed to fit on to plan 386 and I believe should provide satisfactory accommodation for the nurse and for a dispensary.\n\nWhen we advertise for tenders we will request contractors to submit two separate bids:\n\n(a) on the school building itself,\n\n(b) on the extension for the nurse's residence and dispensary.\n\nWe can then advise Indian Health Services as to the exact contribution they will be required to make for the erection of this combined school and dispensary. I hope that you will agree with this plan and have today sent Mr. Taylor the following documents:\n\n(a) Drawings and Specifications of Plan 386,\n\n(b) Drawings of Extension.\nWe wrote to you on June 16, with a copy to Mr. Taylor, and presume that arrangements are being made to locate a good source of water. Mr. Taylor is authorized to pinpoint the location of the building on the site selected by Mr. Clark and himself on June 9. As I would like to advertise for tenders for the erection of this school within the next few days, would Mr. Taylor also arrange to have a well dug at once to ensure an adequate source of water. He is authorized to spend an amount up to $300.00 for the digging of this well. An accountable advance is being sent to him to cover this expenditure.\n\nBernard F.

30, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Education:\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School:\n\nWith Mr. Field Agent Battle and Mr. Asst. Taylor I consulted the Bishop of St. Paul last night. The Reverend Principal of Blue Quills participated in the discussion.\n\nThe school is so situated that children of two religious denominations will find it convenient to attend. Some of these children are already at Blue Quills and Edmonton Residential schools. In some cases their parents may want them to attend the day school which will probably be ready to receive them after the Christmas vacation.\n\nAll aspects of the situation were surveyed and discussed, and agreement was reached on the following points:\n\nAs the majority of the band adhere to the United Church of Canada, the teacher must be (i) acceptable to that denomination, and not of a sect likely to be offensive to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOnly children in the first four grades are to attend this term. Grades above Grade Four will \"carry on\" at residential schools until further notice.\n\nChildren requiring residential facilities (in the judgment of the Department) will continue to be directed to residential schools regardless of school grade.\n\nRoman Catholic parents living within the radius of the school may elect to which type of school their children shall go (if in the first four grades.) The Church authorities will not impose sanctions on those who patronize the day school.\n\nThe school will be conducted in the manner usual for provincial public schools, i.e., with time allowed for religious instruction by interested religious denominations.\n\nThe United Church missionary and the Chief (Ruben Bull) have been assured that the school will be conducted as above and in accordance with the Indian Act.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor, Calgary.\nSuperintendent, St. Paul.\n\nC.W. Clark\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Teachers Goodfish Lake Day School,\nStony Plain Day School.\n\nProgress made by the contractor erecting Goodfish Lake School indicates that the building may be ready to open in January. Major Clark's report of November 30th indicates the denomination of the teacher to be employed at this school. We should advertise immediately in the Calgary Herald, Calgary Albertan, Edmonton Journal, Edmonton Bulletin and the St. Paul Weekly Journal.\n\nWe are informed by Superintendent Robertson that Mr. N. Leskiw teacher at the Stony Plain Day School, senior room, will be leaving on January 1st to take another position at the Coast; it will, therefore, be necessary to advertise for a Catholic teacher to replace him. It might be worth while to mention in the advertisement that the school is thirteen miles from Edmonton and that a house will be provided that should prove attractive to a married man. The advertisement should appear in the Calgary and Edmonton papers only.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI have had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. A. C. Hughes, Welfare Teacher, who is at present supplying at the Morley Residential School until the United Church has secured the services of a teacher or until she is required as teacher in the Sioux Lookout Indian Hospital. I casually said to her that it was my hope that we would have more of her calibre as teachers in this province and on the strength of that she has written to say that she would like to remain in Alberta if there was a vacancy in a departmental day school. She states that even if she is required to go East, that she firmly intends to return to the West.\n\nI understand that Mrs. Hughes is a Presbyterian and it is my belief that she should therefore be acceptable for the new Goodfish School, Saddle Lake Indian Agency, which should be opened in January. I do not know whether she would be interested in taking this school.\n\nWould you kindly advise whether you would be prepared to accept an application from her, and if so, at what grade and salary. I will not answer her letter until I have heard from you.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n8 December, 1949.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 205/6-10 of December 6\n\nI agree that Mrs. Hughes would be a good teacher at the Goodfish Lake School.\n\nHowever, I am somewhat confused as to the religious denomination which is in the majority on this reserve. Our records show that there was formerly a Methodist school on this reserve. However, I understand from Major Clark's report of November 30 that 26 children are R.C. and 16 are U.C. Yet, in his report attached to these statistics, he states that the majority of the band adhere to the United Church of Canada. I presume from this that the R.C. parents have more children than the others.\n\nI understand that Mr. Battle was present at the meeting with the Bishop of St. Paul and that they will permit their children to attend this school if the teacher is not of a sect likely to be offensive to them.\n\nFrom your letter I would assume that Mrs. Hughes would fit this category and that she should be acceptable to everyone at Goodfish Lake. I also assume that this would be a welfare position and that Mrs. Hughes would consider transferring to this school. I agree that you should discuss this transfer with her and I am quite certain that approval can be obtained for her appointment to this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to MR. TAYLOR\nMEMORANDUM\n\nGOODFISH LAKE DAY SCHOOL\n\nPlease review the 708-5 and the 708-4 to ensure that all supplies necessary have been provided for this school.\n\nI believe that a Flag, Register, Report Cards, etc., will be needed. You might also order the plastic cups and drinking fountain.\n\nYou will find a list of the children who will likely attend this school, hereunder, and I would suggest that you order the school supplies now.\n\nB. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Goodfish Lake Indian Day School\n\nOn receipt of yours of the 8th, file 708-1 (E), I had Superintendent Pugh interview Mrs. Hughes to ascertain if she would be prepared to take the Goodfish Lake School. She has answered in the affirmative.\n\nAdherents to the United Church of Canada are in the majority on this reserve although it is anticipated that there will be a majority of R.C. children in attendance at this particular day school. Bishop Beadeux of St. Paul is aware of this fact. As you have all particulars of Mrs. Hughes background and know her very well, I suggest that you write to Bishop Beadeux and state that she is an applicant for the position.\n\nIf you then approve the appointment of Mrs. Hughes to the position, would you kindly state if she will be given the same salary as she is now receiving. A Welfare Teacher is needed at Goodfish as there are no resident Indian Affairs employees.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nDecember 20, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School\n\nReference your 118/2-32 of Dec. 13\n\nThe Department is prepared to approve the transfer of Mrs. Hughes to the Goodfish Lake school but suggest she not be advised definitely until we have written to Bishop Baudaux. I have written to him today and will let you know immediately I get a reply.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMoN\nDecember 20, 1949.\n\nMost Rev. Maurice Baudaux, D.D.,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\n\nGoodfish Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Baudaux:\n\nI have received a report concerning the situation which exists with regard to the appointment of a teacher at this school. I believe that I can interest a teacher in a transfer and that she would be quite acceptable to all. This teacher is Mrs. A.C. Hughes, aged 56 years with a First Class Quebec Teaching Certificate. She was Principal of the Joliette Secondary School and taught History and Latin at the Verdun High School. She is a Protestant and has been teaching for us in the Miller Bay Hospital School at Prince Rupert, B.C. At that time we were unable to get a Catholic teacher and she was sent in and has done a good job.\n\nShe is a very energetic woman and will work hard with the children.

I wrote to the teacher, Mrs. Florence Watters, in regard to the matter, and have received a reply from her to the effect that she sent forward the returns early in October through the Agent. She states that the school is never opened at that place early in September on account of the absence of the people and their having; that she has not taken any legal holidays since school opened and fully expects therefore to be able to make up the regular number of days for the year, which will entitle her to the full salary allowance.\n\nI shall esteem it a favour if you will be good enough to look into the matter and let me know the reason we have not received the usual cheque for that quarter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1914.\n\nRev.

Mr. Agent Hughes of the Saddle Lake Agency will be instructed to have Mrs. Watters prepare a duplicate return and upon its receipt the Department will at once send you a cheque for the amount of salary due.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You know that one woman was carried out dying of consumption and another died there last year of consumption. The windows are all gone. The place is nothing to piece. Sam Bull used it to store his grain last winter (with my permission). The place should be pulled down and used for firewood.\n\nMr. Walter, the new teacher, and two little girls arrived on Saturday with the intention of going into that house. I would not allow an animal of mine to stay there.\n\nMatthew Horle has a new log house partly built about 200 yards from the school. He will sell him for $95. It will cost about $150 to finish it up. It could easily be hauled up to the school lot.\n\nWill you please telegraph the Dept.\nand ask them if they will put $300 into a new house for the teacher. It will cost that by the time it is moved and finished.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nL. Denier.\n\nHope Mrs. Hughes arrived home safe and sound. We enjoyed her visit very much.\nheartly built that he would move up here & ready for occupation for $500.00. We could have it ready for use in two weeks time. It is a log building 18' x 29' & he should finish it off with shingle roof, two floors, doors & windows plaster & whitewash for above figure. Would you not telegraph the Dept. the state of affairs here & ask for permission for this plan to be rushed through. The house here is unsanitary & unsafe to live in. Mr. Queen is writing you & believe I giving\n\nthe view of the matter I intend to open school on Wednesday or will camp at Zooskish until we hear from the Dept.\n\nI will need biscuits for the school. I believe the Dept. intends to provide a hot midday meal for the children & so they will notify you as to what they wish sent for it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs Florence Walters\nWhitefish Lake\nAlta Sep 15/13\n\nMr Hughes\nDear Sir\n\nI arrived here on Saturday after an 8 days drive & found the Goodfish house in a dreadful condition. There is not a pane of glass in the house & hardly a window frame. We are practically outdoors. The house is not fit to live in. Mr Dineen kindly offered us a home with them until other arrangements were made but his home is too far from the school for convenience.\n\nMatthew Houle has a house.\npartly built that he would move up here & be ready for occupation for $300.00. He could have it ready for use in two weeks time. It is a log building 18 by 19 & he could finish it off with shingle roof, two floors, doors & windows plaster & whitewash for above figure. Would you not telegraph the Dept. the state of affairs here & ask for permission for this plan to be rushed through. The house here is unsanitary & unsafe to live in. Mr. Queen is writing you I believe & giving his view of the matter. I intend to open school on Wednesday & will camp at Woodfish until we hear from the Dept.\n\nI will need biscuits for the school. I believe the Dept. intends to provide a hot midday meal for the children. If so they will notify you as to what they wish sent for it.\n\nYrs sincerely,\n\nMrs Florence Watters\nSADDLE LAKE, ALTA.\nSept. 16th, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, letters received from Mr. Dineen and Mrs. Watters regarding the Goodfish Lake day school, and the condition of the old dwelling house at that place.\n\nI was not aware of the fact that a new teacher was to take charge of this school, and I did not know that a change was to be made, until I learned of it by letters enclosed.\n\nThe condition of these buildings is, as described by Mr. Dineen and Mrs. Watters.\n\nI am forwarding these letters for your consideration and advice as to what steps will be taken by the Dept., regarding this.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nChas.

I had no idea she had a family and thought she would be able to stay with us. The school teacher's house at Goodfish Lake is unfit for anyone to live in. I would not use it for a stable.\n\nOne of the Indians started to build a new log house last year but never finished it. He would sell it for $95.00. It would cost about $200 more to move it and finish it. It would be a good thing to buy this and move it up for the school teacher to live in.......\n\nMrs. Aldritt died of consumption in the old house. Mrs. Perrion was carried out dying of consumption. The windows are all gone and the place is rotting to pieces. It should be burned. Mrs. Watters is going to try to live in one room until she hears what is going to be done. I want her to stay here but she feels that it is too far from the school. It is too far for her to walk and her nerves will not allow her to drive, so there is nothing else to be done.\n\nPlease let me hear from you soon. Kind regards to you all.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) L. Dineen\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.,\nSept. 15th., 1913.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nWe arrived at Goodfish Lake after an eight days' drive and found the house in a dreadful condition. We are practically outdoors. There is not a single window pane in the house and scarcely a frame. The house is unsanitary and unsafe to live in. I have moved into an out kitchen after disinfecting it, but cannot unpack until some arrangements are made for a home. I have written Mrs. Hughes asking him to telegraph the Department the state of affairs here and ask permission for the following plan to be carried out:\n\nMatthew Houle, an Indian near by, has a log house partly built, 18 by 19, and he would move in on to the land here and fit it up comfortable and complete for $200, with shingle roof, two floors, windows, door, etc., plaster and whitewash. This seems reasonable, as material has to be teamed from Vegreville, a distance of 50 miles. He could have the house ready in about two weeks and this seems the only plan that could be carried out without delay.\n\nThere is every prospect of a good attendance and I feel sure if we can be settled comfortably that the work will prosper. I intend to open school on the 17th. as soon as I can have it cleaned and ready. I hope the matter will be attended to without delay for you cannot imagine the condition of things here and the weather is already becoming chilly.\n\nI will let you know how we progress. I feel sure all will be well.\n\nKind regards to all,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) (Mrs. F.

Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nWhitefish Lake Alberta\n\nNov 3 '13\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear sir,\n\nI wish to explain how the amount granted in the Dept. The $300.00 sent in of the house finished by the Indians only meant a house with single floors, no ceiling partitions, inside finish, cellar or closet. It was simply a log house mudded & whitemudded with 2 single floors, shingle roof & windows & one door. This would have answered for a time in the case of emergency but would have needed finishing off later on. The house as it stood with sheathing on the roof & one floor & windows cut out cost $93.50 & was purchased for that amount; the moving cost $30.00 which was very reasonable. I do not know the exact cost of the material for finishing inside & out but the house, moving, material & freight must already exceed the grant. The house intended to be cottoned, burlapped & papered this will make a durable finish. The building when completed will be very comfortable. The school is proving very successful & I do not feel that the Dept. will mind the extra outlay toward finishing the house. The labor is being done very reasonable. We spent in the first estimate of the building $600 an explanation to the Dept. but I feel sure you will see the building is being completed as reasonably possible considering how far everything has been freighted &c.\n\nYours sincerely,\nFlorence Watters\nOttawa, November 14, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 11th ultimo in which you are authorized to have the present teacher's residence on the Goodfish Lake reserve made comfortable for the winter, I beg to say that Mrs. Waters, the teacher, has written the Department stating that it will require further outlay to make it habitable for the winter.\n\nMrs. Waters has been requested to communicate with you direct with reference to the additional requirements, and you may expend the necessary amount to complete the work, if the $200.00 already authorized, is not sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Mrs. Waters stated that one was required and may have so informed the Department direct. If it is decided to get a well sunk I respectfully suggest that the well be carried up about 20' or 24' above the grade and the required water elevated with a rope and a bucket. If a pump is supplied it is likely to be out of repair about half the time and the agent called upon frequently to supply repairs and keep it in order\u2014almost an impossible task with so many operators of the pump.\n\nI was shown the plan of the proposed new school plan calling for a building 28' x 36' and a lean-to 20' x 40'. The Indians claim that logs sufficiently long cannot be obtained for such a building, not easily, anyway. Moreover, the saw carriage is limited to about 24'. The roof of the lean-to has very little fall.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.A.

Bed here is broken and side rail held by stick which has a fashion of letting go suddenly.\n\nNo springs here, just boards. Five chairs here and to be six of us when we can get accommodation ready.\n\nWould appreciate a high chair or two. Nothing but a centre table here. No clothes closet or shelves here.\n\nNo window blinds here. The sanitary couch to keep the children from lying on the floor days and evenings, and a sewing machine would both be a source of great help and comfort.\n\nYours resp.,\n(Signed) Mrs. S. H. Lantie\nOctober 14th, 1919\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, copy of a letter received from Mrs. S. H. Lantis, teacher at the Goodfish Lake Day School in which she asks for a considerable quantity of furniture for her use in the teacher's residence.\n\nI was under the impression that teachers were required to supply their own furniture. Under the circumstances I can make no recommendation and I am therefore forwarding the teacher's request to the Department for consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, October 27, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing a requisition from Mrs. G. H. Lantis, teacher of the Scotish Lake Indian Day School, for furniture for her use in the teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not supply furniture in cases where the building used as a teacher's residence is not the property of the Department. It is considered that, as this furniture is for the use of Mrs. Lantis and her family, she should provide what she requires.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. A. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nScotish Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on a recent visit to Goodfish Lake, I found that Miss E.B. Ryckman had been appointed to that school. She brought the matter of residence, board, etc., to my attention and I beg to state that the school residence which has been unoccupied for a number of years, is in a very poor state of repair, being a log building and plastered.\n\nThe plaster has fallen off and the building is unfit for use in its present condition. In order to make it habitable, considerable expenditure would be required, possibly about $200.00, besides furnishings, etc.\n\nIn view of this, Miss Ryckman has arranged with the Missionary, to live at their house providing that the Department will authorize the purchase of furniture for her room as the Missionary has not all his rooms furnished. The articles asked for are; one rug 9' X 12', one writing desk, one dresser, one small rocking chair, one lamp, one toilet set, one Simmons single bed complete with spring and mattress. These could be purchased at a cost of about $100.00.\n\nI am therefore submitting the matter to the Department for their approval or otherwise.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, September 28th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the condition of the teacher's residence at the Whitefish Lake Indian Day School, and the repairs required thereto.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as a considerable expenditure would be required in fitting up this building, it is considered the arrangement the teacher has made to live with the missionary would be more satisfactory. The Department will approve of the purchase of the furniture required to fit up a room for the teacher in the missionary's house, as follows: - 1 rug, 9x12, 1 writing desk, 1 dresser, 1 small rocking chair, 1 lamp, 1 toilet set and 1 Simmons' single bed complete with spring and mattress. While serviceable articles should be supplied, it is not intended that any unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and the total cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $100. You should obtain competitive prices as far as possible, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nIn regard to the recent request of Miss E.B. Ryckman, teacher at the Goodfish Lake Day School, in which certain furniture was asked for, I beg to advise that yesterday while on a visit to that school, Miss Ryckman made a request that she be allowed to use the room at the rear of the School for living in, as she found that the walk from the Missionary's home was too far, and this would be much worse when the very cold weather set in.\n\nShe requests that instead of the writing desk, that Oil cloth for the floor be supplied, this would cost about $30 dollars, a little paint for windows and trim, about 1 gallon, $2.75, and a small cook stove, cost about $30.00. There is a small cook stove at the Beaver Lake Farm house that could be brought down, if the Department approved of this request.\n\nI would estimate that the cost for putting this room in comfortable shape, at about $150 inclusive of furnishings etc.\n\nI should be glad to receive instructions from the Department before ordering that already authorized, so that adjustments could be made.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 25th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, informing the Department that Miss E. B. Ryckman, teacher of the Goodfish Lake Indian Day School, finds it inconvenient, owing to the distance, to reside in the missionary's house, and requests that she be allowed to use the room at the rear of the school for living quarters and that certain furniture be provided.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you consider this would be a better arrangement and would provide satisfactory accommodation, you may arrange to have this room fitted up for the teacher's use. Instead of the writing desk which you were authorized to purchase in official letter of September 28th, last, you may purchase oilcloth for the floor, to a cost of approximately $30. You may also purchase the paint required for the windows and trim, and a small cook stove, and, if required, any of the other articles you have already been authorized to purchase in the above mentioned letter. The total expenditure incurred in fitting up this room should not exceed approximately $150.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain competitive prices, if possible, and the supplies required should be purchased from the firm quoting you the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should give these purchases your early attention, and have the room fitted up and made as comfortable as possible at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We had the grounds all prepared for seed last fall. There is about an acre to seed.\n\nThe seed catalogue calls for 100 lbs per acre, according to this we will need 100 lbs of seed to make a good lawn. At present there is not any good place for the children to play & they track the mud in dreadfully in wet weather. It is impossible to keep either the children or school clean. A good lawn would be a great improvement & help. If you decide to supply the seed, may we have it soon so the grass will have a good start with the spring rains. Hoping to receive a reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs H F Howard\nOttawa, May 15, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th ultimo applying for one hundred pounds of grass seed to sow the Goodfish Lake School grounds I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to comply with your request, which should have been made through Mr. Agent Hughes. You have been frequently informed that the Department cannot deal with communications of this nature which are not forwarded through the office of your local Indian agent.\n\nMr. Hughes will be written to and asked for a report as to what should be done to overcome the difficulty complained of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. H. Howard,\nTeacher,\nGoodfish Lake Day School,\nWhitefish Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, May 15, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. H. H. Howard, teacher of the Goodfish Lake school, states that there is not any good place for the children to play and that they track in mud in wet weather.\n\nKindly let the Department have an estimate of the cost of filling in the grounds with sand or gravel and also state whether you consider this would improve the conditions complained of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, No. 116959/1, regarding cost of filling in the grounds with sand and gravel at Goodfish Lake school, I have the honour to inform you that I do not think that filling in the grounds as suggested would improve the conditions complained of.\n\nI am of the opinion that if the land broken around the school buildings was seeded down to grass it would prove more satisfactory than the filling in as the grounds thereabout are fairly level and any levelling which the grounds would require could be done with a drag. I do not consider that the school grounds require filling in with sand and gravel.\n\nThe cost of levelling the grounds with a drag and seeding down to grass would be about $12.00.\n\nThe children tracking the mud into the school is almost unavoidable as the road passes in front of the school and that is where they spend most of their playtime.

Would you please advise if you may expect to get other tenders?\n\nYou might again interview the principals of the Alberta Construction Company and ascertain -\n\n1. If they can quote a lesser amount.\n2. When they would be prepared to commence the work if their company was fortunate enough in getting this job.\n\nYou may possibly find that the Alberta Construction Company tender is the best that can be secured, and though it now appears excessive to the Departmental Engineer, the price may not be at all out of line with existing building costs.\n\nAs you are fully aware of the urgency, I know that you will give this your immediate attention.

Finally on July 14th a tender was received from the Alberta Construction Company Limited of Edmonton, Alberta offering to erect a school for the sum of $17,985.00.\n\nThis tender was submitted to our Lands and Development Services Branch for consideration and their reply read in part as follows:\n\n\"While of course the urgency for the need of particular buildings, must determine whether or not a tender is accepted by the Indian Affairs Branch, when only one tender can be obtained we do not consider a recommendation in excess of $14,000.00 for a school of this type is justified for the proposed Alexander Day School, and recommend Mr. Hoey be so advised.\"\n\nMr. Gooderham was advised of the Chief Engineer. Shortly after this, we received word from the Principal of the Youville Residential School they would be unable to accept Indian pupils as they, in future, to serve as an old peoples home. Fortunately foreseen this and had erected two Indian Day Schools Michel and Stony Plain Reserves to provide educational facilities for the children who formerly attended the Residential School.\nHowever, as indicated above, we have not been able to obtain a satisfactory tender for the erection of the third school required, namely that on the Alexander's Reserve. Therefore, we again had Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson approach contractors in the vicinity of Edmonton. He approached four companies, namely, The Alberta Construction Company, Poole Construction Company, (who had previously built the Stony Plain and Michel Day Schools for us on a cost plus ten percent basis) Bennett & White Construction Company and Kingsway Construction Company. We have today received an air mail letter from Mr. Regional Supervisor Gooderham in which he reports as follows on Mr. Superintendent Robertson's attempts to interest contractors:\n\n\"Superintendent Robertson has submitted two tenders for the construction of this school on the basis of estimated costs plus fee of 10%, they are attached as follows:\n\nAlberta Construction Co. $15,495.00 plus fee of 10%\nPoole Construction Co. Estimated cost $20,000.00\n\nMr. Robertson reports that the Poole Construction Co. only submitted a tender after some persuasion and that two other firms, Bennett & White Construction Co. and Kingsway Construction, refused to bid.\n\nIt is hoped that the department will now be in a position to proceed with the construction of this school, Mr. Robertson should be advised by \"Air Mail\" direct with copy to this office\".\n\nPlease find attached the two tenders submitted as indicated above. I have also had prepared a Submission to Council recommending the acceptance of the tender of the Alberta Construction Company for the following two reasons:\n\n(a) This company's tender is the lower\n(b) Because this company has done satisfactory work for the Agency Division at the Hobbema Agency\nThe urgency of this situation can best be illustrated by the following comments from Mr. Gooderham:\n\n\"However, it is a serious matter for those from the Alexander Band; there are a number of children from this Band who would attend and their parents want them in school.\n\nI suggest that the day school on this reserve be erected as quickly as possible. In order to accomplish this, it may be necessary to accept an offer to build it at a figure much higher than originally estimated or if need be, to accept an offer on a cost plus basis. You will no doubt have found it impossible to keep within your estimate for schools and still carry out your program owing to the steadily mounting costs. In this province up to the moment no contracts have been placed so far as I am aware and it is not because our superintendents have not tried to get bids\".\n\nActing Director.\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, September 22, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A.

It is requested that you point out the following facts to the Alberta Construction Company when you hand them the contract forms:\n\n(a) That Progress Payments can be made to contractors in accordance with the work performed. Such applications for payments will be certified by you as Indian Superintendent and representative of the Branch. When approved by this office, the necessary cheques will be forwarded.

They are minimum rates only and nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing contractors and employers from the payment of higher rates in any instance where, during the continuance of the work, such higher rates are fixed by provincial legislation, by agreement between employers and employees in the district or by changes in hours of work or other conditions of work, except in cases of emergency as may be approved by the Minister of Labour and then only subject to the payment of overtime rates as specified by the Minister of Labour.\n\nA. I.\n\n(See next page)\n(9) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the lowest or fair and reasonable rates of wages to be observed and what is the proper classification of any wages for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, the Minister may direct him to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour performed by them at rates fixed in the schedule or fixed thereby by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall form part of any claims between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payments to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(10) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place where the work under contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule included in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(11) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(12) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour and provisions concerning workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further facts and information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy himself that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(13) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed paid to the Contractor.\n\n(14) These conditions shall extend not only to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(15) With a view to the prevention of subletting which might arise from subletting, the subletting of contracts, it shall be understood that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractors; the contract shall not, except in cases provided therefor be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(16) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA. I.\nOttawa, October 18, 1948.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request of October 14, we enclose labour conditions for insertion in the proposed contract for the construction of a one room Indian Day School at Alexander's Indian Reserve, Alta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Industrial Relations.\n(M.M. Maclean.)\nIt is presumed from your wire that the Alberta Construction Company is willing to build this school on either of the following terms:\n\n(a) Cost plus ten percent basis\n\n(b) A firm price of $15,495. plus a ten percent fee (or $15,495. plus $1,549.50) or a total of $17,044.50.\n\nIn any event, I would ask that the construction of the school begin as soon as possible, if you have not already done so. Then you can answer this letter indicating whether our above surmise is correct. We would prefer the acceptance of a firm tender in the amount of $17,044.50.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/IM.\nOctober 22, 1943.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alta.,\n\nAlexander Indian Day School.\n\nIn answer to your telegram, I would like to point out the following reasons for the misunderstanding which seems to have arisen:\n\n(1) The tender of September 9th of the Alberta Construction Company reads as follows:\n\n\"As discussed today, we are pleased to submit herewith our estimate for the construction of the above school in the sum of Fifteen Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety-Five Dollars ($15,495.00) plus a fee of 10 percent. Should your Department wish to perform the work on this basis, we are prepared to enter into a contract and begin work at once.\"\n\n(2) In Mr. Gooderham's letter of September 18th, he stated as follows - \"Superintendent Robertson has submitted two tenders for the construction of this school on fees of estimated cost plus a fee of ten percent.\n\n(3) Therefore, an Order-in-Council for the awarding of a contract for the erection of this school was worded to read as follows:\n\n\"That the lower of these tenders has been submitted by the Alberta Construction Company of Edmonton, Alberta, in an estimated amount of $15,495. plus a fee of ten percent on a cost plus ten percent basis.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Alexander's Indian Day School\n\nReferring to your letter of Oct. 22, 1948 in regard to the above.\n\nThe Alberta Construction Co. prefer to make the contract for the Construction of Alexander's Reserve School on a \"Cost plus 10 percent\" basis. Their firm bid on this work was, $17,985.00, and was made July 8, 1948 and forwarded through Mr. Gooderham's office with my letter of July 12th. This bid however, was not based on winter construction.\n\nThe tender of the Alberta Construction Co. dated Sept. 9, 1948 was intended as a cost plus ten percent tender and was made by them on my request. The figure of $15,495.00 was estimated cost only.\n\nThis firm have also received a letter from Mr. Charlton of the Treasury Branch advising them that they had been awarded the contract on a cost plus 10 percent basis and of the Treasury Board regulations in connection therewith.\n\nThe work on the School is coming along fine. I was at the school site on Friday, Oct. 29th, and they have the excavation made and most of the forms in place and expect to pour the concrete the first of the week.\n\nE.A.

Robertson it is stated that the same general practice as that used in submitting claims in the handling of the Stony Plain and Michel contracts should be followed. In those cases the audit was to be done only when the project was completed and progress claims were paid without certification of the field auditor. This method is considered very unsatisfactory as it does not give the field auditor a chance to examine current procedures and charges. Much better service can be rendered to all concerned if the field auditor audits each monthly claim before payment.\n\nAnticipating that there will be no objection on your part, the Auditor is being requested to contact Mr. Robertson and advise him that the monthly progress claims should be presented for audit before payment and will flow from the field auditor to this office then to your office.\n\nWill you kindly advise the amount of the allotment which has been set up to cover the cost of this work including the fixed fee. It is noted that the estimated cost of the work is shown as $15,495.00 plus 10 per cent but the contract provides for a cost not exceeding $16,000.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.G.

Such being so, we shall anticipate receipt of monthly progress claims and will, of course, arrange for their approval by the administration prior to making payment to the contractors.\n\nAn allotment of $15,000.00 has been authorized to cover the cost of the project.\n\nORIGINAL SIGNED BY\nW.

Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Alta.\n\nReference to your letter of Nov. 23rd. in connection with construction of Alexander's Indian Day School.\n\nI was at this school site yesterday with Mr. Gooderham. The construction is coming along very well considering that it is winter construction. The workmen were putting on the rafters yesterday and expect to have the building closed in, in a day or two.\n\nIn regard to desks, there are sufficient suitable desks to furnish this school remaining from those we took over from Youville Residential school. We will, however, require a teacher's desk and chair.\n\nIn regard to the furnishings for the school teaching, I have corrected the list enclosed with your letter inserting the Western Division catalogue numbers and prices and have made up requisition to cover which is forwarded to you herewith.\n\nI do not think that there is any possibility of this school being completed before the first of April at the earliest and I would suggest that the requisition for the furnishings be held up until about the first of February as they would be liable to be damaged if they were stored in the school building before it is completed.\n\np.t.o.\nYou will note that I have not requisitioned for any linoleum rugs.

The teachers and I were only able to find where three rugs were required and the extra four rugs are stored at the Agency and will fill the needs at Alexander's School.\n\nIn regard to advertising for a teacher I would suggest that it be left until the completion date of the school is a little more definite. Frankly I have considerable doubt of our chances of securing a suitable teacher in the midst of a contract year. In view of the large shortage of teachers in Alberta any suitable teacher will be tied up until the end of the June term.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEncs.\nDecember 6, 1948.\n\nMr. H. A.

I note also that you have sufficient desks on hand for pupils' use. I am sending the Furniture requisition to the Departmental Purchasing Agent today and on it I am writing \"to be delivered on or after February 15, 1949\".\n\nI note that you have not requisitioned for rugs and we are checking the furniture lists accordingly.\n\nWe note that you will advise us later with regard to advertising for a teacher at this school.\n\nBernard F.

Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve, Treasury Auditor, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Day School,\nAlexander Reserve - Edmonton Agency,\nAlberta Construction Co. - Contractor.\n\nPROGRESS CLAIM #1 - $10,195.69\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim #1 has been completed at the Contractor's office in Edmonton and the report thereon follows:\n\nMATERIALS: $3,289.94\n\nAll invoices for materials have been checked for calculations and compared with purchase orders or delivery slips when available. These accounts have been approved by Mr. E.A. Robertson, Superintendent of the Indian Agency, acting as Department Engineer.\n\nMaterials taken from the contractor's stock have been checked to original invoices for prices and found in order.\n\nIn accordance with Section 4 of the Agreement, the Contractor has taken advantage of cash discounts and has assumed the benefits since the purchases had been made with Company funds.\n\nSMALL TOOLS:\n\nAn inventory of small tools and non-consumable items has been set up, although not segregated from the charges for materials in this claim.\n\nPAYROLLS & PAYROLL CHARGES - $3,381.32\n\nAlthough a schedule of wage rates has not been issued or included with the contract, the rates that have been paid by the Contractor compares closely with the prevailing scale of wages in this district and have been approved by Mr. E.A. Robertson.\n\nThe following rates were paid on the basis of an 8 hour day, 40 hour week with time and a half for overtime:\n\nForeman - $1.60 per hour plus $1.50 @ day board\nCarpenters - 1.40 \" \" \" board\nCarpenter's helper - 1.25 \" \" \" \"\nRough carpenter - 1.25 \" \" \" \"\nLaborers (including) 80\u00a2 - $1.00 per hour plus board.\n\nThe job foreman maintains a weekly time record showing the number of hours worked each day by each man. The payrolls are compiled from these time records. All calculations and extensions have been checked with one error noted on Inv. 37 - Payroll #6 for Nov. 11-17, where Fred White received payment of $28.75 instead of\n$30.00. The Contractor has agreed to make an adjustment to the employee and include same in the next claim.\n\nBOARD - $154.94\n\nThe value of board received by employees, with the exception of A.E. Elstvedt, the foreman, has not been included in the earnings as required by Income Tax regulations. This has been brought to the Contractor's attention and a further check will be made to ascertain that the amounts involved are properly set up and reported with the employees' earnings.\n\nAn error in extension resulting in an overcharge of $6.70 has been noted on Inv. # 41 where 29 meals @ 67\u00a2 served to E. Dickson have been calculated as $26.13 instead of $19.43. The contractor has taken steps to obtain the necessary credit which will be reflected in the next claim.\n\nVACATION PAY - $60.28\n\nAll employees on this project have received Holiday Pay at the rate of 2% in accordance with the length of their service and on the basis of their gross earnings, exclusive of board paid on their behalf.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE - $25.24\n\nThe provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act have been complied with and the amount of contributions paid by the Contractor on behalf of the employees listed appears correct although the Contributions' books have not yet been examined for proof of payment.\n\nWORKMEN'S COMPENSATION - $128.86\n\nThe Contractor has been assessed at the rate of 4% for the current year by Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board. The above charge has been calculated on the gross payroll and includes value of free board and Vacation Pay.\n\nPUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE - $5.49\n\nThe Contractor carries insurance against the above risks at a cost of .170% of the gross payrolls. The values of free and Vacation Pay have also been included in the calculations of the above charge.\n\nBUILDERS' RISK INSURANCE - $187.00\n\nThe building while in the course of construction and is unoccupied has been insured for one year by the Contractor. The above charge represents the premium on a British General Insurance Co. Ltd. Policy # 93799 for $17,000 which is effective from November 8, 1948. The Department of Mines & Resources have been registered as co-beneficiaries with the Contractor.\n\nEQUIPMENT RENTAL - $245.00\n\nA Company-owned \u00bd Ton Mercury Pick-up truck has been used to transport men and materials to and from the project. The above charge covers the rental from October 14 to December 1st, at the rate of $1.00 per hour without operator. This rate has been approved by Mr. E.A. Robertson.\n\nThe above charge has been included in the \"cost of work\" in error and included in the calculations of the fee. The Contractor has agreed to adjust the overcharge which has resulted on the next Progress Claim.\nSUB-CONTRACTS\n\n1. EXCAVATION AND CONCRETE WORKS - $1,777.50\n\nThe Adby Construction Co., Ltd., has carried out excavation and back filling work at $1.50 per cu. yd., and also supplied and poured concrete @ $20.00 per cu. yd. The Contractor, with the concurrence of the Superintendent of the Agency, has had this work completed at rates which the sub-contractor normally charges.\n\n2. PLUMBING - $219.89\n\nThe firm of Jamison & Lofts has, at the Contractor's request, supplied and installed at current market prices the plumbing material and fixtures required. The above charge includes $48.00 for labour and $6.00 for truck expenses.\n\nTRUCKING - $165.16\n\nThe services of W. Crawford of Edmonton have been retained by the Contractor to have materials as required from Edmonton to the Indian School, a distance of some 22 miles, at the rate of 25\u00a2 per cwt. This rate is somewhat lower than that currently charged by the larger cartage firms in Edmonton.\n\nThe hauling accounts have been compared with the materials invoices. The accounts were found in order and further served to establish proof of delivery of materials to the site.\n\nAn account paid to A. Boddes in the amount of $21.00 for cartage of stone at $3.50 per yd. has been found reasonable and in order.\n\nCONTRACTOR'S FEE - $926.88\n\nIn accordance with the Agreement which the Contractor has signed and returned to the Department for final ratification, a fee of 10% of the \"cost of work\" completed has been claimed in this application.\n\nThe inclusion of equipment rental, noted above, has resulted in an overcharge of $24.80 in fee for which the Contractor has agreed to adjust on the next Progress Claim.\n\nGENERAL\n\nA copy of the Agreement signed by the Contractor and the Department has not been returned to the Company and was therefore not available for examination. According to a draft of the Agreement which has been received, the above charges, excluding the discrepancies noted, appear fair and reasonable.\n\nThe Contractor's records, in spite of the discrepancies disclosed, have been found generally well kept and handled by an efficient staff who have given me all the information and assistance required to carry out my audit.\n\nAn examination of \"paid\" cheques has not been undertaken but will be carried out before the second Progress Claim is passed for payment.\n\nIn accordance with the above report, and subject to the adjustments mentioned, Progress Claim #1 has been certified.\nJ.

All calculations and extensions have been checked with one error noted on Inv. 37 - Payroll # 6 for Nov. 11-17, where Fred White received payment of $28.75 instead of\nThe Contractor has agreed to make an adjustment to the employee and include same in the next claim.\n\n**BOARD - $154.94**\n\nThe value of board received by employees, with the exception of A.F. Elfstedt, the foreman, has not been included in the earnings as required by Income Tax regulations. This has been brought to the Contractor's attention and a further check will be made to ascertain that the amounts involved are properly set up and reported with the employees' earnings.\n\nAn error in extension resulting in an overcharge of $6.70 has been noted on Inv. #41 where 29 meals @ 67\u00a2 served to E. Dickson have been calculated as $26.13 instead of $19.43. The contractor has taken steps to obtain the necessary credit which will be reflected in the next claim.\n\n**VACATION PAY - $60.28**\n\nAll employees on this project have received Holiday Pay at the rate of 2% in accordance with the length of their service and on the basis of their gross earnings, exclusive of board paid on their behalf.\n\n**UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE - $25.24**\n\nThe provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act have been complied with and the amount of contributions paid by the Contractor on behalf of the employees listed appears correct although the Contributions' books have not yet been examined for proof of payment.\n\n**WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION - $128.86**\n\nThe Contractor has been assessed at the rate of 4% for the current year by Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board. The above charge has been calculated on the gross payroll and includes value of free board and Vacation Pay.\n\n**PUBLIC LIABILITY & PROPERTY DAMAGE - $5.49**\n\nThe Contractor carries insurance against the above risks at a cost of .170% of the gross payrolls. The value of free board and Vacation Pay have also been included in the calculations of the above charge.\n\n**BUILDERS RISK INSURANCE - $127.00**\n\nThe building while in the course of construction and is unoccupied has been insured for one year by the Contractor. The above charge represents the premium on a British General Insurance Co. Ltd. Policy #95799 for $17,000 which is effective from November 8, 1943. The Department of Mines & Resources have been registered as co-beneficiaries with the Contractor.\n\n**EQUIPMENT RENTAL - $248.00**\n\nA Company-owned \u00bd Ton Mercury Pick-up truck has been used to transport men and materials to and from the project. The above charge covers the rental from October 14 to December 1st. at the rate of $1.00 per hour without operator. This rate has been approved by Mr. E.A. Robertson.\n\nThe above charge has been included in the \"cost of work\" in error and included in the calculations of the fee. The Contractor has agreed to adjust the overcharge which has resulted on the next Progress Claim.\nSUB - CONTRACTS\n\n1. EXCAVATION AND CONCRETE WORKS - $1,777.50\n\nThe Adby Construction Co. Ltd. has carried out excavation and back filling work at $1.50 per cu. yd., and also supplied and poured concrete @ $20.00 per cu. yd. The Contractor, with the concurrence of the Superintendent of the Agency, has had this work completed at rates which the sub-contractor normally charges.\n\n2. PLUMBING - $219.89\n\nThe firm of Jamison & Lofts has, at the Contractor's request, supplied and installed at current market prices the plumbing material and fixtures required. The above charge includes $48.00 for labour and $6.00 for truck expenses.\n\nTRUCKING - $165.16\n\nThe services of W. Crawford of Edmonton have been retained by the Contractor to have materials as required from Edmonton to the Indian School, a distance of some 38 miles, at the rate of 25\u00a2 per cwt. This rate is somewhat lower than that currently charged by the larger cartage firms in Edmonton.\n\nThe hauling accounts have been compared with the materials invoices. The accounts were found in order and further served to establish proof of delivery of materials to the site.\n\nAn account paid to A. Boddez in the amount of $21.00 for cartage of stone at $3.50 per yd. has been found reasonable and in order.\n\nCONTRACTOR'S FEE - $926.88\n\nIn accordance with the Agreement which the Contractor has signed and returned to the Department for final ratification, a fee of 10% of the \"cost of work\" completed has been claimed in this application.\n\nThe inclusion of equipment rental, noted above, has resulted in an overcharge of $24.20 in fee which the Contractor has agreed to adjust on the next Progress Claim.\n\nGENERAL\n\nA copy of the Agreement signed by the Contractor and the Department has not been returned to the Company and was therefore not available for examination. According to a draft of the Agreement which has been received, the above charges, excluding the discrepancies noted, appear fair and reasonable.\n\nThe Contractor's records, in spite of the discrepancies disclosed, have been found generally well kept and handled by an efficient staff who have given me all the information and assistance required to carry out my audit.\n\nAn examination of \"paid\" cheques has not been undertaken but will be carried out before the second Progress Claim is passed for payment.\n\nIn accordance with the above report, and subject to the adjustments mentioned, Progress Claim #1 has been certified.\nJ.

Villeneuve, Treasury Auditor, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nRe: Construction of Indian Day School\nAlexander Reserve - Edmonton Agency,\nAlberta Construction Co., Contractor.\n\nPROGRESS CLAIM #2 - $4,105.66\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim #2 has been completed by the undersigned at the Contractor's office in Edmonton and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayrolls and Payroll Charges - $1,062.76\n\nA schedule of minimum wage rates to be observed on contract has not been received. The rates paid in the present claim are the same as in claim #1. Since December 29, E. McLean has taken over the duties of foreman from A. Elfstedt and has been paid at the same rate of $1.50 per hour plus $1.50 @ day board which he received on his former job.\n\nWeekly time records maintained and signed by the foreman have been checked in detail to the payrolls and found correctly transcribed and computed.\n\nAn underpayment of $1.25 noted in Claim #1 on Payroll #6 for Nov. 11-17 has been adjusted and paid to Fred White on Payroll #10 for Dec. 16-22.\n\nBoard - $66.53\n\nThe value of board paid by the Contractor on behalf of several employees has not been included on the payrolls for Income Tax deductions owing to the fact that the board accounts are not available at the time the payrolls are compiled. The amounts involved are, however, posted to the employees' individual records of earnings and are reported to the Income Tax Branch in due course.\n\nThe over charge of $6.70 reported in Claim #1, resulting from an apparent error in calculation on Inv. #61, upon inquiries by the Contractor, has been found to be an error in the account submitted by J.D. Morin who charged 89 meals to E. Dickson whereas the number should have been 89 which is in agreement with the payment received by the claimant.\nVacation Pay - $18.64\n\nAll employees have been paid at the rate of 2% in accordance with their length of employment, and Holiday Pay Books have been stamped to date. The value of board has been taken into account in the calculation.\n\nUnemployment Insurance - $7.48\n\nThis represents the Contractor's portion of contributions paid under the U.I. Act. Contribution books have been examined and found in order.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation - $40.55\n\nThis amount represents 4% of the total of wages, board and Vacation Pay charged in the present claim.\n\nOn completion of final returns to the Alberta Workmen's Compensation Board, the contractor's records will be reviewed to adjust any rebates that may accrue in connection with employees whose earnings exceeded $2,375.00 in 1948.\n\nF.H.S. & F.D. - $1.62\n\nThis charge, representing an assessment of .170\u00a2 on the gross payroll, including board, is reasonably accurate although an undercharge of 10 cents has been noted in connection with Payroll #10 for December 22nd.\n\nMaterials - $1,062.76\n\nInvoices for materials have been test checked for calculations and extensions. Delivery and receipt of materials has been reasonably established by comparing invoices to items listed on trucking accounts and also by the signature of the foreman appearing on delivery slips and purchase orders.\n\nMaterials supplied from the contractor's stock have been fairly priced in line with actual cost laid down.\n\nEquipment Rental - $87.00\n\nThis amount represents the Contractor's charge for the rental of a Company-owned \u00bd ton Mercury Pick-up truck at the rate of $1.00 per hour without operator. The number of hours charged corresponds with the number of hours the foreman has been on the job.\n\nIn accordance with Schedule \"A\" (Sec. j) of the contract, these charges have been deleted from the \"cost of the work\" in computing the Contractor's fee or commission.\n\n- Sub-Contracts -\n\n1 - Millwork - W.R. Seidler Ltd. - $1,098.50\n\nWith the concurrence of the Indian Superintendent, Mr. E.A. Robertson, the Contractor has accepted the above firm's estimate of $2,500.00 for millwork as the lowest bid received. To date this sub-contractor has supplied millwork to the value of $1,098.50 in addition to other material not classed or listed as millwork.\nTrucking charges in the present claim amount to $37.68 and have been calculated at the agreed rate of 25 cents per sq. The materials hauled corresponded accurately with supplier invoices and items charged out of the Contractor's stock.\n\nContractor's Fee - $349.61\n\nThe Contractor's fee has been calculated at the rate of 10% on the actual \"cost of work\" completed, as set out in Section 5 (b) of the contract, deleting charges for rental on Company-owned equipment. The overcharge of $24.60 in claim #1 has accordingly been deducted from the fee earned in the present claim, leaving a net fee of $345.61 to be paid.\n\nGeneral -\n\nAn examination of \"paid\" cheques has been performed in connection with payrolls and accounts included in Progress Claim #1, and proof of payment established. A list has been set-up for all cheques outstanding from the previous claim.\n\nThe Contractor has complied with all statutory requirements and, to the best of my knowledge, the accounts submitted herein represent goods and services that have been rendered at prices that appear fair and reasonable.\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing report, and subject to the adjustments mentioned, Progress Claim #2 has been certified.\n\nJ.

That I am Owner of Alberta Construction Company (President, Secretary, Treasurer, or Partner, etc.), the Contractor named in the contract above mentioned, and as such have personal knowledge of the facts hereunder declared.\n\n2. That all the sub-contractors, labour, and accounts for materials whatsoever entering into the construction of that portion of the work covered by the said contract as set forth in the progress estimate passed last previous to the one attached hereto have been duly paid.\n\n3. That the wages paid are in all cases the same as or above those set out in the Schedule of Wages attached to and forming part of the said contract.\n\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act.\n\nALBERTA CONSTRUCTION CO.\n\nDeclared before me at Edmonton, Alberta, County of this 21st day of January A.D. 1949\n\nBetty B.

Rental of the contractor's equipment is all counted part of the cost of work and the amount of such should be included in computing the fee. This error will be corrected on the next claim.\n\nIt is noted that the only approval received for rental of Mercury half ton truck at $1.00 per hour is that of the Indian Superintendent, Mr. E. A. Robertson, and there has apparently been no Ottawa approval for this rental.\n\nAs mentioned by the auditor, we have not yet received a schedule of minimum wage rates which should form part of the contract.\n\nThis audit report has inadvertently been addressed to Mr. F.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\n708 McCallum Hill Bldg.,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton\n\nRe: Indian Day School - Alexander Reserve\nAlberta Construction Co. - Contractors\n\nProgress Claim #8 - $4,450.58\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim #8 has been completed by the undersigned at the Contractor's office in Edmonton, and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayrolls and Payroll charges - $2,116.58\n\nThe payrolls submitted have been checked in detail to the weekly time records which are maintained and signed by the foreman, R. McLean.\n\nThe rates paid by the contractor comply with the Schedule of wages provided in the contract and are in line with current Union rates.\n\nBoard - $186.56\n\nThe Contractor has paid the board accounts as submitted herewith and added the amounts to the earnings of the employees concerned. The value of board has not been recorded on the payrolls owing to the fact that the amounts are not available at the time the payrolls are compiled.\n\nVacation Pay - $39.71\n\nAll employees have been paid in accordance with their length of employment and Holiday Pay Books have been stamped to date. The value of board has been taken into account in the case of each employee.\n\nA minor error of .08 has been noted in the additions of Holiday Pay column on Payroll #14 for January 15, (1949) to 19th where the total is shown as $6.75 instead of $6.75. No adjustment has been requested.\n\nUnemployment Insurance - $13.58\n\nThe Contractor has complied with the Unemployment Insurance Act and the above charge represents the employer's contributions.\nWorkmen's Compensation - $75.14\n\nThis amount represents 6% of the total of wages, board and Vacation Pay charged in this claim less a credit of $5.85 on account of a W.C.B. rebate applicable to 1946 wages charged to this contract. The credit which the Contractor has allowed has in the case of E. McLean been incorrectly calculated as $.34 whereas the correct amount should be $.04, a difference of $.34 which may be adjusted on a later claim if the Contractor so desires.\n\nP.L.C. & P.D.C. - $5.56\n\nThe above charge has been calculated as 170% of the gross payrolls and board but does not include Vacation Pay. An undercharge of $.08 has resulted and no adjustment is contemplated unless requested by the Contractor.\n\nMaterials - $765.44\n\nInvoices for materials have been checked in detail for calculations and extensions. Delivery and receipt of materials in all instances have been acknowledged by the foreman on the project.\n\nMaterials supplied from the contractor's stock have been properly recorded and priced in line with the actual cost laid down.\n\nEquipment Rental - $151.50\n\nThe Contractor has charged the rental of a Company owned \u00bd ton Pick-up truck at $1.00 per hour without operation which is in compliance with the schedule of rates approved in the Contract.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Contract, the contractor has been allowed to derive a fee of 10% on such rentals.\n\nSub-Contracts\n\n1 - Millwork - W.R. Zeidler Ltd. - $515.00\n\nIn accordance with the above firm's accepted tender, millwork in the amount of $515.00 has been supplied and charged in this claim, bringing the amount supplied to date to $1505.50, which is within the approved estimate of $2525.00.\n\n2 - Barry & Kemper - $250.00\n\nThis firm has been authorized to install the furnace and ducts at an estimated cost of $250.00. The above charge would cover a portion of the work that has been completed to date.\nS - R.A. Sorensen - $84.50\n\nWith the consent of the Indian Superintendent, the Contractor has sub-contracted the erection of the chimney to the above party on a cost plus 10% basis. The account submitted is exclusive of materials and is somewhat lower than the cost at other Indian schools of the same specifications.\n\nAn error of 10\u00a2 noted on the account can be overlooked as the contractor has now settled the account.\n\nTrucking - W. Crawford - $35.00\n\nThis charge represents one account and covers materials hauled and delivery of which has been acknowledged by the job foreman.\n\nContractor's Fee - $435.07\n\nThis amount brings the total fee claimed to date to $1764.56 which represents 10% of the \"cost of work\", that has been established and claimed by the Contractor, and is in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe charges submitted by the Contractor to this stage exceed the expenditure of $12,000.00 authorized in the contract by $750.18. The completion of the school is estimated to cost a further $2,500.00. The Contractor has been advised to take immediate action along with the Indian Superintendent to secure the necessary approval from the Department for a further appropriation of funds.\n\nAn examination of \"paid cheques\", has been carried out in connection with payrolls and accounts included in the previous claims and proof of payment established with the exception of a few cheques outstanding.\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing report, and subject to the remarks therein, Progress Claim #8 has been certified.\n\nApproved:\n\nH.

She can then submit the requisitions accordingly. I am sending them in duplicate so that you can keep a copy for your files.\n\nYou are also authorized to make local purchase of janitor supplies up to an amount of $50.00 for brooms, soap, disinfectant, etc. You might also wish to requisition for heavy\nMaplex cups from Simpson's or Eaton's for use by the pupils.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\n709 McCallum Hill Building,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nFrom: J.L. Villeneuve - Treasury Auditor - Edmonton.\n\nRe: Indian Day School - Alexander Reserve\nAlberta Construction Co. - Contractor.\n\nProgress Claim #4 - $4060.02\n\nThe audit of Progress Claim No. 4 has been completed by the undersigned at the Contractor's office in Edmonton and the report thereon follows:\n\nPayrolls\n\nOne hour travelling time per man has been charged from April 20th on, as the contractor was not able to find lodging and board for the men on the site. The extra hour has been charged at straight time and has been done with approval of the Provincial Board of Industrial Relations.\n\nBuilders' Risk Insurance -\n\nThe Contractor has insured the building by an additional $3000 which brings the amount carried to $20000. The extra premium amounted to $33.00.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation -\n\nThe amount of rebate credited on Claim No. 3 which has resulted in an undercharge of 34 cents has not been claimed by the contractor in view of the small amount involved.\n\nA charge of $87.00 has been paid to Adby Construction on Invoice No. 92 for levelling and back filling. This work was performed with the knowledge and approval of the Indian Superintendent Mr. H.A. Robertson.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe cost of the school to the conclusion of this claim amounted to $22,810.20. There are other accounts to come up, such as painting, with the result that the final cost may approach $25000. The original estimate of $16000 has been exceeded considerably due to an appreciable increase in the price of lumber and building materials and also to the fact that the school was at a considerable distance from Edmonton, thus entailing travelling and subsistence expenses.\nThe Indian Superintendent, Mr. E.A. Robertson has been informed on the matter and is of the opinion that the contract has been carried out in good faith and as economically as can reasonably be expected.\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing remarks, Progress Claim No. 4 has been certified.\n\nJLV/jm\n\nF.L.

Cheques covering these remittances have been examined and proof of payment has been established.\n\nVacation Pay:\n\nThe contractor has fully complied with these requirements as prescribed by the Alberta Board of Industrial Relations. Holiday Pay books have been examined from time to time and satisfactory evidence has been obtained that the correct rates and amounts have been paid to the employees.\n\nUnemployment Insurance:\n\nContributions by employer and employees have been test checked by examining the employees books and purchases of stamps from the Commission. The charges claimed by the contractor have been found correctly computed and in order.\n\nWorkmen's Compensation:\n\nThe assessment rate prescribed by the Workmen's Compensation Board of Alberta has been observed by the contractor and payment thereof has been verified by examining cheques and relative records of the contractor. All rebates accruing have been taken into account for the year 1948. There will be no rebate for 1949 as all employees employed on the project are no longer with the contractor and have not earned the maximum assessable amount.\nThe necessary clearance from the W.C. Board has been appended to this claim.\n\nPublic Liability and Property Damages:\n\nThe contractor has maintained the necessary coverage against the above risks throughout the duration of the project and has re-\nmitted the amounts charged in the form of premiums to the Insurance Company.\n\nMaterials and Expenses:\n\nAll invoices for materials have been checked for calcula-\ntions and compared with purchase orders and delivery slips. Materials supplied from the contractor's stores were also checked as to prices and delivery.\n\nMaterials remaining at the conclusion of the project have been set up on Inventory Sheets and disposed of partly by purchase by the contractor at 50% of original price as approved by the Supervising Engineer and partly by remaining the property of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nInsurance:\n\nWith the approval of the Indian Superintendent, Mr. E.A. Robertson, the contractor has cancelled the Fire Insurance Policy on the building and secured and credited the rebate against the present claim.\n\nSubcontracts:\n\nBarry & Kesper - Supply and Installation of Furnace:\n\nIn accordance with the estimate submitted and approved by the Indian Superintendent, the above firm has completed the Installa-\ntion of the heating system at the quoted amount of $255.00.\n\nH.R. Zeidler - Millwork:\n\nWith the concurrence of the Indian Superintendent, the above firm was awarded the subcontract of supplying millwork for the estimated amount of $2589.00. The actual amount supplied has been valued at $2462.40 only, owing to the fact that certain items had to be procured from other suppliers.\n\nThe above two subcontracts have been formally submitted to the department for ratification.\n\nA number of other firms have also provided materials and services of a specialised nature but as these firms would only agree to provide these services at current prices rather than offer an estimate, no formal approval was sought. This also enabled the con-\ntractor to shop around and take advantage of competitive prices.\n\nPlant Rentals:\n\nAlberta Construction - Mercury 1947, \u00bd ton Pickup truck:\n\nThe Company has claimed rentals on the above truck at the rate of $1.00 per hour. This rate was authorised by the Indian Super-\nintendent and corresponds with the rate set out in the Schedule of rates appended to the contract. The contractor has claimed a total rental of $1343.50. The time charged represented the number of hours\nthe truck was out with the men and includes many hours during which it was not in actual operation. Application for approval of the rate charged has gone forward to the Department.\n\nWilkinson & McKean:\n\nThe rent of Engine and Generator was for the operation of a sanding machine. The rate charged is that submitted by the firm owning the equipment. Application for approval of the rate of $8.00 per day has also gone forward to the Department.\n\nFee:\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the contract a fee of 10% on the total cost of the work has been claimed by the contractor. The amount claimed in the present application represents the balance of a total fee of $236.50 as calculated on the total cost of $23,669.14 for the completed project.\n\nGeneral:\n\nAn inspection of the school following its completion has been made by the writer in the company of the Indian Superintendent, Mr. K.A. Robertson who has issued the required certificate of completion.\n\nThe cost of the project has exceeded the original estimate of $18,000 by $8,256.04. There is, however, a reasonable comparison between the cost of this school and the two identical schools erected on the Michel and Winterburn Reserves. The trend in prices has been on the upward since the earlier schools were built and consequently the increased cost can be attributed to this factor.\n\nThe contractor has furnished evidence of all payments of wages and accounts. Cancelled cheques have been examined in every case with the exception of cheque no. 6566 in the amount of $10.26 payable to Paul Henry on Payroll for July 22-28, which was still outstanding at the time of the final audit.\n\nAll applicable credits have been deducted from this and previous claims.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions contained in Contract No. 4458 dated October 5, 1948, I have made an examination of the accounts and records of the contractor, insofar as they pertain to the above mentioned contract and I have received all the information and explanations I have required. I have reviewed the system of internal control and the accounting procedures of the contractor and, without making a detailed audit of the transactions, I have tested the accounting records of the contractor and other supporting evidence by methods and to the extent I have deemed necessary.\n\nI report that, subject to the extent of my examination and in my opinion, the amount of $26,256.04 in the cost arrived at as shown in the accounts and records examined and in accordance with the information and explanations obtained, the said amount being in excess of the estimated cost of $18,000 as set out in the contract by $8,256.04.\nJ.L.

The total cost amounted to $26,256.04, and we regard this as an expensive undertaking. In fact, we are more than ever convinced now that no further contracts on a cost plus basis can be recommended by this Division.\n\nIf you will have Mr. Robertson submit a certificate to the effect that the school has been completed in accordance with the contract of December 17, 1948, and as described in the Plans and Specifications No. 327 as prepared by the Department, then we will return the security deposit to the contractor.\n\nBernard F.

Erikson\n\nDear Mr. Erikson:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 13th regarding the Alexander Indian Day School, this school has cost more than we anticipated and we have been obliged to transfer funds from another project in order to pay your account. This has caused a delay, but the matter has now been adjusted and the Treasury Branch advise that a cheque for $3,445.84 was sent on December 14th.\n\nWe have also requested the Finance Department to return your security deposit cheque of $1,500.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nSt. Alexander Reserve\nRiviere Qui Barre,\nAlberta.\nDec. the 2th 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe, the Indians of the Alexander Reserve, are very proud of our Day School. It allows our children to receive a sound education. Our thanks and gratefulness goes to the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nA good health, we hold, is necessary to profit of the teaching and education given at school. For this reason, we built for our children a hockey rink (170 ft. x 70 ft.), which we are flooding with water from a one-mile lake. A slide for the younger boys and girls is being constructed also.\n\nHaving shown our interest and our good will, having done a good amount of the required work, having our own Band's Hockey Team to Equip with goalie's sticks, pads and protectors, we would greatly appreciate a help from the Department of Mines and Resources to equip our children with their own Hockey equipment.\n\nThey would be in need of the following hockey articles:\n\n- 2 goalie's pads.\n- 2 goalie's sticks.\n- 2 goalie's, breast protectors.\n- a few shovels.\n- 4 \"24 inch\" scrapers.\n\nA few sleighs for the girls would also be appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signatures)\n\nThe Indians of the Alexander Reserve:\n\nLeo Kootenay\nFred Arcand\nPete Lafleshe\nPete Auigabelle\nSimon Burnstick\nPatrick Courteoreille\nJohn Burnstick\nPat Auigabelle\nAlec Arcand\nVictor Bruno\n\nJoe Lafleshe\nMike Burnstick\nPhilip Arcand\nPete Courteoreille\nGregory Arcand\nLeo Bruno, Co.\nNapoleon Arcand\nJasper Chicken\nArchie Arcand\nJimmy Arcand\nJoe Lafleshe & Joe Burnstick.\nSaint Alexander Mission,\nRiviere-Sui-Barre,\nAlberta,\nDec. 19th 1946.\n\nMr. E.T.

I was certain that you would do all you could to help them out, as you have done in the past. So, they tell me.\n\nI have seen Mr. D.Simm, for you were then on your leave.

Pugh, Superintendent, Stony Sarees Indian Agencies, on the inspection of the reserve area. The Nordegg detachment of the R.C.M.P. provided a Jeep and driver for the inspection carried out on May 20th.\n\nThe accompanying township map shows the area embraced in the reserve, the approximate location of the dwelling houses of the Indians, and the area or site selected as most suitable for the Agency and School buildings.\n\nA site for the proposed school and agency buildings was selected in the S.W. quarter of Section 19, Township 39, Range 16 W being a parcel of land bounded northerly by the existing constructed section of the proposed David Thompson Highway and Southerly by the Big Horn River.\n\nThis site was selected as fulfilling more than any other site examined, the following requirements:\n\n1. Accessibility. It is on the principal and only highway in this District, 15 miles from Nordegg.\n\n2. Drainage. The site in general is a level gravel bench at an elevation of approximately 10 feet above high water line of the Big Horn River. Drainage is very satisfactory.\n\n3. Water Supply. Both for domestic and fire fighting purposes is at all times adequate and accessible at a minimum of cost.\n\n4. Surroundings are pleasant. The highway runs along the south side of rather high, up to 300 feet wooded hills. The river as it emerges from the Big Horn Canyon is crossed by the highway Bridge. See accompanying photographs.\n\n5. Control. It is very desirable to have the agency buildings located at a site which will give the most ..........\n\nContinued on Page 2.\n\nTo S.

B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nRe: Bighorn Indian Day School\n\nFurther to your memorandum of June 16th I have examined with interest Mr. Mills' report and have noted the selection made for the school and administrative site on the Bighorn River. From the photographs and information it looks to be a very interesting and attractive site both from the viewpoint of the school and the administrative headquarters.\n\nWe have at the moment before Council a recommendation to create the 5,000-acre block into an Indian Reserve to be known as Bighorn Indian Reserve No. 144A and expect the Order in Council within the next day or two. As soon as the Order in Council is received, this Service is sending forward a recommendation to the Minister to set aside approximately fifty acres at the location marked by you as a school site and as a site for administrative buildings to serve the Reserve.\n\nI discussed this with Mr. Hoey and we agreed that in setting aside the area for administrative purposes we should make it large enough so that we could control enough property to prevent Indian housing from encroaching too closely to the administrative buildings. We also made it large in order to ensure that we have control within the Branch of the exact building site ultimately selected.\n\nAs soon as this authorization is received from the Minister, we will forward you a copy for record purposes. In the meantime I am enclosing copy of the draft of the Minister's order which we propose to ask him for as soon as the Order in Council setting up the Reserve is received here.\nWe are returning herewith Mr. Mills' report with attachments and photographs, and appreciate having had the opportunity to look them over.\n\nEncls.\n\nD.

H. Pugh.\n\nYou will recollect it was proposed to erect log buildings, and an accountable cheque of $2,000.00 was forwarded in 1948 to pay for logging and other preliminary work. The Indians have brought in all the necessary logs, a well is being drilled and what money is left out of this advance will be used to purchase cement.\n\nI hope you are impressed with the construction as indicated in the sketches. I am impressed and believe that this type of building is most suitable for this reserve. The buildings will be erected along a scenic highway now under construction. There will be a community of log buildings, and I can visualize the day when this little Indian settlement will be an attraction for tourists, then the Indians can sell handicraft and operate other lines of business, which will be lucrative and make them more or less self-supporting.\n\nMr. Pugh has given this a great deal of thought and I can see no way to improve on his plans. Neither he nor I are in a position to give any close estimate of the total cost of the two buildings, but it is our belief that they may total close to $14,000.00.

The walls will only require two inch rock wool batts as they will be sufficiently insulated other than with the logs. You might also consider insulating the floor as we have done in plan 888. I am sending a copy of this in the envelope so that you can see how the insulation is applied.\n\n(2) We also feel that screened ventilators should be included in the cement foundations in order to prevent dry rot. Here again, you will find plan 888 of help in placing these ventilators.\nWe have not yet received the toilets/woodshed plan which formed sheet 2 of plan 888. Immediately this is received, we will send you the sheet as you will probably want to build also a log building based on this plan.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt: of Indian Education.\n\nRe: Big Horn Indian Day School.\n\nWe desire to acknowledge the receipt of your file 710-5 (E), of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the erection of the above noted school, and we have today requested the Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta., to forward the copy of Radio message, herewith attached.\n\nIn this connection, we may say, that having just returned from Nordegg and the school site, where we checked the logs and well site etc., and interviewed Mr. Johnson, in regard to the work to be carried out, we were able to reply to your letter on our return with the information requested.\n\nThe wage schedule may appear about ten cents higher than would be the case in closer proximity to commercial centres, but as this site is so far removed from Rocky Mountain House, Nordegg being discounted being a purely Company mining town, we were confronted with the fact that the foreman and crew would have to set up their own living and boarding arrangements. Big Horn Reserve is situated 13 miles from Nordegg and as we have no transportation nearer than Rocky Mountain House (deep), we think that it would be fair to allow Mr. Johnson, if approved, to charge the nominal rate of 6 cents per mile for the use of his light delivery, if required in emergency. It will be also be noted that we have included a charge for the use of a gas power saw at a nominal rate of 10 cents per hour, and in this we feel that it will eliminate hand ripping, sawing etc., and is recommended. The use of the cement mixer is essential and the charge nominal, and will be based on 350 sacks of cement.\n\nI requested Mr. Johnson to proceed out to the site with Mr. Thomas towards the end of the coming week, but will wire Mr. Thomas to delay this, until we have your signal to commence with Mr. Johnson.\n\nWe have made the necessary arrangements with Mr. C. Bruce of Rocky Mtn House to deliver the lumber to the site and as soon as possible, before rains, and the construction of roads which is proceeding between Rocky Mtn House and Nordegg. We checked over bridges between Nordegg and Big Horn, as there was some question as to their carrying capacity, but believe they are safe for normal loads.\n\nShould the foregoing meet with your approval, may we be provided with an accountable cheque to pay wages, in the amount of $2000.00, which is tentative until we know the cost of material. The writer is basing his wage requirements at approximately 40% of the material cost.\n\nLumber reference above is made to Purchase Order No 41088, for forms etc. for this building.\n\nJohn E.

Pugh,\nSuperintendent\n\nThe nearest town to Big Horn school is Rocky Mountain House, 90 miles away. Here the demand for labour, expert and unskilled, is strong during the short intensive building season, and men can bargain for the best jobs. The Big Horn area offers little to attract workers. The nearest settlement, Nordegg, is a company town (coal) which has no facilities and no desire to accommodate transients. It must be made worthwhile for the men to stay on the job or the crew will evaporate. The foreman will have to boss the job and also set up and manage an oasis in the wilderness. He is, accordingly, going to be a valuable* and so an expensive man.\n\nC.A.P.C.\n\n* volatile, too.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**MINES and RESOURCES**\n\nDEPARTMENT: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: May 5, 1949.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Stony & Sarcee Indian Agency Trust Account | $2,000.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\n\nJ.

The Indian Superintendent has recommended the hiring of Mr. B. A. Johnson of Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.70 per hour. On writing to Mr. Pugh to check this wage scale, he advised that carpenters' rates at Rocky Mountain House were $1.75 per hour. The site requires that the foreman set up living and boarding quarters for his crew as it is impossible to commute daily to a nearby town.\n\nWould you therefore approve the appointment of Mr. Johnson as foreman-carpenter for the construction of this school at the rate of $1.70 per hour?\n\nDirector.\n\nBFH/TM\n7th May, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Purchase Order 41083\nYour File: 91368-4-3\n\nThe above was issued to Mr. Charles Bruce for materials to construct the Big Horn Indian Day School.

We are now advised by Superintendent Pugh that Mr. Bruce cannot supply the cement.\n\nSuperintendent Pugh requests that 360 bags of cement be ordered direct from the Canadian Cement Company for delivery at their Exshaw plant.

House.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBIGHORN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL - Alberta.\n\nIncluded in our 1949/50 Estimates is the sum of $8,000.00 to complete the erection of a one-room school and teacherage on the Bighorn Indian Reserve, near Rocky Mountain House, Alberta.\n\nDue to the isolation of the school, we are erecting it of logs which have been cut by the Indians during the winter months. The Indian Superintendent has recommended the hiring of Mr. B. A. Johnson of Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.70 per hour. On writing to Mr. Pugh to check this wage scale, he advised that carpenters' rates at Rocky Mountain House were $1.75 per hour. The site requires that the foreman set up living and boarding quarters for his crew as it is impossible to commute daily to a nearby town.\n\nWould you therefore approve the appointment of Mr. Johnson as foreman-carpenter for the construction of this school at the rate of $1.70 per hour?\n\nApproved,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 12, 1949.\n\nCanada Cement Company,\nCanada Cement Building,\nPhillips Square, Montreal.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttn: Mr. G.A.

Viewed the gravel pit, and arranged for the gravel hauling with the Indians of the Reserve, so they started on this work today.\n\nMr. Johnson is moving into the site on Monday next, and will take with him a Carpenter and Logmen (2), who will commence raising the logs and sawing work. Mr. Johnson will commence the excavation work, with Indian labour. In order to start the Indians off on the gravel it was necessary to purchase four gravel shovels and two picks, these we procure from the Beaver Colleries as there are no other than Company stores at Morley.\n\nWe have requested Mr. Bruce to move in his material for foundation work, at the beginning of the week. In checking the footings for these two buildings, and our bill of material for the concrete work, we notice that no re-inforcing rods were provided for, and bolts for tying the first round of logs to the concrete, and this material we have ordered through the retail store of the Marshall Wells Co. at Rocky Mountain House, and consist of 700 lineal feet of rod and 40 bolts & nuts, all of 5/8\" size, the cost of the rods will approximate $100.00, and the bolts, approximately $4.50. Accounts will be rendered for the above material, and requisitions are attached herewith, which we would ask be approved by the Purchasing Agent for purchase locally from the above Company.\n\nRequisitions for the gravel shovels and picks are also attached, and the same request to cover their purchase is made.\n\nWe also purchased for delivery to the site, some dimension material for gravel hauling as the Indians has no other means of hauling gravel, and the plank will be used for scaffold work after gravel hauling is finished.

Mr Johnson and Mr Thomas our Assistant at Rocky Mountain House, had procured two very good log men, and the following progress is reported upon.\n\nExcavations well under way,\nConcrete forms for school completed.\nAll gravel at site.\nOne half of the logs, stripped of inside peeling, and inside faces hewed on about half the logs, this work was being done in excellent shape, and the hewing of inside of the logs to even 10\", will make the stripping of the inside walls when in place, a simplified matter.\nResidence basement was being dug, and the pump had been set on the casing in this basement, this is being so constructed, that ready access can be had to the pump if required.\nMr Johnson was clearing the site of all excavation rock and dirt as this work proceeded, to which we agreed. He is using all Indian labour on the excavation and clearing of site.\nThey anticipated pouring the school foundations Tuesday last.\nAll material for the above foundation work had been delivered to the site by Mr C Bruce of Rocky Mountain House, including the cement which was obtained through the kindness of Mr Sturrock of the Brazeau Collieries at Nordegg, and Mr Bruce will clear their account.\n\nBeing in remote district, some organization was necessary to set up a camp, and this Mr Johnson undertook. He is boarding the crew and all in tents, and we allowed the use of flooring for the tents, which will be used to top the building to used for the school children's horses at the site.\n\nover.\nWhen requesting delivery from Mr Bruce of the foundation material, and after consultation with Mr Johnson, we asked that the cement flue blocks be delivered, so that this could be carried up through the two buildings on a cement foundation, and while we placed bricks and flue linings in the requisition sent forward for the completion of this building, these can be eliminated when taking delivery of that purchase order. We believe that as there is no furnace in either buildings that the cement block chimneys will be entirely satisfactory.\n\nAs the crew are now well on their way in this work, may we ask if the requisition sent forward for the balance of the material could be expedited, please. We would hesitate to lay off the crew for want of this material, hence our request to ask that this be treated urgently, through the office of the Purchasing Agent.\n\nMight we also point out that should we have rain the roads to the site might also hold up the job, if the material is delayed. You no doubt noted that we requested prices at site, feeling that the Company who were awarded the tender, would be in a better position to truck this material, than us having to arrange same through remote control from this office.\n\nMay we be advised by Air Mail or Army Signal to Mr. G. H. Gooderham, what progress has been made towards the delivery of the above material.\n\nJohn A. Pugh, Supt.\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agency.\nOttawa June 13, 1949,\n\nMr. G.H.

It is anticipated that the school logs will be in place by the end of this week. This appears to be a good job, with the cement foundation down on rock with a two foot base tapering to 12\" as planned.\n\nResidence:- The excavation was complete was the basement, and the crew were readying the forms for concrete pouring. This work proved somewhat expensive, due entirely to the formation we found below ground, this being old river bed, full of rock of all sizes, and a manual and team job from the beginning. Had the writer known that the entire underground was rock and shale as thought this would have not been undertaken, however it is now done, and actually is a requirement at this remote place.\n\nMr Johnson felt that he would have this basement finished by the end of this week, when the log men can move over to this building.\n\nWe have prepared a CREDIT VOUCHER covering labour costs up to the week ending June 11th last, which covers labour on the work up to this point, and includes all excavation work, gravel hauling, from river to site, making of forms and placing for the school, preparation of logs before erection, this consisting of cleaning logs of gum spots, tapering to desired width of 10\", and some clearing work on site.\n\nFrom the Credit voucher it will noted we have expended the sum of $1257.90, leaving a balance of $742.10 in this account, and it will be necessary to ask for a further accountable cheque for the framing work after the logs are in place, and it is desired to ask if this can be submitted at an early date, and the suggested amount is $2000.00.\n\n(over)\nThe Assistant at Rocky Mountain House Agency who is completing the payrolls etc., has sufficient for approximately three weeks work, and we would appreciate receiving the requested further amount prior to that time.\n\nWe have not as yet received any indication as to whom has been awarded the tender for the framing material, and we trust that this will be expedited, in order to keep the crew at work, and they will be ready for roofing material about the end of the month.\n\nThe writer feels satisfied with the progress of the work on this project, and while under a certain amount of remote control, we think Mr. Johnson is doing a good job, under certain difficulties experienced in the excavations.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn E.

B. F. Neary,\n\nEnclosed herewith, please find Voucher No 313, in the amount of $570.90, in favour of Mr R Kingsep, of Eckville, P.P.O., Alberta, covering the drilling of a well at the Big Horn School, on the Big Horn Indian Reserve, Nordegg, Alta.\n\nIt will be observed that the account exceeds $500.00, this being due to the handicap that Mr Kingsep was under, while drilling this well. Road conditions were abnormal, and as a result, he burned out his truck motor, which occasioned several trips into Nordegg. Conditions for living at the Reserve in a tent were not acceptable and therefore Mr Kingsep travelled to and from Nordegg to the well site, a distance of approximately 17 miles one way.\n\nThe writer was fully aware of the above conditions, which were unforeseen, and in view of all the circumstances, we have no hesitancy in recommending the paying of this account, recognizing that it will be necessary to obtain authorization of the account.\n\nThe supply of water is good, and the pumping unit in good order.\n\nJohn M.
