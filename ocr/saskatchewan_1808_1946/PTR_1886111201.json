John McLean, Bishop of Manitoba, which took place at Bishop's Court, a few minutes before noon on Sunday last, the 7th inst. Decoan had been for some time previous to his death afflicted with Bright's disease of the kidney, which had prevented him from making a trip throughout his diocese and the accident which happened to him at Edmonton was the cause of his death. When he arrived from Edmonton he was very low, but it was hoped that with good care he would recover. Fate, however, decided otherwise.\n\nIt was scarcely more than midway on life's pathway, nor had Bishop Mclean been long years to lay down his pilgrim's staff.\n\nIn his death the Anglican church of the Northwest loses a zealous and persistent worker whose labors included an eloquent preaching, and the Town of Prince Albert one of its best, if not its best, friend. To Mrs. Mclean and the other members of her family we tender our sincerest sympathy, and in doing so we assure them only echo the sentiments of all who knew them and by their mention to all those who had the pleasure of the acquaintance of the late prelate.\n\nThis week we are unable to do more in the way of a sketch of the life of the deceased than quote from a letter to be found in Morgan's Annual, but next week we hope to be able to refer at length to his life and labors in the Northwest.\n\n[The Rt. Rev. John Mclean was a native of Scotland, and was born at Pertham on the 17th of November, 1821. He took the degree of M. A. at the University of Aberdeen in 1851, and in 1856 was ordained deacon, and in 1858 was made curate of St. Paul's, London, Ont., where he remained eight years, when he was appointed first Bishop of Australia, and Rector of the Cathedral and Warden and Divinity Professor of St. John's College, Rupert's Land. The doctorate of divinity (honoris causa) was conferred on him in 1871, and D.D. in the same year. In 1871 he was appointed Bishop of Manitoba, and six years afterwards he founded Emmanuel College, of which he was Warden and Divinity Prof.]\nTERRITORIAL NEWS\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nThe Edmonton School Board has cleared all liabilities and now has $700 in hand.\n\nThe new school building will be ready for occupancy next fall.\n\nThe Edmonton Fire Department has purchased two new fire engines.\n\nThe Edmonton Chamber of Commerce has approved the construction of a new city hall.\n\nCALGARY.\n\nThe Calgary Herald reports that the city's population has grown by 10% since last year.\n\nThe Calgary Stampede has been cancelled due to the poor weather conditions.\n\nThe Calgary Exhibition and Stampede will be held from July 25th to August 4th.\n\nThe Calgary Zoo has opened its new aquarium.\n\nThe Calgary Public Library has added over 1,000 new books to its collection.\n\nThe Calgary Police Department has arrested a man for shoplifting.\n\nThe Calgary Fire Department has responded to over 100 emergency calls this week.\n\nThe Calgary Chamber of Commerce has approved the construction of a new convention center.\n\nThe Calgary Stampede has been cancelled due to the poor weather conditions.\n\nThe Calgary Exhibition and Stampede will be held from July 25th to August 4th.\n\nThe Calgary Zoo has opened its new aquarium.\n\nThe Calgary Public Library has added over 1,000 new books to its collection.\n\nThe Calgary Police Department has arrested a man for shoplifting.\n\nThe Calgary Fire Department has responded to over 100 emergency calls this week.\n\nThe Calgary Chamber of Commerce has approved the construction of a new convention center.\n\nFOR GENTLEMEN'S FURNISHINGS!\n\nIN ALL BRANCHES\n\nFOR White Cotton,\n\nFactory Cotton,\n\nFlannels,\n\nSheetin\n\nDress Goods,\n\nSilks,\n\nLinen, etc.\n\nGO TO J.

The motion was carried almost unanimously. Mr. Breda bill requesting illegitimate children.\n\nThe motion of Dr. Wilson was added to the committee on schools and finance, and that of Col. Irvine to those on miscellaneous subjects and papers.\n\nMr. Maclean moved the adjournment, and the question being put, that the civil justice committee expect to get the jurisdiction through the proper hands and at the proper agency, by the adjournment of the session.

He thought the license of the Northwest was of a very low order.\n\nMr. Cowburn introduced a bill to legalize a license by law of Qu'Appelle.\n\nMr. Reid objected to many bills which had been in connection with the railroads for the support of illegitimate children, and he asked that it be allowed to stand.\n\nCol. Richardson moved the committee in the name of the council, to consider the civil justice ordinance, or public notice act. After a few clauses had been passed, Mr. McLeod raised the objection that the bill would not work satisfactorily, and they were only losing time going on with it in its present shape. He proposed that the committee consider the bill printed as they intended to present it, and then the council would be able to deal with it intelligently. He moved that the committee rise and go to Portage.\n\nThe council adjourned about three o'clock.\n\nMr. Hayter Reid's bill has been moved on the committee. The report of the naval committee has been received, and two others added which provide that \"other evidence than that of the mother as to the defendant being the father of the child shall be necessary,\" and \"no action shall be brought after the expiration of six months from the date of the birth of the child.\" The third reading has been deferred.\n\nMr. Hughes will ask the council to consider a resolution asking the Government to erect a bridge across the South Saskatchewan near Saskatoon, for the benefit of the Long Branch and Saskatchewan Railway.
