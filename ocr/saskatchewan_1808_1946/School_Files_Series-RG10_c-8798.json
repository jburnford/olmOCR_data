For a number of years, Catholic pupils have attended a white school in the village of Oka and the tuition fee of $5.00 per month per pupil has been paid by the department. The attached memorandum submitted by the Oka School Board reveals that the residents of Oka are urgently in need of additional school accommodation and that it is the intention of the School Board to provide this accommodation by the erection of a new school building during the summer of 1947. Unless accommodation can be secured in this building when erected for Indian children, the department will be called upon to erect an additional Indian day school at Oka for the accommodation of Roman Catholic pupils. The two Indian day schools at this agency - one in the village and one on the reserve - are operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nI hesitate to recommend a $25,000.00 grant by the Government for the erection of the new school building, nor am I sure that we have statutory authority to make such a grant. It would be unwise, in my judgment, to become too closely linked up with the provincial educational authorities in the erection of public or separate schools. Such action on our part might lead to...\nlead to constitutional complications - education as usually understood, being the sole responsibility of provincial governments. I would recommend, however, subject to the approval of the Minister, that we enter into an agreement with the Oka School Board for a fifteen-year period whereby we shall allow a tuition grant at the rate of $60.00 per pupil per annum and that this grant be paid quarterly, in the same manner as residential schools' grants are now paid and that the Secretary of the School Board at Oka be so notified.\n\nApproved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\n13th February 1947.\n\n17 x 60 = 1020\nLa Commission Scolaire d'Oka\n\nEducational Facilities for Indians of Oka Agency\n\nPlease find attached the proposals made concerning a grant of $25,000 towards the building of your new school.

Fi. 1182.\nMiss Therese Cree of Oka, aged 17, accompanied by her mother recently applied for a grant in order to enable her to attend the Institut Marguerite d'Youville Montreal, Que., in order to take up nursing. Therese attended the Ecole Normale of Montreal and was quite successful in her studies. She applied to Hospitals in order to be taken as a student nurse but could not be accepted owing to her age. The minimum being 18 years old. She was then advised to enter the above institution where she would get the best advanced training for the profession she intends to take.\n\nYou will find herewith some correspondence between Therese and the Institut Marguerite d'Youville. Also some prospectus which have been sent, giving details as to the curriculum and the price of the courses together with that of the board.\n\nYou will note that the cost of the studies would be of $205.00 and that of the board of $35.00 per month, for a total of $555.00 for the 10 months.\n\nThis amount is rather prohibitive if we take into consideration the fact that the parents would be unable to contribute in the amount of $100.00 only.\n\nPlease let me have your comments in this case.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant with reference to request of Miss Therese Cree for a tuition grant of $455.00.\n\nIn the first paragraph of your letter you state that Miss Cree attended Ecole Normale and it is inferred that she is qualified to teach school. If so, it is felt that she should teach for a year or so and save some of her salary in order to assist her to take the additional course.\n\nWe have very many applications this year for tuition grants and funds at our disposal will not permit us making the very large grant requested by Miss Cree.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe parents of Marie Laure Simon an Oka indian girl, who attended the Convent of St-Tustache, Que., for the past three years have applied for a further grant of $150.00 to enable Marie Laure to attend the Normal School at Montreal.\n\nThis girl has done very well at St-Tustache and the Principal is recommending her for higher studies as she intends to become a teacher. She has finished her tenth year which is the highest grade taught at the above institution.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the grant requested be given as this girl quite deserving.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. Frs. Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant, the Department will allow a grant of $150. for the coming academic year to enable Marie Laure Simon to attend normal school at Montreal.\n\nBernard F.

Brisebois, Indian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nI had a visit this morning from Mrs. Henri Vincent of Oka.\n\nShe states that she spoke to you July last with reference to her two children, Raymond and Jean. The former has been placed in a school where the cost of $34.00 a month and the latter in a school where the cost is $19.00 a month.\n\nMrs. Vincent informed me that she is a widow and receives a pension but did not state the amount of the pension nor from whom she receives it. She expressed the opinion that the Department should pay at least half the cost of the two children's education in the schools at which they have been placed.\n\nI pointed out to her that this matter should have been brought to our attention either in July or August. I also reminded her that in paying a pension it was the intention to enable a widowed mother to maintain her home.

Mrs. Cree stated that she saved the sum of $200.00 towards the payment of the tuition and board of Therese and requested a similar amount from the Branch if at all possible.\n\nCommunication with the Institut revealed that Therese, who is taking a special course to prepare her to take up nursing, is not only a good pupil but an exceptionally good one who has obtained the highest marks regularly.\n\nOwing to the above circumstances I would kindly ask you to take her case into consideration it being understood that no further help will be asked after this year as she will enter a Hospital for her nursing course which she could not do this year being a younger than the minimum age required.\n\n/ year /\n\n(Frs.

Richard, Jr., is hired to take them to and from the Country what he is doing with a light truck when the roads are opened and with a team and sleigh when the roads are closing.\n\nMr. Richard is using an ordinary uncovered sleigh which he owns. However when the wind is high and in cold weather younger children do not attend or miss more school than they should on account of lack of proper equipment.\n\nWe have found a completely covered sleigh (double) which was formerly used to transport the Professors to and from the Agricultural College at a price of $35.00. This sleigh is in fair condition and would meet our requirements. It is considered that this acquisition would improve the transportation of the children.\n\nPlease let me know if this purchase can be made. It is understood that in the event of Richard discontinuing to transport the children to the Schools that the above would remain our property.\n\n(Frs.

Brother Director  \nSt. Joseph High School  \nBerthierville, P.Q.  \nTel. Berthierville 10\n\nDuring the summer: Rev. A. Brodeur, c.s.v.  \n16 Main Street  \nP. O. Box 91  \nForestdale, R.I.  \nTel. Woonsocket\nAFFILIATION\n\nIn establishing and maintaining the plan of affiliation, the authorities of the CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA have especially in mind the first part of Article 71, Section 2, of the Statutes of the University as approved by the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities. This article reads: \"Colleges, Seminaries, and other Catholic Institutions may, without prejudice to their autonomy, be affiliated to the University by the Rector and the Academic Senate, upon the fulfillment of conditions to be prescribed by said Rector and Senate.\"\n\nCertain minimum requirements are necessary for the proper maintenance of an institution of any kind, but the main emphasis is placed on the administrators' understanding of the purpose of their foundation as a Catholic institution, on their zeal, and on the resources at their command to enable the institution to attain the aims proposed.\n\nSYSTEM OF EDUCATION\n\nSaint Joseph High is under the administration of the Clerics of Saint Viator (C.S.V.), a body of religious teachers who devote themselves to the work of Catholic education. This Congregation founded a century ago, is international in scope, conducting all types of schools in Belgium, France, Spain, China, Canada and the United States. Into the history of the success of Saint Joseph's have gone the experiences of men consecrated to the work of education in various parts of the world during the past hundred years.\n\nThe atmosphere and environment of the School, the planning of each day's program, the daily companionship of vigorous manly boys, and the associations with men whose lives are devoted to school work, are indispensable factors in the preparation of a boy for higher education. The advantages of these factors and many others are offered by the School for the benefit of the student during his high school days.\nRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION\n\nHowever important the mental development of a student may be, his moral development is of still greater importance. Without a conscience, an educated man is a menace to society. Religious education which alone can develop and strengthen the will and induce good habits, is of prime importance at Saint Joseph's. In addition to the formal courses in Religion covering the whole field of Christian Dogma and Morals, obligatory on all students, Holy mass is celebrated daily in the students' Chapel; Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, Devotions to the Sacred Heart and to Our Blessed Lady, and other liturgical functions are held at frequent intervals. Moreover the Sodalities which function in the School and the Catholic Action Movement aim at developing a spirit of virile piety in the students.\n\nPERSONAL INTEREST\n\nSt. Joseph's looks upon its course of instruction and its system of discipline as only secondary to its chief aim\u2014the formation of good character. The Faculty do not isolate themselves from the boys. The relations between them are personal. An atmosphere of frankness and manliness between the students and the Faculty gives to the school an invaluable aid for successful work. Character training is not confined to school hours. On the athletic field, in the clubs, in study, in the library, in every activity the program of personal attention and mutual approach to problems is carried on the develop interests apart from their lessons. They meet minds more mature than their own. They are made to realize that they have a share of responsibility in their character development. In these personal contacts, judgment and good habits are consolidated to mold the men of tomorrow.\n\nGUIDANCE\n\nEducational, vocational and spiritual guidance are featured as an integral part of the educational program at Saint Joseph's. Spiritual counsel is imparted by the Chaplains. The head Chaplain supervises the religious activities of the Student Body. Educational guidance is available to the student at all times. Vocational guidance is available upon request. All students are required to participate in a testing program which furnishes Counselors with data for educational and vocational guidance. Standard tests are used in this program.\n\nPRINCIPLES, AIMS, IDEALS\n\nSAINT JOSEPH'S is a boarding school for Franco-American students. The principles underlying the system of education functioning at SAINT JOSEPH'S are based on the solid philosophy of the Catholic Church which makes up the basis of all education. In upholding these principles ST JOSEPH'S subscribes to the belief that education in its truest sense is not merely intellectual achievement, but the development of every phase in a boy's life \u2014 the training of his soul, mind and body.\n\nTo attain its scolastic aims, SAINT JOSEPH HIGH endeavors to develop habits of industry and accuracy in study, a high regard for scholarship, and the spirit of willingness to conquer difficulties through perseverance. Every effort is made to promote health and physical development. Throughout the year the boys participate in all kinds of organized athletic sports and games under the supervision of capable directors. Moral training is secured by imparting a knowledge of religious truth, by developing a high regard for the gifts of faith, and by instilling the principles of Christian virtues.\n\nThe boys of SAINT JOSEPH'S must have lofty ideals in order to adjust themselves to the norm set by the principles and aims of the school.\n\nIt is through such channels that SAINT JOSEPH HIGH hopes to guide its students by providing those moral, mental and physical standards which successfully prepare them not merely for higher education but for life itself.\n\nLOCATION, ACCOMMODATIONS\n\nSaint Joseph's is located at Berthierville, along the St. Lawrence River, fifty miles north of Montreal, on the highway to Quebec. Its location is easy of access either by train, bus or ferry. The School accommodates three hundred resident students. The cafeteria and laundry services are taken care of by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Ottawa. The Board of Underwriters have fully approved the modern alarm and fire sprinklers systems. A physician is attached to the School and may be consulted at any hour of the day. Consulting specialists and convenient hospital service are close at hand.\nREGULATIONS GOVERNING ADMISSION\n\nCandidates for admission to the Freshman Class must be graduates of an approved grammar school and present a certificate of admission to high school. The record of the candidate's scholastic achievement ought to be on file before registration. A knowledge of the French language is not required of the applicant, but the study of French is a requirement in the four years of high school.\n\nADMISSION TO ADVANCED STANDING\n\nStudents who apply for the upper classes must present a transcript of their high school record with an official statement of honorable dismissal. Credit will be reckoned according to St. Joseph's curricular requirements and the certificating grades of the institution from which transfer is made.\n\nRegulations Governing Scholastic Standing\n\nGrades are determined monthly on the basis of supervised written tests. Also written examinations are given at the end of terms. Final grades are calculated by combining the monthly test marks with the examination mark of the end of term. The passing grade is 60%. Recommendations are not issued to students in any subject in which they have not achieved a grade of 70%.\n\nCREDITS\n\nThe school year is made up of two semesters, each of eighteen weeks. One credit in one subject implies an aggregate of 120 hours of class work in that subject. Half credits may be granted for one semester of work. No credit is given for an incomplete semester. Sixteen credits are required for graduation.\n\nPROMOTION\n\nTo be promoted to a higher class, the student at St. Joseph's must obtain a general final average of 60%, on the monthly and final examinations.\n\nDIPLOMAS\n\nThe Saint Joseph High Diploma is awarded to the graduate who fulfills all the requirements of the School and obtains a good average in Fourth Year High at St. Joseph's.\n\nThe present plan of affiliation does not require the taking of formal examinations from the University. A secondary school Diploma is however issued by the University to those students in the senior class who have fulfilled the requirements of the School and, in addition thereto, pass successfully comprehensive examinations in seven subjects, namely: Religion, English, Algebra, Geometry, French or Latin, History and a Natural Science. Students are not considered as candidates to the above University examinations unless they obtain an average of sixty percent on those subjects during the months prior to the taking of the examinations.\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS\n\nScholarship grants are for a period of one year. Information about available scholarships may be obtained by writing to the Director of Scholarships.\n\nDISCIPLINE\n\nThe educational system at Saint Joseph's aims at the formation of character. Accordingly, the Discipline is considerate but firm especially when the reputation of the student body or the School is concerned. Matters of discipline are supervised by the Prefect of Discipline.\nDISMISSAL\n\nThe Administration reserves the right to dismiss at any time a student who refuses to comply with the regulations of the School.\n\nOUTFIT\n\nThe school outfit is loaned for the year. This is to be worn on special occasions only. The student may wear any color suit. A suit coat must always be worn in chapel. The wearing of overalls and dungarees is prohibited.\n\nBoarders must be provided with an overcoat, heavy underwear for the winter, pyjamas, overshoes and rubbers, towels, soap, mirror, comb, toothbrush and other toilet articles. All clothes should be marked with the student's name and enrollment number.\n\nSTUDENT EXPENSES\n\nAfter the student has been notified that he has been accepted for enrollment, he will be required to make registration. A fee of $5.00 is payable at the time of this registration. All fees are to be paid in advance, upon receiving a monthly invoice sent by the Bursar. The Administration reserves the right to suspend any student whose parents do not fulfill the obligation of paying fees at the prescribed time. To obtain transfers, reports, promotion certificates or diplomas, all financial indebtedness must be settled with the School.\n\nAt the Beginning of each Scholastic Year\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Registration Fee                          | $5.00  |\n| Rent of textbooks in high school          | $4.00  |\n| Rent of textbooks in grammar school       | $4.00  |\n| Various workbooks, each                   | $1.00  |\n| Loan of school outfit                    | $5.00  |\n\nPer Month\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Tuition in high school                    | $10.00 |\n| Tuition in grammar school                 | $9.00  |\n| Board, Lodging, Laundry, Mending          | $3.00  |\n| Piano or Violin lessons                   | $3.00  |\n| Cornet, Saxophone or other Instruments    | $2.00  |\n| School Band Membership                    | $1.00  |\n\nSPECIAL FEES\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Infirmary service, per day                | $.25   |\n| Locker fee and loan of key for the year   | $.50   |\n| High school graduation fees (diplomas)    | $3.00  |\n| Grammar school graduation fees (diploma)  | $1.00  |\n| Catholic University examinations, each    | $.25   |\n\nNo refund will be made for board and tuition, except if the student is absent more than two weeks in succession.\n\nA substantial reduction may be obtained if two brothers attend the School at the same time.\n\nThe months of September, December, January and June are payable in full.\n\nTotal $365.00\n## COURSES OF INSTRUCTION IN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n**COURSE A** is preparatory for B.A. and Pre-Medical.\n\n**COURSE B** is preparatory for B.Sc. and B.

It is therefore helpful to the student to participate in these activities to the extent that his scholastic standing will allow.\n\nTHE CLASS COUNCILS\n\nThe Class Councils, composed of the President and other Officers, meet at various intervals during the year. The purpose of this organization is to awaken and sustain a spirit of humanity and loyalty in the school activities; to promote better understanding among students and between the teachers and the students; to encourage student endeavor; to provide for the loyal observance of the school tradition; to achieve wholesome observance of disciplinary regulations, and to assist incoming students to incorporate themselves into the class body.\n\nEXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\n\nFour types of extra-curricular activities are recognized and four types of student organizations are represented in the following list.\n\nSpiritual Activities: The Guard of Honor of the Sacred Heart.

En 1847, un rameau de l'arbre \u00e9tait plant\u00e9 dans le sol f\u00e9cond du Canada o\u00f9 il pourra cro\u00eetre vigoureusement; plus tard il r\u00e9pandit son ombre bienfaisante sur divers \u00c9tats de la R\u00e9publique voisine.\n\nBUT \u2014 Sanctification personnelle, enseignement, service des saints autels.\n\nOEUVRES \u2014 \u00c9coles primaires et sup\u00e9rieures, coll\u00e8ges commerciaux, coll\u00e8ges classiques, Institution des sourds-muets, \u00e9coles d'agriculture, orphelinats, minist\u00e8re paroissial, maison de retraites ferm\u00e9es, pr\u00e9dication, missions en pays infid\u00e8les.\n\nMAISONS DE FORMATION \u2014 Juvenats, Noviciats, Scolasticat de th\u00e9ologie, \u00c9cole normale, \u00e9tudes universitaires.\n\nLes Soeurs du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de J\u00e9sus\n\nLes Religieuses du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de J\u00e9sus ont la direction de la cuisine, de la couture et des r\u00e9fectoires du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph, \u00e0 Berthierville.\n\nLes Soeurs du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur ont des maisons dans les dioc\u00e8ses d'Ottawa, de Montr\u00e9al, de Mont-Laurier, de Pembroke, de Joliette et de St-Jean de Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nLa Maison Provinciale, \u00e0 Ottawa, comprend aussi le Noviciat et le Pensionnat. Dans ce pensionnat, se donnent les cours bilingues de la province d'Ontario. Les \u00e9l\u00e8ves y sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9es aux examens d'entr\u00e9e de \"Lower,\" \"Middle\" et \"Upper School.\" Chaque ann\u00e9e aussi plusieurs jeunes musiciennes y obtiennent des dipl\u00f4mes de l'Institut P\u00e9dagogique de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\u00c0 Saint-Hubert (Chambly), les Soeurs du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de J\u00e9sus ont leur \u00c9cole Normale et un Pensionnat o\u00f9 se donnent les cours de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nFormer les jeunes filles aux usages de la bonne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et aux pratiques de la vie chr\u00e9tienne demeure le principal souci de ces \u00e9ducatrices.\nSITE\n\nSur la route nationale qui relie Montr\u00e9al, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et Qu\u00e9bec, face aux \u00eeles du lac St-Pierre, Berthierville d\u00e9ploie sa vie fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 travers un treillis de vieux ormes. Ce joli centre r\u00e9gional attire, retient et repose voyageurs et touristes.\n\nLa plus importante de ses institutions d'enseignement, le Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph occupe une vaste propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9glise et de la place publique, \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e du \"chemin du roi\". C'est un \u00e9difice b\u00e2ti en 1884. Mais le plan pr\u00e9voyait deux annexes au corps central. La derni\u00e8re, de date r\u00e9cente jouit de toutes les am\u00e9liorations modernes : chapelle, salles de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, d'\u00e9tude, de classe, de douches, dortoirs et studios, autant de pi\u00e8ces spacieuses, claires, ventil\u00e9es, qui r\u00e9pondent aux moindres exigences de l'hygi\u00e8ne.\n\nQuant \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation, les visiteurs l'admirent sans r\u00e9serve. Un terrain de cinq arpents est am\u00e9nag\u00e9 pour les \u00e9bats, la gaiet\u00e9, les agr\u00e9ments de l'esprit; de puissants r\u00e9flecteurs permettent de l'utiliser aux r\u00e9cr\u00e9ations du soir. Rien n'y manque : pelouses, haie d'arbustes, plates-bandes, promontoires, losanges et filets de balle-au-camp, jeux de paume et de tennis, estrades, abreuvoirs, etc. La vie \u00e9coli\u00e8re y jouit d'une saine libert\u00e9; tout y favorise la discipline des muscles et l'exercice des vertus sociales.\n\nCOURS D'ETUDES\n\nNotre cours d'\u00e9tudes comprend deux divisions enti\u00e8rement distinctes:\n\n1\u2014LE COURS SUPERIEUR BILINGUE suit le programme trac\u00e9 par le Conseil de l'Instruction Publique pour les cours sup\u00e9rieurs, \u00e0 base scientifique et litt\u00e9raire.\n\nLangue fran\u00e7aise. \u2014 Les autorit\u00e9s du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph se font un devoir d'accorder \u00e0 la langue fran\u00e7aise la place qui lui revient de droit: la premi\u00e8re.

Par l'Arch-\nconfr\u00e9rie de la Garde d'Honneur, notre jeunesse veut b\u00e9n\u00e9fi-\ncier largement de ces promesses, et la grande faveur que re-\n\u00e7oit cette Association chez les Clercs de Saint-Viateur ne sur-\nprend personne quand on sait que son premier promoteur\ndans toute l'Am\u00e9rique n'est autre que le regrette P\u00e8re Cy-\nrille Beaudry, c.s.v., grand ap\u00f4tre du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur et de la\nCommunion quotidienne.\n\nAu Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph, les membres de la Garde d'Hon-\nneur se r\u00e9unissent le vendredi soir pour m\u00e9diter sur les pro-\nmesses du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, ou pour discuter les diff\u00e9rents as-\npects de cette d\u00e9votion; ils la font ainsi entrer peu \u00e0 peu dans\nleur vie quotidienne par la pratique de l'heure de garde\"\njournali\u00e8re. De plus, ils expriment dans un colloque intime\nleurs aspirations, les d\u00e9sirs et les besoins de chacun. C'est ainsi\nque ces jeunes, en plus de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un d\u00e9sir pressant de J\u00e9-\nsus de le consoler dans son Divin Coeur \"bless\u00e9\" et qui deman-\nde \"r\u00e9paration\", tendent \u00e0 s'assurer la r\u00e9alisation de cette au-\ntre promesse: \"Je serai leur refuge assur\u00e9 pendant la vie et\nsurtout \u00e0 la mort.\"\n\nLA CONFRERIE DES SAINTS-ANGES\n\nAvec la d\u00e9votion au Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, par la Garde d'Hon-\nneur la d\u00e9votion aux Saints-Anges Gardiens est une autre d\u00e9-\nvotion ch\u00e8re aux Clercs de Saint-Viateur qui publient en\nFrance une revue de cette honneur.\n\nS'appuyant sur des textes de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Tes-\ntament, de m\u00eame que sur l'enseignement de l'Eglise, une Con-\nfr\u00e9rie a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e pour d\u00e9velopper la d\u00e9votion de ces c\u00e9les-\ntes Protecteurs chez les jeunes de qui Notre-Seigneur disait\n\"que leurs Anges voient sans cesse la face du P\u00e8re\".\nEn notre Coll\u00e8ge, cette Confr\u00e9rie des Anges Gardiens recrute presque tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves des classes inf\u00e9rieures. Chaque lundi, le samediier r\u00e9unit \u00e0 la chapelle les membres pour r\u00e9citer l'office ou faire quelques consid\u00e9rations sur ces Saints Protecteurs.\n\nVers la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, tous les membres se rendent en p\u00e8lerinage au sanctuaire des Saints-Anges, au Juv\u00e9nat de Berthierville, afin de rendre \u00e0 leur c\u00e9leste protecteur un juste tribut d'hommage et de reconnaissance pour les gr\u00e2ces nombreuses qu'ils ont obtenues par leur intercession et les bons offices qu'ils ont remplis aupr\u00e8s d'eux.\n\nL'ACTION CATHOLIQUE\n\nDans notre Coll\u00e8ge, il n'y a pas que des Associations qui tendent \u00e0 la sanctification personnelle; une impulsion constante est donn\u00e9e aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour les amener \u00e0 penser aux autres, \u00e0 se d\u00e9vouer pour le bien commun et pour la bonne sant\u00e9 morale de leur milieu. D\u00e9j\u00e0 l'id\u00e9e d'apostolat leur est enseign\u00e9e par le moyen de l'Action Catholique. Dans les directives papales et \u00e9piscopales sur ce sujet, on insiste sur l'importance de former l'enfant, l'\u00e9tudiant, au r\u00f4le qu'il devra jouer plus tard comme catholique dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nAussi avons-nous dans notre maison une section bien vivante de la Jeunesse Etudiante Catholique. Les dirigeants, \u00e0 leur r\u00e9union hebdomadaire, se forcent de se p\u00e9n\u00e9trer du programme qui leur est assign\u00e9 pour ensuite le faire passer chez les coll\u00e8gues, dans les jeux, la discipline ou l'\u00e9tude. Leur action est si r\u00e9elle qu'ils r\u00e9ussissent, \u00e0 chaque premi\u00e8re, \u00e0 faire participer tous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves \u00e0 une grande campagne d'une semaine, o\u00f9 chacun y met du sien pour faire ressortir, selon ses moyens, les id\u00e9es principales du programme de l'ann\u00e9e qui s'ach\u00e8ve. Cette Campagne est encadr\u00e9e par une d\u00e9monstration publique dans les rues de la ville; pancartes, chants, discours, chants all\u00e9goriques proclament la volont\u00e9 des jeunes de profiter de leur ann\u00e9e de formation pour pr\u00e9parer une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'ils auront voulu meilleure.\n\nEn plus de procurer des avantages imm\u00e9diats aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves, la Jeunesse Etudiante Catholique contribue \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une mentalit\u00e9 favorable \u00e0 l'Action Catholique tant recommand\u00e9e par les deux derniers Papes, et aussi \u00e0 lui pr\u00e9parer pour un avenir prochain les hommes d'action qu'elle r\u00e9clame.\n\nLES ARTS\n\nL'art est la manifestation du beau; c'est aussi l'interpr\u00e9tation de la nature. O\u00f9 le beau n'est pas en jeu, l'art cesse d'exister; o\u00f9 les proportions, l'harmonie que pr\u00e9sente la nature sont m\u00e9connues, il n'y a plus d'art. L'alt\u00e9ration du sens absolu que doit garder ce mot comporte une id\u00e9e de sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9, d'excellence, ce qui habituellement \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une expression de beaut\u00e9, semblable quand elle rev\u00eat une forme. C'est ainsi que la parole, la peinture, le dessin, le chant, la musique sont des arts, et le Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph s'y int\u00e9resse vivement.\n\nLes Cercles nombreux des litt\u00e9ratures fran\u00e7aise et anglaise, de Jeunes Naturalistes favorisent la ma\u00eetrise de soi en public; des cours r\u00e9guliers de chant de genre d\u00e9veloppent l'imagination et la pr\u00e9cision des \u00e9l\u00e8ves; enfin, la musique vocale est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par deux chorales, et la musique instrumentale par le piano et la fanfare; plus de cent cinquante \u00e9l\u00e8ves b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient des le\u00e7ons de professeurs exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, au service de la jeunesse et de l'art.\n\nLE CERCLE MARSOALAIS\n\nCette organisation litt\u00e9raire porte le nom d'un ancien directeur de notre Coll\u00e8ge. Se perfectionner dans l'art oratoire et acqu\u00e9rir une meilleure personnalit\u00e9, voil\u00e0 le double but de ce cercle. A cette fin, ses membres \u00e9tudient, lisent et dramatisent des extraits des meilleurs auteurs fran\u00e7ais et canadiens.\n\nLe Cercle Marsola\u00efs tient ses s\u00e9ances r\u00e9guli\u00e8res tous les quinze jours. Chacun d\u00e9bute par la pri\u00e8re et le chant national. Quelques bois discutent des extraits de leur auteur pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Suit alors les improvisations. Elles sont de deux genres. Les premi\u00e8res, sans pr\u00e9paration, traitent d'un sujet au choix de la \"victime\"; les secondes sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9es. Deux minutes, trois minutes, c'est court! Cependant, que d'impressions, que de craintes accompagnent ces modestes travaux; et aussi, que de ma\u00eetrise de soi ils n\u00e9cessitent. D'autres jours, il y aura des discussions, des lectures, des interviews.\n\nAutant d'occasions pour l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve d'augmenter sa ma\u00eetrise de soi, de soigner sa diction, de se d\u00e9velopper une personnalit\u00e9 brillante et d'acqu\u00e9rir peu \u00e0 peu une saine influence. Seuls les\nLe Cercle des Jeunes Naturalistes\n\nLe Cercle des Jeunes Naturalistes se compte au nombre des Cercles en activit\u00e9 dans notre coll\u00e8ge. S'il est ainsi consid\u00e9r\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, c'est qu'ils ont compris les connaissances vastes et pr\u00e9cieuses qu'il procure \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation.\n\nSon but est de r\u00e9veiller \u00e0 tous ceux qui approfondissent les myst\u00e8res des sciences naturelles, des connaissances particuli\u00e8res des plus attrayantes et des plus r\u00e9elles. Il agrandit ainsi le vaste champ de nos connaissances, ouvre de nouveaux horizons \u00e0 nos esprits et nous montre \u00e0 observer la grandeur et la beaut\u00e9 de la nature d\u00e9ployant sa magnificence devant nos yeux \u00e9veill\u00e9s.\n\nSon programme, presque sans limite, est ainsi des plus vastes. Toutes ses diverses \u00e9tudes se portent sur la nature, qu'il cherche \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler aux jeunes esprits d\u00e9sireux de la connaissance. Un de ses plus grands avantages, est d'instruire en r\u00e9alit\u00e9! En effet, que d'heureuses et captivantes excursions nous procure-t-il pas au printemps, \u00e0 l'automne, presque soudaine des plantes et des insectes? Que d'heures de plaisirs pass\u00e9es dans un sous-bois, \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte et \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des nombreux sp\u00e9cimens de notre merveilleuse flore laurentienne! Que de moments d\u00e9licieux dans la poursuite des petits insectes qui, en un instant, se d\u00e9robent \u00e0 nos yeux, pour r\u00e9appara\u00eetre un instant plus tard...\n\nIl nous invite... Il est attrayant... Faisons nombre \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s!... Profitons de ses nombreux bienfaits.\n\nL'HARMONIE\n\nL'\u00e9tude de la musique instrumentale est attrayante autant qu'elle est utile. Les exercices de fanfare procurent aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves d'int\u00e9ressantes r\u00e9cr\u00e9ations et constituent les premiers pas vers la culture plus compl\u00e8te de cet art.\n\nLA CHORALE\n\nLa musique vocale et le plain chant, enseign\u00e9s pour fins du culte religieux, pr\u00e9parent des auxiliaires aux chorales de nos \u00e9glises paroissiales.\n\n[21]\nLE SPORT\n\nTous les \u00e9l\u00e8ves doivent faire partie d\u2019une \u00e9quipe dans un jeu ou l\u2019autre, selon la saison. Il y en a pour tous les go\u00fbts et tous les temps. \u00c0 l\u2019automne, le rugby et la balle au mur sont \u00e0 l\u2019honneur; les jeux aux r\u00e9cr\u00e9ations du soir, les parties de drap\u00e9au organis\u00e9es entre classes occupent les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. L\u2019hiver, le gourou et le patin l\u2019emportent, mais il y a aussi les \u00e9preuves en raquettes, en skis, et les jeux int\u00e9rieurs o\u00f9 les \u00e9quipes de ping-pong, de badminton, de bilboquet, etc., donnent \u00e0 la salle une bruyante activit\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, la balle au camp devient le sport favori; plusieurs cependant s\u2019adonnent au tennis, \u00e0 la balle au mur, et aux excursions le long du fleuve ou \u00e0 travers champs.\n\nDes parties de rugby, de balle au camp, et de gourou sont organis\u00e9es entre nos \u00e9quipes et celles d\u2019autres coll\u00e8ges. Divers clubs \u00e9trangers se mesurent aux n\u00f4tres soit sur la glace, soit sur le losange...\n\nNotre v\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 fondateur n\u2019\u00e9crivait-il pas : \u201cLes jeux forment le caract\u00e8re, habituent au support mutuel, pr\u00e9parent \u00e0 la vie sociale, font aimer l\u2019\u00e9cole, pr\u00e9viennent le mauvais esprit, dissipent les pens\u00e9es malsaines\u201d.\n\nQuoique le but principal de tous les efforts soit le plein d\u00e9veloppement de leurs facult\u00e9s intellectuelles et morales, n\u00e9anmoins nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves comprennent la parole de Pie XI aux jeunes de Milan : \u201cPratiquez l\u2019Evangile et pratiquez les sports. Ne n\u00e9gligez ni votre \u00e2me ni votre corps.\u201d\n\nLE CORPS DE CADETS\n\nLa discipline est la note caract\u00e9ristique du corps de cadets num\u00e9ro 239 du Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Joseph.\n\nDes cours de gymnastique, de premiers soins aux bless\u00e9s, de signalement avec drapeaux, lampe et appareil d\u2019\u00e9mission Morse sont donn\u00e9s avec succ\u00e8s \u00e0 un groupe consid\u00e9rable de cadets.\n\nLes troph\u00e9es d\u00e9cern\u00e9s \u00e0 nos cadets prouvent l\u2019excellence du travail qu\u2019ils accomplissent.\n\n[22]\n\nL\u2019AMICALE\n\nUne amicale regroupe en association tous les anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves d\u2019un coll\u00e8ge. Elle renoue les liens d\u2019amiti\u00e9 entre camarades diss\u00e9min\u00e9s aux quatre coins du pays par les conditions de la vie.\n\nCes r\u00e9unions, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es par une franche camaraderie, permettent aux membres d\u2019agrandir le cercle de leurs relations sociales, parmi les nombreux \u00e9l\u00e8ves sortis du m\u00eame coll\u00e8ge ayant re\u00e7u la m\u00eame formation, conservant la m\u00eame traditionnelle affection envers l\u2019Alma Mater.\n\nDe cette union intime naissent souvent, en face des d\u00e9ficiences de la vie, des lacunes \u00e0 corriger et des mouvements \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ou \u00e0 maintenir.\n\nSi chaque objet pieux de la chapelle rappelle le souvenir d\u2019un bienfaiteur, d\u2019une bienfaitrice, il faut que nous voitilleurs l\u2019\u0153uvre de nos anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves. La fanfare s\u2019est vu renouveler en une seule fois, tous ses instruments. Les Missions ont eu leur part de g\u00e9n\u00e9reuses contributions, la cour de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation s\u2019est enrichie de solides \u00e9taudes.

School, Oka, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I bring to your attention a few facts that have to do with the Indian children of Oka, who belong to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nAs you are probably aware of, these children attend the Roman Catholic school, and I understand that your department pays to the school board a fee of so much per capita.\n\nLately, the gentlemen of St-Sulpice who owned the school house, sold the same to the school board of Oka for the price of $50,000.00; this building has to be renovated, altered and the board will have to meet the total expenditure including the price of around $60,000.00.\n\nThough a provincial grant has been promised, the school commissioners feel that the burden on their shoulders is still very heavy. Under the circumstances they feel that the dues of fees paid by your department are not in proportion with the cost of education that they have to meet.\nSo I have been requested to ask you for a grant; May I suggest that next week you call me and then make an appointment at your convenience to discuss the matter?\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilippe Valois,\nM.P.,\n(Argenteuil-Deux Montagnes).\n\nPV: AJ\nLA COMMISSION SCOLAIRE D'OKA\n\nOKA, QU\u00c9. 8 octobre 1949.\n\nM.

I suppose the Indian agent at Parry Sound would only \"pass the buck\" so am writing directly to you.\n\nPeople have been telling us that we should go out try to get ahead, being easily taken to prop-\n\nagenda I have gone out to try for myself.\n\nAs we are legally incapable of making any contracts with any business house like the bank to borrow any money, we are that way handicapped.\n\nLet me know what you have in mind, and if I can get a loan from you.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6484, file 42022-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI do not think it will be of much expense to you later on.\n\nOur privileges are limited in the business world; but we cannot remain ignorant of the changes that are happening around us, so we have to try for ourselves.\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nCalvin Mogansh.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Calvin Noganosh in which he states that he is in Toronto attending Shaw's Business School and he requests the Department to allow him tuition fees of $18.00 a month for a period of ten months.\n\nI am impressed with his letter as he states that he is working in order to pay for his board and room. Presumably he is attending business college at night.\n\nPlease let me know the age of this man, also any information regarding his previous education. Would it be possible to ascertain from Shaw's Business School what progress he is making and how long it will take him to complete the course?

He is now attending the Shaw Business School in Toronto, taking a general business course. The school principal advises me that his progress has so far been satisfactory and that he is a hard worker and they expect that he will complete the course satisfactorily. The course takes about ten months to complete and the tuition fees are $18.00 per month.\n\nI understand from the school principal that Calvin Noganosh is at present working for a hotel in Toronto and that there is some chance of him being able to use the education he is now receiving along these same lines of employment.\n\nI have known him personally for a couple of years and he is a steady fellow, for an Indian, and a rather likeable chap, whom I think may do something with any education he receives.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,  \nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDept. of Mines & Resources,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\nSTATEMENT\n\nDec. 11, 1940\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn re: Wilhelmina Vincent's Orphanage,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nTERMS\n\nFor Board and Tuition\nof Edward Sullivan\nfor the months of\nSeptember, October and\nNovember.\n\n$36.00\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO St. Vincent's Orphanage,\nADDRESS Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nDATE SERVICE AMOUNT\nDec. 11 for board and tuition of Edward Sullivan for\nthe months of September, October and November. 36.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and\nthat the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the\nsame is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nAgent\n\nVoucher No. 1409 DATE December 12, 1940.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6484, file 42022-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the Parry Sound Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 13, 1940\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1409,\n\namounting to $35.00 in favour\n\nof St. Vincent's Orphanage, Peterborough Ontario,\n\nfor board and tuition of Edward Sullivan for the months of September, October and November.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6484, file 42022-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nDecember 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to Calvin Noganosh.\n\nOur appropriation for tuition grants is very low and as a consequence I find that only $100.00 can be allowed toward the cost of his tuition.

He obtained High School Entrance and then entered our High School. He has completed five Forms without ever missing a year, and holds, now, a complete Junior Matriculation and complete Senior Matriculation certificate.\n\nHis success is due to earnest daily hard work and application. He has a splendid character,- a high sense of honour, and a personality which, though manifesting a quiet reserve, is nevertheless much admired. He has always been a favourite among the boys.\n\nSister M. Lucretia\n(Principal)\nSt. Peter's School,\nPeterborough, May 26, 1941.\n\nReverend Mother Scholastica,\nSuperior, St. Vincent's Orphanage,\nPeterborough.\n\nDear Mother,-\n\nI am writing you in the interests of Edward Sullivan who is at present under your guardianship at St. Vincent's Orphanage. This boy has, this year, completed his Senior Matriculation Course after five years' High School work.\n\nThere are many opportunities available for me to suggest him as a suitable boy to go on for some higher profession. He is one who will make good use of any opportunity given him. He will, however, need someone to support him, to some extent, during his apprenticeship. It seems too bad that, because he is an Orphanage boy, he cannot take advantage of opportunities offered for higher education.\n\nI trust, dear Mother, that you will give this matter consideration. It might be that the Government which has so generously helped him up to this time, may finance him further.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in the past,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nSister M. Lucretia (Principal)\nSt. Vincent's Orphanage,\nPeterborough, June 16, 1941.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent, Department of Indian Affairs,\nParry Sound.\n\nDear Mr. Devlin,\n\nI received your letter of June 2, and wish to give you further information regarding Edward Sullivan. I think, too that something definite should be proposed to the Department, and I have one to make.\n\nAs I told you, a Druggist in Peterborough, Mr. Stanley Bogue, whose present apprentice is ready for University in October, has asked Eddie to go on for Pharmacy and apprentice with him. He will take him on in July. He will work there for three years with remuneration, little at first, but increasing as he gains experience. This money he could save to put himself through University if the Department of Indian Affairs would still keep him in the Orphanage at the same fee. It is true, that as a grown boy, out at work daily, he will not be of much service to us in the Orphanage, but his fee will pay his board, and we will be glad to help him as much as we can. If the Department sees fit to pay more, every cent of his money, after his expenses are paid, will be saved by him under our supervision. If the Department will not pay more, then for his sake, I would keep him at the same fee.\n\nPerhaps the Department could place him in some good Government position which might have even a better future?\n\nIf my first proposal meets with your approval, might it not be well to try it for a year or two, and perhaps something better may present itself in the meantime.\n\nI appreciate your interest, and I shall await further communication from you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSister Scholastica,\n(Superior)\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had some correspondence recently with the Mother Superior of the St. Vincent's Orphanage, Peterborough with regard to the further disposition of Edward Sullivan an Indian boy who has been a pupil of the school in Peterborough for a number of years.\n\nThis boy has this year completed his education there by taking his senior High School matriculation, and the school officials have such a high opinion of his character and ability that they would like to see him go further. Some tentative arrangements have been made by them for him to study pharmacy by taking an apprenticeship with a druggist in Peterborough, Mr. Stanley Bogue, with a view to him later taking a course in university. His earnings as an apprentice will be small, and, with a view to his saving these towards the cost of a university course, the school officials propose to continue to board him at the orphanage if the Department will keep up the payments of $12.00 monthly which are the board and tuition fees which have been allowed them during his course at the school.\n\nI am enclosing copy of last letter received from the orphanage, also copies of letters of recommendation from the school principal.\n\nEdward Sullivan is an orphan whose parents originally resided on the Moose Point Reserve and were drowned near Midland about twelve years ago. He is now nineteen years old. This appears to be a case in which further education would be of benefit and I am glad to recommend it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJune 23, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to Edward Sullivan.\n\nThe Department is prepared to continue allowing the amount of $12.00 a month to St. Vincent's Orphanage for this boy's board and room on the distinct understanding that the money he earns will be placed in a trust account, either by the Sister Superior or yourself, and retained until the time arrives for him to go to university. It is felt that in view of the assistance that we have already given him, and the further assistance promised in this letter, that we are dealing fairly with him and consequently it should be very definitely understood by all parties concerned that this Department will not be responsible for any amount toward the expenses of his university course. As stated above, the money for this can be retained in a trust account until it is required and, of course, its expenditure should be supervised either by the Sister Superior or yourself.\n\nYou should advise me later if Sullivan intends to take advantage of this offer. In the event of his doing so a report should be submitted twice a year to this Branch with regard to his progress.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S. Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nR.A.

All of these children reside on the Reserve and not in the village of Depot Harbour, but live so far from the Indian Day school that they would be obliged to walk two miles or more to attend it. This, I believe, is the reason why permission was originally granted for these children to attend the Depot Harbour school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Indian children attending the Depot Harbour White School.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate distance that these children reside from the white school. In your letter you state that they reside 2 miles from the Indian school. This does not seem to be a very long distance, as many Indian children throughout the country travel this distance to school. Has any endeavour been made recently to have the Indian children attend an Indian school?\n\nAs you have been advised on former occasions, our funds are very limited, and every possible effort should be made to effect savings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nAugust 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference: Letter, August 8, 103-22.\n\nReplying to your letter re attendance of Indian children at Depot Harbour white school, beg to advise you that the children concerned all live within a distance of approximately one-half mile from the Depot Harbour school and roughly, at least two miles from the Indian school. This is, as you say, not a very great distance. The fact is that the children do not live on any travelled road and the greatest difficulty occurs in the winter when the deep snow makes it practically impossible for them to attend the Indian school with any degree of regularity.\n\nI will, however, make it a point to talk to their parents at the first opportunity, and see if it can be arranged for them to attend the Indian school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the St. Vincent Orphanage Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Mildred Winnipeg Wheatley\nAge: 13\nName of Band: Non Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Wellington Wheatley\nMother's full name and No.: Mary Wheatley\nParents living or dead: Father living, Mother dead\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?

In explanation of this application I wish to advise that this girl is not technically an Indian, not being a member of any Band, but is in blood at least three-quarters Indian. Her paternal grandfather is a white man who married an Indian woman of the Parry Island Band and his son, her father, also married an Indian of the Parry Island Band. This girl's mother died in infancy and she has been brought up by her aunt Martha James who is a member of the Parry Island Band.\n\nFrom complaints made by Martha James to me, and my own investigations, it is apparent that this girl is inclined to get out of control and I think that a term in one of the residential schools would be beneficial to her.\n\nEnc.

We agreed to save his earnings in a trust account; if the Department would pay $12 a month for his board. We have not saved it all, and I am giving you an account of just what we have been able to do.\n\nHe earned $7.00 per week.\n$5.00 went to his trust account\n$12# to unemployment insurance\n$188 for his current expenses.\nHe has $124.00 in trust account now to be used for his college.\ncourse, if and when the time arrives.\n\nHis second six months has just begun with a raise in his wages of one dollar per week. That extra dollar will go to his trust account with the exception of $3.00 that he now needs for repairs.\n\nWhen we agreed to take the responsibility of his course preparatory to his pharmacy, there was no conclusion arrived at as to his clothing. He manages for small expenses with his $1.88 per week. Do you think the Department would give him a suit in the spring or should it be taken from his trust account? They often gave us clothing when he was a boy.\n\nIf this statement is satisfactory I will send his bill in for the board. You see we agreed to save his earnings but we could not save it all as he needed pocket money.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister Scholastica\nW. S. BOGUE, Phm. R.\nChemist and Druggist\nCOR.

He seems content and satisfied, and interested in pharmacy.\n\nWishing you the best of health and happiness in the New Year, Sister.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S.

Phyllis Jones passed the High School Entrance Examinations and wants to attend High School in Parry Sound, providing the Dept. will help her financially.\n\nPhyllis has been a good worker all through school and shows promise of being a satisfactory High School student.\nI have had a talk with her and she promises to attend regularly and do her best. Mr. P.M. Scott, J.P.S. Parry Sound, told me she made good marks on the examinations.\n\nWould you, please, bring this matter to the attention of the Dept.? I would like to have Phyllis continue her studies, if possible, as I consider she is too young, fourteen last March, to drop school work. She has also expressed a desire to attend university. During the summer months she works at the Ojibway Hotel, Pointe au Baril.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. L.H. Bradt.\nIf you find this a worthy case, I would appreciate very much it being given favourable consideration.\n\nMr. Arneil.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nInspector Arneil has brought to my attention the name of Phyllis Jones. I understand that this girl has attended the Shawanaga Indian Day School and has recently passed her High School Entrance Examination and wishes to attend the Parry Sound High School.\n\nI enclose the form which you should have completed and returned to this office. When we receive it further consideration will be given her request for assistance.\n\nYou will note that the girl should be medically examined and the reverse side of the form should also be completed. When allowing tuition grants we wish to be sure that the applicant is in good health and able to profit by any assistance that might be allowed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR TUITION GRANT\n\n1.

Her mother was a member of the Cape Croker Band but is now deceased. Phyllis, I believe, was never made a member of her mother's band and has been brought up by her grandmother who resides on the Shawanaga Reserve.\n\nI find that it will not be necessary for the Department to incur any expense in her case other than to supply the necessary books and school supplies for the high school course. An aunt of this girl, Mrs. Roy Salt, resides in Parry Sound and has undertaken to keep her for the duration of the course and I am advised that no fees will be charged by the local school board. I would be obliged should you see fit to grant the required books, if you would advise me as soon as possible so that I may purchase these locally.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6484, file 42022-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 31st August, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th instant, you may purchase the book required for Phyllis Jones to attend High School at Parry Sound during the coming academic year. It is noted that this is the only expenditure required from the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAn Indian of the Manitoulin Unceded Band named John Agowissa has made inquiries with me as to the possibility of his getting some form of correspondence courses for his family. This man is living on the French River and is at least four miles from any school. He does not live on any reserve, his house being in unorganized territory. I have advised him that if he desires education for his children he should take up residence on his own Reserve where there are school facilities but he maintains that he is unable to make a living there. His family are as follows.\n\nErnest Agowissa    age 15\nStanley            \"      12\nJohn               \"      11\nIda                \"      10\nMarjorie           \"       7\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 11th October, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent, Parry Sound, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to securing correspondence courses for the children in the family of John Agowissa.\n\nYou do not state if any of these children have received previous instruction or if they are able to read. If not, I cannot see any value in supplying correspondence courses for them.\n\nIf this man is not prepared to live on his own reserve where a Day School is located, I feel that the children should be placed in a Residential School. This would be in their own best interests and surely the parents should have sufficient interest in their children to see that they receive some education.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to draw attention to the case of Adrienne King, daughter of Solomon King one of the Christian Island families resident in this Agency. Adrienne King has been a patient in the Mountain Sanatorium, Hamilton, for some years and has just recently been discharged from that institution as cured. She was in to see me recently and looked very fit. She did not wish to return to live with her family on the Parry Island Reserve as they have had tubercular history and she has made arrangements to live with some relatives in Toronto.\n\nShe is desirous of obtaining some further education and wishes to take a commercial course at the Shaw Schools in Toronto. She advises me that she had endeavoured to keep up with her education while in the sanatorium and had passed through the first grade of high school while there. She is now about 21 years of age and is a bright intelligent girl who would I think justify any expenditures which might be made on her behalf. I am particularly interested in her case since she is one of the few whose lives we have been able to save through sanatorium treatment and I believe that the fact that she has been cured through sanatorium treatment will have a good effect on other Indians infected with tuberculosis who look upon being sent to the sanatorium as a death sentence.\n\nI understand that her relatives in Toronto will take care of her board and lodging and I would be glad to know if the Department will undertake to pay for her tuition in the course which she proposes to take and also possibly make a small cash allowance to take care of clothing and incidentals.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6484, file 42022-3, part 1)\nOttawa, December 1, 1945.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the request of Adrienne King for a tuition grant to enable her to take a business college course in Toronto.\n\nPlease let me know the length of the course and the amount which this girl wishes the Department to allow. Possibly you could have the enclosed form completed. This would give us the information that we require before making a final decision.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nNote: In order to make as certain as possible that applicants for tuition grants will have the physical stamina to complete a course of higher education, the following information must be supplied:\n\n1.

I note that she is suggesting a correspondence course.\n\nI doubt very much if such a course would be of any real value to her as it is quite probable she would never complete it.\n\nAs she is residing in Toronto I cannot understand why she could not attend a Business College during the next six to nine months. In so doing she would have proper instruction and business machines would be available for practice. Please make further inquiries with a view to ascertaining if this suggestion could be put into effect and if so, the monthly charge for tuition.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI have just been in communication with the public school inspector for the District who has advised me as to a situation which has arisen with regard to the transport of high school pupils. Arrangements have been made for the transportation of various high school pupils daily from the neighborhood of Pointe au Baril and Shawanaga to the high school in Parry Sound. A contract was made for this purpose with a local man covering a specified number of pupils. Since the contract was made, two more pupils have turned up and as this necessitates the use of a small bus instead of the two cars formerly used by the contractor he cannot take care of these two extra pupils without an additional payment of $3.00 per day.\n\nOne of these pupils is an Indian boy, James St. Germaine, whose family belong to the Rama Band but who have been resident close to the Shawanaga Reserve for some years. The other one is an orphan, Phyllis Jones, whose mother formerly belonged to the Cape Croker Band. I told the inspector that we could not accept responsibility in her case and he believes that the Provincial department might be satisfied to pay $1.50 per day on her account if the Indian Affairs Branch will also pay $1.50 per day on account of the St. Germaine boy.\n\nAs the arrangements for a bus must be made within the next ten days, I would appreciate your consideration of this matter.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 20 November 1946.\n\nMr. S.

The school fees amount to $125.00 per year and I am advised that her school books this year will cost in the neighborhood of $20.00.

We have now three children of school age on that Reserve and a possible fourth. These could attend a nearby white school at the village of Britt but the distance from their home to this school is in the neighborhood of four miles. The school has a bus service which comes within about two and a half miles of where these children live and the contractor would be willing to go the remaining distance to pick up these children in the morning and return them in the afternoon for a sum of $3.00 per day. Your authority for this expenditure would be appreciated.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 2, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of September 11th with reference to the three children of school age on the Magnetawan Reserve.\n\nThere are approximately 190 days in the academic year and at $3.00 a day for the cost of driving them an expenditure of nearly $600.00 would be involved and there is always the possibility that they would not attend regularly.\n\nWe are inclined to feel that it would be preferable to place the children in one of our residential schools. If you concur, you might forward application forms and certificates of health.\n\nBernard F.

I note that the expenditures for this purpose have not been approved. I had already told the contractor to go ahead and pick up these children daily until I should receive advice from you. I have notified him today that we cannot be responsible for the expenditure and he may discontinue the service immediately. We will, however, be obliged to pay him for the month of September. I trust that you will be able to arrange this.\n\nWith regard to placing these children in a residential school, I might say that they are all of the Roman Catholic religion and the only available school would be that at Spanish, which appears at present to be full up. We can, however, if the parents concur, have application made for these children at that school and have them placed on the waiting list.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 8, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant\nwith reference to the transportation of children\non the Magnetawan Reserve to the white school at\nBritt.\n\nIt is noted that you are endeavouring\nto obtain approval of the parents to have the\nchildren placed in a residential School.

Her parents have been able themselves to take care of all expenses in this connection as they have had a temporary residence in Toronto. This Toronto residence was interrupted for some time recently and they have been living on the Gibson Reserve but with the intention of returning to Toronto very shortly, as soon as residence arrangements can be completed.\n\nIn the meantime, the girl was boarded by a relative Fred News, who resides in Toronto and to whom the payment of $25.00 would be made. Since no other costs have been incurred in this case, I would recommend that the payment of this amount be approved.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 17, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nTuition Grant - Lyla White.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of $25.00 to cover expenses incurred in boarding Lyla White, of the Gibson Band, in Toronto while attending high school there.\n\nPlease find attached copy of tuition grant form which should be completed in this case and forwarded here.\n\nWe are forwarding you an accountable advance of $25.00 to cover these boarding expenses.\n\nBernard F.

Since then, she has changed her plans and wishes to attend the Shaw Business Schools for a stenographic course. This course would entail somewhat more expense as the charges in the Shaw Schools are $1.00 per day with an initial charge of $7.05 for supplies. The course would take from six to eight months. There is a possibility that Miss Dewasha may, after completing the business course, again return to Jarvis Street Collegiate to continue her high school education.\n\nHer present idea in taking the business course is so that she would be able to maintain herself if anything should happen to her father who is not in very good health and this strikes me as being a very sensible idea.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you if it will be possible to alter the present arrangements.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSeptember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nWe have your letter of August 31st regarding Phyllis Dewasha.\n\nIt is noted that she now wishes to take a commercial course and we are prepared to allow the same amount as promised for the academic course, namely $160.00.\n\nIf she takes this course for the period mentioned in your letter, there will be no possibility of her returning for the academic course during the academic year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 103-22 (E.2), Sept. 3/48\n\nVoucher No. 476\n\nDATE: September 21, 1948\nThere are two pupils of the Shawanaga Day School who passed the entrance examinations for high school this year. These two pupils are Lorne Pawis, aged 14 and Norma Pawis, aged 15. Requests have been made to me to have them attend high school in Parry Sound. I had been for some time endeavouring to discover what the costs would be, but during the summer holidays, as most of the officials concerned were out of town, I was unable to get anything definite on this until recently. I am now advised by the high school principal that the Provincial Government pays the fees for out-of-town children and that there would therefore be no charge for these two. I am not at all satisfied with this and believe that the Provincial authorities would probably insist on payment by the Department when it was discovered that these were Indian children.\n\nThere is also the matter of transportation. A school bus service operates daily between Parry Sound and Pointe au Baril on Highway 69 and passes the Shawanage Reserve en route. I have on my desk an agreement ready for signature by the bus operator in which he agrees to transport these two pupils for the sum of $1.00 per day.\n\nIn the case of these children, I am very doubtful if any expenditures on their behalf would be of permanent value. The boy, Lorne Pawis was always a somewhat erratic pupil when attending the Shawanaga Day School and the girl was not much better. I have had on several occasions to pick her up here in Parry Sound and send her back to Shawanaga. I believe that her main interest would be the opportunity to spend time in town.\n\nHowever, should you think that it would be worthwhile to go\nto any trouble to get further education for these two children, if you will send me the regular forms, I will have them completed and returned to you.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nSeptember 27, 1948.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nWe have given careful consideration to your letter of the 21st instant regarding requests that you have received for tuition grants for Lorne and Norma Pawis.\n\nWe do not feel that any tuition grants are justified in the case of these two children and, therefore, no amount can be allowed for the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOct. 9, 1948\n\nMr. Regional Supervisor Morris is a little concerned about the refusal to allow the two Paris children (unrelated) a chance to show what they can do.

At that time I had made a tentative arrangement to have three children who were of school age carried by bus to a nearby white school at Britt, Ontario, a distance of between five and six miles from the children's homes. The bus service would then have cost us $3.00 per day for the transportation of these children, but this was considered excessive by the Department. We have now reached the stage where there are a possible nine children on this Reserve who could attend the school at Britt.\n\nI have talked recently to the man who has the contract for the transportation of the Britt children and his charge would still be $3.00 per day, irrespective of the number, which, however, is not to exceed nine. I have not yet contacted the Britt School Board as to what per capita charge they would make on these children but would be pleased to know if you would consider now the payment of the transportation and I will advise you further as to the school costs.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\n15th February, 1949.\n\nMr. S. Devlin,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the situation at the Magnetawan Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that you can arrange to have a maximum of 9 children transported to the school at Britt at a charge of $3.00 per teaching day.\n\nThe Department approves the expenditure mentioned, provided you can make the necessary arrangements with the Britt School Board to accept the Indian children. If so, you will no doubt advise us later regarding the rate which they will charge. In the event of arrangements being completed, you should make certain that the 9 children attend regularly.\n\nBernard F.

Last year we paid $68.00 and the township paid the balance. But this year the township refuses to pay any of the cost.

This is as much as we allow in any individual case. Under these circumstances it is felt that you should be sufficiently interested in your son's education to pay the cost of the tuition fees.

While motoring through the country we came upon a settlement of Indians near Burley Falls. They had broken away from the Government Reserve at Curve Lake, to make a living, they claimed for themselves and their families. No doubt this Indian community has already been reported to you, with all the complications connected with it.\n\nThe section of Crown land on which these Indians had chosen to \"squat\" could not be more desolate, barren and rocky, with little or no ground that could be cultivated. There is no school in the district, so the children (twenty-seven of them) are growing up without any education. The majority of them can neither read nor write.\n\nWe moved about the settlement, chatting with the different families\u2014not out of curiosity\u2014but with deep interest and concern for the children. We found one boy taking the Department of Education Correspondence Course, this was required of him because his Mother was receiving the Mothers' Allowance. We read the child's papers and as we examined them it became quite clear to us that some older person had been responsible for the major portion of the work. As we met one problem after another we found ourselves subconsciously searching for the solutions. Above all the lethargy that pervaded the place impressed and appalled us. It was a very drab picture but not without hope. In spite of the difficulties in tilling the ground, two families had succeeded in making a flower garden. This encouraged and delighted me. Being a keen gardener myself I appreciated the difficulties they had overcome and it gave me hope of their ability to overcome other things.\n\nAs we were leaving the settlement we noticed one family having their evening meal on the verandah of their dilapidated shack, a young girl was cooking something on a fire near-by.\nIn a flash my mind went back to the many summers I had spent at camp with my Company of Girl Guides and had watched them, times without number cooking their meals just as this girl was doing. Then came the thought, why would not an adaptation of Sir Robert Baden-Powell's plan for Scouts and Guides be the very thing for Indian children? I remembered the keenness with which the Guides responded both in work and play, and as to play, what would be more suitable than the fine Scouting games so well known amongst Scouts and Guides. Then there was the backbone of the whole plan, the aim of developing resourcefulness and the making of good citizens, was not this the aim for Indian Children as well?\n\nEver since the war broke out, I have been looking for an opportunity to, in some way, be of service to the country. The thought of the possibility of work amongst the Indian women and children so impressed me, that I determined last September to do something about it. Here surely was the thing, not only that I could do, but would like above all else to do.\n\nFor years my sister and I had a studio in the Women's Art Association in Toronto. Here we came in contact with Crafts of all kinds, and for many seasons the Secretary of the Association and I acted as judges in the Craft section of the Women's Building at the Canadian National Exhibition. In this way, and with a practical working knowledge of many of the crafts, I have come to know and appreciate the educational value of Craft work. Besides my training in Art and the years of work in the Commercial art world, there were fifteen years experience and periods of training in connection with the Girl Guides Association. My appointment for a period of this time as Camp advisor for the Division of Toronto, gave me ample opportunity to test my own organizing ability. The remembrance of all this, but especially the thought of the children, has emboldened me, a perfect stranger, to write and offer my services to your department in Ottawa, for work amongst the Indians.\n\nUpon my return to Toronto I went to see Mr V.K. Green, the Chief Inspector for the Provincial Department of Education, and told him the story of the Burley Falls Indians. He wrote the Inspector of the Peterborough district, who replied promptly confirming our report, and adding to it, the difficulties he had encountered in trying to meet the situation.\n\nThen I went to see Miss Clark of the Women's Institute Branch. I have made illustrations for her department, from time to time and know and admire the work they are doing in the rural districts. I asked her if she had ever arranged courses for the Indian Mothers and Children. She showed real interest in the matter.\nbut said the Indians were outside her jurisdiction\n\nOn one of my visits to the Indian section at the Royal Ontario Museum, I went to have a chat with Mr. C. T. Currelly. Mr. Currelly has helped me in times past in connection with illustrations for some history books I had to do. I found him very interested in the Indians, of course, and we chatted for sometime on the question of Indians in general. Later I went back to study and make some drawings of the Indian Crafts on display. I mentally compared them with those one sees for sale in the Department Stores, supposedly made by the Indians, and also with a basket some one had recently given me, a basket bought from an Indian women in Muskoka. It seemed to me, if in years gone by Indians could produce such interesting things, surely amongst the Indians of today we could find many who could be inspired to do better things.\n\nThe thing I would like very much to do, would be first to visit the Government Reserves and Settlements, for my own information, to have a firsthand knowledge of the resources of each district that might be used in Craft work. To list the resources, limitations and possibilities of each place and plan accordingly. One realizes there are limitations and the necessity of using, not what one can find in the city shops, but in the main what can be found by the Indians themselves in their own community. Then I would like to get to work amongst them.\n\nI have mentioned the subject of the Indians to Mrs. H. B. Warren, President of the Dominion Girl Guides Association, and know, If asked, she would gladly say a word on my behalf. Then too, several friends in Ottawa, who have known me for years, would I know corroborate what I have just written of my training and experience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Edith B. Maclaren.)\nOttawa, January 29, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Maclaren:\n\nYour letter of the 10th instant, addressed to Mr. Philip Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI note with interest your reference to a settlement of so-called Indians near Burley Falls, Ont. It has occurred to me that this is the group or band of so-called Indians that has been investigated on a number of occasions by officials of this Department. About a year ago Indian Agent Eastwood of Peterboro investigated this Band and reported that of this Band only one - Josh Johnson - was a bona fide Indian, in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act, and that this particular man was a member of the Mud Lake Indian Band.\n\nIt would appear that this group are really half-breed citizens, probably with a certain amount of Indian blood. As half-breeds, however, they are not the responsibility of the Dominion Government. They are citizens in a very absolute sense and as such are the responsibility of the Provincial Government insofar as their education and general welfare is concerned.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that about 2 years ago a Handicraft Division was organized in this Department with a senior official in charge. This Handicraft Division has been organized to promote worthwhile handicraft projects on Indian Reserves and to encourage what we term Home Industries on reserves throughout the Dominion. The officials in charge of this Division have already succeeded in organizing a large number of worthwhile industries on a number of reserves in the East and it is our intention to extend this work just as soon as the funds at our disposal will enable us to do so. We have organized and placed on display at the Canadian National Exhibition, Toronto, during the last two years an exhibit of Indian handicraft products. These have included baskets, hand-woven ties, scarfs, rugs, metal work, hand-carved statuettes, leather goods, etc.\n\nIt is my intention to pass on your letter to Miss Moodie, the official in charge of this Division. Miss Moodie is at present absent from the office and is not likely to return for a week or 10 days. It has occurred to me that in addition to this you might yourself communicate with Miss Moodie, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, submitting any suggestions you may care to offer.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMiss Edith B. Maclaren,\n19 Poplar Plains Rd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nFeb. 4th - 41\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nWelfare and Training Branch\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThank you for your prompt reply of January 29th to my letter addressed to Mr. Phelan regarding my interest in the work amongst the Indian children.\n\nI appreciated the information in your letter regarding the handcraft department or works in the Indian schools. I had been informed of the intentions of the Branch to revise the curricula of the Indian schools but had not been aware of work being already done by Miss Moodie's division. I regret not having seen the displays you mentioned at the Canadian Nat. Exhibition.\n\nIn your letter you say \"It has occurred to me that this group or band of so-called Indians (at Burly Falls) that has been investigated on a number of occasions.\"\nWhen you mentioned a Josh Johnston I knew your surmise was correct. For there was a family of Johnstons. The father was almost blind, the mother was receiving the mother's allowance, the child had had his leg amputated. There was a family - the mother a full-blooded Indian married to a Scotch man by the name of Hogarth. I well remember this family. I was particularly struck with the children. There were quite a tribe of them and most of them had the clear features of their white father, such fine looking little people. This seemed unfortunate as well as remarkable. It was remarkable to me also the intense interest these people stirred within me to the opportunities of work amongst the Indians groups of the country. The heading of your Department describes quite simply this interest, first their welfare, secondly their training.\n\nTo return quickly back to the Birch Falls group again. The Indians that made the strongest appeal for help for the children went by the name of Buster Brown. He also had a small\ntribe of his own. This family I believe is a pure blood Indian family. His appeal was both interesting and dramatic. He had evidently tried in a weak Indian fashion to solve the school problem of the children. It was he who informed us there were twenty seven children in the community. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this number only by the number of children we saw, we concluded he could not be far wrong in his count.\n\nI will be very glad indeed to write Miss Moodie as you have suggested. Thanking you again for your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdith B. MacLaren.\n1912 Poplar Plains Rd.\nToronto.\nOttawa, February 8, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Maclaren:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to state that I am today communicating with the Indian Agent at Peterboro in respect to the racial status of the Brown family, referred to by you in your communication.\n\nI appreciate very fully your interest in the welfare of these children and the courtesy that prompted you to bring the matter to my attention.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMiss Edith B. Maclaren,\n19\u00bd Poplar Plains Road,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, February 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is my understanding that you have on more than one occasion investigated and reported upon the racial status of a group of so-called Indians living at or near Burley Falls.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Edith B. MacLaren, 19# Poplar Plains Road, Toronto, in which she states that she recently visited this group of Indians and was particularly disturbed to note that no educational facilities whatever have been provided for the children of school age. She assures me that one family made a very strong appeal to her for the facilities necessary for the education of their children. This particular man, known as Buster Brown, assured her that he was a pure-blood Indian. I am anxious to know if you are at all familiar with this particular family and if Brown is the responsibility of this Department.\n\nI personally find it somewhat difficult to understand why the educational needs of this particular group has not been brought to the attention of the Provincial Authorities. One would think that the people in the surrounding district would be sufficiently interested in these children to present their claims to the Department of Education, Toronto.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. Vincent McC. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterboro, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 102-29 of February 8th in regard to the group of people residing at Burleigh Falls, Ont. and in particular \"Buster\" or Ernest Brown and family, Ernest Brown is the illegitimate son of Mrs. William Smoke, #115 Alnwick Band. His father is supposed to have been a white man from what I can gather. He has been living for at least fifteen years at Burleigh Falls, Ont and has, to my knowledge, never resided on any Indian Reserve in this Agency. He is listed in the Voter's List for Peterborough West, rural polling Division #55, which also includes the name of his wife. In my opinion Brown is definitely not the responsibility of this Department. He is one of a group of persons of some Indian blood, who have no legal status as Indians, who reside in the vicinity of Burleigh Falls. Some of them lease property from the Department of Transportation and others from the Ontario Government. They are wood cutters and general labourers.\n\nOn account of them living on Government property the Township of Harvey declines to take any responsibility whatsoever for them and\nThe Secretary,\n\nthis for a number of years has been the reason for numerous investigations, which resulted in nothing being done for these people. They at one time were able to attend school about three and one-half miles distant but apparently were ejected from this school. It would appear to me that the whole set-up is to \"oust\" these people and have somebody else look after them.\n\nI understand the R.C.M.P. were ordered to evict them about a year ago but there was considerable opposition and public opinion supported these people in remaining and apparently the action was not completed, as they still reside on this property.\n\nIn regard to the educational needs of this particular group, I enclose a copy of my letter dated August 5th, 1937. The Provincial Authorities have been well aware of the situation at Burleigh Falls for ten years or more but it would appear that the people in the surrounding district are more interested in getting these people out of the Township than looking after their interests. I endeavoured to get in touch with Mr. Leo Copp, local school inspector, during the week, but was unable to do so until Saturday morning last. He tells me that these people reside on the Forest Reserve, lots 5 and 6, Concession 1, Harvey, which the Department of Education feel should not be set up as a School section at the cost to the Township, as there are no taxes to support a school and until a school section is organized no school can be considered. He has proposed to the Department of Education to carry on correspondence classes for grades 9 and 10 but it is questionable in my mind whether the children would be advanced enough to take this course. In addition to this Mr. Copp is arranging immediately for a study place, with a person in charge, for one day. He is going up this week to make arrangements and if he can secure a cottage he will endeavour to get his Department\nThe Secretary,\n\nto supply wood for heating and land a student for\nthe purpose of instructing all children who wish\nto attend. I believe this Branch of the Department\nis under Mr. C. D. Bouck.\n\nI believe Miss Edith B. McLaren\ncalled on me last fall. I understand she is with\nthe Auxiliary Service of the Department of Education\nand I brought the matter to her attention. I believe\nshe then visited Burleigh Falls and told me she\nwould do what she could.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND JUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nV.M.

I wrote the Clerk of the Township of Harvey on receipt of your letter but have not as yet received a reply.\n\nI called at each permanent house at this settlement yesterday and took note of all particulars. I found that the total population numbers fifty-five, thirty-nine of whom were children and, as stated in your letter, there are eighteen children of school age. The parents stated to me that those attending school were ejected two years ago and no children have been attending school since. The nearest school house is four miles north of Burleigh Falls on the Apsley Road. This was the only available school, which they attended. Previous to their being ejected, about seven pupils were attending regularly, all of whom were Canadian citizens, three being the children of Jack Jacobs, enfranchised by Order-In-Council dated September 8th, 1934 - four children of George Hogarth (born in\nThe Secretary,\n\nPeebles, Scotland, of Scotch parentage), married to Louisa Taylor (Indian) daughter of Abe Taylor Band #55, Mud Lake. Mrs. Hogarth has received her commutation of interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa, February 21, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Maclaren:\n\nMay I refer to your letter to me dated February 4, 1941, and my reply thereto dated February 8.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from Indian Agent Eastwood. Mr. Eastwood, you will note, deals rather fully with the racial status of the Brown family. It is my earnest hope that some action will be taken by the provincial authorities to provide educational facilities for this nomadic group of citizens.

The letter authorizing a grant, at the rate of $65.00 each, in order to assist Charlotte and Robert Marsden in attending Campbellford High School, during the Academic year 1940-41 was dated August 21st, 1940, File 103-25.\n\nIn reply to the second paragraph of your letter Charlotte Marsden completed her Junior Matriculation during the Academic year 1940-41 and has her application in to the Nicholls Hospital, Peterborough, to go in training as a nurse.\n\nRobert Marsden should obtain his Junior Matriculation during the Academic year 1941-42, as I understand he is now in the fourth form. His father, Norman Marsden, has requested that as his son wishes to continue his schooling, that he be granted the usual $65.00 tuition to be used to defray the cost of transportation from Alnwick Reserve to Campbellford.\n\nIn regard to Charlotte Marsden, I have two letters, which I enclose, from her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Marsden. They request\nThe Secretary,\n\nin these letters assistance in purchasing of supplies, uniforms and other necessities for Charlotte to carry on her course in nursing.

Minos & Resources.\nSecretary.\n\nEsteemed Sir,\n\nWould you please forward this letter to the Dsp. of Education as it is very important to the one concerned. Our Boy Robert Marsden has been attending Campbellford High School until the term closed or until he got into third form went by bus, now this has been stopped we just got word concerning same. Now he has no way of getting to any High School unless he goes to board out and this we are unable to do.\nunless the Department gave us a grant towards it. Our own money being tied up in our loan. But we could get him the books that required. We have a son and his wife & family that work in Toronto. He said that they would board Bob for a little in the way of expenses. I suppose he couldn't do it for any less than 4 or 5 dollars per week as rent & living is so very high in the cities. But we could help out in the way of potatoes & vegetables but not money. The time is now so close at hand for the school term to\nBegin that we are just at a loss what to do for we know that the Department would not want to stop Bobo education just when he has got to the third form. In fact he done real well for he was sick quite a lot.\n\nWill you kindly advise our Agent Mr. V. M. Eastwood and please give Bobo a chance like the rest of the boys that went through, received.\n\nThanking you in advance\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nNorman Marsden (Chief)\nRR2 Rosemuth\nOnt.\nOttawa,\nAugust 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have a letter from Norman Marsden requesting assistance for his boy, Robert Marsden, to complete his high school course. Would you please look into the matter and send us your recommendations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 103-25 of August 26th, stating that Norman Marsden had written a letter requesting assistance for his boy, Robert Marsden, to complete his high school course, I wish to refer you to your letter 103-25 of August 14th, wherein the usual grant of $65.00 was allowed to enable this boy to continue at high school for another year. Apparently this is unsatisfactory to Norman Marsden. From what he tells me the bus from Roseneath to Campbellford has discontinued its service and Norman Marsden is unable to make arrangements to have the boy live at home and go to Campbellford each day, as he has in the past. What he proposes to do is to have the boy go to his son's home in Toronto and have the boy attend school from there. He wishes to secure sufficient of a tuition grant to board the boy at his son's home in Toronto at $5.00 a week. This would mean approximately forty weeks at $5.00 a week and a total cost of approximately $200.00, which is a considerable amount in comparison with what the previous assistance has been.\n\nI also was under a misunderstanding from Norman Marsden in regard to the progress of the boy and have recently learned that he is in third form, of the Collegiate, and not in the Matriculation form, as previously advised. This would mean two more years of schooling.\nIn view of the fact that an application of Mrs. Ross Beaver, of the same Reserve, for a tuition grant to enable her daughter, Vivian, to attend High School, has been refused, on account of no allowance for new grants for 1941-42, I cannot very well recommend the increased grant for Norman Marsden's boy.\n\nI think that Norman Marsden can arrange some method of having his boy continue at Campbellford and if not, his other son in Toronto could bear part of the cost, if arrangements were made to send the boy to Toronto. I think if the family is sufficiently anxious to have the boy continue, that the present grant could be made to do.\n\nI explained this matter in full to Norman Marsden before he wrote his letter to the Department and endeavoured to show him that I could not fairly recommend an increase when others were refused assistance on account of economy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nOttawa,\nSeptember 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo you may inform Norman Marsden that for the academic year 1941-42 the total amount that this Department is prepared to allow for the tuition of his son is $65.00. Any further expenditure will have to be paid by the father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. V.M.

The son, Robert, passed his entrance with honours and would like to continue at school. If he secured the cost of his transportation, which would be $6.00 a month by bus from Rice Lake Reserve to the school, his father could finance the cost of his books and so forth. The boy is fourteen years of age and is a good student. It would be the intention of his parents, if assistance is granted, to have him continue along some vocational work.\n\nIf funds are available for this purpose I would be pleased to recommend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV.M.

But so far have not been able to get in touch with him as he is possibly away from home on vacation.\n\nWe had a vocational course in mind for him & Miss Long gave us a list of what she thought he should take. You understand of course he has taken a general course in our school here in the village these last two years 41-42. He passed his Entrance Exams when he was 13 yrs of age and just kept on in our school. He is real anxious to continue we are also if it is at all possible.\n\nWe were told other Indian children had received a grant from the Department to help out their expenses so we thought if that was possible we would manage to pay the balance. I do not know exactly what it will be but of course Board will likely be most of it might be around $400.00\n\nI do not receive any allowance for him from the Soldier.

Fraser, Esq., M.P.\n\nI am writing you regarding a matter that seems to me to be very unfair.\n\nThese are the facts. A daily bus from Roseneath transports 29 pupils Cobourg Collegiate, 4 of them are Indian from Alderville Reserve. Twenty-five of these from Roseneath taken practically free, due to grants. The other Indian children have to pay $10.00 per month each for this accommodation. Their parents are poor and the least able to pay but the children are clever and ambitious. One girl, Norma Beaver, who gets honours in her course each year, has one brother serving in Italy (wounded recently), another serving in France, and a third preparing to go overseas. Surely a family such as this deserves the very best advantages Canadian Schools can give without the added burden of transportation.\n\nYou will know who should deal with this gross injustice and it is my hope that you will take the matter up at once. A remedy should be found immediately because school is now open and they are in attendance.\n\nTheir parents are appealing to me for corrections of this condition and I promised to consult you as our representative.\n\nI am in charge of the Alderville Mission and have served among them for nearly eight years.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd) H.

HOEY\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of October 4, regarding certain children from the Alnwick Reserve who are attending Cobourg High School, Inspector Arneil investigated this matter when he was on the Alnwick Reserve on October 14. There are five children from the Alnwick Reserve who wish to attend Cobourg Collegiate:\n\n1. Lois Bigwin - 12 years of age, passed the entrance this year.\n\n2. Nona Simpson - 13 years of age, passed the entrance this year.\n\n3. Max Beaver - 13 years of age, passed the entrance this year.\n\n4. Alton Bigwin - This boy is not quite 17 years of age. He is in fourth year high school work.\n\n5. Norma Beaver - Nearly 17 years of age. She is taking third year high school work, with special reference to a stenographic course.\n\nInspector Arneil considers that all the above-mentioned children should be encouraged to attend high school. The fee will be $10 a month for transportation, plus the tuition fees at the Cobourg Collegiate, which will be at the rate of approximately 53\u00a2 a day. I should appreciate having your authority to notify the Indian Agent that we will allow the amounts mentioned above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1944.\n\nMr. V. Eastwood, Indian Agent, 385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nInspector Arneil has reported regarding his inquiries in connection with certain children from the Alnwick Reserve who wish to attend Cobourg High School. Mr. Arneil recommends that tuition grants be allowed for the following:\n\nLois Bigwin\nNona Simpson\nMax Beaver\nAlton Bigwin\nNorma Beaver\n\nWe are prepared to allow an amount of $10 a month for transportation of each of them, plus the tuition fees at the Cobourg Collegiate. In requesting payment of tuition fees the school board should prepare their account in the manner required by the Department of Education of Ontario in the case of pupils attending a high school or collegiate institute from an outside municipality.\n\nIt is our intention to allow the grant for the period September 1, 1944, to June 30, 1945, and I presume that the payment of $10 for the transportation will be required each month. Consequently at the end of each month you should forward a voucher in favour of the transportation company reading: \"Tuition grant at the rate of $10 a month each for ...............\". The name of each pupil should be stated.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of October 4 and my reply of October 11, with reference to a requisition for a tuition grant for certain Indian children of the Alnwick Reserve.\n\nInspector Arneil visited the Alnwick Reserve on October 14 and at that time he interviewed the Indian Agent and the children for whom tuition grants had been requested. He ascertained that five children wished to attend Cobourg Collegiate and, as they had the necessary qualifications, he recommended that a tuition grant be allowed for each of them. Following receipt of Inspector Arneil's recommendation we advised the Indian Agent to notify the Cobourg High School that we would allow an amount for transportation to the school and fees for each of the following children:\n\nLois Bigwin\nNona Simpson\nMax Beaver\nAlton Bigwin\nNorma Beaver\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Mrs. Allan Taylor\nAddress: 714 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov.1/44 | To room and board for the month of October, 1944                       |        |\n|          | for Raymond O.

I have discussed the matter with him as I am anxious to have these two children continue their education and he states that some assistance to cover the cost of board and transportation would make it possible for him to have them continue.\n\nLloyd Paudash would like to attend the vocational Course of the Peterborough Collegiate and vocational School at Peterborough. He is a bright intelligent boy who has just passed his entrance this year. He is bright and intelligent and should do well especially on this course as he has a natural aptitude towards mechanics. June Paudash has completed her fourth year at Peterborough High School and would like to attend Peterborough business college in order to take a commercial course.\n\nI would suggest that a grant of $100.00 for each would materially assist him in paying the costs of transportation and board for the year.\n\nGeorge Paudash has recently received his discharge from the Veteran's Guard and he lost a son Herman, who was a Pilot Sergeant in the R.C.A.F. He was reported missing in a flight over Germany in 1943 and after a considerable length of time was officially reported as presumed dead. Herman received a tuition grant to send him to the Peterborough Collegiate and Vocational School and did very well in his studies and showed exceptional promise but the war interrupted the completion of his studies. I recommend that assistance be granted to both these children.\n\nVincent M. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 7, 1946.\n\nMr. V. M.

Sept.7/46\n\nVoucher No...42\n\nDate: February 19, 1947\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI submit for your consideration an application for a Tuition Grant to enable Alton Bigwin, son of James Bigwin Jr., #213 Alnwick Bend, to continue his studies at university.\n\nI enclose a letter which I requested him to write in which he states that he would like to enter medicine at University of Toronto or Queen's University. I also enclose a letter received from Mr. R. N. McKenzie, principal of the Cobourg Collegiate Institute. Assistance has been granted to Alton in order to enable him to attend Cobourg Collegiate Institute but this was limited to transportation costs only.\n\nHis father is unable to assist him to any appreciable extent. I believe the costs of his attending would largely fall on the Department if a grant was made towards furthering his education. No doubt he could augment his income by working during the summer holidays in the first few years of his course.\n\nI would recommend that assistance be granted him as I know him to be of a quiet studious type and very ambitious to make progress. On attaining his senior matriculation he would be unable to proceed with his studies unless this assistance is granted. How much assistance he would require I have no idea but no doubt similar cases which may be receiving assistance might be a guide for what his yearly expenses would entail.\n\nV. V. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\nR.B. 3\nCobourg, Ont.,\nFebruary 14, 1947\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn this letter I shall endeavour to give you all the information about my school work. Every so often I have spent two or three hours in giving thought to what I would take up as a life's work. Each time I have come to the conclusion that I would like to be a doctor. I well understand that high standing is required in Algebra, Geometry, Physics and Chemistry, in fact, at least second class honours before I could enter medical studies. Last year I got six subjects but I went back to school this year to raise my standing in the previously mentioned subjects. This year I work more diligently and my results are better. My standing at present, in my estimation, is pretty good. I think that going to medical school takes more money than any other course.\nDue to this fact I would need all the financial assistance that you could possibly acquire for me. In reading your letter I understand that you are going to make the application to a University for me. I would be very much pleased and very thankful if you did so. I would like to enter Queen's University in Kingston or one in Toronto but I would gladly go wherever you could find an opening for me. Should I not attain good marks in all subjects I would pursue studies in some other course; and would still need financial assistance, but I am quite certain that if I work hard enough I shall have first class honours in all subjects. I think I have given you all the details which you will require. I thank you very much for helping me in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\nAlton Biguin.\nCobourg Collegiate Institute\nCobourg, Ontario\n\nFeb. 17/47.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of Feb. 12th re Alton Biswin is at hand.\n\nThis young man is registered at present in grade 13. He was absent for most of the November tests through illness, I believe. His marks on two subjects were as follows:\n\nAlgebra -------------- 62\nGeometry -------------- 84\n\nThe teachers feel he has the ability to take higher studies. All he needs is determination on his part to succeed.\n\nOn behalf of the teachers of this school I would strongly recommend that all the assistance possible be given to Alton Biswin.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. N. McKenzie\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 27th, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th inst., enclosing letter from Alton Bigwin requesting tuition grant for the next academic year in order to enable him to take a medical course at either Toronto or Queens University.\n\nWe have read Bigwin's letter and also the letter from the principal of the Cobourg Collegiate. Provided Bigwin is successful in the examinations at the end of the current academic year we are prepared to favourably consider granting him assistance.\n\nBigwin's letter is slightly indefinite as you will note from the following sentence. \"Should I not attain good marks in all subjects I would pursue studies in some other course\". Bigwin should understand that he must make a definite decision what course he intends to follow before he enters university. If he is not successful in that course, the Department will not be able to grant him any further assistance. In other words, we cannot promise to provide a tuition grant if he switches from one course to another.\n\nEnclosed is one of our regular application forms for a tuition grant. This should be completed after Easter at which time you can obtain from the principal of the Cobourg Collegiate, the marks obtained by Bigwin at the Easter examinations.\nYou will notice on the reverse side of the application form that the medical certificate should be completed by a doctor. Before allowing a tuition grant, we wish to be assured that the applicant is reasonably healthy and we would like him to be physically able to continue the course he begins.\n\nBernard F.

Eastwood,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Eastwood:\n\nThis letter is written on behalf of Alton Bigwin from Alderville. This young man is registered this year in grade 13 of our school.\n\nHis marks at the present time for the following upper school subjects are:\n\nLatin Composition ............... 72\nGeometry ......................... 90\nAlgebra ......................... 75\nChemistry ....................... 75\nPhysics ......................... 76\n\nAlton Bigwin is a steady dependable lad. The teachers would like to see him proceed to university and would recommend that every assistance possible be given to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nCOBOURG COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn reply to file 103-25(WT1) dated the 27th of February, I submit herewith an application for tuition grant on behalf of Elmer Alton Bigwin, son of James Bigwin Jr., #213 Alnwick Band. Attached is a completed medical certificate as required.\n\nI have interviewed Elmer Bigwin and he is firm in his mind as to his intentions of taking up medicine if financial assistance is forthcoming. He has submitted to me a summary of student's expenses based on thirty weeks in the first school year. He states that the academic fees increase in the second and third years. Based on the first year's expenses, he considers the following would be his minimum requirements:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Board and Lodging (30 weeks @ $15 per week) | $450.00 |\n| First year academic fee        | $200.00 |\n| Registration fee per year      | $25.00  |\n| Books                         | $40.00  |\n| Athletic Association          | $10.00  |\n| Instruments                   | $30.00  |\n| Students Health insurance     | $10.00  |\n| Incidentals (class fees etc.) | $40.00  |\n| Microscope (if it has to be purchased or $25 per year rental) | $150.00 |\n| Laundry pressing etc.          | $50.00  |\n\nMicroscopes can be rented if registered early enough at $15 per year plus $10 per year in the case of damage. This would amount to $150 at the end of six years.\n\nA student would have a very short earning period during the summer holidays but he states that he could possibly earn sufficient to purchase his clothes and other requirements above those listed.\nFrom the $1005 estimated, his father states that he can provide $200.\n\nI realize this is a tuition grant of very large proportions over the six or seven years and it is doubtful whether the boy's father could assist his son in a greater amount than $300 or $400. I would like to add that his father may be able to increase his assistance as he is one of the most progressive farmers on the Alnwick Indian reserve since he started six or seven years ago. He has at the present time fifteen cows and three young cattle, has purchased a Fordson tractor on his own without assistance and is hoping to put in a larger crop this year and proposes to rent some additional property from his neighbours who are not using their land.\n\nV. M. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of May 5th giving detailed information regarding the request of James Bigwin, Jr., for assistance to enable him to take a medical course. In one portion of your letter you state that the father can provide $200, and later on you mention the amounts of $300 and $400. I presume you mean that we can depend on the father for $200 a year. Possibly he might be able to provide either of the higher sums. Please confirm this matter.\n\nAs the university term is only thirty weeks, it means that there are approximately twenty-two weeks on which James Bigwin Jr., might earn money to help himself, if he can secure any kind of a position. As you are aware, many white boys in the same position as Bigwin earn during the holiday period a considerable portion of the funds required for their university course.\n\nAs you state in your letter, this request is for a tuition grant much larger than usually allowed. We must take into consideration also, the fact that if he continues to be successful in the course, we will have to continue assistance for six or seven years.\n\nThe matter is sufficiently important for us to request that Bigwin pay a visit to the Department. At that time we will arrange to have him meet Dr. Moore, the head of the Medical Services, and other departmental officials.\nWe believe we are justified in making this request as we would like to have a personal interview with him.\n\nIn the event of his accepting this suggestion, you should notify us a week or ten days before he comes so that we may make certain the officials whom we wish him to meet will be in Ottawa.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuptl. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn reply to file 103-25 (WTI) dated the 9th of May 1947, I now have a reply from Alton Bigwin stating that he has to write his examinations the week of the 26th of May but that he would be able to go to Ottawa on the 3rd of June if that date would be agreeable to the Departmental officials who will interview him. If this date is not satisfactory please advise a date that would be more suitable and I know that Alton Bigwin could arrange to attend.\n\nIn reply to the first paragraph of your letter of May 9th, James Bigwin Jr., the father of this boy, states that he has heavy financial undertakings this year and will have difficulty assisting his son at this time but next year he states the burden will be lighter and he could assist his son to the extent of $200 a year and this would supplement what Alton could earn during the summer holiday period. When he finishes his studies, he intends getting employment this year for the summer months and he will have approximately ten weeks employment providing he can secure a job.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ont.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant in which you state that Alton Bigwin can visit the Department on June 3rd. As far as I know at present this day will be satisfactory.\n\nI note the information contained in the second paragraph of your letter and I hope that Mr. Bigwin will be able to obtain employment for the summer months. It is noted that the assistance that the father can give is evidently problematical, which usually happens in such cases.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. or Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe interviewed Alton Bigwin today concerning his desire to go through for medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nWe can allow a tuition grant of $400 to cover part of his expenses next year. This of course, depends upon his passing his matriculation examinations in June. I have suggested that he rent a microscope for the first year rather than purchase one. After his Christmas examination results are received we can consider granting an additional amount of around $150, to cover any other expenses.\n\nWe will do everything possible to ensure that he has no outstanding bills to meet during his course. However, he will have to live carefully and to watch his expenditures. The point is that we have so many other applicants for tuition grants and we have to ensure that the limited funds available are evenly distributed. However, this has been explained to Alton and we feel he understands the situation.\n\nWe are prepared to meet the expenses that he has incurred in coming to Ottawa. Would you please submit a voucher covering this amount. He was instructed to retain his hotel bill and to hand it to you for forwarding with the voucher. Would you also send a receipt from the railway company which should be easy to obtain.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 1947  | Expenses incurred in proceeding to Ottawa    |        |\n|            | for interview and return                     | $15.55 |\n|            | Authorized in letter 103-25(WT) of June 3, 1947 |        |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

M. Hogan.\n\nAt the present time I have been negotiating for a rate to have the school bus call at the Nice Lake reserve and pick these children up and return them daily to the reserve but the bus operator does not wish to make the run into the Reserve. It passes the cross roads about four miles from the reserve and to date I have been unable to make satisfactory arrangements for some member of the reserve to take them out daily to meet the bus. Fletcher's bus service operates during the school term and charges $2.00 a week per pupil, on the basis of 36 weeks this would amount to $72.00 per school term.\n\nAs these pupils would require books, certain fees, so forth, I would recommend that each be given a grant of $125 and have them make their own arrangements for getting to and from school and their parents should be able to contribute something for the costs exceeding this amount.\n\nV. H. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Tuition Grants Mud Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nMay assistance in the form of a Tuition Grant be given the following pupils of the Mud Lake Indian Day School who wish to continue their studies in Peterborough. In both cases they will of necessity have to reside in Peterborough, as the Mud Lake Indian Reserve is 24 miles from Peterborough and the roads are not always open in the winter time and regular attendance would be impossible.\n\nEric McCue, son of Clayton McCue #109 Mud Lake Band, was successful in the recent high school entrance examinations. He would like to continue his studies at the Peterborough Collegiate and Vocational School. He will require financial assistance to board in Peterborough on the basis of a ten month term or forty weeks and a five day week. I estimate the cost of his board will be about $7.00. I suggest that he would require assistance in the amount of $200.00 and his father could possibly make up the balance of his costs or the boy could work after school hours and help put himself through school.\n\nMable Taylor, daughter of Allen Taylor #99 Mud Lake Band has completed her second year at the Peterborough Collegiate and Vocational School. The first year being general and the second year commercial. This she attended without any assistance from the Department as her father was at that time in the army and was financially able to keep his daughter in school. He is now discharged from the army and his income has been considerably reduced. His daughter will, therefore, require assistance to continue her education. She is desirous of taking a one year's junior Secretarial course at the Peterborough Business College Limited at Peterborough, Ontario. The term is approximately ten months. The tuition rates for a ten month course are $175 with $18 for books. If assistance to this extent is granted, her father proposes to look after the cost of her boarding in Peterborough and arrangements can be made to have her reside at an older sister's who works and resides in Peterborough.\n\nI recommend that both these students have assistance and believe that they will benefit materially by taking up their further studies.\n\nV. M. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6484, file 42025-3, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Tuition Grants.\u2014Alnwick Band.\n\nHerewith I request consideration of a Tuition Grant to the following members of the Alnwick Band who propose to attend the Collegiate Institute at Cobourg, all of whom have been recommended by their teacher, Mr. John Loukes:\n\n| Name            | Family No. |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Lois Bigwin     | 215        |\n| Alton Bigwin    | 215 (will further advise) |\n| Nina Simpson    | 196        |\n| Sheila Crowe    | 206        |\n| Mary Marsden    | 173        |\n| Caroline Marsden| 173        |\n| Elgie Marsden   | 290        |\n\nThe Alnwick Township School Area operates a school bus from Roseneath, Ontario and this bus passes daily during the school term through the Alnwick Indian Reserve, picks up the students and returns them to the Reserve. The cost of the service is $100.00 per pupil per school year. This is a much less cost than children boarding in Cobourg. Arrangements were made last year on the same basis and authority for paying transportation of pupils from the Alnwick Indian Reserve approved under authority of file 103-25 of October 23, 1945.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the following tuition grants are authorized for the academic year 1947-48:\n\n(1) Lawrence Keith Salleby, - An amount of $125. will be allowed for each of these boys to assist them in attending Peterborough Collegiate.\n\n(2) Fern Loukes - A grant of $125. will be allowed each Boyd Cowie of these children to enable them to attend Peterborough Collegiate.\n\n(3) Eric McCue - In connection with the former it is Mable Taylor noted that you recommend assistance to the amount of $200. and for the latter an amount of $193. It is further noted that they will have to reside in Peterborough.\n\nWe are favourably disposed to allow these grants and we would like to have our regular application forms completed for each of these. These forms are enclosed and you should have them completed and returned to us as soon as possible.\n\n(4) Lois Bigwin, Alton Bigwin, Nina Simpson, Sheila Crowe, Mary Maraden, Caroline Marsden and Elgie Marsden - A grant of $100. will be allowed for each of these children who are members of the Alnwick Band and who will attend the Collegiate Institute in Cobourg.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nLawrence Keith Salleby born on the 15th of October 1933 and George Salleby born on the 1st of September 1933, members of the Georgina Island Band and residing with their uncle, Hanlon Howard #36 Nice Lake Band, on the Nice Lake reserve, were successful in passing their entrance examinations and now desire and are recommended by their teacher to attend the Peterborough Collegiate and Vocational School at Peterborough.\n\nReferring to file 62-25A (1), of June 26th being the latest correspondence in regard to these two boys, in view of the Nice Lake Band Council being unfavourable to admitting these two boys to band membership, I suggested in my letter of April 29th that these boys be placed in Residential School and I was advised that arrangements had been made for them to attend at Shingwauk. However, later as a result of a protest by Hanlon Howard, I suggested that the boys be given a tuition grant to attend the Peterborough Collegiate at Peterborough.\n\nUnder cover of a letter of this same date in regard to children of the Nice Lake Band, arrangements can be made for these two boys to attend on the same bus by granting them $125 each the same as these other children and let them take the school bus daily to Peterborough and reside at their home. I would recommend that this be done.\n\nIn regard to the transfer of their membership, I will endeavour to get another opinion from the Nice Lake Band Council at their first meeting in September with a view to enrolling these two boys into membership and transferring there capital shares from the Georgina Island Band to the Nice Lake Band. In order to present all the facts to the Council, may I please be advised what the per capita share in the capital fund of the Georgina Island Band would amount to.\n\nV.M. Eastwood\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 3rd, 1947.\n\nV.M. Eastwood, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n365 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nReference is made to your letter of August 21st, 1947, and you are advised that the approximate per capita share in the Capital Fund of the Georgina Island Band is $256.00. Therefore, the transfer of the Sallaby boys to the Rice Lake Band would bring approximately $12.00 to the Capital Funds of that Band.\n\nA.G. Leslie,\nFor Chief Clerk,\nTrusts and Annuities.\n\nAL/JA\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 103-25(WTL) dated 26th of August 1947, I would request a revision of grants authorized under paragraph 4 of this letter as follows:\n\nThe children attending Cobourg Collegiate Institute will be Lois Bigwin, Mona Simpson and Elgie Marsden.\n\nAlton Bigwin has his senior matriculation and is not going further at school.\n\nSheila Crowe, Mary Marsden and Caroline Marsden all have their senior matriculation and decided not to go further with their education.\n\nIn view of this cutting down of the outlay of grants, may the grants of the three pupils attending be increased to $120 each as this is the actual cost of transportation for the bus of the Alnwick Township School Area. In addition to this there will be a charge for fees of approximately 12\u00a2 per day charged by the Cobourg Collegiate Institute. Based on an estimate of 186 days it will amount to $22.38 at the rate of .1203\u00a2 which was charged this past year.\n\nIt may be possible that I can get the parents to pay the fees if the transportation is taken care of.\n\nV.

Browne, Principal,\nCollegiate and Vocational School,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nRe: Miss Mable Taylor, pupil in grade XI 1946-47\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Taylor, a member of the Mud Lake Band, is completing the attached application for a Tuition Grant and requires your signature to question twelve as to your statement of character, general fitness and academic capability. Would you kindly complete this form by signing it and return same to this office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD,\nIndian Agent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nOttawa, September 18, 1947.\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water Street, Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $193.00 for the current academic year to assist Miss Mabel Taylor who is attending Peterborough Collegiate. We actually approved her admission in official letter of August 26, but so that there will be no doubt in the matter I am writing to you again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nManual Training Mud Lake Indian Day School and Alnwick Indian Day School.\n\nManual Training is now available to these two schools and is being taught at the Rice Lake Combined School which is a school administered by the Township of Otonabee and to which school board an annual grant is made for the instruction of Indian children of the Rice Lake Band.\n\nI have been in touch with Mr. J.L. McColl of 635 Oxford Street, Peterborough, who is in charge of manual training for the Department of Education for Ontario for this area. His training comes under the supervision of the local inspector for this Department. No doubt the Department is familiar with the set up of this type of training but to cover it fully in this letter Mr. McColl tells me that an annual course is put on in these schools and that the manual training teacher visits the school one day or each week and lays out work to be completed at his next call the following week. 60% of the instruction is in woodworking; 20% of the time is taken up in instruction of sheet metal work, soldering, tinsmithing and rope work; the remaining 20% is of miscellaneous work covering work in leather, painting, glazing glass and other appropriate work that can be utilized by Indians on the Reserve.\n\nThe Instructor will be in charge of a small kit of woodworking tools which he will leave at the school. They can purchase this kit at a 25% reduction and a nucleus of tools would cost approximately $30. A work bench and some tools have been purchased for the Mud Lake Indian Day School and these tools with the kit available from the manual training teacher would appear to be all that would be required in tools for the moment.\n\nThe cost per school for tools is set at 5\u00a2 per pupil per month. The allowance for teacher and supplies is $190 per teaching year per school.\n\nThe estimated cost for Alnwick Indian Day School where there would be seven boys over nine years of age who would take training would be $190 + $3.50 making a total of $193.50.\nThe estimated cost for Mud Lake Indian Day School where there are approximately 24 boys of age to take manual training would be $190 + $2.00 making a total of $202.00.\n\nMr. McColl states that while it is to an advantage to have a separate room for manual training, the work is done in most rural schools right in the classroom. A separate room is available in the Mission House now temporarily used as a school house for the Alnwick Band. At Mud Lake there is a large basement room originally intended for this work.\n\nMay favourable consideration be given to installing manual training in these two schools.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD,\nIndian Agent.\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 103-25 (WT) dated June 3, 1947 wherein a Tuition Grant was approved for Alton Bigwin #213 Alnwick Band to assist him towards his expenses in attending the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto. I wrote on September 3rd advising that he had decided not to attend university.\n\nI am now in receipt of advice from him that he wishes to proceed with his first intentions and although he was unable to enter first year medicine he has now registered in first year Arts where he was advised that he could transfer into the Faculty of Medicine next year and it would mean only a loss of one year in his complete course. He has requested me to again submit his application for the assistance previously authorized and I would appreciate early advice as to whether this can be confirmed in order to so advise him.\n\nM. Eastwood\nIndian Agent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Indian Agent, 385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant,\nwith reference to Alton Bigwin.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for us to decide\nwhat answer to give. This man started out with the\nidea of taking a Medical course. After visiting the\nDepartment and interviewing several officials he\ndecided that he would not take this course. Your\nrecent letter states that he is considering an Arts\ncourse. Has he already gone to Toronto University?\nBefore making a final decision, we would like to have\na letter from the University indicating if taking an\nArts course this year would count on his Medical course\nif he later decided to take the latter course. We would\nalso be interested in knowing the approximate amount\nBigwin has earned during the past summer.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/HM.\nAPPLICATION FOR TUITION GRANT\n\n1.

Applications have not been returned for Lois Bigwin, Alton Bigwin and Nona Simpson.

M. EASTWOOD\nIndian agent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nMr. V. M. Eastwood,\n395 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have registered at the University of Toronto. For nearly five weeks I have attended the lectures in the Pass Arts Course at University College.\n\nYesterday I had a long, informal chat with Mr. G. Beatty, Dean of the faculty of Arts. He was very helpful in that he gave me every encouragement to my ambitions. Dr. Beatty stated that due to my Indian stock the University would certainly want to encourage such a move and would thus endeavour to arrange my change in course from Pass Arts to Pre-Medical next year provided that I do sufficiently well this year. He suggested that I write of my intentions to Dean MacFarlane of the faculty of Medicine. Another suggestion was that I tell you that I am taking these subjects: Maths A, Physics, Chemistry, English la-b, and philosophy B. \"This course\", he stated, \"corresponds very much to that of the first pre-medical year,\" so that there would be no hindrance in my switching next year. Lastly, Dr. Beatty is writing a letter to the Department stating the required particulars.\n\nDuring the summer, though I was very careful of my expenditures, I was only able to make about $220. I only bought a new suit and some shirts out of this amount. When I came to school, I paid the first instalment of fees which amounted to one hundred and fifty-six dollars. Then my gym equipment and locker cost ten dollars. My books cost just a shade under fifty-dollars. After spending this amount I hadn't much left. My Dad, though he hasn't a high income, helps to pay my board which is fifteen dollars a week. Now there is my board for the year, my second payment of fees etc. to pay. If I am to get good marks in order to enter Pre-med next year, I think it wise to spend much time in study and not to work. This means that money for my board must come from elsewhere so I am urgently and hopefully asking that the Department grant me as much assistance as possible. As ironically stated in the first line of this page I am in debt. Reassuring you that I will put forth the utmost effort in studying I hope I am able to get as much help as was suggested by Col. Weary last May.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Alton Bigwin\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6484, file 42025-3, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to file 1035 (WT1) I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Alton Bigwin which I believe answers all points raised in Departmental letter.\n\nV.M.

He is not required to write tests in English, Calculus and Geometry until the end of January, although he has written one preliminary test in Calculus and passed it, also one in physics in which he got 40, however he states that only 55 passed out of 150. The real Physics test comes in February.\n\nIn a letter dated January 11th he states that he has received his marks in philosophy and Chemistry respectively being 60 and 74. He does not write English until January 17th, Calculus on January 30th and Geometry on February 5th. I have requested a report from the Office of the Registrar.

M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Lakes Agency,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Eastwood:\n\nRe: Mr. Alton Rigwin, I Pass.\n\nI understand from young Mr. Rigwin that in order for you to decide whether to recommend him for further assistance or not, you would need to know how he is doing in his studies.\n\nI have made inquiries and find that in I Pass he is taking the following subjects:\n\nPhysics la 4 hrs. a week,\nChemistry 2 3 hrs. a week,\nMathematics la, lb 3 hrs. a week,\nPhilosophy lb 2 hrs. a week,\nEnglish la, lb 3 hrs. a week.\n\nHe has had term examinations to date, and the results seem to indicate that he is at least an average student - perhaps a little better than that in such subjects as the first three above. In Philosophy and English he gets about 60%, which is 10% above the passing mark. I am convinced that he is working well and realistically, and believe that the results of the year's work will justify your confidence in him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. Beatty,\nDean.\n\nSB/AM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant to Alton Bigwin #213 Alnwick Band.\n\nWith reference to file 103-25(WT1) dated October 29, 1947 wherein I was advised that Alton Bigwin had been allowed a tuition grant of $400.00 for the current academic year, $350.00 of this grant was received at this office and now has been expended to date with the exception of a balance of $19.00.\n\nCredit vouchers have been forwarded regularly on the receipt of accounts.\n\nI am submitting a letter from the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Toronto University, setting out Alton Bigwin's standing at the Christmas examination results. I have retained a copy of this letter.\n\nAssuming the current year would be completed by May 15th there will be twelve weeks at $15.00 a week or $180.00 to be paid out in board. The funds on hand, inclusive of the $50.00 additional authorized amounts to $69.00 which will be short $111.00. It would appear that in order to complete his year, he will require an additional amount of $111.00.\n\nIn Alton's letter to me he suggested that if he were granted $75.00 more, he would endeavour to borrow the rest.\n\nIn recommending that he be given an additional grant of his requirements of $111.00 I would do so on the understanding that any further assistance would be on at least a 50/50 basis. He would have the whole summer to earn funds for his expenses in his second year and his father has promised to assist him to a greater extent than he has this year. I believe the father will be financially able to do so as he has an excellent herd of 25 cattle and is doing a good job of cultivating his land. His father has completed payment for some improvements to his house, has purchased some additional farm machinery and expects to be able to assist Alton to a greater degree.\n\nV. M. Eastwood, Superintendent,\nHic\u00e9 and Mud Lakes Agency.\nFebruary 26, 1948.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the tuition grant for Alton Bigwin. In view of the information contained in the first part of your letter, we will allow the extra amount of $111.00 and this will be paid from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49. You should, therefore, apply for same about April 1st.\n\nMr. Bigwin should understand that further assistance should be on a 50-50 basis. He should be able to earn considerable funds during the coming summer and as his father is in comfortable circumstances, he should be in a position to assist his son.\n\nBernard F.

A careful search of our files does not reveal that we received a Quarterly Return for the months of October, November and December, 1948. If you would have your teacher prepare such a return, we will arrange to forward you a cheque at once.\n\nI am very sorry that this delay has occurred and hope that you have not been too greatly inconvenienced.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn this village of Hiawatha there are five students who attended high school in Peterborough; three have gone two years and two have had their first year.\n\nThis year all five students failed to pass the examinations. To my estimation it was not due to the lack of study.\n\nAccording to the radio and paper, it was not all the students' fault. An investigation is now being made in the Collegiate. Enclosed is a clipping from the newspaper.\n\nI have been informed that failure in passing examinations, these Indian students cannot continue.\ntheir studies because Government help will be cut off.\n\nIs it true that these students have to give up their education because of one year's failure?\n\nI have always had the opinion that the Indian Government wanted the Indians to improve their stations in life.\n\nIf these students continue to go to high school, will the Indian Dept. continue to help?\n\nI am anxiously waiting word from the Dept., whether or not I should get my children ready for the coming term. If I do not receive help my children will have to give up their education.\n\nI would appreciate it very much a reply to this letter.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nRemain very Truly Yours,\n\n(Mrs.) Robert Cowie\n\n\"Hiawatha\"\n\nKeene, Ontario\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6484, file 42025-3, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCHARGE MARKING OF EXAMS\n'DISHONEST' AT PETERBORO\n\nSpecial to The Star\nPeterboro, July 30\u2014Charges that the whole system of setting and marking examinations in the collegiate and vocational school here was \"dishonest and absolutely unfair to the students\" were made today by Dr. H. G. Carleton, chairman of the supervisory committee of the board. A full investigation has been ordered by the superintendent of education.\n\nDr. Eldon P. Ray, one of the collegiate teacher's, published a newspaper advertisement in which he said \"tests were fair\" and that \"placing the blame for poor results on the staff simply provided a scapegoat for parents and students who have shirked their responsibility.\"\n\nReports received by the board of education showed only 53 of the 115 grade 11 students passed in all subjects. Thirty-two failed and 30 others must write supplemental examinations before the fall term.\n\n\"My guidebook is the fact that our students are not passing and, in fact, results have not been as good as in other schools during the past few years,\" said Dr. Carleton. \"The board is unanimously behind my charges; the system is dishonest. Teachers can fix marks any way they wish and are not averse to favoritism.\"\n\nDon't Consider Students\n\"Apparently the members of the board were satisfied to attribute the poor results to teaching, the examinations and the marking without considering another force in the school\u2014namely, the students,\" Dr. Ray said in his advertisement. \"A fair report on the examination results would have given some consideration to the student desire to learn, student participation in school activities and demands on student time outside the school.\n\n\"The chairman of the supervisory committee evidently has a very unfavorable opinion about the integrity and ability of the teachers of the school when he charged them with 'dishonesty' and being 'absolutely unfair' in the conduct of examinations,\" the advertisement said.\n\n\"Such statements are absolutely unfair because the person who makes them can do so under cover of the board, without fear of consequences, knowing he cannot be compelled either to prove his allegations or to retract them.\n\n\"Go To Pasture?\"\n\"Moreover, Dr. Carleton has some views about the poor mental health of teachers, and apparently is in favor of a year's leave of absence. But did the good doctor not get the prescriptions for beast and man confused when he suggested that teachers \"go to pasture for a year and maybe they could come back?\"\n\n\"Dr. Carleton's description of the examination results as 'the worst I have ever seen in a collegiate' is emphatic to say the least,\" the paid advertisement continued. \"Is this a statement of fact based on the study of examination results at P.C. V.S. in comparison with the results of the other schools over a period of years, or a personal and perhaps biased opinion arising from the results of this year?\"\nPeterborough Collegiate and Vocational School\n\nINDUSTRIAL ARTS DEPARTMENT\n\nREPORT\n\nOf Boyd Cowie, Grade T10A\n\nFor the period beginning , and ending June 1949\n\n| SUBJECTS               | STANDING |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Woodworking            | 47       |\n| Machine Shop Practice  |          |\n| Draughting             |          |\n| Electricity            |          |\n| Motor Mechanics        |          |\n| Related Draughting     |          |\n\n| SUBJECTS               | STANDING |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| English                | 48       |\n| English Literature     |          |\n| English Composition    |          |\n| Spelling               |          |\n| History                | 40       |\n| Mathematics            |          |\n| Science                | 40       |\n| Economics              |          |\n| Geography              | 40       |\n| Physical Education and Health | |\n\n1 indicates First Class Honours 75%\n2 \" Second \" \" 66%\n3 \" Third \" \" 60%\nC \" Credit or pass standing 50%\n\nFifty per cent. is required in each subject.

Ford M.D.\nAug 23/49\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nIn applying for a Tuition Grant for Lucille Courie, I believe her failure from 1945 to 1947 was partly on account of having to be up at 5 A.M. to catch the bus to Peterborough, ride 14 miles to Peterborough, then return home at 6:20 P.M. each day.\n\nAlso passing from girlhood to womanhood.\n\nWas another reason at the age of 13 yrs... from her Mother.\n\nMrs Robert Courie\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nLucille Cowie who failed to pass her Grade IV examinations during the school year 1948-49.\n\nI taught Lucille during the years 1946-47 and 1947-48. During these two years Lucille completed Grades 6, 7, and 8 work satisfactorily. I considered her an honor student.\n\nShe possessed a little better than average intelligence, worked very hard and cooperated perfectly with me. She exhibited a lively interest in all subjects. Because of this I cannot understand her failure to gain her goal unless she suffered from spasmodics.

It is of the highest importance that pupils have regular study hours at home, free from interruption, not only for the work assigned for the next day, but also for a systematic review of the work which has been covered. Without these regular hours failure is practically certain.

Eastwood:\n\nI am writing this letter on behalf of two Indian girls in our school, Carolyn Marsden and Elgie Marsden of Rosenearth.\n\nCarolyn has passed into grade 10 and hopes to continue studies with us in September. Her sister requested I send this message to you.\n\nElgie Marsden was not so fortunate. She did not pass her grade 10 examinations. She missed some time last year because of sickness. She was growing fast. Besides that I think she found the work difficult.\n\nWe are fond of Elgie and would like to see her continue her studies. We think she will make good. We hope you will be able to give her consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCobourg Collegiate Institute\nCobourg, Ontario\n\nAugust 22, 1949.\n\nCol. V.M. Eastwood,\nAgent for Indian Affairs,\nPeterborough Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Eastwood:\n\nI am writing this letter on behalf of Lillian Bigwin an Indian girl from Alderville who attended our school last year.\n\nShe was registered in grade 9. In June she was promoted to grade 10.\n\nHer mother requests that I write to you to the effect that Lillian would like to return to our school this fall to continue her studies.\n\nWe hope you will do all you can on her behalf.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. N. McKenzie\nPrincipal.\nAugust 31st, 1949.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nRe: Tuition Grants - Your File 25-3 (25)\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, the Department approves the following tuition grants:\n\n1. Eric McCue: Grant of $200.00 for academic year 1949-50.\n\n2. Louis Taylor: Grant of $10.00 for the purchase of books. The Department will also pay school fees.\n\n3. Thelma Taylor: $10.00 to purchase books and also school fees.\n\nNote: In the case of the two Taylor children, it is understood from your letter that if further assistance is necessary, you will write later.\n\n4. Rice Lake Band Students: For the pupils from this band who wish to attend Peterborough Collegiate, we will allow an amount of $125.00 each plus fees. It is noted that only two requests have been received so far, and that you will submit their applications later.\n\n5. Alnwick Band Students: The Department will allow $120.00 plus fees in the case of each pupil whom\nyou consider should attend high school at Cobourg. It is understood that this grant will not be allowed for repeaters, and that you will forward us a list of the pupils from this band who intend to study at Cobourg Collegiate during the academic year 1949-50.\n\n6. Carolyn Marsden: The Department will allow the same grant for 1949-50 as we allowed for the past academic year. It is noted that she will attend Cobourg Collegiate.\n\n7. Lillian Bigwin: As she has passed to Grade 10, the Department will allow the same grant for 1949-50 as we allowed for the past academic year.\n\n8. Lucille Cowie: I think you will agree that her marks are very unsatisfactory, and it is not our usual practice to renew a grant when a pupil has failed to obtain promotion. Do you feel that it would be advisable to allow the grant she requests? We might be prepared to consider allowing her a grant from September 1st to December 31st, and if her progress is still unsatisfactory at the end of December, the grant would be cancelled. Please let us hear further from you regarding this girl's request.\n\n9. Elgie Marsden: What has been stated regarding Lucille Cowie applies also in this case. Has she been medically examined, and is she in proper physical condition to again attend school? We would like to hear further from you.\n\n10. Roger Murray Crowe: Has this boy been medically examined recently? If not, you can no doubt arrange to have him examined as we wish to be assured that he is in good physical condition before approving a grant.\nWe have also received your letter of August 24th commenting on the letter which we received from Mrs. Robert Cowie.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

This was approved in our letter of August 31st.\n\nWe have now received from you Voucher No. 372 reading, \"Board - Eric McGue from September 12th to 23rd - $20.00\". This Voucher has been paid. We have also received Voucher No. 393 reading \"Board for Eric McGue from September 26th to October 7th\".\n\nAre we to understand that the parents are not paying their share of the cost as they promised to do? Our grant of $200.00 a year works out at $20.00 an academic month. For the period September 1st, 1949, to March 31st, 1950, the amount due from the Department would be $140.00.\n\nAs we have already paid $20.00, we are forwarding you an accountable advance of $120.00 representing our share of the tuition for this boy for the period October 1st to March 31st. In April 1950, you should apply for an advance of $60.00 for the balance of the academic year.

His health failed. After a keen examination, the Doctor affirms that the scholar could proceed his studies. Everything now rests in your power, if such be possible to realize the boy's ideal. He belongs to a peaceful family, and has had an excellent conduct since he left school. At times, he has been employed at the Atlantic Trading Store, showing that he is honest and serious.\n\nOn Mr. Thibault's last visit, the boy himself solicited our kind inspector for the necessary grant, to cover the three years' course at the Rimouski Technical School. This explains, why I am including \"The Prospectus\" of the said school, where you will be able to consider that $220.00 yearly would be required for the board and studies.\n\nThe parents are able to provide for the traveling expenses and clothing.\n\nThe members of the Technical School of Rimouski, have the great privilege of rooming & boarding with the Seminary students thus giving them a good social education, and religious environment.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist.\nRestigouche, July 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include a letter received from the Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist requesting the privilege to help the boy John Lavigne to perform his school at the Rimouski Technical School for three years.\n\nMr Inspector Thibault on his last visit has examined this question and is in the condition to inform the Department about this case, for Myself, if any possibility to do something I recommend this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 14, 1941.\n\nReverend Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, which recommends John Lavigne for a technical education.\n\nOn checking over this boy's classroom record, I find that he went as high as the Seventh Grade.

I would like to know if I have to teach that grade besides the first eight grades that I already have.\n\nAs you know, this pupil underwent an appendic operation last fall which kept her at home a month. It is easy to see that she did no more than her year's work this year. Nevertheless, she has succeeded and is ready to do Grade XI work.\n\nWith schools opened nine months only, it will be difficult for her to complete her year's work and prepare for writing Matriculation examinations. I would suggest that arrangements be made, if possible, to secure her room and board so she can attend Dalhousie College. We have heard of the Department sponsoring a course for advanced grades.\n\nMay I add, that I am not making this request for any personal points of view; if should my request not be granted, I will teach her grade classes, although, like many other teachers...\nit will be a new experience to me.\n\nIt is the first time in the history of the Eel River Bar Indian Day School that a pupil has the cleverness, courage and ambition to secure an education and I feel proud of such an ideal. I would not like to see her abandon her work or fail in her final examinations, that is why I am bringing up this matter for consideration for I feel, I could not like to take the risk of preparing a pupil for writing matriculation papers after only nine months of school.\n\nHoping the Department will give this matter its immediate attention, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlice M.

In the case of this boy it is noted that the course will be for 3 years and the total expenditure, $660. It is impossible for the Department to consider making this grant, and you should advise Lavigne and those interested accordingly.\n\nThere is a great scarcity of labour at the present time, and this boy should have no difficulty in obtaining work. Some attempt should be made to have him apprenticed in some industry, where he will not only earn enough to keep himself, but will have an opportunity of learning some trade that would be useful to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nRestigouche, August 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to ask the Department if it will be possible to send again this September Robert Metallic to Ottawa to terminate the three years accepted by the Department.\n\nI have not received any report from this College, but I suppose you received it directly like last year. This young Indian here on the Reserve shows a good example and good conduct. I recommend the continuation of his course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department will allow for the academic year 1941-42 the same grant as last year for Robert Metallic. It is understood that this will be the last year for which a grant will be paid for him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received from our Indian Agent at Restigouche, P.E.I., an application of pupil of Indian School for a tuition grant, along with a letter stating that the Department does not encourage Indian girls to get academic training but would finance a vocational course of not exceeding one year, if applied for.\n\nThis letter was a great disappointment to both teacher and pupil, for I believe in giving a chance to any individual, regardless of race, to follow the career he or she is best fitted for. This child is living in a rather unfortunate environment. Her parents disagree as to her choice of training. I had always thought she liked the teaching profession but I know now, her mind is set on being a nurse. She has all the qualities needed to be a success at the School of Nursing.\n\nThe cost of training in our local county hospitals is rather low especially during the second and third years as compared to any other training.\n\nThis pupil has completed Grade X work and is ready to start Grade XI's work in Sept.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42026-3, part 2)\nIn order to prepare for writing Matriculation, I would like the Department to allow me to fill out and return this Application form asking for free tuition for doing Grade X work at the Sacrament Convent where all the High School grades are taught.\n\nHere are the reasons for asking this favor:\n\n1. During her grade ten, this pupil lost a month of school on account of an appendix operation. She needs a full school-year for Grade X. The schools on our Reserve are closed a whole month.\n\n2. I have the first eight graders. I have never taught Grade X and wouldn't like to attempt to prepare a pupil for writing Matriculation papers.\n\n3. I would like to see her take her grade X where the scientific experiments are performed. In rural schools, there is a considerable lack of adequate supplies to work with.\n\nI am sending this letter directly to the Department rather than through the Indian Office, to avoid delay.\n\nI would like the Department to consider this application favorably and let me know at its earliest convenience, for our Public School opens early next month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlice M. Heppell,\nTeacher at Eel River Bar Indian Day School,\nDarlington, N.B.\nOttawa, August 11, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the application for a tuition grant for Marguerite Pictou.\n\nVery careful consideration was given to this request before replying to the Indian Agent. Unless under very unusual circumstances, the Department doubts the advisability of encouraging Indian girls to take academic training. We would be much more inclined to assist this girl if she attended a vocational course, especially if this course could be covered in a year's time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Alice M.

On July 16 Mr. Phelan wrote to the Indian agent, Dr. Richard, asking him for a report on this girl, the progress she had made at school, her health, character etc. Dr. Richard's reply to that letter, which is dated August 15, did not reach us until this morning. It is scarcely necessary to state that in a period as critical as the one in which we find ourselves officials of this Department are not permitted to make such grants until the fullest possible investigation of each case has been undertaken and completed.\n\nThe claim of this girl for a tuition grant will be now carefully reviewed and reviewed rather sympathetically. May I thank you for your interest in this particular case and for the courtesy that\n\nRev. F.C. Ryan,\nRoute No. 1,\nNewcastle, N.B.\nprompted you to bring it to my personal attention.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S. I am enclosing herewith copy of Dr. Richard's letter of August 16. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\nOttawa,\nAugust 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 15 and also an application form filled in by you sent forward therewith.\n\nIt is noted that this girl, in a letter to Father Ryan dated August 11, states:\n\n\"If I do not get any Government help this year I will have to get a room in town and attend school there.\"\n\nIn view of the limited funds at our disposal, and the reluctance of the Government to provide grants other than grants for vocational courses, I have been wondering if it would be possible for this girl to make arrangements for the completion of her course in town. If she can do this the Department would be prepared to allow her a tuition grant not exceeding $100.00. In view of the fact that schools are likely to open in September I should appreciate it very much if you would give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nUpper Clark, N.B.\nSept 1, 1941\n\nTo Arthur Richard,\nRestigouche, P.E.\n\nDear Mr. Richard,\n\nI have received your letter of Aug. 28th informing me that the Department is prepared to allow Marguerite Pieton a tuition grant of $100.00.\n\nAfter consulting both pupil and her parents, I have decided to accept this grant providing it is not below $100.00. This means that the idea of boarding will have to be abandoned. Instead she will have to get a room, and board herself. I cannot supply the name of the rooming-house, yet but I'll know this week. The Department may either send the money directly or else send it in my name and I'll attend to it. That's just to make matters easier for both the Department and my pupil.\n\nAt any rate, we'll do our best to get that scanty allowance. I hope there won't be any delay in getting it.\n\nVery gratefully yours,\n\nAlice M. Hoppell.\nRestigouche, September 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20 ultimo regarding tuition grant to Marguerite Pictou, Eel River Reserve, I beg to include a letter received from the Teacher Miss Alice Heppell about the decision taken for this girl.\n\nAs by your letter a tuition grant of $100.00 have been granted for this girl, I would be pleased to hear from the Department how this grant will be paid. This girl will have to pay for room every month and a certain amount might be sent to Miss Heppell to look after this girl. The schools in N.B. are opening on 16 sept.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: September 8, 1941.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Restigouche Indian Agency Trust Account | $50.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nDr. A.

When he visited the Department I promised him that we would allow the usual tuition grant for him for one more year. As a matter of fact we had not intended to allow any further grant for him after the end of June, 1942. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of August 8, 1941. However, it should be definitely understood by all parties concerned that the academic year 1942-43 is the last for which we can allow any grant for this boy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nTo Dr Art. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRistigouche,\nQue.\n\nRecommendation for Alphonse Metallic.\n\nKnowing well the young Alphonse Metallic, my altar boy, for the striking contrast of his good manners, politeness, devoutness in all kinds of social practices, his keen understanding in matters of scholarship and after special examination having found solid his will of spending his lifetime for the social welfare of others, I feel it my duty to recommend this boy to your benevolent acceptation as a beginner in High-College training.\n\nFather Lucien, parish-priest.\nDear Sir,\n\nI do not suppose that the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs will think that I am abusing of your kindness by humbly asking the Department for a grant of $10.00 monthly to be paid to the Servite Fathers of Ottawa, in favor of a boy of the Senior class of the Restigouche Day School, who wishes to become like his brother, a priest. The student is brother to Robert Metallic, the privileged pupil, whom the Honourable Department is protecting since the last three years and continues to do so for this coming scholar year.\n\nI have the pleasure to hear that Robert is answering admirably well to your generous grant, by his good conduct, application, and serious reasoning.\n\nThe total board is $17.00 a month. You will notice that I have obtained from the Fathers, a copious reduction of $7.00 a month, leaving the board $10.00.\n\nAlphonse Metallic, the 15 year old boy in question has worked on the Steamers all summer, and has earned enough of his own saving, to pay his yearly expenses, clothing and fair. Such perseverance and good will merit encouragements, since we so rarely meet similar eagerness and enthusiasm.\n\nTo my opinion, the members of the Honourable Staff of Indian Affairs would congratulate themselves in years to come, of having protected the said child.\n\nI am soliciting your benevolent help for one year only. We will then see if he proves himself worthy of it. Trusting you will give my request your traditional sympathetic attention, I am,\n\nVery gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42026-3, part 2)\nOttawa,\nSeptember 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nRe: Alphonse Metalic\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 4th instant, written on behalf of the above-noted Indian pupil. In this connection I am sending forward a letter addressed by me a few days ago to Mr. Arsenault. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. We are, at the present time, acting under definite instructions not to encourage Indian boys to take up academic or classical courses. The officials here feel that such boys should be encouraged to take up vocational or semi-vocational courses at recognized technical schools. Apart from this policy, however, it is noted that a tuition grant has already been granted to the brother of this boy and it would be very unusual indeed to assist two boys in the one family.

She proved docile and interested and likes to complete the course this year should you judge proper that the Department pay her board.\n\nBrigitte Martin is 14 and attended Carleton School directed by the Sisters of Charity, for the\nAcademic Years 1943-44 and 1944-45.\n\nWe have lately been informed that the child was maintained at said school by the National Defense, as her father is still in active service. So please cancel her name.\n\nInstead of the latter we have chosen Vivian Jerome, 18 years old, who attended Maria Indian Day School for the last year in 1942-43 and who would appreciate a year of vocational training.\n\nBeing newly appointed here, we had in mind to promote the activities of our predecessor, Sr. Mary of Mercy.\n\nNevertheless, we have been somewhat thoughtful since we read in one of yours dated September 16, 1943 - that a salary was granted to Sister Mary of Mercy on the distinct understanding that she would arrange to carry out the full programme of vocational\ntraining outlined by Mr. Doucet,\" and\nthis \"should obviate the necessity in\nfuture of having to send pupils to other\nschools.\"\n\nIf this is still your intention we\nask to be advised that we may strive\nduring the Academic year 1945-46 to\ncreate the mentality amongst the In-\ndian girls that their school answers\nperfectly to their needs and to carry\nout the programme so as to meet with\ntheir requirements.\n\nPlease let us know your opinion\non the question.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nS.

We had in mind that only the girls who had made good showing in the Maria School and who would take full advantage of additional education would receive this privilege.\n\nI trust that you will keep our wishes in mind in future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Sr. M. of St. Adeline,\nSuperior and Principal,\nHoly Rosary Convent,\nRimouski, Quebec.\nOttawa, October 1, 1945.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of August 29, in which I requested to be advised regarding Mary Condo and Anna Caplin.

It aims at preparing girls to face their duties as mother and wife and teaches them practically all domestic sciences. A third year is recommended to specialize in one subject. This course gives a certificate. This is the course our\nIndian girls are following.\n\nOn leaving Pinawa Vocational Training School the Indian girls might be able to give demonstrations to young ladies and even married women but one of the teachers would necessarily have to organize a club and act as supervisor.\n\nWith the hope that this answer somewhat answers yours of October 11th I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.M.

Miss Vivian objected that her services were requested at home. Actually we do not wish to replace her as we like to study the mentality of our Indian girls which seems to be a \"fickle-minded\" one.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nPhilip Phelps, Chief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nHoly Rosary Convent,\nRimouski, February 8, 1946.\n\nTo the Honorable Superintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nAllow me to send you the state of accounts for our Indian girls that you protect so benevolently. Since September, we have three girls at our Home Economics School. The Department pays the board of two, the other one is taken care of by her father, soldier; but there is nothing given to pay for the material needed to learn sewing, knitting, weaving, etc...\n\nWe have already asked you $16.00 thinking it would cover all the expenses, but the amount has come up to $32.31. So, you see we are under balance by $16.31. Prospecting the expenses from now until June, the girls shall still need more than $16.00.\n\nSo, may you please, allow us to use the money\u2014that is $33.00\u2014that would have been paid for Vivian Jerome absent in January and might be so for a part of February. We feel sorry that sickness keeps her away from continuing her course regularly, for she and her companions are studious and attentive to their work and would be apt to render services to their families and surroundings.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42026-3, part 2)\nTo the Honourable Superintendent\n\nI trust that your kindness will comply with our request to cover all the expenses of the year and I pray you agree the expression of my gratitude.\n\nVery respectfully and gratefully yours\n\nSister Marie-Ange\nPrincipal\n\u00c9cole Minagoue R\u00e9gionale\nOttawa, February 19, 1946.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letters of February 8 and February 11, in connection with the Indian girls who are attending the Holy Rosary Convent. It is noted that Vivian Jerome did not return to the Convent on January 1 and consequently we are unable to allow any payment for her for the months of January and February.\n\nYou may forward a detailed statement of the materials which you have supplied to these girls. No mention of any charge for materials was made when Sister Mary of St. Adeline, Principal of the Maria School, requested authority to send the girls to the Holy Rosary Convent.\n\nYou should also submit another account for Therese Vicaire for the months of January and February.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Arsenault, Indian Agent\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you be kind enough to ask the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs for two special grants for two pupils of the Restigouche Indian Day School who have just completed their 8th Grade and would like to make higher studies.\n\nOne scholar John Henry Isaac, 15 years of age, son of Peter Isaac would like to become a wood scaler. He is very intelligent, has always attended school regularly and I have reasons to believe he could make a good living out of that speciality. His parents would pay his transportation and all that is required in the prospectus.\n\nThe other student is Eleanore Gedeon daughter of Thomas Gedeon, age 15 very bright, would desire to follow a business course. His father states of being able to obtain a position for her in the same office where he has been working for the last 19 years, in Dalhousie Paper Co. I recommend her as a decent and willing child. She would certainly make her complete business course in a very short time. Since these two pupil had their 7th grade Certificate granted them by the Department of Public Education of the Province of Quebec last year and have made, this year, their 8th grade, they are admitted into the 1st year of High School at St.-Michael's Academy fo Chatham, N.B. for $250.00 a year each.\n\nMr. Gedeon promises also to pay transportation & provide the child with all the requirements of the prospectus Academy.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n(Sgd) Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist\n\nMany Thanks.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttached hereto copy of a letter from the Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School recommending two Indian pupils namely John Henry Isaac and Eleanore Gedeon both of the Restigouche Reserve for a higher class of education.\n\nI recommend these two students for the courses mentioned in the Principal's letter for the good reason that these children have always attended school regularly and have certainly made sacrifices to obtain their 7th grade Certificate and moreover completed their 8th grade. Since these children are anxious to take higher studies it would give an example on the Reserve if they ever go through with the course on the other hand if the Department refuses this grant it would probably create a certain problem or reason for other children in not continuing their studies.\n\nYour immediate answer would be appreciated in this matter.\n\nE. Arsenault\nIndian agent.\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, August 6th, 1947.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant with reference to John Henry Isaac and Eleanore Gideon who wish to attend St. Michael's Academy, Chatham, N.B., during the coming academic year.\n\nEnclosed are two of our regular forms. One should be prepared for each of the two children mentioned in your letter. On the reverse side you will note there is space for a medical examination and this side of the form should also be fully completed by the medical officer.\n\nAs soon as return these forms we will give the request further consideration.\n\nBernard F.

I have already submitted my opinion on this subject to our benevolent Ottawa Inspectors, particularly Mr. A.J. Doucet and they have approved my desire but I have always been prevented to do so due to lack of a proper apprentice shop.\n\nThis week I have discovered a bilingual barber academy in Moncton, N.B., which gives complete courses on the said profession. If the student is applied he can obtain his Diploma in four months for $135.00. The board is $10.00 a week and the necessary tools to begin with cost $30.00. Thus making a total cost of $225.00 for the complete course.\n\nWould the Honourable Department of Indian Affairs accept to pay this course in favour of Jimmy Lavigne, young Indian of 28 years of age who would be delighted to take this profession. He has a piece of land and an old house near his home where he could begin his barber shop.\n\nI have hopes that he would prove worthy of this profession. Kindly forward us the necessary forms for more precise informations if the Honourable Department accept my humble proposal.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, R.S.R.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42026-3, part 2)\nOttawa, March 30, 1948.\n\nMr. E.

However, before doing so we wish to have one of our regular forms completed. I enclose this and you will note on the second page that we require a statement of the health of this boy.\n\nPlease have this form returned to us as we will then be in a position to decide what amount we can allow.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nDalhousie, N.

Since the Department has already given the above part payments in September, we cannot submit accounts to the amount of $30.00 for the Months of October, November and December, as this will not correspond to the allowance given for the grant, that is $120.00 for this school term, as per a copy of a letter we have here from the Superintendent of Education, Bernard F. Neary of Ottawa, dated October 15, 1948.\n\nKindly let us know if the extras paid by the Department in September will be deducted from this said grant of $120.00 at the end of December. If so, we shall get in touch with the parents to pay these extras before the new year. Now that we know the parents agreed to pay for extras, we shall send them accounts accordingly. Had we known that when the accounts for September were sent, there would not have been any misunderstanding.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd) Les Religieuses de Notre-Dame du Sacre Coeur.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42026-3, part 2)\nDecember 22, 1948.\n\nMr. C.R.

F. Neary  \nSupt. of Education.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd inst., in connection with Indian children attending Provincial Schools, I wish to state that your list is exact with the exception of One Jean Narvie from Mel River Reserve.\n\nAn application in favour of Jean Narvie has been submitted to the Dept. together with my letter dated November 30, 1948, since we are still waiting for a reply to this letter, Jean Narvie has not been attending school as yet.\n\nWould you kindly inform the writer as per the content of my letter dated November 30, 1948.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated in order that this pupil may be advised accordingly.\n\n(C.R.

Que.\n\nWith reference to the above noted pupil I wish to submit the following report:\n\nRecently, the Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School visited this office. Her main reason for doing so was to enquire if an application had been submitted for authority to send the above mentioned girl to a vocational school.\n\nUpon interviewing the Principal the latter stated that a request had been made to Mr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent at the time. I have checked our files and as much as I can find, I gather no application was ever made in this case.\n\nThe Principal also stated that Miss T. Vicaire attended the Holy Rosary Vocational School at Rimouski, P.Q. approximately two years and was kept home during the academic year of 1947-1948 and as much as we can ascertain, her mother was the cause of it due to her health condition.\n\nSince this girl was doing very good at school and anxious to return for one more year to complete her course, the Principal took for granted that the application would be approved and made the necessary arrangements with the Principal of the School at Rimouski for her admission.\nThe result is now that Miss Therese Vicaire has been attending the Rimouski School since the opening in September at a cost of $35.00 per Month.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, I have made no promise to the Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School that this expenditure would be paid by the Department, however, due to the fact that this girl has already spent two years at this school and that another year would permit her to complete her course, I would strongly recommend that a grant of $350.00 covering the whole year of schooling be approved.\n\nI have interviewed Miss Vicaire today, who is back on the Reserve for the Holidays and stated that She was doing well and was anxious to return after the holidays.\n\nI would therefore appreciate an early reply concerning this matter.\n\ncc.\n\n(C.R. Nadeau) Supt.,\nRestigouche Indian Agency.\n6th January, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Nadeau,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nRestigouche, P.E.\n\nWe have your letter of 22nd December, 1948, regarding a tuition grant for Therese Vicaire.\n\nOn reviewing our file, we cannot find any previous request for a tuition grant for this girl. However, in view of the information contained in your letter, we will allow a tuition grant of $350.00 for the academic year 1948-49.\n\nI enclose one of our regular forms which you should have completed and returned, so that our file will be complete.\n\nWe are also in receipt of your letter of 27th December, 1948, regarding a tuition grant for Jean Narvie. In her case, we will allow a tuition grant of $250.00 for the academic year 1948-49. This is the amount requested on the application form submitted to us by the former Superintendent.\n\nBernard F.

It was reported by the Principal of the Indian Day School that his behaviour was not the best and that the school was not compelled to teach the 9th. grade, apparently this child left school on account of discipline.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Peter Isaac, mother of the child together with Sister M. of the Holy Eucharist, Principal of the Restigouche Indian Day School, have made the necessary arrangements to send the child to the Campbellton Academy School where brothers are teaching, the boy has been attending since January 1st.\n\nMrs. Isaac called at this office and asked if the Department would be kind enough to pay for the tuition and the books.\n\nWe have made inquiries to that effect and the tuition fee is $5.00 per Month and the necessary books costs approximately $12.00.\n\nDue to the fact that this boy cannot be taught higher than the 8th. grade, I would recommend that the amount of $42.00 be authorized for this purpose.\n\n(C.R.

I find that her first duty is to tend to her babies yet at home and deserves to have\na $15.00 grant to provide for Arthur's books, ferry & thitins.\n\nThe yearly grant requested for this child for making his 10th Grade of High School is $150.00\n\nThanking you,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Eucharist\nPrincipal\nPortigouche Indian Day School\nPortigouche, P.E.I.\nJuly 20, 1949\n\nMrs. C.R. Macdonald, Sup't of Ind. Agency\nPortigouche, P.E.I.\n\nDear Mrs. Macdonald,\n\nI have been informed by the Principal of Sisters of the Sacred Heart Academy that their college was being transferred from St. Joseph, N.B., to Moncton, N.B., into a modern fireproof College and that the Board of Directors was raised to $370.00 instead of $350.00. This will mean that $20.00 more would be needed for Eleonore and Ruth's grant.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSister Mary of the Holy Enchant.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Application for Tuition Grants Renewal for the Academic Year 1949-1950.\n\nWith reference to the above I wish to submit the following report for the renewal of tuition grants for the undermentioned pupils whom have attended Convents and Colleges last year.\n\nAs the yearly cost for tuition, board etc. has been increased for the coming year, a larger amount for each student is being requested.\n\n1. Eleanor Gedeon, Academie N.D. de S.C. St. Joseph, N.B.\n   Tuition, Board, etc. $390.00\n\n2. Ruth Bernard, Academie N.D. du S.C. St. Joseph, N.B.\n   Tuition, Board, etc. $390.00\n\n3.

No answer has been given to questions\n6, 7, 8, 9 and 11. The information required by\nthese questions must be supplied on the form before\nhis application can be given consideration.\n\nWith reference to the application for\ntuition grant for Anita Narvie, you write as follows:\n\n\"This child's mother died about 2\nmonths ago. Would recommend her to Dalhousie\nConvent providing tuition grant given for\nsister Jean.\"\n\n......2\nThe same questions are unanswered on this form as are unanswered on the application form for Alfred Narvie. In any case, this girl has only attained 7th Grade. It is not our practice to send children to white institutions until they have completed their 8th Grade.\n\nIt is noted, however, that the child's mother died, and we feel that it would be advisable to place her in the Shubenacadie Residential School where she can complete her 8th Grade work. If her sister \"Jean\" to whom you refer is not over 16 years of age, she could also attend the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nYou should let us have further information regarding the 3 Narvie children at the earliest possible date.\n\nBernard F.

J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Vocational Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet,\n\nAt the end of July I have forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Education the Tuition grant forms in order to place three new pupils in High Schools in New Brunswick and two in a vocational school in Montreal. Their names were Brennie Labellois and James Caplin. Mr. C.R. Nadeau, Superintendent of Indian Agency received a reply that you would personally Mr. Doucet, obtain the place in Montreal for Brennie Labellois and nothing was mentioned concerning James Caplin.\n\nThis is no doubt due to my letter dated July 11th, in which I requested for Brennie alone as James' parents could not afford to pay his clothes and transportation.

I have been asked to write to you regarding this matter since the student is a good intelligent girl and I am told the Indian Agent looking after the Scugog Indians has done nothing to assist her.\n\nTrusting that this matter may be investigated soon to assist this Indian girl who is at present going 2\u00bd miles to catch our School Bus.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Crane,\nPrincipal.\nOctober 13th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.J.

Lyons, Virginia, Ontario, and as soon as his reply is received, we will write to you again.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 42027-3 (E.I.) of Oct. 18 re. Jay Edgar attending Port Perry high school. Jay Edgar attended public school on Seagoy and traveled the same distance night and morning as she does now to meet the bus. Due to the fact that ninety percent of the land on Seagoy Reserve is taxable I can see no reason why this bus service for school children is set at any given point.\n\nWith your permission I will see the Clerk of Seagoy Township and discuss this problem as I expect the taxes from Indian land would warrant bus service for this girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J. Lyons\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42027-3, part 1)\nNovember 2nd, 1949.\n\nMr. W.J. Lyons,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nVirginia, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd ultimo,\nyour file 25-8-10, with reference to the request\nthat has been received for assistance for Faye Edgar,\nwho is attending Port Perry High School.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you\nin the near future. At that time, you should let\nus know the fee charged by the Port Perry High School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nTo whom it may Concern -\n\nWith regard to Faye Edgar's work and progress at school I find that she has failed in English. However I do not consider this a serious matter as it may be due to her home surroundings. In all other subjects her work seems to be quite satisfactory. She seems to have a genuine interest in school and gets a good deal out of the various sports in which she is actively engaged. I should say that her progress is quite favourable and her schooling is beneficial to her.\n\nJ. L.

However, after a discussion with the Principal of the High School and a careful review of the cases of each one that failed, the following pupils are recommended for an opportunity to repeat their last year's studies and to receive the usual grant:\n\nBernice Anderson    Gary Capton\nLois Hill           Sylvia Hill\n\nThe following pupils passed their Entrance last year and are recommended by the Inspector to proceed direct to High School, and this office would recommend their receiving the usual grants:\n\n-continued\nNorma Moses          Elaine Smith\nLeona Vanevery       Vivian Smith\nWallace Bomberry     Clara Hill\nJune Lickers         Wilma Hill\nLena King            Peter Hill\nBarbara Jamieson     Fern Moses\nAnita Hill           Leslie Doctor\n\nThe results for the Upper School pupils for last year are not yet known, but this office will communicate further with regard to the grants required for them.\n\nLt.-Col.

As you know it has not been the practice of the Department to allow grants in such cases and we cannot see our way clear at the present time to make any change in regulations that have been in effect for several years.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSix Nations Council Resolution No.13, Sept.6/45.\n\nThe Council by the above resolution approved of paying the tuition fees for eight children in order they may continue their education at High School. The first three pupils named were attending High School last year but owing to the fact they were unable to win promotion, are not eligible for Departmental grants this year, consequently their parents who wish them to continue, appealed to the Council and they saw fit to consent to paying the fees.\n\nThe remaining pupils are all successful Entrance pupils but whose standing after the examinations was not sufficiently high in the opinion of the Inspector to warrant him recommending them for Departmental grants. The Department will appreciate that examination marks are not always a true criterion of the ability of pupils, so this office is of the opinion that the pupils concerned should have the benefit of the doubt and be given an opportunity to continue their education under the assistance given them by the Council.\n\nUpon approval being received from the Department this office will make the usual arrangements with the High Schools concerned and have the tuition fee invoices separated from those actually paid by the Department.\n\nThe pupils concerned are: Margaret Mt.Pleasant, Garry Capton, Gwen Smith, Leonard Staats Jr., Alva Hill, Geraldine Burnham, Vera Vanevery and Howard Vanevery.\n\nLt.-Col.E.P.Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nCROSS REFERENCE SHEET\n\nEXTRACT FROM, OR PRECIS OF, COMMUNICATION DATED 13-9-45\n\nWRITTEN BY E.

The amount of money necessary for each pupil is in the neighbourhood of $170.00. Therefore, an expenditure of approximately $1,360.00 from Band Funds is necessary.\n\nSuperintendent Randle recommends the expenditure and I would be pleased to have the approval of the Minister. The balance to the credit of the Six Nations Revenue Account No. 33 is $56,151.54.\n\nActing Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThis office would request approval for Jerry Longboat, son of Gordon Longboat, to attend S.S.No.8, Oneida Township.\n\nThis child is in the same position as the Peters children, who are already attending this school, as his parents live on the extreme eastern boundary of the Reserve, and it is too far for him to go to our nearest school.\n\nThe tuition fee charged by the Oneida School Board will be approximately $15.00, and if approved the account will be submitted with that of the Peters children.\n\nLt.-Col.

Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nThis is further to our telephone conversation this morning. I understand that the Indian Affairs Branch pay the tuition fees of Indian children who have passed the entrance examinations and have to attend high school outside the reservation. I also am informed that a grant of $100 per child for clothing, etc., is given to these children.\n\nRuth Fraser of Oshweken, daughter of Joseph Fraser, a Six-Nation Indian, is in her third year at the Ontario Bible School, Fort Erie, Ontario. She is 17 years of age.\n\nThis is to request that the tuition fee and the grant usually given to children from this reservation attending Caledonia High School or Brantford Collegiate be allowed to Miss Fraser.\n\nThe calendar of this institution shows that the curriculum is similar to that of the high schools in Ontario, including English, geography, history, mathematics, general science, languages, etc., with additional bible training. I am enclosing for your information a certificate from the principal of this institution as to Miss Fraser's qualifications and progress in her school work.\n\nWill you kindly let me know at your earliest convenience what decision is reached in respect of this application?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42032-3, part 15)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 15, 1946.\n\nLt.-Colonel E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent, Brantford, Ont.\n\nI have received a request for a tuition grant for Ruth Fraser, who is stated to be a daughter of Joseph Fraser, of Ohweken.\n\nThis girl is 17 years of age and is in her third year at the Ontario Bible School, Fort Erie, Ontario. The calendar of this institution shows that the curriculum is similar to that of the high schools in Ontario and Miss Fraser is stated to be now in Grade XI. I would appreciate receiving a report from you at the earliest possible date in regard to the above request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nI believe there is considerable merit in Mr. Webster's suggestion, and I arranged with Colonel Randle to interview several bus lines that operate in the vicinity of Brantford, to ascertain the cost of transportation.\n\nWhen the above information is available, I will submit the matter to you again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRe: Tuition Grants for Indian Children Attending High Schools, and Collegiate Institutes.\n\nIn connection with the above, you are aware that for some years past, it has been our policy to authorize the attendance of certain Indian children of the Six Nations Reserve at Brantford Collegiate Institute, and Hagersville High School. In each case, we have been responsible for the tuition fee, and have also allowed $100.00 to the parents for extra expenses, that they were obliged to provide for their children.\n\nWhen I was in Brantford last week, I discussed the above situation with the Indian Superintendent, Colonel Randle, and the Public School Inspector, Mr. Webster, who inspects the Indian Day Schools, and Six Nations and New Credit Reserves.\n\nDuring the course of our conversation, I was informed that in many cases the parents of children have to provide a considerable amount more than we allow. This is caused by purchasing extra clothing, and in some cases, providing for the maintenance of children in Brantford. In other cases, especially girls, they live in a white home, and do housework for their maintenance, but attend school during the day. This practice has not always worked out very satisfactorily, as some employers oblige the girls to work until a very late hour in the evening. In other cases, when the girls are allowed out to attend a show etc., it has been found difficult to have them return home at a reasonable hour.\n\nMr. Webster felt that it would be advisable for us to consider the possibility of transporting the children to and from the Reserve each day. Judging from his experience, in certain communities outside of Brantford, he felt that we can secure transportation for considerably less than the amount of $100.00 that we now allow for each pupil.\nJune 22, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn case the report on Indian Schools does not reach your offices before the close of the school term I am writing this special letter regarding Miss Gladys Hill and Miss Bird Rose.\n\nYou will recall that we discussed the advisability of Miss Hill attending the Primary Course in Hamilton and I am instructing her to contact Col. Randle by way of making arrangement for financial assistance. I would like to recommend that Miss Rose also be given an opportunity of attending the Music Course in Toronto this summer. I feel that she lacks the training in class instruction although well qualified otherwise. She has sent in her application, so that should the recommendation go through, she will be prepared to attend. A copy of this letter is being mailed to Col. Randle.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJCW/w\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42032-3, part 15)\nJune 28, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Webster:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to Miss Gladys Hill and Miss Bird Rose.\n\nI have not yet heard from Colonel Randle, but when he writes the recommendation will receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nOn May 13th I wrote you respecting a grant of $100. as tuition fees for Miss Ruth Fraser of Oshweken. Miss Fraser is the daughter of Mr. Joseph Fraser, a Six-Nation Indian and is a student at the Ontario Bible School, Fort Erie, Ontario. She is 17 years of age.\n\nYour Mr. Neary informed me recently that there was no evidence that Miss Fraser had passed the entrance examinations and that the principal of the Ontario Bible School was being contacted to find out what her standing is. Following this, I wrote Mr. Fraser explaining the delay. He himself got in touch with the principal of the school who forwarded a letter to me which I am enclosing for your information.\n\nI think this should settle the matter as to her standing and I hope it will soon be adjusted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMCS/NJ\nEncl.\nJuly 23, 1946\n\nMr. Mark Senn\nHouse of Commons\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter addressed to Mr. Joseph Fraser and dated July 18, has been referred to me by Mrs. Fraser with a request that I write a brief letter to clarify the question concerning her daughter's High School Entrance Certificate.\n\nMiss Ruth Fraser was admitted to Ontario Bible School in September 1943 upon presentation of a High School Certificate duly signed at Paris, Ontario on July 5, 1943. The Certificate was signed by Mr. J. Campbell Webster B. A., and Mr. C. Ward Butcher B. A.\n\nTrusting that this statement will serve to clear the matter regarding Miss Fraser's High School Certificate.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42032-3, part 15)\nOttawa, July 29, 1946.\n\nLt. Col. E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nTuition Grant for Ruth Fraser.\n\nReference your 2004/46 of 10th July, 1946.\n\nWe have this day received a letter from the Principal of the Bible School at Fort Erie, Ontario, in which he states that Miss Fraser was admitted to his school in September 1943 upon presentation of a High School Certificate duly signed at Paris, Ontario on July 5, 1943. This certificate was signed by Mr. J. Campbell Webster, B.A., and Mr. C. Ward Butcher B.A.\n\nI am attaching the tuition grant forms for application so that we can arrange to have Miss Fraser's fees for 1945-46 paid to the Bible School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJuly 28, 1946\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of July 16 in which you make inquiry concerning Miss Ruth Fraser's High School Certificate. I recently had occasion to review some of Miss Fraser's school records on some other business and noted that her High School Entrance Certificate bears the date of July 5, 1943 and was properly signed. I do not know the name of the school she was attending at that time but I could get it by corresponding with her parents and send it to you later if you so desire.\n\nMiss Fraser spent three years at Ontario Bible School and we found her to be a fine quiet girl of good moral standing. She did not rank high in scholastic standing but was quite diligent and faithful in her work. She was out of school at times for farm service at home during the critical years of the war and these absences no doubt had some bearing on her grades.\n\nWe trust that this information will be of service to you and if I can secure the name of the school Ruth was attending at the time of her Entrance Examinations, I will be pleased to send it on to you at a later date.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6485, file 42032-3, part 15)\nOttawa, July 29, 1946.\n\nE.L. Steckley, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nOntario Bible School,\nFort Erie North, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receiving your letter of July 25th, I wrote at once to Lieutenant Colonel E.P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ontario. I enclosed the application forms for tuition grants for Miss Ruth Fraser.\n\nWhen these forms are completed and if all is in accordance with our regulations we will forward you a cheque for her tuition fees.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The same circumstances apply to Jillian Burnham and Eleanor Jamieson, and these three pupils are all recommended for resumption of grants.\n\n--cont'd.\nWilma E. Jamieson is attending North Toronto Collegiate, being the daughter of Elmer Jamieson, a Six Nations Indian teaching in Toronto. In 1945-6 academic year she lead her class each term and was promoted, having obtained an average of 80.8%. Her parents would appreciate if the Department would make her the grant of $100.00, but tuition fees are not necessary, as the family reside in Toronto, but live on the Reserve each summer. This office would recommend your favourable consideration of this excellent young student.\n\nPatricia Styres failed to gain promotion at Caledonia High School, but is requesting consideration for a further grant, as last year she was recovering from considerable previous illness which put her backward.\n\nThe following pupils passed their Entrance Examinations and are recommended by the Inspector to receive grants. Several additional ones were recommended, but as they have not applied for grants we presume they do not intend to go on to High School.\n\n| Beaver, George | King, Jessie |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Doxtator, Raymond | Laforme, Reginald |\n| Fishcarrier, Henry | McNaughton, Reginald |\n| Garlow, Sarah | Montur, Raymond A. |\n| Hill, Reva | Smith, Barbara |\n| Hill, Joyce | Styres, Elsie |\n| Hill, Milton D. | Vanevery, Russell |\n\nThis office would appreciate your early reply in order the pupils and schools may be advised about receiving grants and fees, and we regret our delay, but were awaiting Upper School results.\n\nLt.-Col.

Jamieson. This family do not reside continuously on the Six Nations Reserve. We do not feel that we would be justified in allowing a grant in this case.\n\nI note that Patricia Styres failed and consequently will have to repeat the years work. As you know it is not our general practice to allow a grant in such a case and we can not see our way clear at the present time to make any change in the regulations that have been in effect for several years. However, if the Six Nations Band Council see fit to allow a grant from Band funds, I do not think that the Trust Branch will refuse permission.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThis will acknowledge your 103-32 (WT.1) of the 29th of August with reference to school grants, and this office appreciates your action in approving the various recommendations.\n\nWith reference to the Entrance pupils approved, we have since been advised that Milton D. Hill, Reginald Laforme and Raymond Doxtator, will not after all go on to High School this year.\n\nIt is therefore recommended their grants be transferred to Verna and Howard Vanevery - second year students at Hagersville High School, and to Ruth Fraser who has been attending the Bible School at Fort Erie and to whom recently the Department decided to give a grant for last year. She is continuing there, and we missed adding in her name because she was not on our permanent lists last year.\n\nVerna and Howard Vanevery passed their Entrance in 1945, but were not recommended by the Inspector so did not receive grants in the past academic year. However, they attended Hagersville High School, both won promotion and the Principal says they are two of the brightest Indian students he has ever had. In view of these facts, you will appreciate they both deserve this assistance from the Department.\n\nThere is also Delores Vanevery, who was recommended by the Inspector for a grant, but due to the fact that her parents did not contact this office, we omitted her name from our former request for grants. She is now attending High School and her parents have requested a grant for her. If it all possible, it would be appreciated if a grant could be given her.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P.

F.P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSix Nations Council Resolution No.4, Sept.11/47.\n\nThe Council voted to pay from Six Nations Funds the tuition fees of Gwen Smith, Vivian Smith, Norma Moses, and Barbara Jamieson.\n\nAll these pupils were attending High School last year but failed to obtain promotion, so are not eligible for Departmental assistance.\n\nThese students come from families of a good type, and in the opinion of this office should be permitted to continue their education by the Council's help.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 8th, 1947.\n\nLt.-Col. E.F. Rendle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nReference is made to your letter of September 2nd, 1947, your file 3301/47, and you are advised that Six Nations Council resolution No. 5 of August 7th, 1947, is approved.\n\nIt is noted that a similar case re Patricia Stines involved an expenditure from Band Funds during 1946 in the amount of $145.13. Presumably the expenditure necessary for the daughter of Wesley Barnham will be approximately equal. When submitting your voucher please quote this file and letter as reference.\n\nA.G. Leslie,\nFor Chief Clerk,\nTrusts and Annuities.\n\nAL/JA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your File 103-32 MT.1 of the 27th of August approving of grants to various Indian pupils attending High School, you are now advised that four of those pupils are not attending High School. Leslie Doctor is remaining at home to work on his father's farm; Eva Hill has discontinued High School and accepted a commercial position; Betty Smith has finished High School and will go into training next year as a nurse, being too late this year with her application to get into the local hospital; Carmen Porter is staying at home to work on his father's farm.\n\nBy our letter 3290/47 of the 2nd of September we applied for five additional grants, - for Charles Bomberly, Russel Moses, Thomas Johnson, Stanley Green and Eugene Lickers. As to date you have not replied to our request, it is suggested that the four grants referred to in the first paragraph of this letter but not taken up, - be transferred to Charles Bomberly, Russel Moses, Stanley Green and Eugene Lickers. Thomas Johnson was actually approved for a grant in your letter of August 27th, but was listed as Thomas Johns.\n\nWe also would report that two pupils who passed their Entrance are actually now in attendance at High School, though they did not notify this office that they intended to proceed. Their names are Romaine Sandy, attending Caledonia High School, and Virginia Hill attending Brentford Collegiate Institute, - and as they are both deserving of grants, if it is possible, this office would recommend your approval, as while they failed to carry out the proper procedure in not notifying us, - it would not be fair to deprive them of grants if funds are available. Also, Walter Doctor, who received a grant from the Department three years ago but who failed his year and so did not receive a grant last year, - was successful in gaining promotion, and is asking to be reinstated.\n\nWe would also draw your attention to our letter of the 18th of September asking for approval of grants for the pupils who were attending Caledonia High School last year and were successful in gaining promotion. We would appreciate your early reply in order we can notify the various High Schools concerned as to what pupils are the responsibility of the Department this year, and so the parents of any pupils who may not receive a grant may be notified.\n\nLt.-Col. F.F. Randle,\nEPR/HV\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 25th, 1947.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle, Indian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, the Department will allow the usual grant for the academic year 1947-48 for the following Indian pupils who are attending Caledonia High School:\n\nWallace Bomberry       June Lichers\nHenry Fischoarrier    Helen Monture\nSarah Carlow          Josephine Sandy\nClara Hill            Elsie Styres\nWilma Hill\n\nIt is noted in the last paragraph of your letter that Florence Bomberry and Wilma Longboat are enrolling at Hamilton Normal School.

However, we are prepared to allow the usual grant for each of the under mentioned:\n\nCharles Bomberry\nRussel Moses\nThomas Johnson\nStanley Green\nEugene Lickers\n\nWe will also allow the usual grant for Romaine Sandy who is attending Caledonia High School and Virginia Hill who is attending Brantford Collegiate.\n\nWe have carefully considered the case of Walter Doctor; the same grant will be allowed for him as we allow the other pupils for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nBernard F.

Isaac.\n\nThis will acknowledge your File 103-32(E.) of the 16th instant with reference to the above person's communication to Mr. Tom Reid, M.P., - and in reply you are advised that according to our records the Isaac family have lived in Brantford for many years.\n\nAs you know, being residents of this City entitles members of the family to attend High School in the usual way, - while the grants made by the Department were to assist Indian children coming in daily from the Reserve to attend High School in meeting some of their expenses.\n\nThe letter addressed to Mr. Reid is returned herewith.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle,\nEPR/MB\nEncl.\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nAlso, Betty Smith, who successfully matriculated at Brantford Collegiate, and now wishes to train as a Nurse, would like to have the assistance of a grant.\n\nNeither of the parents of these two girls are well off. Mrs. King is a widow with a very small income, and the Smiths are a large family living off a small farm.\n\nYour early reply would be appreciated.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe establishment of bus routes to convey High School pupils to their respective schools, raises one or two problems for clarification.\n\nFirst, the pupils who failed last year to secure promotion. As you know, in past years when we were giving grants, if a pupil failed to gain promotion we discontinued their grant and the pupil normally left school, as the parents could not afford to pay the tuition fees. There were a few exceptions to this where either the parents or the Council made the necessary payment.\n\nNow with the establishment of bus routes and no grants, is the Department willing to permit those who failed last year, to continue, and also pay their tuition fees?\n\nSecondly, we have three pupils in the south part of the Reserve who have always gone to Waterford High School and now owing to road conditions and their extreme isolation the bus routes we are establishing could not reach them without wasting much time and road miles. May they be permitted to continue going to Waterford and receive the usual $100.00 grant?\n\nAlso, we have two pupils in the Upper School at Brantford Collegiate, whom it would be unfair to transfer at such a late date to Hagersville High School. May they be permitted to finish their education at Brantford Collegiate, and receive the usual grant?\n\nThere is also one boy, crippled through Polio', - who is rated as having the highest intelligence of all last year's Grade 8 pupils, who wishes to go to boarding school, - the Fort Erie Bible School. This is really the best place for this disabled boy, and it is recommended we allow him a $100.00 grant, particularly as his family are in very poor circumstances.\n\nThen, Jessie King, who has had two successful years at Hagersville High School, would like to go on to Business College in Hamilton, and if possible receive a grant.\nObservation Out\n\nDate: Aug 23/48\n\nThe Indian Superintendent,\nIndian Office,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Bus Transportation, Six Nations Superintendency.\n\nI hereby tender to convey by bus, to and from their various schools during the academic year 1948-49, the high school pupils and those attending Vocational Training classes on the Reserve, at the rate of 36 cents per mile, covering a total of 260 miles per week.\n\nC.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Transportation, Six Nations Superintendent.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 4th concerning the provision of School Bus facilities for High School pupils and Vocational Training classes in this Superintendentcy, we are now enclosing the tenders of two persons concerned.\n\nBoth tenders are at the rate of .35\u00a2 per mile and that of Mr. Schurr covers 352 miles per week, and that of Mr. Styres 260 miles per week.\n\nAs it has been found after all children have been spotted on the map of the Reserve, that the bulk are centered around the middle and eastern portions of the Reserves, - to save operating over a large number of unnecessary miles we are diverting all pupils to Caledonia and Hagersville High Schools, and cutting out Brantford.\n\nAs you may remember, both Hagersville and Caledonia are adjacent to the two Reserves, while the Western boundaries of the Reserve at the nearest point is six miles from Brantford. Also in the event of heavy snow it would not take much effort to keep entry into Hagersville and Caledonia open, but we might have difficulty in getting the County or Brantford Township to keep essential roads open at the necessary time.\n\nConsequently we propose to have one bus taking the High School pupils, approximately 30 pupils, to Hagersville, - a return run of 58 miles daily; - and the other bus to Caledonia with approximately 30 pupils, a return run of 40 miles daily.\n\nIn addition we shall have five local Vocational Training routes. Last year we only had three, but with the addition of the girls and also the fact that there is a much larger percentage of children in Grades 7 and 8 this year, - we have to split the groups in five, - otherwise the classes would be too large for the limited capacity of the Manual Training and Home Economics school-rooms.\nRe: Transportation, Six Nations Superintendency.\n\nThis office regrets we could not send this information earlier, but we had to await Entrance Examination results and others, to know just where the children would be located, to plan routes.\n\nHowever, as you know, early confirmation of your approval is important, as we shall have to advise all High School pupils of approximately the time and place to meet their bus, where the bus does not actually pass their place of residence. Therefore this office would appreciate early action and advice.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle,\nEPR/MB\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nTom Reid, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Reid:\n\nFurther to my letter of August 16, I have now had an answer from Mr. Indian Superintendent Randle at Brantford concerning the Isaac family. In his reply he advises that according to Indian office records, the Isaac family have lived in Brantford for many years. He further states as follows:\n\n\"As you know, being residents of this City entitles members of the family to attend High School in the usual way, - while the grants made by the Department were to assist Indian children coming in daily from the Reserve to attend High School in meeting some of their expenses.\"\n\nI am returning the letter sent to you by Mr. Isaac.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nLt. Colonel E. P. Randle,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nTuition Grants - Six Nations Superintendency\n\nReference your 127 [32] of August 25\n\nAs discussed with you by long distance, the following are the answers to the points raised in your letter:\n\n(1) The Department is prepared to transport children to high schools in the busses chartered for that purpose.\n\nWhile we are not prepared to pay the tuition fees for pupils who fail to gain promotions, we are quite prepared to transport them in our busses.\n\n(2) The three pupils going to Waterford High School will receive the usual $100.00 grant.\n\n(3) The pupils in the higher grades at the Brantford Collegiate may continue to attend this school and finish their education there.\n\n(4) Please submit a tuition grant form to enable the crippled boy to attend the Fort Erie Bible School.\n\n(5) Please submit a tuition grant application to enable Jessie King to attend Business College in Hamilton.\n\n(6) Please submit a similar application form for Betty Smith.\n\n.... I note\nI note that the pupils in (5) and (6) above have received tuition grants from the Department previously; in these cases, therefore, you need only recommend the amount which the Department should be prepared to advance for their continued higher education. It is presumed we already have tuition grant forms on hand from these children.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Jack Davis, - Oneida No.326.\n\nThis young man obtained his senior Matriculation last summer at Port Colborne High School, and now desires to attend McMaster University in order to finally teach.\n\nWhile it is appreciated that the general policy has been not to help Indians living off the Reserves, - this office is rather of the opinion there should be exceptions, and this case is one of them.\n\nAs you know the population of the Six Nations Reserve is now over 6,000 persons, and as a result with only a limited amount of land available more and more some of our Indians must seek outside employment.\n\nIn this case, this young applicant's father owns no land, so he was forced to obtain outside employment, and since the war has been steadily employed at the International Nickel Plant at Port Colborne. As an unskilled workman with a family of four all under age, - he has not been able to save anything to support a son at University, and you will appreciate is actually not in such favourable circumstances as many of our families living on the Reserve, owning land, whose children we have assisted by grants for years, who have no rent to pay, and whose incomes earned on the Reserve are exempt from direct taxation.\n\nConsequently this office is inclined to the opinion that this young man, having gone so far and proved his ability, should receive and deserves our help, and he may prove to be the type we may be glad to get eventually into the Indian Service.\n\nThe writer knows this family well as they frequently visit the Reserve, and this young man often sang at our School Concerts and other public events as he had a remarkable treble voice, and also sang over the radio.\n\nWhile it is probably a wise policy not to assist Indian children going to High School in outlying municipalities, as they are entitled as residents to receive such education, and should not need any assistance.\nassistance from the Department, - in going on to University there are expenses of a much greater nature, and it is probably more fair to help them, as being Indians they have little chance of getting consideration, help or credit from any other source.\n\nThis office recommends a grant of $300.00, and would appreciate an early reply, as the term will soon commence, and this young man must know what he can plan.\n\nLt.-Col.E.F.Randle,\nEPR/MB\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nHIGH SCHOOL GRANTS, QUARTER ENDED Sept.30/48.\n\nBrantford Collegiate\n\nLeona Vanevery\nDelores Vanevery\nRaymond Montour\nStanley Green\nBill Burnham\n\nWaterford High School\n\nRoland Hill\nCarol Moses\nFern Moses\n\nHamilton Business College\n\nJessie King\n\nFort Erie Bible School\n\nGordon Miller\nGeorge Miller\n\nHamilton General Hospital\n\nBetty Smith - Cancelled - too late to enter class - will start September 1949\n\nUniversity of Toronto - Public Health Nursing\nMarion Moses - approved File 103-32(E.1) Sept.20/48\nOttawa, October 2, 1948.\n\nLt.-Col.

With regard to these two pupils you are advised that the grants they receive are actually turned over to the school authorities against the costs of tuition, board, etc. After the school authorities have received that sum, there is still approximately $174.50 to be paid to cover the balance of board, tuition, etc., - and this office wishes to be advised if the Department will be responsible for that amount for each of them also, as it is equivalent to the fees we pay for pupils attending ordinary High School where the pupils also receive a grant of $100.00.\nExtract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Six Nations Council held at Ohareken, Ont., on October 25th, 1947.\n\n3.

This office turns over to the School authorities the school grant we receive of $100.00, - which is the only contribution the parents or the pupils make, as this family are desperately poor and cannot pay anything other than the grant afore-mentioned.\n\nThis leaves the sum of $174.50 per pupil outstanding to the school, and this office in our previous letter wished to ascertain from you whether the Department would be responsible for this amount, - as on the basis of the tuition fees paid the regular High Schools, this sum is not very much greater.\n\nIt might be added that Mrs. Miller, the mother of these two boys, is a deeply religious woman and that is the reason the parents wished the boys to attend this School as they feel they get a better form of training there than by attending the ordinary High School.\n\nMrs. Miller was a former teacher on the Reserve, and has been a supply teacher for us at various times.\n\nLt.-Col.

L. Skuce that the provincial chapter would offer the scholarship. It goes to the student from the six nations or Mississauga reserves who obtained the highest standing and intended to become a teacher.\n\nShe said the provincial IODE had spent $35,064 on education during last year, $7,762 more than the previous year.\n\nSpends Double\n\nMrs. T. E. Briant of Welland, welfare convener, announced Ontario chapters had spent $92,967 on welfare work last year, almost double the amount spent the year before.\n\n\"Gradually our members are realizing the great importance of health, and stress is being placed on the promotion of health rather than on the distribution of food and clothing,\" she said.\n\nIODE naturalization greeting cards were presented to 1,454 new Canadians during the year. Mrs. G. L. Hamilton of Windsor, immigration convener, reported. Mrs. Allan D. Hollinsake of Hamilton, treasurer, reported $293,851 was raised by the Ontario chapters last year and $273,872 spent.\n\n15,344 Members\n\n\"Ontario now has 13 municipal chapters, 390 primaries, 18 junior lodges, total of 1,067 chapters,\" said Mrs. M. B. Somers of Tillsonburg, organizing secretary. \"The total membership is 16,344, an increase of 356 over last year.\"\n\nMrs. Henry T. Ross, Jr., Barns, said Echoes, the order's magazine, now had 14,506 subscribers. Mrs. C. F. Washington of Walkerton said $538 was spent on the order's work in India. Mrs. Percy Downey, Port Arthur, said there were 2,683 Empire correspondence links last year.\n\nMrs. W. N. Smith of Sudbury reported that chapters had contributed $8,459 to the endowment fund, but she urged further contributions to complete the fund by the Queen's jubilee in 1950.\n\n\"Hospitalization of veterans is becoming more centralized as DVA hospitals are transferred from military jurisdiction to civic enterprise,\" said Mrs. J. J. Watt of Toronto, welfare convener and president. \"However, there is no lessening in our conscientious devotion shown in our well-planned visiting program.\"\n\nMrs. Watt said more than one-quarter of the $14,067 raised for ex-service work was contributed through the Canadian Legion Poppy Day Fund.\n\nOntario chapters spent $128,281 on post-war service work during the last year, it was shown by the report of Mrs. J. B. Smart of Watertown.\n\nAt the opening sessions, Mrs. F. P. McCurdy of Toronto, national president, said the 32,000 women in the IODE must use their power and influence to uphold the \"individual freedom which is threatened in every democracy.\"\n\nThe provincial president, Mrs. Cecil L. Brown, Hamilton, warned delegates they must be vigilant so they would not be \"lured by the glittering sophistry of Soviet subversive propaganda.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe following pupils who were successful in gaining promotion at High School last year and who received grants as well as having tuition fees paid, are requesting grants again this year.\n\nBrantford Collegiate Institute\n\n- Leone Vanevery\n- Delores Vanevery\n- Stanley Green\n- Bill Burnham\n\nWaterford High School\n\n- Roland Hill\n\nFort Erie Bible School\n\n- Gordon Miller\n- George Miller\n\nThe following pupils are requesting grants in order to take special training.\n\nRuth Vanevery - Successfully passed Grade IX at Hagersville High School last year, wishes to attend Brantford Business College this year. It is recommended she receive a $100.00 grant to assist her in paying the necessary fees.\n\nPatricia Stynes - Successfully passed Grade XII at Caledonia High School last year, will take training for nursing at Hamilton General Hospital this year. It is recommended she receive a grant of $100.00.\nJack Davis - This case was brought to your attention last year, File 42032-3 (E.1) 2 October, 1948. This boy's parents are now actually building a house in Chawaken and will shortly return to the Reserve to live.\n\nJack could not attend University last year without assistance, but has worked out and earned enough to pay his fees at McMaster University this year, and has enrolled with the hope he may attain a degree to enable him to be a High School Teacher.\n\nThis young lad is intelligent and should do well, and in view of the fact his parents are returning to the Reserve, you may consider it is fair to assist him with a grant as board in Hamilton will run into considerable money for approximately seven months, so we would recommend a grant of $200.00.\n\nWhile in the Air Cadets a year or two back, he was one of those selected to go to the British Isles and as such a group is selected from the best Cadets across Canada, Jack must have been smart and keen.\n\nRobt. M. Davis\n\nThe lad is brother of the above and will attend Hamilton Normal School this year and on qualifying hopes to obtain a position on our teaching staff. It is recommended he be given a grant of $100.00.\n\nRichard Moses\n\nSuccessfully passed his Entrance last year and owing to home location will have to attend Waterford High School, so it is recommended he be given a grant of $100.00.\n\nLt.-Col. W. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent\nEXTRACT FROM THE\nMINUTES OF THE SIX NATIONS COUNCIL MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY,\nAT OHSWEKEN, SEPTEMBER 1, 1949.\n\nMoved by Leonard Staats, seconded by Elam Froman, that the tuition fees be paid from Six Nations funds for the following High School pupils:\nGeraldine Burnham, Elsie Styres, and Vivian Smith.

Recent reports indicate that the truant officer travels approximately 1,100 miles each month.\n\nIn our letter of December 2nd, 1944, it was stated that the total amount that could be allowed Burnham should not exceed $15.00 a month. If you consider it advisable, we are quite prepared to allow a total of $25.00 a month but the mileage rate will have to remain the same, namely .07\u00a2 a mile for the first 2,500 miles and .09\u00a2 a mile for the next 2,500 miles.\n\nBernard F.

I have just had brought to my attention a young girl from whom we pay tuition at the Deseronto Public School who has been absent for the past two weeks but no report has been made to me from either the Deseronto Public School or the local Chief of Police. I just happened to stumble on it through talking to this girl's grandmother. Incidentally this girl has been an irregular attendant all spring.\n\nAs far as I can see no one is taking any responsibility for the attendance of Indian children at these three public schools and yet the Department pays full tuition fees for them all.\n\nWhile it is possibly too late to do much about this matter before the end of the current term, I would like to have your views regarding the coming school year on this very important matter.\n\nThis also brings up another point. No doubt the white schools will be opening on September 3rd whereas our Reserve day schools do not open until Oct.1st. Will you kindly advise whether you wish the Indian children to start the fall term at these outside schools in September or October.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. H.

Parents or guardians and the teacher of the white school should be notified accordingly.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the suggestion regarding an increased allowance to the constable in order to ensure that he will perform truant officer's duties. Although the officials are very sympathetic to this recommendation it has been found impossible to put it in effect due to present regulations governing appointments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. H. M.

It is difficult to understand, however, why white pupils attending Indian schools are not charged a similar fee to be paid by the responsible township or municipality. A white tenant with say four children coming from the township to rent a small Indian farm at a rental of perhaps $75. per year, creates a considerable loss to the Department in so far that the rental is usually paid to an absentee Indian and they educate the tenants children. This question shall be discussed at greater length in the office in due course.\n\nW.S.

No.1, Tyendinaga Township.\n\nDr. Eckardt informs me that arrangements were made with the Department that the school board receive a nominal fee of $2.00 per month for each Indian child attending this school, regardless of the number of days such child attends.\n\nIn the enclosed account it does show that Hubert and Ronnie Maracle, children of Gordon Maracle did not attend at all, although two other children of this same family did attend and the charge is being made because desks were set aside for all the children whether they occupied them or not. I do not consider that a charge should be made in the case of these two children who did not even report to school on opening day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

November 19th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed Voucher No. 204 for $33.00 in favour of Mary M. Hawley, Sec-Treas., Public School Board, Deseronto, Ont. and being for tuition fees for the month of September, 1941, for Indian pupils from Tyendinaga Reserve attending that school.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the fact that the children of Elgin Moses and Abel Green in attending the Deseronto School have a distance of approximately one mile to go and that the Eastern Day School is about one and one-third miles from their homes. The children of Murney Maracle have about one mile to the Deseronto Public School and are distant a mile and one-half from the Eastern Day School.\n\nThe children of Peter Whalen, a white tenant on the reserve and living on the adjoining property to Murney Maracle, attend the Eastern Indian Day school. There are four Whalen children attending the Indian school.\n\nWhile the seating capacity at the present time would not allow for eleven more pupils that are attending Deseronto Public school to be transferred to Eastern Indian Day school, I would consider that if the white pupils are removed from this Indian school it would allow accommodation there for the children that are now attending in Deseronto and none of these Indian children would have a greater distance than one and one-half miles from the Indian school. Miss Stoddart the teacher does walk this distance daily in attending her duties.\n\nThe same condition exists at the Shannonville end of the reserve and should be thoroughly examined in the future to lessen the tuition costs of Indian pupils attending white schools where school space is available to send them to Indian Schools.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing voucher for tuition fees for Indian children of the Tyendinaga Reserve attending the Deseronto Public School during the month of September, 1941. This account will be paid.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and the Department agrees with the recommendations that you have made.\n\nIt must always be kept in mind that in our opinion the funds voted by Parliament are for the education of Indian children and not for the education of white children. However, we do not wish to unduly interfere with the children's school work and consequently it has been decided that no change will be made until the end of the current quarter.\n\nYou should notify Abel Green, Murney Maracle and Elgin Moses that it is expected that their children will enroll as pupils of the Tyendinaga Eastern Day School on January 5, 1942, the date on which Indian day schools re-open after the Christmas holidays. They should further be informed that after the end of December, 1941, no further payment will be made for the education of their children at the Deseronto White School.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nYou should also advise the Secretary-Treasurer of the Deseronto Public School to the same effect.\n\nPeter Whalen, a white tenant on the reserve, should be advised immediately that the Department will not allow his children to attend any Indian day school after the end of December, 1941. From that date Mr. Whalen will have to make his own arrangements at his own expense for the education of his children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeseronto, Ont. November 27th 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed voucher No. 209 amounting to $50.40 in favour of Mary M. Hawley, Sec-Treas. High School Board, Deseronto, Ont. and being tuition fees for Indian pupils attending that school during September 1941.\n\nFive children are attending this school and Catherine Brant did attend during the academic year 1940-41 and passed into the 10th grade last June. The parents of this girl live on the reserve near Shannonville, Ont.\n\nVernon and Donald Green live on the Reserve on the Bay Shore road and passed their entrance last Summer and are just commencing their High School education.\n\nJohn and Verna Maracle are children of Mark Maracle who is and has been a resident of Deseronto, for a number of years. This man owns property in Deseronto and pays taxes in that municipality and it is recommended that no tuition fees be paid by the Department in this case.\n\nThese children were all interviewed by myself and from them I obtained information as to their residence. The Principal of the school states that they are all very fine pupils and are diligent in their attendance and studies. A report on their progress will be obtained at the end of the Xmas term.\n\nThis office was not aware that Indian pupils were attending this school until this account was received, as none of the pupils or parents had made application to me with reference to their attendance or that tuition be paid on their behalf, although they may have made an application through Mr. Rendell before I took over this Agency Office. Tuition grants for Catherine Brant, Vernon and Donald Green are recommended.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing account of the Deseronto High School for tuition fees for Indian pupils attending that school during the month of September.\n\nBefore payment of this account can be considered it will be necessary for the parents of these children to submit definite information indicating on whose authority these children were placed in high school. I may add that as far as grants for tuition of children at high schools is concerned our appropriation is completely exhausted and we cannot find on our file any authority for the admission of these children to high school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

December 11th 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn October 3rd I did submit to the department voucher No. 162 for $36.00 in favour of Dr. H. E. Eckardt, Shannonville, Ont. being tuition fees for Indian pupils at Shannonville Public School for September, which Dr. Eckardt reports he has not as yet received payment. Your early consideration in payment of this voucher is requested.\n\nTo give the Department some idea of the situation concerning Indian children attending the Shannonville and Milltown Public schools, which schools receive tuition fee payment from the Department, I am enclosing a rough sketch of the Western end of the reserve, showing the location of the homes of these pupils, relative to the white schools they attend and the location of the Western Indian Day school.\n\nEnclosed also find a statement showing the parents, number of children and the distance they are from the white and Indian schools. All children have to traverse the main roads shown by the arrows.\n\nThe enrollment at Western Indian Day school at the present time is 12 pupils and it could accommodate 30 or all those resident on the York Road and near Milltown. Children living near the Bay of Quinte are too far from an Indian Day school to be forced to attend the Western school and it would also seem an injustice to force the Milltown pupils to go to the Indian school when they are within a couple of hundred yards of another school, which would leave the children of Gordon Maracle and Hubert Brant to be transferred, as both are on a main road that is kept open the year around, providing the Department approves of such action, which certainly will not meet with the approval of the Indians who are objecting strenuously against the order to remove their children from the Deseronto Public school.\nThe present location of the Western Indian Day school is far from the ideal spot or centre of population at the present time, but may have been when it was erected and as Indians move about considerable. As the population is now located this school should be on the York Road in the vicinity of lots 8 or 9 and a right of way secured from Herbert Brants to the York Road, running across the farms between the two roads and such a school would have saved the paying of any tuition fees and all could have attended an Indian school without too much distance or hardship.\n\nAt the present time there are five white pupils attending Eastern and three attending Central Indian Day schools and those attending Eastern have been instructed to remove their children at the end of the month of December. This would leave only three white children attending any Indian school at the present time thereby eliminating any proposed saw-off in the payment of tuition fees with a white municipality.\n\nIt is suggested that in the future that clauses be included in any leases granted to whites, that they must pay school tuition fees of $2.00 a month per pupil for any of their children that attend an Indian school, during the term of their lease and failing to pay their children would be barred from the school. Such a fee to be chargeable to those tenants having children of a school age and not to persons without children or not of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclos. 2.\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 11th instant with reference to Indian children attending white schools. Arrangements are being made for payment of your voucher No. 162 and a cheque should reach Dr. Eckardt in the near future.\n\nMr. Doucet has reported regarding his recent visit to the Tyendinaga Reserve and it has been decided to allow the Indian children who are at present attending the Shannonville and Milltown white schools to continue at these schools until June 30, 1942.\n\nBeginning with September 1, 1942, all Indian children in the section of the reserve who have been attending the two white schools mentioned above must attend the Tyendinaga Western School. You should immediately notify the trustees of both Shannonville and Milltown that the Department will not allow any tuition fees for Indian children attending their schools after the end of June, 1942. In my letter of November 22 I have also advised you regarding the action which should be taken in regard to attendance at the Tyendinaga Eastern School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.D.

A. Hoey,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letters 103-34 of November 22nd, and December 20th, definite instructions have been given this office concerning the payment of future tuition fees on behalf of Indian children attending white schools, and for the removal of white children from the Eastern Indian Day School.\n\nI would wish to advise you that there are three white children attending Central Indian Day School being two of Perry C. Badgley's, tenant under lease 757, and one of Raymond McKenzie's, tenant under leases 799 and 831.\n\nThe farms occupied by these white tenants are situated on what is known as the Ridge Road in Concession A, and they are distant, in the case of McKenzie over four miles, and in the case of Badgley over five miles from the school. Mr. Badgley has appeared at this office inquiring if any change is contemplated by the Department with regard to the attendance of his children at the Central School, maintaining it is an impossibility for him to send them elsewhere. He also states that he paid school tax on his previous lease amounting to $40.00 per annum when he had no children of school age, and considers he is entitled to some consideration in regards to the present attendance of his two small children.\n\nIf the Department contemplates any change in connection with these three children, I would be pleased to receive your instructions at an early date, as after the first of the year they will be the only white children on the Indian Reserve going to an Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Their parents should be informed that they will have to make other arrangements for the academic year 1942-43 as white children will not be allowed to attend the Tyendinaga Central School after the end of June, 1942.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

January 8th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed Voucher 268 amounting to $149.04 in favour of Mary M. Hawley, Secretary of Board of Education, Deseronto, and being for tuition fees for December quarter for Indian pupils attending at the Deseronto High School.\n\nThis account again makes charges for the two children of Mark Maracle, who is as I reported when submitting accounts for September fees on November 27th last, a permanent resident of Deseronto, where he owns property and pays school tax. Charges to the amount of $53.76 should be deducted from the amount of the enclosed voucher.\n\nI have also learned from Miss. Hawley that the Dept. paid voucher #209 in its entirety, whereas $20.16 should have been deducted as charges made for the children of Mark Maracle. This amount should also be deducted from the enclosed voucher as being overpayment of fees for September month.\n\nWith reference to your letter 103-34 of December 3rd I would advise that I have interviewed Herbert J. Brant and Earl Green, parents of the other three children attending High School and they have advised me that they had not procured the permission of any persons to place their children in high school and did not consider such permission necessary, as it had never been demanded by other Agents in the past. These Indians are also of the belief that when they surrendered the land on which the High School is built to the Town of Deseronto it was understood at that time that all Indian children would be privileged to attend at the Deseronto school. This belief is also carried by some of the Band Council, although there is nothing in the surrender to bear out this contention.\n\nHerbert J. Brant appeared before the Council meeting yesterday complaining that never before I came here was it necessary that an Indian of their band had to make application to the Department through this office to be allowed to send their children to Deseronto High School and considered that I was overstepping my authority in asking him on whose authority he placed his child in Deseronto school, with fees to be paid by the Department. From the contention of Herbert Brant and some members of the Council, it would appear that they have always been allowed to do much as they liked in this matter in the past.\n\nAs Catherine Brant, Donald and Vernon Green are reserve residents I recommend that they be allowed to complete their attendance at High School for the present academic year, their tuition fees to be paid by the Department and that in future no fees will be paid unless the admission of the pupil receives the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant a deduction of $73.92 will be made from the account submitted by the Board of Education at Deseronto. This covers the overpayment of $20.16 made on your voucher No. 209 as well as the deduction of $53.76 for the September quarter in connection with the fees of Mark Maracle's children. In view of the circumstances in this case the Department does not consider itself responsible for the fees of his children. Apparently he is entitled to the same consideration as other residents of Deseronto.\n\nIt has been decided to pay the fees of Catherine Brant, Donald Green and Vernon Green for the balance of the current academic year. No authority was given for their admission to the Deseronto High School and when the parents state that it has been the practice in the past to send children to high school without receiving authority from the Department they are giving you information which is totally incorrect. These parents should be notified that while the Department is paying their tuition fees this year, as a result of your recommendation, no payment of fees for these children will be made after the end of June, 1942.\n\nA notice signed by yourself should be posted in the Indian Office and in each of the\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nfour day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve to the effect that the Department will not pay tuition fees for Indian children attending any high school unless application for same has been made to the Department, through your office, and our approval has been obtained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In both cases they are resident on the reserve and hold government leases for the lands on which they reside. Neither of these families can be considered as indigents, as both are possessed of stock and equipment and should be able to pay any school tax themselves.\n\nIt is the contention of some members of the board of education with whom I have spoken, that they must look to the department for their fees and it would be the duty of the department to be re-imbursed from the white tenants who are residents on the reserve.\n\nThese accounts are submitted for whatever action the department desires to take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 13, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing account received from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Board of Education, Deseronto, requesting payment of fees for certain white children whose parents are lessees of land on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nThe Department does not consider that it is responsible for the education of these children and consequently we are not prepared to pay the account submitted by the Deseronto School Board. I am, therefore, returning the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, May 9, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nI visited the Tyendinaga Reserve on May 6 and 7.\n\nAll members of the Council seemed quite reconciled to the fact that it was not our intention to pay tuition fees for children attending the two white schools on the west side of the reserve; namely, Shannonville and Milltown.\n\nHowever, there are probably two or three families on the western side of the reserve whose children will have to permit to attend Milltown due to the fact that a large swamp near their house would make it necessary for them to travel between 3 and 4 miles to reach the Western school. If we insisted on the children from these few families attending the latter school there is no doubt that they simply would not attend. Indian Agent Moore will advise us later regarding the names of the families concerned.\n\nI also had considerable discussion with the Indian Agent regarding the clause in the old leases of the white tenants providing for payment of \"School Taxes.\" The agent seemed to be under the impression that all of the leases of white tenants called for payment of school tax. However, I remember that this question came up about three or four years ago and at that time it was decided that when leases were renewed there would be no clause in them regarding school tax. On checking with the Treasury Branch I find that there are very few of the white tenants whose leases now call for payment of school tax and when these particular leases expire there will be no clause in the new lease regarding school taxes. He agent mentioned specifically the case of Parr Badgely who, he stated, was paying a school tax of approximately $6.00 a year. I find in the Treasury Branch that Mr. Moore is mistaken in this regard and I am writing to him to that effect.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief Training Division.\nShannonville, Ont.\nJune 27, 1942.\n\nMr. A.D.

Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary,\nMinister Natural Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nI have been interviewed by Mr. Perry Badgley, R.R. #1, Deseronto, who rents a farm belonging to Dan H. Maracle being part of lot 21, Concession \"A\", Township Tyendinaga, on a Mohawk Indian Reserve. Mr. Badgley has rented this farm for approximately eleven years at an annual rental of $500.00.\n\nHe has been advised by Mr. Moore, the Indian Agent, at Deseronto, that regulations have been issued preventing his children from attending the school on the Reserve. This will result in his being forced to drive the children six miles to and from Deseronto; they are three-quarters of a mile from the Indian school. Mr. Badgley does not feel that he can drive this distance on account of the restriction on gasoline and rubber, as the two trips would estimate approximately twenty-four miles. His lease expires February 1st, next year, and he would like to renew his lease provided permission could be granted for his children to attend the Indian school.\n\nMr. Badgley tells me that there are very few white children on the Reserve who are in the position of his, as the majority of them live in the easterly end of the Reserve and, consequently, it is easier for them to go to Deseronto than to the Indian school.\n\nHe would, therefore, be very grateful if you can ascertain the background of the regulations concerned and see whether or not an exception could be made or an amendment added which would permit Mr. Badgley's three children to go to this school. He would be very glad to pay school tax or any other moderate assessment for this privilege. If this arrangement could be made it would be very beneficial for all concerned.\n\nThanking you, with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

October 26th 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder instructions given in Mr. Hoey's letter of January 6th 1942, file 103-34, Mr. Perry Badgley and Mr. Raymond McKenzie, white tenants on the reserve, were advised that their children could not attend Central Indian Day school after the end of last June term and that they would have to make other arrangements for their children.\n\nTo date neither Badgley or McKenzie have made any other arrangements and desire to have their children continue to attend at Central School. While McKenzie did not personally pay any school tax in past years, his father with whom he resided did pay when he had no children attending school. The case of Badgley has been brought to the attention of the department on previous occasions and this man paid $200.00 in school taxes when he had no children attending school.\n\nMr. Hoey visited this Agency today and requests that I bring to your attention the question of allowing these three children to continue to attend at Central School and while I am little concerned in the case of McKenzie, I feel some consideration should be given Badgley, who occupies the best farm on the reserve containing 250 acres, is a good workman, pays $500.00 annual rental to an aged Indian owner, whose farm will possibly lie idle if Badgley has to remove, as he is resident at least five miles from a white school. On account of this situation and because no white school is available for Badgley it is suggested that he be allowed to continue to send his two children to Central School during the term 1942-43 and no precedent will be created as with the exception of McKenzie and Badgley all other white tenants are near to white schools that entail no hardship to them. McKenzie's lease runs out in 1943 and he should have the same privilege and his lease not renewed at that time, unless he makes other arrangements for the education of his child.\n\nPhilip Phalen, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to allowing the children of Mr. Perry Badgley and Mr. Raymond McKenzie to attend the Tyendinaga Central School. I was under the impression that all the officials had decided not to allow white children to attend Indian schools in future. Recently we received from the Minister's office a letter which had been forwarded to them on behalf of Badgley's children and in our reply we stated that favourable consideration could not be given to their attending the Central School.\n\nYou refer to the amounts which Badgley claims to have paid for school taxes. I believe that you understand the circumstances under which these were collected and, although a portion of the amount received was credited to band funds, it was never used in connection with the cost of education on the Tyendinaga Reserve. I am inclined to feel that if we change our mind again we will be obliged to provide educational facilities for these children and children of other white tenants as long as they lease land on the reserve. I will discuss the matter further with Mr. Hoey when he returns to the office next week and write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\nOttawa,\nNovember 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my return to the office I have discussed with Mr. Phelan the contents of your letter of the 26th ultimo and his reply of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the children of Mr. Perry Badgley and Mr. Raymond McKenzie. It has been definitely decided to adhere to the original decision; namely, that these children will not be allowed to attend one of the Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nShannonville Ont Nov 9th 1942\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJust a few lines to see why Raymond McKenzie boy, Earl age 8 yrs can't go to the Mohawk school our Indian agent says he can't go to the school on the reserve now McKenzie has to drive 5 miles to take the boy to a white school then drives home again. Then he has to go and get the boy after school and drive back home again which makes 10 miles every school day. Our government is asking everyone to save on gas and if McKenzie moves off of the reserve our farm will lay idle and the government is asking the farmers to grow more grain and McKenzie is a great farmer he grows pigs lots of hogs in fact everything which is needed. As my husband is crippled by rheumatism he would be unable to work on farms McKenzie is willing to pay school fees if you would let the boy go to school on the reserve until after the war it would make it a lot better for a lot of us we pay two dollars per month for our girl going to Shannonville school as its too far for her to walk to the Mohawk school our farm is three miles from school. Our farm where McKenzie lives so if there was a farm where McKenzie lives and it would help pay his rent to move and it would help pay his rent to try and make it sad for my husband to try and work two farms and have to buy a car.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAnd that would take gas and money away from helping with war work please let me know what can be done\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMrs. Oliver Hill\nShannonville\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dec 16-42| To books supplied for pupils taking grade 9 studies at Eastern Indian day school, as per attached accounts | .90    |\n\nAuth: 103-34 Aug 24th and Sept 23rd 1942.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. 263\n\nDate: January 19th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6485, file 42034-3, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDeseronto, Ont. June 11th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nBennet Brant and Altha Zachariah of the Tyendinaga Reserve have during the past academic year been receiving a Grade IX Correspondence Course through the Ontario Department of Education, while continuing as pupils of the Eastern Day School under the direction of the teacher Miss Nora H. Stoddart. Enclosed you will find the report of the Department of Education showing the progress these pupils have made at their grade nine studies.\n\nBoth these pupils have expressed a desire that they will continue their studies in September next and it is the opinion of their teacher and myself that as both their parents are in good steady employment and both scholars have bicycles and are not far distant from Deseronto, that they should be quite able to continue their education without any further assistance from the Department by enrolling on their own responsibility at the Deseronto High School, in the same manner as many rural white children do.\n\nMiss Stoddart the teacher of Eastern School has given these two pupils a lot of attention and service and with her large enrollment has not the time, she also states that these pupils have an influence on the younger pupils that effect the discipline of the school and for all concerned they should be in a school with pupils of their own age and academic standing.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nTORONTO. JUNE 8th, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nYour letter of June 7th has been received.\n\nBelow you will find a statement showing the subjects in Grade IX Correspondence Courses in which Brant Bennett and Altha Zachariah will be granted standing when certificates are issued in June:\n\nBrant Bennett:\n- English (Literature and Composition)\n- Mathematics\n- General Science\n- British History\n\nAltha Zachariah:\n- English (Literature and Composition)\n- Mathematics\n- General Science\n- British History\n\nThey have ten more lessons in Mathematics to complete but we are taking it for granted that they will complete them by the end of June or at least before the opening of school in September. They have now started the Geography so it would be well to carry this subject over until the fall term opens. Both pupils have done very satisfactory work due, no doubt, to the encouragement and judicious supervision of their work by their tutor.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSupervisor of Correspondence Courses.\n\nMiss N. H. Stoddart,\nEastern Tyendinaga Indian Day School,\nDESERONTIO, ONTARIO.\nOttawa, June 15, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to Bennet Brant and Altha Zachariah.\n\nIt is noted that these two pupils have taken Grade IX Correspondence Course.\n\nI agree with your suggestion that these pupils should not return to the Tyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School next year. It is noted that their parents are able to provide for their education and therefore they should enroll at the Deseronto High School. It should be understood that the Department will not be responsible for any expenditures in regard to their attending High School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nMr. A.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1943.\n\nSchools;\n\nTo date no applications have been received by this office from pupils who desire to continue their education to High School from pupils who passed their entrance examinations in June last.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ont. December 2nd 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThis office recently received a visit from Mr. C. Sager, Chairman of the Deseronto School Board, in connection with the payment of tuition fees for five Indian Children, residents of Tyendinaga Reserve, who are attending the High School here.\n\nMr. Sager was advised of the decision of the Department in so far as it referred to Bennett Brant and Altha Zacharias, two of the children concerned and I would refer to your letter 103-34 of June 15th 1943.\n\nThe other three pupils enrolled themselves at October 1st last when school re-opened and Mr. Sager was advised that the Department had not authorized the payment of tuition fees on behalf of these children. Mr. Sager was not able to inform me what the actual fees of these children would be, but surmised it would be in the vicinity of $85.00 per pupil and that as they were Indians it was the intention of the Board to send accounts to this office at the end of the December term. As the pupils were enrolled by their parents, I advised Mr. Sager that accounts on their behalf should be sent to the parents of the pupils for payment in the first place and that no doubt if these parents found the fees more than they could pay, they would no doubt apply to this office for assistance and I was prepared at that time to place the matter before the Department with any recommendation I could make, after having first learned from the parents their financial standing and ability to pay part or the whole of the fees. If I am in error in my instructions to Mr. Sager I would wish to be advised, as he informs me that the Board may deal direct with the Department through other channels.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1943.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to certain Indian children who are attending the Deseronto High School. I note from the second paragraph of your letter that you have already informed Mr. Sager regarding the Department's decision in connection with Bennett Brant and Altha Zachariah.\n\nRegarding the other three children, no request was submitted to the Department for a tuition grant to enable them to attend high school and consequently you should inform Mr. Sager that the Department will not be responsible for any tuition fees for them during the current academic year. It would be impossible to administer our appropriation properly if we allowed Indians to incur expenditures for which no authority was either requested or received from this Department.\n\nFor the academic year 1944-45 the Department is prepared to sympathetically consider requests for tuition grants from deserving pupils in your agency. Full particulars regarding the academic standing of the pupil should be forwarded before the end of July, 1944. This report should include a statement from the teacher of the Indian school which the pupil has previously attended, indicating the academic ability of the pupil and the standing obtained. You should also report on the financial condition of the parents and advise what amount, if any, they are in a position to provide.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have your letter of December 6th in connection with pupils from Tyendinaga Reserve attending Deseronto High School and in so far as it refers to the second paragraph of that letter I would wish to more fully explain the cases of these three pupils mentioned.\n\nLorraine Brant one of these pupils passed her entrance exams in June 1942; she is the daughter of Hubert Brant who has five younger children attending day school. Brant lives within one mile of Shannonville and in September arranged that his child would attend Shannonville Continuation School and the school board of that Village agreed to accept her without any fees being charged. In December 1942 the teacher of the Shannonville School took ill and Lorraine continued her studies at the Deseronto High School and travelled daily by bus, a distance of 12 miles and the Deseronto School Board did not charge her any fees from December 1942 to June 1943 and this girl passed into the 2nd form with very high marks. When the Deseronto High School opened on October 1st 1943 (Shannonville School having discontinued High School grades) Lorraine enrolled at that school and according to the Principal is a very adept pupil. While the mother of this girl approached me in September 1943 concerning assistance from the Department in the payment of fees, I advised her that possibly the school board would not be charging any, as they had not done so for the six months of the year 1942-43 and when she was advised by the board of these charges and their amount and needed help I would then be prepared to submit a report to the Department for your consideration as to a grant being given. This girl has shown an earnest desire to attend school and the parents have considered transportation costs that they have been paying themselves and if and when the local school board take some definite action concerning fees and mean to levy the same, a grant from the department would certainly be recommended by this office, to the amount of the fees as set by the school board.\nEllwood Brant, 15 year old son of Ex-Chief John A. Brant passed his entrance with honours in June 1943 and is now going to Deseronto High School. Brant has four children in all, two going to school and two over school age and lives 9 miles from Deseronto. This parent applied to me in August last with reference to assistance if fees were to be charged for his son and I advised him that should the High School Board levy fees I was prepared to place his application for assistance before the Department. Ellwood from Oct 1st to Nov 30th did cycle each day from his home on the reserve and since December 1st has been boarding in Deseronto with relatives, going home on week ends. While Ellwood had some earning capacity last summer the cost of his books, cycle, board would use this up and if fees were to be charged for this boy I was quite prepared to recommend to the Department that he be given a grant of three-quarters the amount of such fees.\n\nPhyllis Green, 14 year old girl of Abel Green, passed her entrance in June 1943 and is now going to Deseronto High School. Green has seven children of school age and under and lives on the reserve within one mile of the High School. The parents of this child at no time contacted this office concerning her enrollment or assistance in a tuition grant. While Green did not apply, had he done so I was quite prepared to recommend to the Department that Phyllis receive a grant to half the fees that would be charged by the board for this girl, and while there were no transportation or board costs in this case, Green has a large family with limited earning capacity himself and would have been deserving of some assistance.\n\nIn your letter you request applications for grants by the end of July, which would be hardly possible if all school boards are like the Deseronto High School Board, in that they cannot make up their minds if they are going to charge tuition fees for Indian children or not, for after I received your letter I contacted the Chairman as to whether the board had taken any action to set the amount of fees for Indian children and he advised me that although a meeting was held by the board in December, the question did not even come up at the board meeting and fees are generally assessed in accordance with the enrollment on a per capita basis. If no fees are charged for Indian children then I would consider no grants necessary as I believe all Indians can arrange for transportation themselves as is now being done by Norway Maracle and Frank Claus, whose girls passed their entrance last June and are attending Belleville High School on arrangements made by their respective parents.\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14, 1943.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant and have noted with interest the additional information contained therein.\n\nI may state that we have, in our parliamentary appropriations from year to year, a comparatively small amount for the payment of tuition grants and for the care of delinquent and incorrigible Indian pupils. During the months of July and August, thousands of requests reach the Department for tuition grants. These requests come from school principals, Indian agents, missionaries, etc. All requests are carefully reviewed and a decision reached in each case. You can readily see, therefore, how important it is that requests for tuition grants from the Tyendinaga reserve should reach us late in July or early in August. Unless such requests reach us at that time, it will be simply impossible to consider the claims of pupils from your agency, regardless of how deserving they may be.\n\nIn the case of the pupils referred to in your communication - Lorraine Brant, Ellwood Brant and Phyllis Green, may I suggest that you discuss the case of these pupils with the Chairman and Secretary of the Deseronto High School Board. Despite the fact that our funds for this year have been allotted, a sincere attempt will be made by the officials here to meet the tuition costs of these students, on your recommendation. It is important, however, and of course very desirable, that a decision in respect to the matter should be reached at an early date.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nThe attached account has been received direct from the Belleville Collegiate Institute. I presume it refers to the daughter of Frank Claus, who was mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter of December 9. If you approve the account the Department is prepared to pay the tuition fees only for this girl. In the event of our doing so I presume that Norway Maracle will expect the same consideration. However, you will no doubt let me know in regard to this.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeseronto, Ont., January 27th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 14th concerning the payment of tuition fees for three Indian pupils attending Deseronto High School and would advise that upon receipt of your letter I contacted the Chairman of the School Board, requesting that the Board take early action in establishing the amount of tuition fees that would be charged Indian pupils for the 1943-44 school term.\n\nAt their meeting of January 14th, the School Board set the amount of $68.00 as the fee chargeable for Indian pupils, which is quite a low rate in comparison with the fees at Belleville, which are estimated at 78\u00a2 per day.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department authorize the payment of this fee for Lorraine Brant, Ellwood Brant and Phyllis Green for the school year 1943-44. Lorraine Brant is in 2nd form and heading her class; Ellwood Brant and Phyllis Green are in 1st form and both attending regular and according to the Principal are very adept pupils. If possible this fee should be paid for these pupils at an early date if funds are available; if not it would be permissible to pay it after the end of March or when the new appropriation is available.\n\nWhile the parents of Phyllis Green and Ellwood Brant advise that they might be able to pay as much as $25.00 of their fees, it would not be until next Spring and any funds they can produce at that time could be refunded to the Department. No payment is expected from the parents of Lorraine Brant.\n\nA. D.

In the latter part of December, Mrs. Claus and her daughter took up light housekeeping in two rooms at 110 Station Street, Belleville, for which she pays a monthly rental.\n\nWhile Mrs. Claus cannot be considered to have had a Belleville domicile previous to 1944 and therefore tuition fees would be chargeable for 1943, I do consider that if they maintain their present rooms in the future they should be exempt from future payment of tuition fees. I advised Mrs. Claus that she should continue her present domicile in Belleville as in my opinion it was a more satisfactory way to live than commuting daily, both for Mrs. Claus and for the school pupil Joan, and also would be less liable to injure their health. While Mrs. Claus must be complimented for the way she is maintaining herself and child, she could give no reason for not contacting this office or making application for assistance for tuition fees, when she enrolled her daughter last September.\n\nNorway Maracle has two daughters attending school in Belleville, the eldest Norma has been going for some time and is in 12th grade. The youngest girl Alma commenced last September and is in 9th grade.\n\n(over)\nMrs. Maracle advises me that at the time of enrolling these girls, she was informed by the Principal that there would be no fees, although they offered to pay if necessary, on account of both girls being domiciled in homes in which they gave some work in return for their board and lodging; in fact the girl Norma is living with the family of Colonel Merritt, V.C.\n\nAs no fees have been requested on behalf of the girls of Norway Maracle, the matter could be let drop for the present and this industrious family congratulated in the manner in which they are seeing that their children procure higher education.\n\nA.

The progress report reveals that Lorraine Brent is an exceptionally clever pupil in her second year at High School, and that the marks obtained by Elwood Brent and Payllis Green are fair. These children have all been advised that any future assistance given them will depend largely on the report they obtain at the end of the June term, and on their regular attendance.\n\nA. D.

D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1944.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th instant, enclosing applications for tuition grants for Lorraine Brant, Phyllis Green, Elwood Brant and Eugene Green, who wish to attend Deseronto High School. The Department approves the children mentioned attending high school. It is noted that the approximate cost for each of them will be $68 a year.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeseronto, Ontario, Oct. 18th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter 34-1-1 of July 14th authorizing the payment of tuition fees for Western School pupils to Shannonville and Milltown public schools and whose attendance there was made necessary through the closing of Western School, I would advise that the following Indian pupils are in attendance at these white schools.\n\nAttending Shannonville School:\nArdeth Brant, Aubrey Maracle, Marlene Brant,\nDuane Baptiste, Donald Brant, Arthur Brant,\nIola Green, Wilme Green, Shirley John,\nAida Maracle, Robert Maracle.\n\nMilltown Public School:\nVernon Hill, Robert Brant, Stuart Brant,\nJean Shirley Brant, Freeda Brant.\n\nThese are all pupils on behalf of whom it will be necessary to pay tuition fees.\n\nI would report additional attendance of Indian children on whom I would request instructions as to the payment of fees. Gordon Maracle, widower, lives on the outskirts of Shannonville, and while Western school was open he always sent his\nthree children to Shannonville and had paid their fees himself as these children lived a long distance from Western School, and the closing of Western School actually made no change financially to Gordon Maracle. The same condition arises with Walter Maracle living on the outskirts of Milltown who has four children attending that school and who paid their fees himself and never sent his children to Western School.\n\nBoth Walter and Gordon Maracle have applied for tuition grants for their children, and I have sympathy for their request and recommend their children receive tuition grants the same as the others for the year Western School will be closed.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1944.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in which you advise that 11 children from the Tyendinaga Reserve will attend the Shannonville white school and 12 children will attend the Milltown Public School. In mentioning this latter number it is intended to include the children of both Walter and Gordon Maracle. I understand from your letter of July 11 that the cost of the tuition will be $2 per pupil per month.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1944\n\nSchools:\nNearly all pupils plus new ones entered the two boarding schools the first week. There were 194 children enrolled at the end of the month - all appeared to be in good health. There are competent teachers in all class-rooms; manual training cannot be taught at either school as no instructors available, at present.\n\nThe Principal of Old Suns is frog jumping between Blackfoot Reserve and Elkhorn School, Manitoba, and he taught manual. The Principal of Crowfoot lost his mechanic and growing more grey hairs! He has another man arriving in October. Both schools had good crops, all harvested. Three Indian boys entered Gleichen High School - in Grade 9 on October 2nd, by arrangements made this month. A number of ex-pupils girls are working in hospitals, boarding schools and hotels as seamstresses or maids, while one girl is a stenographer in the air force and one boys is stenographer in this office. This is mentioned because such facts are not generally known.\n\nG.H.

Eckardt, S.S. 1,- Sept. to Dec. ----- $ 128.00 Shannonville, Ontario.\n\nIn requesting the school accounts, I asked the secretaries to show the attendance of the Indian pupils during the period of their account, and which reports show a fairly good attendance at Milltown school, considerable improvement could be made at Shannonville Public School, although severe snows and stormy weather attributed to the poor attendance at all schools during December.\n\nThe account for Milltown School should be paid in its entirety, but no fees should be paid Shannonville school on behalf of nine pupils who did not attend during September, thereby reducing their account by $ 16.00. Dr. Eckardt contends that they should be paid fees for the whole period as desks were allotted them whether they are absent or not, and while I concur in this view after a pupil is enrolled, I do not consider fees should be paid until such enrollment, which eliminates the nine pupils above referred to, and this question is left for the consideration of the Department, and I would ask that I be advised of your decision so that I may have it for future guidance.\n\nA.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nSchools: The school attendance during June quarter has been fairly good, but in spite of the efforts of this office and local Reserve organizations, the attendance has never been brought to a maximum and it is anticipated some better results will be obtained in the future on account of family allowances being paid to Indians. The teachers report a moderate number of cases of head and body lice, also the odd case of skin disease in which it has been necessary to order the children home for attention and treatment. Four pupils from Eastern, all that tried, have passed their Entrance examinations and two of these at least have expressed a desire to attend the local High School; the other two are making their own arrangements to attend Vocational School at Belleville. Two pupils from Central passed their Entrance Exams and one girl is expecting to continue to High School at Deseronto. As previously reported, the co-operation from the R.C.M.P. and Special Constable in their duties as truant officers has been poor, lack of which can be attributed to the extra duties placed on the police on account of the war, which limits the time available for duties on the Reserve. It is expected these officers will give more supervision from this time on and that the parents will be closely checked in connection with the poor and irregular attendance of children of school age. For two days, June 19 and 20, senior pupils of all Reserve schools attended the Homemakers Club convention and heard addresses concerning Family Allowances, nutrition and medical care, school attendance, etc., from which they should derive considerable benefit in future. Manual training and sewing work at Eastern school has progressed well but has lagged some at Mission and Central schools, due partially to the indifference of the teachers in not procuring materials as was authorized. It is suggested that some definite graduation ceremony be established annually for Indian pupils who pass their Entrance examinations and at this gathering the children receive their entrance diplomas and also be capped and gowned. Such a procedure would be of some incentive for pupils to at least get their entrance and presentation of their certificates could be made by an official of the Department or some prominent local school inspector or public official. Gowns and mortar boards are inexpensive and could be supplied by the Department on a loan basis and be available yearly.\n\nA.D.

Hennon, to attend Deseronto High School during the coming academic year and I enclose Application and Physical Examination Form.\n\nThe status of this girl is complicated and has not been thoroughly established in that she is the illegitimate daughter of No. 820, Stella Claus of the Mohawk Band. The mother gave the child, when quite young, in adoption to Roma Hennon, who has raised and schooled her on the Indian Reserve. Roma Hennon is the widow of a white man and therefore has no Indian status, although she has made her home with her aged mother, Mrs. Margaret Culbertson, on the Reserve for over ten years.\n\nWhen taking possession of the child, she changed her name from Claus to Hennon and no legal adoption was made through a court that permitted this. Mrs. Hennon now advises me that she is taking the necessary action to have this child legally adopted in a Court of Law and the point is\u2014\"what would be the status of the child if legally adopted\"; would she be entitled to Band membership as the illegitimate child of Stella Claus, or, would her adoption by a Court give her the status of Roma Hennon, who is not a Band member. If, as an illegitimate child, Freda becomes a member of the Mohawk Band, I would recommend that she receive a tuition grant to attend High School and would ask your early consideration.\n\nADM/JMCV\n\nA.

Had this girl or her parents applied at this office for tuition assistance, I would have considered that she could have attended the Deseronto High School in the same manner as seven other Indian children who are pupils from the Reserve attending that school and whose tuition fees are paid by the Department.\n\nThe payment of the Belleville Collegiate account by the Department is not recommended and I would consider this girl or her parents be called upon to pay the account themselves.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM/JMcV\nOttawa, March 15, 1946.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to Joan Brant. As the attendance of this girl at Belleville Collegiate was not approved by the Department, I agree with you that the parents should pay the tuition fees.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDeseronto, Ontario.\nJanuary 19, 1946.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945.\n\nSchools:\n\nDue to Western School being kept closed, about 32 children are attending at the Shannonville and Milltown white Public Schools where their fees at $2.00 a month per pupil are being paid by the Department and this procedure meets with the approval of most of the parents and the pupils themselves, as they have much less distance to travel to go to school and seem perfectly satisfied to continue the present arrangement. I do believe it to the advantage of these children to be associated with white children as it would broaden their prospective and training to their future advantage. The attendance at the agency schools has been quite fair during the Fall term. Cod Liver Oil has been supplied all schools and is given the pupils under the direction of the teachers. A number of pupils have been absent from school due to skin diseases and the nurse is eventually getting these cleaned up. There were many cases of head lice reported at the time of the nurse's visit and these are also receiving attention. The Mohawk Agricultural Society have appropriated $25.00 as prizes for the Fair in the Fall of 1946 and arrangements will be made to compile a prize list so that the school children can show exhibits of school work, including sewing and manual training and the Department will be asked to supply the materials necessary for such vocational work.\n\nA.D.
