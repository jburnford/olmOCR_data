It seems that there was an error in the report regarding the recent events in Soudan. It is important that we correct any misinformation as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n**Correspondence**\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn response to your letter, I would like to provide you with some additional information. The recent events in Soudan have been widely discussed and debated. It is important that we continue to seek accurate and truthful reporting.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n**Publisher\u2019s Notice**\n\n**OUR RATES**\n\nSubscribers: $9 per year; single copies, 25\u00a2 each.\n\nSubscription Rates:\n\n| Rate Description          | Annual Fee |\n|---------------------------|------------|\n| East End Delivery         | $18        |\n| West End Delivery         | $16        |\n| Paper Mail                | $14        |\n| Post Office Box           | $13        |\n| Microfilm Copy            | $10        |\n\n**THE INDIANS**\n\nThere are reports and counter-reports being circulated respecting the Indians of the North West. Men who are in a position and qualified to judge say that there is danger of an Indian uprising before spring. There are also reports which contain various points saying there need be no fear. Rev. E. S. W. Bentheath, a gentleman who is a close observer of the Indian affairs and has opportunities of being placed in an impartial opinion as to its value, writes to the Winnipeg Manitoban his convictions on this subject. He may be of the opinion that unless a sufficient force is promptly sent to disarm the Indians we shall see the existing breaches of the laws of the land, not only of its provisions but an uprising against our existence.\n\n**THE FARMERS\u2019 UNION**\n\nA correspondent writes us to the effect that we are a little severe on the Farmers\u2019 Union last week, His Honor the Mayor is doing what he could for them.\n\nThe rates do not apply to members of the Union, whose dues are paid on a monthly basis.\n\n**THE CANADA PACIFIC**\n\nThere was a report recently issued that it would be necessary to increase the rates on the Canada Pacific from $150 to $175 per ton.\n\n**NOTES AND COMMENTS**\n\nIf Mr. Palestine would make a little less noise than he does, he would do more good than harm. It is said that he is not interested in the outcome of any case, but that he is interested in the fact that it has been brought forward.\n\nMr. Palestine, in his recent article on the Emigration Union and the C. S. B., do you not think there will be a little increase in the number of farmers to whom you write? Is it not true that the Emigration Union has become a national organization?\n\nSAVE THE DATE\n\nMay 1st - The annual Alfred Smith Memorial Lecture will be given by Dr. J. M. Mitchelson.\n\n**CONSUMPTION CURE**\n\nAn old remedy, tried from practice, and always found to be useful when threatened with consumption. A word of warning, however, about consumption: If any one has the misfortune to fall ill with it, there are remedies available \u2014 especially if one can be found who won\u2019t try to take advantage of the situation.\n\n**MARITIME**\n\nCaptain Disney, of the I. D., who is in town, says that he has recently visited the Blood reserve, and everything is quiet there. The stolen horses, although not returned, are on the reserve, but they are horses stolen from other Indians, chiefly the Great Cree. As the warriors have not yet appeared, they are not likely to be returned.\n\n**NEWSPAPER**\n\nIn conversation with an old timer the other day, he asked him what he thought about the Blood Indians. He replied that he thought they were in mighty bad shape. We asked him what he thought about the situation now? He answered that the situation was not so bad as it had been previously.\n\n**MONTREAL**\n\nThey were poor enough in those days, and all joint ownerships must end. If a person took out a mortgage on land for a large sum, and if he defaulted, his creditors could place a lien on all of his property.\n\n**OTTAWA**\n\nWe were too late in finding this information.

The song was written by Francis Scott Key, who had been detained by the British as a prisoner of war during the siege of Baltimore. He wrote the poem while he was held captive on a British ship, and it was set to music by John Stafford Smith.\n\nThe poem describes the American flag still waving over Fort McHenry after a long bombardment by the British fleet. The poem became an instant hit and was later set to music by Smith, becoming the national anthem of the United States.\n\nThe poem begins:\n\nO say can you see, by the dawn's early light,\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,\nO'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nThe poem ends with the famous line:\n\nAnd the people shall be free.\n\nThe poem became an instant hit and was later set to music by Smith, becoming the national anthem of the United States.\nRapid City Ripples.\n\nFIRE.\n\nOn Sunday morning last about six o'clock the town was aroused by the dread alarm of fire. On exam-\nining it was discovered that Mr. Geo. Newnham's billiard parlor was in flames. The fire was in the Caldwell house adjoining. It was not long before both buildings were reduced to ashes. The damage done was extensive and there was no insurance on the hotel. The billiard room was of late construction and although the fire was bad, it was thought the building would be saved. It was insured for $2000. All the furniture of the building was removed.\n\nOn Monday evening the 29th ult., the Freemasons had a very enjoy-\nable time at a supper in Bolman's hall, which was highly attended.\n\nAt the annual meeting for the non-masonic mayor and council members for the ensuing year held in Bolman's hall on Tuesday, the 29th ult., the following gentlemen were elected to office: Mr. S. A. Head, mayor; Messrs. Webb, Grummit, But-\nchart, Hall, McNaught and Ross as councillors.\n\nTHE CRADLE.\n\nOn the 24th inst., the wife of Thos. Cot-\ntingham gave birth to a daughter.\n\nOn the 4th inst., the wife of Robert Mac-\ndonald of a son.\n\n\"How to Handle a Queen.\"\n\nTo catch a queen the operator first puts a piece of sugar on the comb near the hive, while a minute later he goes in to fill themselves with honey, which swarms to the comb. The queen soon fol-\nlowed the hive. Being filled with honey, she became very active and moved, and will seldom stop unless she is disturbed by some other bee. When the queen is found, the comb containing the wings and out into the cage. Worker bees will not allow her to escape in this manner, it being impossible for them to sting when taken up by the worker. If the workers are sufficient in number, all the queens will be killed, but if the number is increased until sometimes reaching 100, then the worker bees by massing around the cage will prevent the queen from escaping.\n\nGRAND COLONIAL EXHIBITION.\n\nIn London, England, 1860.\n\nFOURTY FOUR THOUSAND FEET RESERVED FOR CANADA.\n\nFirst Royal Exhibition Commis-\nsioners, 1860.\n\nTHE NATIONAL AND COLONIAL EXHIBITION to be held in LONDON, ENGLAND, commencing May 1st, 1860, is intended to be a great international exhibition, the object of which is to bring into closer relations the nations of Europe with each other.\n\nBesides the great benefits resulting to the arts, a Royal Commission has been appointed to visit the exhibition.
