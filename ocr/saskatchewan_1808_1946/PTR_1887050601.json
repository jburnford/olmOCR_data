Canon Flett.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nMr. Macdonald has arrived back from Scotland, and has commenced his Parliamentary duties. While we were sorry that he should have been absent from the House so long, it may be stated that no major matters have come up of special interest to the Northwest. He is, therefore, in a position to do as much for Saskatchewan as if he had not been absent, and we are sure he will make himself heard as \"speaking voice,\" and use every other means in his power to further the interests of his constituents.\n\nTHE FISHERY DIFFICULTY\n\nSpeaking of the fishery difficulty the Montcalm Star says\u2014\n\n\"The cable telegram leads to the conclusion that some progress is being made towards a settlement of the fishery difficulty with the United States. The treaty that Lord Salisbury is now engaged in settling the details on the conditions of the Treaty of Washington minus the pecuniary indemnity should be taken with many grains of allowance. The privilege of fishing in Canadian waters was intended to Canada by that treaty is worth little or nothing to Canadians, so that the only advantage that the Dominion would get under the reported terms would be the return for giving the Americans facilities for obtaining supplies and transhipment of fish. It is evident that the sale of Canadian caught fish into the United States market. This looks to us like a very one sided arrangement, nearly all the advantage being on the side of the United States. Under such an arrangement the speedy exhaustion of the inshore fisheries of Canada would be a matter of certainty. Independently of the extra drain on those fisheries which exporters there would put upon them, the American methods of fishing are very wasteful and it would be found exceedingly difficult to compel United States fishermen to conform to Canadian laws and regulations.\"\n\n\"It is well to see that the eyes of reflecting Americans are being opened to the injury which non-intercourse with Canada would inflict upon the commerce of the country. Secretary Blaine expects that to carry out the threat of Congress would not be quite so pleasant a way of punishing Canadians for the crime of protecting their own property as the present method. Members of Congress seem to think, in fact, that it would bear a very close resemblance to that very unpardonable operation of cutting off your nose to spite your face. He said that the threat of the government will bear repetition. \"It is doubtful,\" he said, \"if the interests of San Francisco in maintaining her present coal supply from British Columbia, and adding the important trade with the United States, has been connected with Canada and the vast trade that flows across our northern boundary do not exceed the interests of Massachusetts in the matter of the application of reciprocity as an alternative to commercial non-intercourse.\"\n\nReferring to Lord Salisbury's proposition the Globe assumes a somewhat whimsical tone, and main points are that the proposal to surrender to the Washington Government of an immensely valuable property belonging to Canada, and the surrender of every main content of the fisheries upheld by the Canadian Government cannot consent to it without stifling themselves and incurring universal condemnation. But the strange feature in that journal is the fact that they now hold that the only way to overcome the difficulty is by \"unrestricted reciprocity\" while at the same time it objects to our fisheries being thrown open to Americans on similar terms. When Canada received five million dollars from the U.S. for the right to fish in Canadian waters by the treaty of 1818, it was not enough. During the last American war, blighted by the government for not having made a treaty treaty with the U.S., now it advocates unrestricted reciprocity while it opposes the \"surrender to the Washington Government of a valuable property and the surrender of every main content of the fisheries upheld by the Canadian people.\" It is hard to tell what the Globe wants.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nThe estimated cost of this year's destruction of salmon is $15,000, in addition to the almost total failure of the season's run expected.\n\nSir John Lister Kaye is full of big philanthropic schemes for the advancement of the fishery industry. He is engaged in his farming operations in the Northwest but he says he will have a New Year's resolution to make good the loss he has found feasible from actual experiment at Belgrave, on the Canadian Pacific Railway, where he has a farm of 3,000 acres. He found it cost about $300 to start a homestead. A man working on his own account could earn $200 a year. If he is honest, will have $300 more. My idea is that the Government send to us 200 trustworthy farmers, paying them $200 each and give them $200 per year for 40 days per year for keep. I find them hardworking men, and while they are working for themselves they have knowledge of the surrounding lands. At the end of the year, if they conduct themselves properly, they shall be given the company's employment, and they can take up land in the neighborhood of their work. They are hardworking people. In other words Sir John Lister Kaye, in his goodness of heart, is preparing to give away $200,000 to the farmers who fail at an expense of over $50,000 a year to the people of Canada. Sir John Lister Kaye is a good friend to the people of Canada.\n\nD. H. Macdonald, M.P., has arrived in Ottawa from Scotland.\n\nThe Dominion railways in the Provinces of Manitoba and the Territories have been granted three million acres during the past year, and when forty miles of railway are completed the same may be certified to by the Government engineer 250,000 acres will be added to the Dominion.\n\nThe Scrip Commission will visit points hereafter named in June.

R. Grant, with reference to the closing of the trail northward, and taking some steps to have the trail re-opened; and from Chester Thompson, having now to place about two miles on the street.

Bain and Agnew was passed: \"That Coms. Stewart and Braden be a Committee to see what a main drainage channel of about two acres can be located for, and to report next meeting.\"\n\nCom.

Stewart and Bain.\n\nThe by-law was read and considered, and on motion the Committee rose and the chairman reported.\n\nThe by-law was read a third time, and on motion of Coms. Cranmer and Bain was ordered to be signed, sealed and numbered.\n\nThe Council then adjourned to meet Monday next at 7:30 p.m.\n\nMEN AT OTTAWA.\n\n(From the Winnipeg Jap.)\n\nOTTAWA, April 20.\n\nThe House had been down to work yet, but the real business of the House will double themselves in a few days. The Government, confident in its strength, not to mention its ability, effects to get its support into the hands, while the Opposition, on the other hand, has only a couple of noses, and having grown up in the old defensive style, is marshalling its forces as for a fierce fight as the halls of Parliament over ever.\n\nThe Liberal contingent, when the address the other day was apparently only the customary handshaking which the party periodically indulges in, is preliminary to pounding the eternal stumps off their antagonists; and although that ceremony was a pleasant recreation, the most important political contest commences then the hair will fly.\n\nThe Black Rods are likely to be in a fine form, and the diamond will result of the recent elections being still keenly felt by him. He visits the House in his usual jaunty manner, and with his head bowed on his arms, which rest on his desk. Sir Richard looks grim and serious, while Mr. Laurier smart and effeminate as usual, Trow and Landecker wear their ordinary every day dress, but the others don't show any particular anxiety or express they would, just before the elections.\n\nMills and Edgar, Cook, Wilson, Casey and Jones are all there, and their faces are a noticeable darkened look about them. Yet, they see, they build up hopes larger than life, and expect to receive from the Boilers, and their hopes, notwithstanding their efforts to keep up appearances, are as thin as a leaf like the orange crop of Manicota to form a Minnesota blizzard. The Boiler, as a team, have nothing to do but to wait for their old chiefman. While anxious at the Government's attitude, the Rioters, however, are rather encouraged by the very trip which they through their Province where the Metis leader seems to be unfazed, they seem to believe that the old chiefman will be their professionally new found friends. They fully appreiate the motives of the Grits and feel that they will be able to rely on them, and that they haven't any confidence in them. And so\u2014to the utter disgust of the Blaketites, who are convinced that the Liberal power disappears from view\u2014the Boilers return to the fold, leaving only the gallant Amy to \"guard the fort\" in protestation of 400,000 votes, the left. Clinton, it is also understood, is still undecided with an inclination to join the Government, which fully counted upon him. There is consequently not an encouraging outlook for the Liberals, and so, hanging under defeat, the members prefer to rent their splendid disappointments on the shoulders of the Boilers, who are for their being kept out in the cold shades. Their debating power, weakened by the spirit of the lyric of the Canadian bard, has been silenced by Jones, the tear-down flag-man from Halifax, who certainly has a good deal to say.\n\nAcross the ditch, the chiefman occupies his old seat and looks just as jovial and cheerful as happy chirpy birds in the springtime. His hearty laugh, Sir Charles Tucker, who as yet has not taken any part in the battle, is heard by the Boilers, who are still bright with a kind of curious anticipation of the keen pleasure he will enjoy when the ungodly deluge he will take in carrying the war into Africa. Sir Charles Tucker has always been the belief that he'll be better prepared to carry the war with the enemy than ever before.\n\nOf the western contingent Dartin is still in the same position, and though his voice in the House, the others content themselves with getting their work in the Ministers and the Opposition by constant interjection. This keeps them pretty busy, and as Mr. Scarth toddles along with his pockets bulging out with daily correspondence, he whispers to me confidentially that there isn't such a terrible lot of fun in being a member after all.\n\nThe Boilers have been hard at work this week. It takes me a couple of hours each day just acknowledging them, and I guess I won't have much leisure this year. But, ding-dong, if I don't believe I'll have to have two if the latter half of spring is like this. Thus they work hard, and their customers come, and as busy as a nailer keeping up his correspondence, while A. V. and Mr. Royce have been hard at get through with their work with astonishing rapidity. We don't see much of Hon. Wat, who seems to be shielding himself in the Liberal contingent which comes from the far west, between Lake Superior and the Pacific Ocean. What have helped yet, and there are hopes that such an unanimity will be shown in their votes that his duties as Liberal whip will be very light.\n\nG. H.
