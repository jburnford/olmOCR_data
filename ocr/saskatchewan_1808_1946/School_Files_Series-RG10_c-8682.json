In his absence I have gone carefully over the files, and there is nothing on record here to indicate whether the contractor or the school management will undertake the installation of the plant. I should like to have information from you on this point at your earliest convenience.\n\nI was somewhat surprised to learn that the request for this plant reached this Branch early in February. It would appear that the delay in making the purchase has been due almost wholly to our failure to secure sufficient information to satisfy the Purchasing Agent. Under existing purchasing regulations it is of the utmost importance that the fullest possible information with respect to the supplies ordered, their delivery and their installation be forwarded with the requisitions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

School I yesterday visited the Revd. Principal and he advises me that in his specification which was forwarded on to Ottawa he made an allowance of $75.00 for labour installing this plant.\n\nThere is an electrician living within 4 miles of this school who has always done any work of this category which the Revd. Principal required, a Mr. Arthur Kendrick, whom he had in mind for the work and who is quite capable and whose charge would be far less than getting in a man from Regina or some outside point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben.

BAILEY\n\nI am attaching hereto for your information copy of a letter received by this Branch from Mr. M.A.W.R. McKenzie, Crooked Lakes Agency, and also a copy of a telegram received from the Principal of the Cowessess Indian residential school. Both these communications, you will note, relate to the purchase of an electric lighting plant at the Cowessess residential school. It is my hope that you will be able to make arrangements for the delivery of this plant at the earliest possible date.\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Electric lighting plant,\nCowessess residential school.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in which you supply additional information with respect to the installation of an electric lighting plant at the Cowessess Indian residential school.\n\nIn the first paragraph of your communication you state: \"I yesterday visited the Rev. Principal. He advises me that in his specification which was forwarded to Ottawa he made an allowance of $75.00 for labour for installing this plant.\" I have made a detailed search of the file relating to the purchase of this plant and I have made a careful perusal of all the letters received from you and from the Principal with respect to the matter. The first letter from the Principal to you was dated Marieval via Grayson, Sask., February 12, 1939. There is no reference whatever in this communication to labour costs. May I refer you also to your letter to the Department dated February 13, 1939, your letter dated March 2, 1939 and your letter of April 1, 1939. No doubt you have on file copies of these letters and you will note that in none of these is there a reference to the $75.00 installation costs. In your letter dated June 28, 1939, you enclosed a letter from the Principal of the school together with a diagram of the building. You also sent forward a letter received by the Principal from the Mumford Medland Company Limited. Here again there was no reference to installation costs.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nIn view of the delay experienced by the Principal in securing delivery of this plant it is altogether likely that the matter will be referred to the Minister for review and for whatever action he may deem necessary. Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, is, at this date, absent from the office. The files here indicate that the delay, to some extent at least, has been due to the failure of the Principal and yourself to send forward the information requested by the Purchasing Branch. I am anxious, therefore, that you should send forward immediately particulars of the specification referred to in your letter of August 18. I am anxious to know if this particular specification was dated, the date it was sent forward and if it was sent forward with a covering letter and, if so, the date of the covering letter. When delays such as this occur it is, in my judgment, of the utmost importance that we should seek out and determine exactly the individual or individuals responsible for the delay. I feel confident that it will be the desire of the Minister that we should do so in this case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

R. School was away in the States I was unable to see him until yesterday when I went down to the school.\n\nIt appears on his referring to his file that he went through the necessary particulars with Mr. McKenzie and on his pencil copy of his figures he has an allowance of $75.00 for installation but I am unable to find any record of this $75.00 being requisitioned for to Ottawa until mentioned in my letter of 16th August last and evidently this was omitted.\n\nThe Revd. Principal feels that this was an omission on Mr. McKenzie's part as he counted on it but states that the most important thing as far as he is concerned is to get the new plant and if this could be supplied at an early date as it is badly needed he would be willing to instal it etc. at his own expense rather than delay further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilfred J.

We have already expended $207.00. This leaves a balance of $368.00.\n\nIt should be impressed on the Principal that the amount above stated is all that we will have to expend at the Cowessess School during the current fiscal year. Consequently if there is anything more urgent than the painting a request should be forwarded for obtaining it. If, however, the painting is considered the most important you may submit a requisition for the paint required. It is presumed that the school will supply the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nWith reference to your other letter of the 12th instant I may say that the Purchasing Agent took exception to some of the prices charged by the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company for fire extinguishers. Consequently there was some delay in having the account passed for payment. However, cheque No. 38906 for $167.29 was issued and sent to the Company on the 18th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G. A.

However, it is possible that you have already considered this contingency as you mention you can secure the flues for $3.00 but you do not state in your letter if this includes the installation of them. In any case you should keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.\nJune 17th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe grainery at the Cowessess Residential School is in very poor condition and is infested with rats, the Rev. Principal is asking that it be reshingled and remodeled. This is particularly necessary this year owing to the increase in the coarse grains acreage.\n\nI have secured quotations on the material required from the Security Lumber Co., Ltd., Broadview, and this amounts to $150.00. The Rev. Principal, however, states that if he be permitted to purchase this material from St. Lazare, Man., he could get it for $125.00. If this was satisfactory to the Department you could communicate with Rev. Father de Varennes direct.\n\nI would recommend the above for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJune 23, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to repairing the granary at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. The quotations obtained by the Principal and yourself have been noted but I would again point out that present purchasing regulations require that when the expenditure amounts to over $50.00 all purchases have to be made through our Purchasing Branch. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to forward detailed information regarding the material required and you can attach to this the quotations that you and the Principal have received and the whole matter will then be submitted for the decision of the Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.J.D.

The wiring is defective by reason of the circuits being run with bell wire, and stapled to the surface finish, and the circuits extended with flexible cord. There are also exposed blade knife switches used to control outlets. This is a hazardous condition using either 32 or 110 volts and it is suggested that the Branch have a licensed contractor check over the wiring, and submit prices for bringing the whole installation up to the standards of the Canadian Electrical Code in compliance with the Electrical Inspection and Licensing Act.\n\nFor your information the following contractors are licensed in the Crooked Lake district:\n\nH. E. Hurst at Grenfell, W. E. Biram, at Wolseley,\nG. V. Lamont, A.F. Miller, and A. Sieble at Whitewood,\nH. Gottfried at Lemberg, Helge E. Anderson at Dubuc, and\nFrank Chomos at Esterhazy.\n\nEvidently it is necessary to make the change they have suggested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.,\nAugust 6th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe present water supply at the Cowessess Residential School is not sufficient for their needs. The present well is 3 ft in diameter and there is only 2\u00bd ft of water, this can be pumped dry in ten minutes. It would offer little protection in case of fire.\n\nIn discussing this matter with the Rev. Principal, it was thought that the best solution would be to dig a new well 25 ft. deep and 6 ft in diameter. It has been tested and water was found available adjacent to the work shop. If the Department would supply the materials the school staff would do the work.\n\nThe following materials would be required:\n- 100 sacks cement\n- 40 ft. 2\" Galv. pipe\n- 2 - 90\u00b0 Galv. Elbows.\n\nThe approximate cost would be $125.00.\n\nI would recommend that this be granted as it is very necessary, particularly so from the viewpoint of fire protection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, requesting materials costing approximately $125.00 in order to provide a new well at the Cowessess Residential School.\n\nIn regard to this school I may say that an amount of $400.00 was provided in this year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment. We have already expended an amount of $47.20, leaving a balance available of $152.70. This, of course, would be sufficient to cover the materials required for the well, but before a decision can be made in this regard I wish to bring to your attention the contents of a letter just received from Mr. Christianson.\n\nHe has been informed by the Saskatchewan Power Commission that one of their inspectors recently visited this school and states:\n\n\"The lighting plant has been changed from 38 to 110 volts. This was apparently done by the school at the time the new lighting plant was purchased in the fall of 1939. The Provincial Inspector states that the wiring is defective by reason of the circuits being run with bell wire, and staked to the surface finish, and the circuits extended with flexible cord. There are also exposed blade knife switches used to control outlets. This is a hazardous condition using either 22 or 110 volts.\"\n\nIn view of this report the Department considers that before any other expenditures are incurred we should have an estimate of the cost of putting the wiring in this school in proper condition. Mr. George Lamont, of Whitewood, Sask., is on the Preferred List and I am informed he could give us an idea of what expenditures it would be necessary to incur. Please make the necessary arrangements in this regard and submit his report at the earliest possible date. Then we have this we will be in a position to decide if the funds available will permit the purchase of the materials requested for the well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W. J. D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou shall receive through our good Indian Agent the estimates for 1942 which I believe are very necessary. I know that the war burden is heavy, but on the other hand, I know that you are very pleased to see our Institution being kept in good order. And I believe, in this regard, that I have done my best, and I was glad to do it, to improve and embellish your property here.\n\nTwo years ago, I have built a cattle shed and a house for our farm-instructor. Last year, an electric centrifugal pump for the stable, a new milk cooler and a room were installed. All the buildings were painted anew (paint furnished by the Dept), a new lawnsman and sidewalks were made, an old shed rebuilt. This year, the old permanent granary was rebuilt, the foundation of one man's house made, cement and lumber supplied by the Dept. Implements shed was covered anew, the inside of the School refreshed, also, $104.88 were spent in blank fabrics, curtains & mattresses. All these expenses, except those specially mentioned were paid partially by our grant and partially by our Missionary funds.\n\nUnfortunately, the Department has deemed necessary to cut off our grant. By this move, since the living cost is increasing, I am facing a great problem too not be able to give a proper salary to my men and to not be able to well look after the children, which I am obliged to keep over my number even by discharging those of 15 years of age.\n\nI do not ask the Department to increase the pupilage number, but only to pay for the 70 children entitled to me in 1939.\n\nBesides, the crop is close to a failure this year, the wheat gave 16 bushels an acre, the barley 5 and the oats 20 bushels an acre, but the hay and potatoes are good enough.\n\nThis statement is made only in view to bring good to this school and to give you in short what is going on here.\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Lamont and he promised to send an electrician down to Cowessess School the next day. He did not do so and since then I have called on him twice and each time he stated he would send someone. I phoned him again today and he informed me that he was unable to send a man as one electrician was sick and the other was too busy to go. He promised to try and get another man to go and if so he would send his estimate in a few days. I would be glad to have your further instructions in the event that he is unable to make the above arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.D.

On receipt of your letter of August 4 Indian Agent Kerley was written and directed to have the wiring inspected and a report submitted regarding the cost of making the repairs that are required.\n\nAlthough Mr. Kerley was written on August 12 he did not reply until September 8 at which time he stated that he had been unable to obtain the electrician owing to the latter's illness. He promised at that time to get another man and said that he would send the estimate in a few days. Since that time we have heard nothing further from him.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could take any action that would make Mr. Kerley respond more promptly to official communications.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. M.

The cost of wire and labour $18.00 batteries $4.80 a total of $22.80.\n\nThis work is all necessary, but I had Mr. Kendrick estimate each part in case the Department saw fit only to do the school building and laundry at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Owing to want of funds his request was refused year after year.\n\nOwing to present conditions Father de Varennes does not hope for any assistance from the Department but he would appreciate it very much if you would allow him to demolish the stable at the Crooked Lake Agency which is not in use any more, and use the lumber and other materials to enlarge the school stable. He undertakes to do all the work without any assistance from the Department as he has at his disposal for the present, a substantial amount from the Missionary fund of the Oblate Fathers.\n\nIt is to be hoped that you will be able to grant Father de Varennes' request, and as the season is already far advanced, an early decision would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However it is the only place we have at the present time to the best of my knowledge. It would cost $1200.00 to build a stable of the proper size for our use and I do not suppose that our Branch would want to advance this money at the present time so that we could give the present barn to the Cowessess School. However, I am going down to the Cowessess School in a few days and I shall telephone before I leave to Father de Varennes and ask him to meet me at the Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The following reply has been received from him:\n\n\"In this connection I wish to inform you that the request was made to me by Father de Varennes some time ago and as far as I know this is the only barn we have had at the Agency and much too large for our present use.

Apparently, from Mr. Christianson's letter, some use is being made of it by the agency. However, when I hear further from Mr. Christianson I will write you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermott Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nJuly 18th., 1942\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that we have a large barn at the Crooked Lake Agency. The Principal of the Cowessess School is very anxious to get this barn and as it is much too large for our use and can be put to good use by the school since they have a lot of cattle and horses, I have decided that as far as I am concerned it will be in order to hand the barn over to him.\n\nI believe Miss Walton has a book there which shows snaps of all the Agency buildings at Cowessess, and you can judge the size of the barn from that.\n\nHowever, we will require to fix up an old barn that we have at Cowessess and which will meet our requirements. This will take from $150.00 to $200.00 in the way of repairs in addition to what old material we have on hand. I believe there is sufficient money in the $1800.00 that was allowed for repairs to Agency buildings to do this work.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Kerley, the Agent, and he is in agreement with the above plan. I would refer you to Departmental letter No. 108-2-5 of the 23rd ultimo with reference to this.\n\nAs Father de Varennes wants to get at this work immediately I am sending this letter by Air Mail and I trust that you will give me a reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christenson\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nMr. Christianson has reported that the large barn at the Crooked Lake Agency is too large for Agency use and can be put to good use by the Cowesses School as they have a large number of cattle and horses. Also that there is an old barn at Cowesses which will meet the Agency requirements but which requires repairs.\n\nHe recommended the expenditure of from $150. to $200. for repairing the old barn. In view of the fact that Mr. Christianson states that the barn at the Agency is too large and should be handed over to the school and the barn at Cowesses repaired for the Agency use I would recommend the expenditure of from $150. to $200. for the purpose.\n\nSecretary.\nJuly 28, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th of July suggesting that the barn at the Crooked Lake Agency be handed over to the Cowessess School, as it is too large for agency use and can be put to good use by the school as they have a number of cattle and horses.\n\nIn reply I would say that it is not considered advisable, at the present time, to transfer this barn to the school.\n\nI note your reference to a barn at Cowessess, which you state would be suitable for agency use if repaired, and that the repairs would cost from $150.00 to $200.00. Is this barn the property of the school, and as the transfer of the Agency barn to the school is not approved, will it be necessary for the school to make application for the repairs to this barn?\n\nKindly let me hear from you in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L.

The Purchasing Branch wrote to this firm but they have failed to reply.\n\nDid you receive a written quotation from this firm? If so, I wish you would forward it to this office by return mail. We are anxious to know if the price of $129 included both sales tax and transportation from Winnipeg to the school. As just intimated an immediate reply is desired.\n\nR.A.

We were not sure that the quotation of $129.00 indicated on your requisition included sales tax and transportation, and we, therefore, proceeded to obtain this information.\n\nThis morning Vulcan Iron Works sent us their tender on these covers, together with blue prints illustrating the product they propose to supply. Their price is $145.00 f.o.b. Grayson, Dominion sales tax included. It would, therefore, appear that the original quotation (referred to on your requisition) did not include sales tax or freight.\n\nWe have not sufficient information to judge whether or not the manhole covers as described in the drawings herewith would be satisfactory, and suggest that they be referred to Mr. Gow at Winnipeg for his advice.\n\nIt will be in order for Mr. Hamilton to place the order with Vulcan Iron Works, Ltd., Winnipeg, provided the drawings are approved by Mr. Gow. The Company state in their tender, dated March 6th, that they can ship within ten days from receipt of order.\n\nWhen delivery has been accepted please send the invoice to this office for the usual action.\n\nEnclosure 3.\n\nH.J.

Lemire, O.M.I., has advised this Branch that he wishes to purchase a John Deer tractor, Model \"D\", for use on the farm attached to the school. Payment of the cost of this tractor will be made from school funds and the Cowessess School is government-owned.\n\nThe Principal further states that he knows where he can secure the machine mentioned, but the firm requires a priority. I would appreciate it if you could arrange to have the necessary priority issued.\n\nActing Director.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nTractor for Indian Mission School,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nRepresentations have been made to this office to the effect that it is very necessary that a new tractor be provided for the above Mission School in order that they may carry on their farm operations.\n\nIt is stated that they have completed all the necessary documents for the authorities in charge of allocation of farm machinery and that the John Deer Company at Yorkton are holding for them a 38 D-Model tractor on rubber. The Company, however, have told them that they must have a letter of recommendation from the department, recommending or verifying that this implement is needed.\n\nIt is stated, further, that there are 900 acres under cultivation, 7 of which will be put into crop this spring providing they get the necessary machinery; that there are also 200 acres to be summer-fallowed; that they work 16 head of horses on this farm and the tractor is also used to do threshing etc.\n\nThis further statement is made; that the tractor on hand has been in continuous use for 19 years and is almost a total wreck and of no further use, and the need of a new tractor is stressed.\n\nImmediate consideration is desired as we are informed that it is only a matter of days before the School will be starting the crop year of 1945.\n\nWill you please let me have a report, at the earliest possible moment.\n\nMr. Hoey -\n\nFor report as requested.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nA complimentary copy of our \"Canada Descriptive Atlas\" is sent you herewith. While we are able to supply a complimentary copy to a teacher it has been found necessary, in order to keep distribution within reasonable limits, to make a nominal charge of ten cents a copy for atlases sent to pupils or the general public. Should you require additional copies on this basis we will be glad to supply them. It is a convenience when pupils pool their orders and have the amount remitted by their teacher. PLEASE DO NOT SEND STAMPS.\n\nHerewith we are sending material relating specifically to the National Parks of Canada which I hope will be of interest to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nROBERT J.C. STEAD,\nSuperintendent,\nPublicity and Information.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, April 18, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of April 16, regarding a tractor for the Cowessess Indian Residential School, near Broadview, Sask., we have verified, on our files, the information he has evidently received. Under the circumstances, I believe that a letter should be forwarded to the John Deer Company, and therefore I attach a draft reply that might be sent.\n\nActing Director.\nCOPY - to be returned to Indian Affairs when letter is signed\n\nOttawa, April 18, 1945.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis Department has recently been advised that the management of the Cowessess Indian Residential School, near Broadview, Saskatchewan, is endeavouring to secure a tractor. The Indian Residential School mentioned is operated for this Department by the Oblate Order. There are 90 children in attendance and it is necessary for the management to cultivate a very large area of ground in order to provide the necessary food. From the information that we have available it is evident that a tractor is essential and this Department believes that the management is justified in endeavouring to secure one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe John Deere Company,\nYorkton, Sask.\nOttawa, May 2, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPurchase Order No. 2688 has been placed with the Sherwin-Williams Company of Canada, Limited, Regina, Sask., for the following goods for the Cowessess Indian Residential School:\n\n20 gallons white paint for inside\n15 \" cream \"\n10 \" Lionoil\n5 \" paint thinner\n\n3 only 3\" paint brushes, medium, Albatross,\n2 \" 2\" \"\n\n10 gallons red paint for outside.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I believe there are two 1 H.P. surplus motors at Lestock and these could both be used to advantage at the Cowessess School as the other one could be used in the bakery, if the Department will authorize their transfer.\n\nI would recommend this for your consideration.\n\nW.J.D.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing a petition from the Indians of the above reserve asking for the construction of a new residential school.\n\nThe information I have is that the school is too small and looked upon as some kind of a fire trap. The Indians are very fearful for the lives of their children should a fire originate during the night. The present building could be used for class rooms and, therefore, need not be considered a total loss.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant enclosing petition from certain Indians of the Crooked Lake Agency requesting the erection of a new school to replace the present Cowessess Residential School. As no provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school at this point, I regret that immediate consideration cannot be given to the request contained in the petition.\n\nHowever, we are noting the matter for reconsideration when preparing the estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nIt should be understood that we cannot give you any definite assurance that favourable consideration to the project will be given at that time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nRev.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, Indians of Sakimay Band, Sakimay Reserve, Crooked Lake Agency, in the Province of Saskatchewan, wish to draw to your attention the complete inadequacy of the present school buildings situated at the east end of the Crooked Lake, in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nThe present school building is very old, and entirely out of date for school purposes; in comparison with similar schools for white children, we are certain in that our school would be condemned out of hand. It is a complete fire-trap, and children would have no time to escape, and we imagine that the majority would perish, if it ever happens that a fire starts or breaks out during night. And us, parents, we never feel at ease when our children are at school. We do implore and insist that the Department should take the means to put or to have our children in safety when at school.\n\nFurther it is stated to be pointed out, that there is not nearly sufficient accommodation for the present number of scholars. There should be accommodation for at least 200 children.\n\nWe feel that in view of the age of the building, and its negative nature as a school, that remodelling or making additions to same would not put same in a first class condition for proper school purposes. Therefore we do respectfully urge that a new school be built, fully modern in every respect, and particularly to include gymnasium, and one capable of favorable comparison with a similar type used for the white children, and one that will not only fulfill the present needs, but capable of providing for our increasing school population.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nKing Jerome Piell (signature)\nKoel Joel Williams\n\nIndian Affairs.

A similar request is being mailed to Mr. Keenleyside, the Deputy Minister of the Department.\n\nI do not know whether you have ever visited the Cowesses school. If you have, you will readily understand the fear which the Indians live under for the lives of their children. All possible supervision is exercised in connection with fire prevention but they know that accidents will happen in spite of these measures, that is why the present request is forwarded to you in the hope that you will take their case before the Minister and obtain for them a new school.\n\nShould it be impossible for the present year to meet their wishes I believe that a four-room school building would materially relieve the situation. This class-room building could be well utilized when the new school is built and would not, therefore, be a loss or useless expense on the part of your Department.\n\nIn any case the whole matter is left to your kind attention and I shall notify the Indians that you will take their interests to heart.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl. 1.\nMr. H. L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nMines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose another letter received today in connection with the request of the Indians of the Cowesses School for a fireproof building to replace their present institution.\n\nThe arguments brought forward in favour of this project are about the same but I thought that you might like to know that the sentiment among the Indians of the Agency are quite unanimous in this respect.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEnclosure 1.\nGrenfell, Sask.\nSeptember 3rd 1947.\n\nRev. Father J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nUniversity of Oblate Fathers,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nReverend Father;\n\nWe, Indians of Sakimay Band, Sakimay Reserve,\nCrooked Lake Agency, in the Province of Saskatchewan, wish to draw\nyour attention to the complete inadequacy of the present school\nbuildings situated at the east end of Crooked Lake, in the Crooked\nLake Agency.\n\nThe present school building is very old, and entirely\nout of date for school purposes; in comparison with similar schools\nfor white children, we are certain that our school would be\ncondemned out of hand. It is a complete fire-trap, and children\nwould have no time to escape, and we imagine that the majority\nwould perish, if it ever happens that a fire starts during night.\nAnd us, parents, we never feel at ease when our children are at school,\nwe do implore and insist that the department should take the means\nto put or to have our children in safety when at school.\n\nFurther it is to be pointed out, that there is not\nnearly sufficient accommodation for the present number of scholars -\nthis year there should be around 200 children attending.\n\nWe feel that in view of the age of the building, and its\nnegative nature as a school, that remodelling or making additions to\nsame would not put same in a first class condition for proper school\npurposes. Therefore we do respectfully urge that a new school be\nbuilt, fully modern in every respect, and particularly to include a\ngymnasium, and one capable of favorable comparison with a similar type\nused for the white children, and one that will not only fulfill the\npresent needs, but capable of providing for our increasing school\npopulation.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPaul Acoose, Counsellor.\nLouis Acoose, Noel Acoose\nNoel Joe Williams\n\nIndian Affairs.

Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose the originals of two letters which I have just received from the Indians of Cowesses Reservation in Saskatchewan, in which they ask for a new fireproof school to replace the present building.\n\nThe Indians of this reservation are very conscious of the danger to which their children are being exposed in the present old school building and their desire to have it replaced by a modern fireproof building is quite normal and natural.\n\nOn my return from the Makenzie District, I stopped at Cowesses School and I can assure you that what is said in these letters is quite accurate.\n\nIn your coming estimates it is to be hoped that provisions will be made for this project. These Indians are a deserving group and the fact that they have already written several times about this same matter shows on their part a desire to give their children a modern education which the Department has every advantage to encourage.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain, Mr. Keenleyside,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Flourde, O.M.I.\n\nEnc1. 2\nOn the date mentioned above I, W.J. Redwood, constable of Lowered band of Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nI am sending you a few lines on behalf of Crooked Lake Agency in order to ask you for some help, as you know yourself that we need a new school in Marieval. Our school that we have is only a fire trap too old and too small. We need a school at least for 200 children. I did will say that we have children in the Reserve should be in school, but there is no room for them. Some time ago a petition was sent to the Indian Dept. and was signed by all Indians and headmen. But we got no satisfaction. But we still feel we should get a new school. Rev. Father Sam\nasking you to help us with all your power to get a new school. By doing this you might be saving a lot of lives. We don't know what is going to happen anytime with this old school as I said before it's only a fire trap. I will also add that we have a good staff in this school, we have a good principal who does his very best to cooperate with the Indians, and good to everyone also the sisters are good to all the children. They are really taking place of mothers. So we have something to be proud of. Hope this will put in your mind our big question is worth something and why we like to keep up our Roman Catholic school.\n\nN.J. Remmert\nCowesses Indian Reservation,\nMarieval, P.O., Sask.\n\nReverend Father J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOblate Fathers University,\nOttawa.\n\nReverend and Dear Father;\n\nOur Reverend and dear Principal and Pastor, Father J. Lemire, has told us that we could put into your hands our request for a new and larger fire-proof Indian residential School. Twice already we have made petition to the Department of ours for the urgent need of a new and larger fire-proof School, but it seems that no worthwhile consideration has been given to our petitions.\n\nBeing Indians, it does not mean that we do not love our children, and then could be exposed to the greatest danger. As you must know yourself this actual residential School is a fire-trap and a real danger for the lives of our beloved children. We certainly feel unsafe sending our children this said School at the present, and we conscientiously believe that we should not send them at all, especially knowing so many Schools of the kind burning down. We do not wish to be mean to the Department, as mostly all of us have went through this present School, and we surely are very grateful to the Department for the education received, and also to the reverend Fathers and Sisters.\n\nRev. Father J. Lemire, we know, is taking all precaution possible actually for the safety of our children, still the danger is existing and very great.\n\nThis said residential School is not only a fire-trap, but also far too small. We do appreciate a lot the education given at the School, and we wish to see all the children to have the opportunity to be educated.\n\nWe do hope, reverend and dear Father Plourde, that you may present our request to the Indian Department in our behalf, and you succeed to obtain for us a new and larger fire-proof residential School\u2014-for the accommodation and the safety of our beloved children, and also of our dear staff, who is exposed also seriously.\n\nWe are very grateful, rev. and dear Father, for all you are doing and will do for us.\n\nOn behalf of the Indians of Cowesses reservation specially of those who have children at the said School, and are mostly interested of a larger and fire-proof building, we do sign hereunder.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Such a project would release considerable space in the present building, which could be used for dormitories and recreation room.\n\nI, therefore, hope that you will be able to consider my proposition favourably when preparing your estimates if you find it impossible, as stated above, to erect a complete new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

But I did not see him after the examinations took place. In consequence, I am not certain of recommendations he made.\n\nIn any case action should be taken at once to replace the condemned boiler.

While this school was not on his original itinerary, the visit was arranged at the request of Regional Supervisor J.P.B. Ostrander, who obtained the necessary authority by telegram from this Division through the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe following report is the result of the survey made:\n\nThe heating system is a one-pipe low pressure steam type, not of modern design. It was reported to our Officer that the system functioned as well as could be expected under present circumstances. The existing low pressure steam steel fire box boiler was found to be of insufficient capacity, and in addition, several tubes were leaking. No record could be found with regard to its age but it may be assumed to be between 20 and 25 years old.\n\nWith a boiler of insufficient capacity, which shows considerable damage as a result of forcing, it would be uneconomical to incur expenditures for repairs.\n\nDr. Simes of the Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital, in a letter to Indian Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, offered a 35-horse power Leonard low pressure steam, steel fire box boiler for use at the above school. Our Officer visited the hospital and inspected the boiler and obtained all details in connection therewith.\n\nThe boiler was installed in 1936 as an emergency measure while general repairs and revisions were being made to the hospital power plant, and in all, was only used for a period of 10 to 15 hours. Our Officer found it to be in all-round first class condition. It is therefore recommended that this boiler be acquired by Indian Affairs for installation at Cowessess to replace the present 25-horse power unit.\n\nThere is an old 15-horse power Case threshing machine, locomotive type, high pressure boiler in the boiler room of the school which supplies the laundry with high pressure steam. This unit was found to be so badly worn and deteriorated as to be a source of great danger. It should be immediately cut out of service. The plates are worn exceedingly thin in spots and its operation to\n\nR. A.

It has not yet been returned to the manufacturer.\n\nIt is recommended that this unit be purchased by the Indian Affairs Branch for removal to, and installation in the Cowessess School.\n\nWhile the matter is urgent, it is unlikely that any contractor would submit a firm tender for carrying out work of this nature. It is thought, however, that a number of firms may be willing to undertake the work at cost plus a percentage, or at cost plus a fixed fee, in which connection is suggested that the firm of Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon, who are familiar with the situation, be asked along with other contractors, to submit an estimate for carrying out this work.\n\nShould the Indian Affairs Branch accept the foregoing recommendations, this Division will prepare a specification covering the work to be carried out, for use in obtaining estimates.\n\nChief Engineer.\nNEALE, STOTHARD & CHAPMAN\nTINSMITHING, PLUMBING AND HEATING\n118 EIGHTH STREET\nBRANDON, MANITOBA\n\nSept. 29/48\n\nBernard F.

One 2\" Injector, all pipes, fittings, valves, labor, transportation and board to complete this installation.\n\nTo disconnect and remove low pressure Leonard Boiler, #312635, plus off connections, change smoke breeching, clean up site at Indian Hospital, Qu'Appelle, Sask.\n\nTo transport and install same in Cowesses School, complete with new smoke breeching, (Boiler to Chimney), all pipes, fittings, valves, labor, transportation and board to complete this installation as a one pipe heating system to your satisfaction for the sum of $3,676.40.\n\nFurther to the above, it would be, in our opinion, greatly to the advantage of the School to have the low pressure heating Boiler stokerized, as the Boiler being installed is not any too large. Therefore, we quote for your approval as follows:\n\nTo -- One Canadian Fairbanks-Morse #1-350 Industrial Stoker equipped with 110 to 120 D.C. Motor, installed complete with:\n1-- McDenneill Millar #47-2 Feeder and Cutoff.\n1-- #P404 Pressuretrol.\n1-- R. 19A Relay.\n1-- T. 11A Thermostat.\n1-- C.R. 7006 Magnetic Switch.\n\nThis Stoker will burn the low grade Souris coal and is sized for that purpose.\n\nThe above for the sum of $1,605.65.\n\nTotal price complete, $5,282.05.\n\nRegarding old Case steam Engine at Cowesses School, you are of course informed that this Boiler was used also for power. Is it the intention of your department to run the Laundry, Dairy, Pressure Pump and Sump Pump from the power plant supplying the electric power? Or was it your intention to have a steam engine installed for power and supplied by steam from the high pressure boiler?\n\nPlease advise, as we have made no provisions for power take off or steam engine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNeale, Stothard & Chapman.\n\nPer [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The heating boiler which it is contemplated to use, is 10 horsepower larger than the existing unit, and is large enough to handle the heating load when fired by hand.\n\nThe high pressure boiler is intended to serve several items of existing laundry equipment only, including the tumbler dryer and the box coil drying cabinets.\n\nIt is understood that this work will be carried out by the Indian Affairs Branch, and will be under the nominal supervision of Indian Superintendent Kerley and that no funds will be transferred to this Division.\n\nR.A.

He has no objection to the change, but it seems that no provision was made for another steam engine. If that be so, he wonders how he will be able to operate the laundry machinery. I believe that it would be in order for your engineer to examine the power facilities at the school and suggest such changes as he may deem fit. It would certainly be unfortunate if the laundry was left for a certain period of time without sufficient power to operate.\n\nMoreover, he states in the same letter that it is impossible to secure good cordwood and he is therefore obliged to install a stoker, the value of which will be between fourteen and fifteen hundred dollars. This is also a matter which your engineer should study. Wages in a matter of this kind are so important a factor that mechanical facilities might be provided where they are found necessary or very useful.\n\nWill you please let me know at your convenience if the Department can do anything to remedy both conditions.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

I believe that it would be in order for your engineer to examine the power facilities at the school and suggest such changes as he may deem fit. It would certainly be unfortunate if the laundry was left for a certain period of time without sufficient power to operate.\n\nMoreover, he states in the same letter that it is impossible to secure good cordwood and he is therefore obliged to install a stoker, the value of which will be between fourteen and fifteen hundred dollars. This is also a matter which your engineer should study. Wages in a matter of this kind are so important a factor that mechanical facilities might be provided where they are found necessary or very useful.\"\n\nYou will recall that with regard to the stoker, funds were not available this year for the work, and we did not accept that part of Mr. Stothard's tender which dealt with the installation of an industrial stoker. However, we would like to have your comments with regard to the steam engine.\n\nActing Director.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, December 1, 1948.\n\nRe: Cowesses Indian Residential School,\nCowesses, Sask.\n\nIn connection with Major MacKay's memorandum of November 26th bearing your notation of the 30th, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWhile no mention was made of a new engine in our memorandum of October 12th, enquiries were instituted to obtain prices and delivery of a new unit. Thus far prices have not been received.\n\nIn the meantime, in order to provide temporary service, it is suggested that the old engine be removed from the old Case Boiler and set up on a firm base in the boiler room and piped to the new horizontal return tubular high pressure boiler now being installed, to provide temporary service for the laundry machinery. As far as could be determined at the time the inspection was carried out, the engine appeared capable of providing power for the laundry machinery, for a limited time at least.\n\nIn dismantling this engine, it will likely be found that in order to provide continuous and efficient service, major repairs will be necessary. As this unit has been in use for a considerable length of time, it would more than likely prove extremely difficult and uneconomical to effect such repairs, and it is considered that a new engine should be installed.\n\nThe purpose of this steam engine, is to drive a line of shafting and counter-shafting which in turn is connected to the various items of laundry machinery through belts and pulleys. Since the electrical services at the school are taken care of by a direct current generating unit, which incidentally is loaded to capacity, it is not possible to drive the laundry machinery by means of electric motors.\n\nWhen prices have been received for the proposed new engine, a further recommendation will be submitted for your approval and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 7, 1948.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nCowessess Residential School - Steam Engine\n\nIt is understood that the low pressure heating boiler has been installed and is now in operation at this school.\n\nOur reports indicate that the brick layer should have finished bricking-in the high pressure boiler by this time. As you are probably aware, we have spent a considerable sum at this school this year and our funds are running low.\n\nTherefore, our engineers have been asked to advise with regard to carrying on with the old steam engine. Their report is attached hereto in duplicate.\n\nWould you please confer with the principal of the school and find out whether it is possible for these adjustments to be made locally. Mr. Hargreaves advises me that one of the Brothers at the school might be capable of providing temporary adjustments.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\no/c to Rev. J.O.

This engine became so old and worn that it was necessary to dismantle it. It was condemned by the Provincial Boiler Inspector as being too dangerous to use. In some places the metal was too thin to work with. The purpose of the steam is to drive a line of shafting and counter-shafting which in turn is connected to the various items of laundry machinery through belts and pulleys. Since the electrical services at the school are taken care of by a direct current generating unit, which unfortunately is loaded to capacity, it is not possible to drive the laundry machinery by means of electrical motors.\n\nOn December 17, a memorandum was submitted to the Lands and Development Services Branch concerning the installation of a small Diesel Engine at this school. We have just received a call from the Engineering and Construction Division of this Branch advising that a 20 horse power Diesel is available at the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Factory. This firm has quoted to our Engineer a price of $1,660.00 f.o.b. the Cowessess Residential School, Grayson, Saskatchewan. Apparently we are very fortunate in being able to locate such an engine and particularly at a price which is so fair and reasonable.\n\nI was advised by the Engineers that immediate action will be necessary if we are to secure this machine. I\nhave, therefore, prepared a requisition for its purchase and am sending this letter and the requisition to you by hand. I would appreciate your phoning to Mr. Lee of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Branch in Ottawa at phone number 3-7779 if you can obtain the necessary approval for its purchase.\n\nAt the present time, it is necessary to do all the laundry at this school by a small electrical washer or by hand. It is obvious that this condition cannot last for any length of time particularly as the Indians are complaining about the use of child labour in our school. Normally, it would take three or four months to obtain such an engine, and we would appreciate your cooperation in obtaining the one mentioned above which can be delivered in two or three weeks.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| Repair # | Description          | Amount |\n|----------|----------------------|--------|\n| 123818   |                      | 9.01   |\n| 123822   |                      | 6.49   |\n| 123821   |                      | 9.35   |\n| 123820   |                      | 6.64   |\n| 123819   |                      | 4.70   |\n| 123824   |                      | 7.80   |\n| 123823   |                      | 8.41   |\n| 179335   |                      | 13.07  |\n\nTotal: 64.47\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our understanding is that this boiler could not be properly installed at the Gordon's Residential School owing to lack of space, and it was necessary to secure a horizontal boiler.\n\nPayment was not made for the vertical boiler, and before it had been finally decided that it could not be used, the president of the plumbing company doing the work died, and his business was evidently taken over by someone else. While the contract for the plumbing and heating was satisfactorily completed, the new owner did not wish to take back the vertical boiler.\n\nAt that time, Mr. Hargreaves of your Division was in the west and ascertained that a new boiler was needed at the Cowessess School, and it was found that the vertical boiler, surplus to requirements at the Gordon's School, would be satisfactory for the Cowessess School. Arrangements were then made to transfer the vertical boiler to that school.\n\nWe have now received an account amounting to $932.86 covering the cost of the vertical boiler, and we will have to secure a Purchase Order before payment can be made.\nWe would, therefore, appreciate it if you would let us have as much information as your Branch has available, in order to assist us in securing a Purchase Order.\n\nPP/ST Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: Washing Machines for Pine Creek and Cowessess Indian Residential Schools\n\nQuotations on two washing machines for use at the above schools are enclosed.

(RG 10, Volume 6303, file 651-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to the enclosed copy of a Purchase Order for a Diesel Power Unit which has been delivered to the Cowessess Indian Residential School at Grayson, at a cost of $2,162.00, when visiting at the Cowessess School recently, and discussing this motor with Reverend Father Lemire, the Principal, and Indian Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, it appeared that this equipment cannot be used satisfactorily at the Cowessess School for lighting purposes.\n\nNo generator came with the power unit, and a generator of an A.C. type is required to use it. Even if a generator is supplied, the Reverend Principal is not satisfied with such an arrangement without batteries. This type of power unit is for furnishing power direct from the generator without storage batteries. As the Department is aware, storage batteries are practically essential at a residential school, as it often happens that one or two lights are necessary through the night because of sickness and for the use of the Night Watchmen in his travels. Such temporary lights cannot be supplied without starting the motor unless there are storage batteries.\n\nReverend Father Lemire informed me that when Mr. Hargreaves visited his school he drew to the attention of Mr. Hargreaves that new storage batteries would be needed shortly, as the old ones have just about outlived their usefulness. Indian Superintendent Kerley informed me that he forwarded to the Department a requisition for new batteries.\n\nNeither Reverend Father Lemire nor Mr. Kerley are aware of any requisition having been forwarded to the Department for the power unit which has been delivered.\n\nPlease instruct me further in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

A copy of our purchase order is attached for your information.\n\nAlso attached is a copy of letter dated June 20th, 1949, from Regional Supervisor Ostrander. This letter explains itself, and we would appreciate it if you would advise us as soon as possible what further action you consider should be taken.\n\nActing Director.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, July 18, 1949.\n\nRe: Cowesses Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of July 12th bearing your marginal notation of the 14th instant, to which was attached copy of Regional Supervisor Ostrander's letter of June 20th, you are advised as follows:\n\nMr. Ostrander's letter indicates a total lack of knowledge regarding the purpose served by the diesel engine referred to, and it is felt that a brief review of the facts at this time would be worthwhile.\n\nOur Mr. Hargreaves visited the above school last August and recommended that a new high pressure boiler be purchased and installed, as the existing threshing machine type high pressure boiler was in a precarious state. It was felt at that time, that the steam engine, which was mounted on the old boiler, could be salvaged, repaired and connected to the new high pressure boiler and could continue to drive the line shafting which powers the laundry machinery.\n\nHowever, in dismantling the boiler, the engine was found to be in such poor condition, that it could be put to no further use.\n\nWe then recommended the purchase of a diesel engine fitted with a suitable fly-wheel pulley for driving the laundry line shafting. Our memorandum to you dated January 15th for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch, clearly stated the purpose of this unit.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Ostrander's letter was written before he acquainted himself with the facts. It also appears that neither the Principal nor Indian Superintendent Kerley were informed by the Indian Affairs Branch as to the reason for supplying this engine, or if so, they both have failed to remember.\n\nWhen our officer made his visit, Principal Lemire was verbally advised to request the Indian Affairs Branch through Indian Superintendent Kerley for new batteries when required, for use in the existing DC diesel operated lighting plant.\n\nIn the light of the above information, it can be clearly seen that the diesel engine recently supplied to the school, has no connection whatever with the lighting plant, but is intended to provide power through pulleys and line shafting to operate the laundry equipment.\n\nChas.

As a result of his visit the Lands and Development Services recommended the purchase of a Diesel Power Unit to which you refer in your letter. In recommending the purchase the Lands and Development Services wrote as follows:\n\n\"We have investigated the performance and general characteristics of the Fairbanks-Morse Company Model 48AS 41 diesel power unit which is offered complete with standard equipment, and it is our opinion that the Indian Affairs Branch would be well advised to purchase this unit for driving the line shafting in connection with the various items of laundry equipment at the above.\n\nIt is recommended that this machine be run at 1200 R.P.M., at which speed a rating of 19-5 H.P. can be obtained. This capacity should be sufficient for the purpose.\n\nIn view of Mr. Hargreaves' visit to the school, we do not feel that it was necessary to explain this matter...\"\nAgain to the principal as we felt that he understood the reasons for supplying the power unit.\n\nHowever, on receipt of your letter of June 20th, we again took up the matter with the Lands and Development Services and I enclose for your information a copy of their reply.\n\nI am sending a duplicate copy of this letter and also a duplicate copy of the report from the Lands and Development Services so that you may forward them for the information of the principal of the Cowessess School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMcN\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Cowessess Residential School,\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 09-622 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\nSHIP TO Rev.

I am informed that there are over 200 children who are asking to be admitted to the Cowesses School, and there is no room for them as only about 100 can be received in the present school.\n\nSome two years ago, promise was made that a class-room block would be built so as to make room for the large number of children who are not yet receiving any education.\n\nCircumstances apparently did not allow you to proceed with this project, but it is hoped that you may do so during the current fiscal year.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nNovember 1st, 1949.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nRe: Cowessess Indian Residential School\n\nWe have your letter of October 29th recommending that a classroom block be erected at the above school.\n\nWhen we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1950-51, careful consideration will be given to your request.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 4th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nAs you are aware, we included in our appropriation a few years ago, an amount for a classroom block at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. We did not proceed with the construction of this building, and no funds have been provided for it in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nWe have received representations lately that the school management has been applying for some years past for a classroom block at this school, and they consider that funds for the construction of the building should be included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1950-51.\n\nPlease let us have your comments on the matter by army signal as soon as possible. It is noted that you did not include this item in your letter of October 7th, in which you forwarded a list of the Indian day schools which you consider should be erected in the Province of Saskatchewan during the next fiscal year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nREGINA\n\nNOVEMBER 7 1949\n\nP PHILAN\n\nRE LETTER NOVEMBER 4 ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM CONVESSS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL MR OSTRANDER ON NORTHERN INSPECTIONS THIS WEEK CONVENT AS REQUESTED BY ARMY MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY HE RETURNS TO REGINA OFFICE\n\nSCOVILL\n\nPM/AS\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Mr. Phelan\n\nYour letter of the 4th instant, File 1-1-5 Sask./651-5 (EL) arrived in this office on November 7th when I was absent in the northern part of the province. You will have received an Army Message from Mr. H.F. Scovill acknowledging receipt of the letter and advising that the matter referred to would be given attention upon my return to the office.\n\nI am not giving the information by Army Signal as tomorrow is a holiday and an Air Mail letter will reach the Department on Saturday morning, the 12th.\n\nWith regard to the matter of a classroom block for the Cowessess Indian Residential School I was under the impression that funds are available in this year's Appropriation to build the classroom block, but that the Department had delayed the construction because of the fact that a decision had not been made as to what kind of a building would be constructed if one was constructed at all.\n\nIt has always been my opinion that a separate building is needed at the Cowessess School, and that if it is built it should be a dormitory building of one storey.\n\nI know the Department is aware that the Cowessess School is not by any means safe against loss of life by fire. It would burn very quickly, and has too many corridors and corners where trouble could result if children had to be removed from the school quickly during the night. With this in mind I must say that I cannot agree with the policy of having the children in a safe building of one storey in the daytime for classroom work, and at night in a dangerous location, too high off the ground for them to jump out safely in case of fire. Actually, the classrooms in the main building at the Cowessess School leave little to be desired, and one more classroom could easily be added in the main building in one of the dormitories if a dormitory building of one storey was built a short distance away from the main building.\n\nI know there are some objections to having children sleeping on the ground floor, but one very important thing in its favour is that in case of fire if a doorway gets blocked there is no difficulty in kicking out a window or windows through which the children can climb with safety. If the school authorities do not wish to have the older girls and boys sleeping on the ground floor of a one storey dormitory building I see no reason why arrangements could not be made in such a building for sleeping quarters for all the younger children of both sexes. Certainly, in case of fire, the older boys and girls are much less likely to have difficulty in vacating the building by the fire escapes.\n\nIt is my recommendation that a dormitory building be erected on a suitable plan to provide dormitory space for 40 boys and 40 girls and that the classrooms remain in the main building. If it is decided to approve my recommendation I see no reason why this building could not be constructed in....\nnot be constructed in two parts, if necessary constructing half of it, or accommodation for 40 children in 1950, and, if found practical, an addition to house another 40 children could be added in 1951. I suggest this because of the fact that the present emergency would be met, and there would be sufficient room in the building suggested to provide accommodation for 40, or all of the younger children. The immediate fire hazard would thus be partially met, and the dormitory space now being used by those 40 children could become classroom space.\n\nI am unable to give any estimate of the cost of a building to provide dormitory space for 40 children, but I have no doubt that the Engineering Services could furnish a close enough estimate on this for immediate use in providing the money in the 1950-51 Appropriation.\n\nJ.P.B.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 47035 dated Oct. 24th, 1949.\n\nVoucher No. 856\n\nDATE: Nov. 30th, 1949\nCowessess Indian Residential School:\n\nAdditional accommodation:\n\nWith Mr. Supt Kerley I surveyed the existing buildings and the nearby reserves and checked population statistics. I had a long discussion also with the Reverend Principal and he and the Departmental officials concerned concur in the following recommendations:\n\n(1) Instead of a class-room block on the school grounds, supply modern dormitory space.\n\n(2) Convert the Cowessess Agency office to school purposes\n\n(3) Permit the attendance as day pupils at the residential school of the few Indian children who could go attend.\n\n(4) Permit the residential school to serve the metis or non-Indian children who live near the reserve (on road allowances and other non-taxpaying property).\n\nRegarding the first recommendation Mr. Regional supervisor Ostrander wrote to you on November 10th, suggesting a one-story dormitory building. This might not be adequate for the needs of this area, as the children are so scattered that residential facilities are necessary for a minimum of one hundred twenty pupils unless it is the intention to go back to one-room and two-room schools and abandon the advantages which concentration of pupils permits. I may seem to be contradicting myself in recommending the one-room or two-room school at the old agency, but I have to suggest that the eligible pupils from this school receive their vocational training at the residential school centre. Other ways in which they could share the activities of the larger centre could be arranged. The people for miles around visit the school's new hall for movies, pool and bowling.\n\nThe residential school has an authorized pupilage of 110. I counted 125 present. That means that some sleep two to a bed. The plumbing is ancient and inadequate for mass use but would serve for individual use during school-hours. The corridors, stairways and fire escapes seem to me hazardous during the hours of darkness.\n\nThe present main building could continue to supply living quarters and chapel for the staff, office and reception rooms, infirmary and sewing quarters. In this building there are at present three rooms being used as class-rooms and a fourth room as a sewing-instruction room. The former larger sewing-room has become a dormitory; 16 girls and one staff member. It could be a regular class-room. The two top-floor dormitories which have dormer windows and sloping ceilings could be adapted for class work, perhaps for the lower grades or for manual arts. Thus there would be room for 150 or more pupils during the day. As a start a dormitory building for girls only would release half the attic and the small girls' dormitory and allow a safer distribution of the boys on the top floor and make available one more classroom.\nThe second suggestion (converting the agency office) might get under way at an early date so as to use any funds surplus to requirements between now and March 31st 1950. The cost will be comparable to the cost at Saddle Lake or Winterburn (Stonyplain).\n\nThe third recommendation might be arranged to go into effect after Christmas on an experimental basis. It would relieve some of the present congestion in dormitories.\n\nThe fourth suggestion would involve some negotiations with the Province of Saskatchewan, but the school already deals with the Province because the nearby Metis school is taught by a reverend sister who is associated with the residential school. The single Grade 8 pupil enrolled at the residential school in reality does her school work as a pupil at the Metis school. Here is an opportunity to implement the Parliamentary Committee's recommendation that wherever possible Indian children be educated along with other children. There are presently about thirty-five of these Metis. If they were consolidated with the residential school and distributed throughout the grades (as day pupils or in some cases boarders), another teacher could be added to strengthen the present staff and to permit better division of the grades. Social conditions in the area would also be subject to improvement. The Cowessess Co-op is already an example of Indians co-operating with non-Indians, so also is Grouard. In the educational field there are already similar mergers at Grouard, Fort Chipewyan, Ermineskin, (Church-owned residential schools) and Hobbs, Big Eddy and Wahpotan Sioux day schools. The fact that Cowessess is a government-owned school would allow the Department to have a voice in the negotiations.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nIndian Affairs.

I concur in Major Clark's recommendation that some of the children living near the school begin attending on a day basis after the Christmas holidays and in this way relieve the present congestion in the dormitories.\n\nPROPOSAL A:\n\nThis would of course involve rather lengthy negotiations with the Saskatchewan Department of Education.\n\nBernard F.

Miller,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to purchase for the purpose of making\na farm in connection with our Indian boarding school, t\nthe following land belonging to Cowessess Band of\nIndians. That is to say, the portion of land bounded\non the east by Weed creek, on the north by the hill,\non the west by Crooked Lake, on the north by the\nQu'Appelle river, with the exception of four acres\nintended for Cemetery and church purposes.\n\nThe price I am willing to pay is $15.00 per\nacre cash.\n\nIn connection with this application I have\nreason to believe that a good majority of the Indians\nwill be favorable to making the surrender, and that\nthe price stated will be satisfactory, as I consider\nit a very fair valuation.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department at an\nearly a date as possible would have a deed of\nsurrender submitted to the Indians for their approval,\nso that the land could be surveyed by the survey\nparty, who I understand, is to shortly begin surveying\nthe other portions of the Indian lands which have\nbeen surrendered.\n\nAsking favorable consideration of this\napplication,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sig'd.) S. Perreault,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter dated 8th instant of the Rev. S. Perreault, Principal of Cowessess Boarding School, addressed to me, asking for a deed of surrender to be submitted to the Indians of Cowessess band for certain lands situated near the school, which he desires to purchase, and is willing to pay $15.00 per acre for cash for the land. He states it as his opinion that a majority of the Indians will favor a surrender if it is submitted.\n\nI forward the application to you and would request that you will be good enough to forward same to the Department with a report in the matter, as you are familiar with the circumstances.\n\nI beg to point out if it is decided to ask the Indians to surrender this land for the purpose stated, that care must be taken to reserve a roadway, say 60' wide between the south boundary and the base of the hill for the purpose of making a roadway through the land asked for to Crooked Lake, along the bank of which a great deal of the wood, and most of the building timber belonging to this Band is located, and is only accessible by crossing the land which Father Perreault desires to purchase.\n\nI may also point out that the only hay obtainable in the valley is included in the portion of land described by the Rev. Father. The hay flat is on the north side and near the Qu'Appelle river.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInsp. of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres.\nIt might be well to consider whether this hay land should be kept for the Indians.\n\nIt is said to be the wish of the Indians, in the event of surrender of this land, that they should be paid the whole of the proceeds in equal shares per capita, no part of the proceeds to be funded. Father Perrault is prepared to pay $3,000.00 at time of taking surrender, and the balance as soon as the quantity of land is ascertained.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) M. Miller,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. Father Perreault, Principal of the Cowessess Boarding School on Cowessess Reserve, asking that a block of land in the rear of his school about 200 acres and owned by the Indians be sold to the Roman Catholic Church for the purpose of establishing a home farm in connection with the school.\n\nI also enclose a copy of our letter from our Agent at Crooked Lakes dealing with the matter.\n\nWhen at Crooked Lakes last winter the matter was brought up by the Rev. Principal, who is much handicapped in not having a farm in connection with his school (which is a good one) and I went over the property and I consider the price offered viz. $15.00 per acre full value. I do not however approve of selling any new land that might be included, but as this is all at one end of the property it could well be withheld.\n\nThe large majority of the Indians on Cowessess reserve are treaty half-breeds and members of the Roman Catholic Church and I am led to believe that they are willing to sell, and if the Department grants the Principal's request I would suggest that the surveyors who are to be on this reserve in a short\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Act provides that only one half may be paid them. I think this point should be explained to the Indians, and if they are still willing to make the surrender, the survey may go ahead; if not it is to be held in abeyance.\n\nDr. Minister,\n\nThis land is situated in the northern and unoccupied portion of the Reserve. It will require to be surrendered in the usual manner; for this purpose the survey is required. Mr. Reid is now surveying the southern and surrendered part of the reserve. S.

Mr. Graham has been authorized to take the surrender. I have, however, to inform you that the Indians desire that the whole of the proceeds be divided among them. The Department is willing to distribute the full amount allowed by law, viz 50%. If the Indians do not accede to this, you are not to make the survey and no further action in the matter is to be taken.\n\nThe survey is to be made in the usual manner or which you are well informed. If at all convenient, the lines should conform with the projected section lines or be parallel to them.

If the sale is made the Department can distribute to the Indians only the per cent allowed by law namely, 50 per cent, the rest will have to be funded for the benefit of the band. Should a lease be decided upon, however, the rental payable thereunder can be distributed to the Indians in cash or expended for their benefit as may be arranged or decided according to the circumstances during the currency of the lease.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

The Land in question is situated as follows:- Situated on the East end of the Crooked Lake, bounded on the North by the Qu'Appelle River, on the East by Weed Creek, on the West by the Lake on the River.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nThe Indians are now quite willing to surrender the Land to the Roman Catholic Church for the purposes mentioned, and are willing to accept the terms offered, viz $15.00 per acre, and a payment of 50% at the time of signing after deducting 10% for Land management.\n\nThe Revd Father Perrault informs me that he has the cash ready to make the full payment, and I would suggest that the payment be made of 50% at the time of signing on the three hundred acre basis, and after the Land has been surveyed and the exact acreage determined, the difference, if any, can be paid to the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, September 8, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 24th ultimo, No. 5, in regard to the question of surrender of a portion of the Cowessess Indian Reserve, applied for by the Rev.

The meeting was duly held in accordance with the rules of the Band and the Surrender submitted. Nearly every male Indian on the reserve was present and the vote was almost unanimous, only three voting against the proposition.\n\nAfter completing the papers I started in to pay them the fifty per cent proceeds of Cheque No. 487, $2025.00. All Indians present were paid, but it will be some weeks before I can send you the pay-sheet, as there were a good many female absentees.\n\nAs instructed I am sending you an Imperial Bank Draft for the money received from Rev.

Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nREGINA, SASK., October 31st\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn December 14, 1902, you issued to Mr. Hegele a Patent for a portion of this reserve. The description in the Patent refers to the survey of the road made by the Provincial Government in the year 1903. In checking the Patent with the plan of the road, I find that the same does not correspond with the land mentioned in the patent, as the land mentioned in the patent over laps the roadway.\n\nI enclose herewith blue print copy of the roadway as affects the land mentioned in patent, and by referring to the same you will see that the two descriptions do not correspond.\n\nKindly let me hear from you as to what steps you are prepared to take, so as to make the corrections.\n\nApparently the plan of this land was made by one J. K. McLean, D. L. O., but we have not the copy thereof, in this office.\n\nI have today seen the surveyor who surveyed the Government road and he informs me that while most of his field work was done in 1903, the plan was not completed until 1905, and some slight alterations were made in this.\n\nNo doubt this will account for the variations between the plan and the Patent.\n\nI will be obliged if you will let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6304, file 651-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st ultimo inclosing blue print and mentioning that the land covered by patent issued by this Department in December 1909, conveying to the Les Rev. Peres Oblates, a portion of the Cowessess Indian Reserve, overlaps the Provincial Government road; and stating that the discrepancy in the description might arise from the fact that although this road was surveyed in 1908, the plan was prepared in 1909, and some slight alterations were made on it.\n\nThe bearings and chainages of the north limit of this road, as returned by our surveyor, are not identical with those shown on the road plan, but the description expressly states the boundary in question to be along the north limit (and the north limit produced to the south limit of Crooked Lake) of the road to Crooked Lake surveyed in 1908 by the Provincial Government; on this account and from the fact that the monuments on the ground govern the survey, the description cannot be construed to include any part of said road.\n\nEnclosed please find blue print of the plan referred to in the patent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Registrar,\nLands Titles Office,\nRegina.\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Beys, O.M.I., Principal of Cowessess Boarding School, in which the school authorities wish to erect a pasture on Cowessess Reserve.\n\nThe meeting opened at 2 o'clock P.M., there being present E. Taylor, Indian Agent; A. Boyer, clerk; H. Cameron, Interpreter; Joe Lerat, chief; Norbert Delorme and Pierre Lerat, headmen; and 19 voting Indians.\n\nThe agent informed the Indians that the Principal of the school desired to be given permission to build a fence on their reserve, size about one mile by about one and a half miles, for the purpose of pasturing during the summer season the cattle belonging to the school. The land which the Principal desired to enclose by the fence was of such a nature that it would not by allowing it to be enclosed affect the Indians of the Band in their agricultural or other industries, and as the school had no land of its own which could be utilized for a pasture and at the same time have sufficient land for grain growing or other purposes the agent thought that the Indians especially if they took into consideration which they should do the benefits derived from the school would after due consideration give their consent to the proposed fence being built. He, however, told them that after he had explained as nearly as was possible at the present moment the boundaries of the proposed fence and what remuneration the Band would derive from such a source that he would leave it to them for their consideration and if they were agreeable for the fence to be built he would afterwards\nafterwards submit the whole matter to the Department, and that\nthe Department would after due consideration and in the best\ninterests of the Band give a decision on the matter and instruct\nhim accordingly.\n\nThe agent then outlined, as nearly as was possible,\nthe boundaries of the fence and also described the land which\nwould be enclosed. From such description it appeared that quite\na lot of timber, both green and dead poplar, would be enclosed,\nbut the school authorities agreed to provide gates wherever\nnecessary that the Indians in order to have access to the timber\nwould not be placed at any disadvantage to what belonged to them.\nAs regards remuneration to the Band the agent told the Indians\nthat the school was agreeable to pay $1.00 per head annually for\nall stock over one year old pastured in the proposed enclosure.\n\nThe school authorities would erect the fence them-\nselves, and provide all the materials necessary. The proposed\nfence would not cross any government road allowances, and at\nany road commonly used by the Indians which the fence did cross\ngates would be provided.\n\nThe school authorities wished to reach an agree-\nment for the fence if built to remain and be used by the school\nfor at least ten years, but in this regard the agent said he\nwas not in a position to say whether the Department would grant\na lease for that length of time or not although if the school\nwent to the expense and trouble of building the fence it should\nbe distinctly on the understanding that the fence and land en-\nclosed thereby would be available to the school for stock graz-\ning purposes for many years. The Department however would lay\ndown a ruling in this regard and before the matter was finally\nsettled the Indians would be consulted further.\n\nJoe Lerat, chief, then said that the Indians had\ndiscussed the application of the school among themselves, and\nthat he thought they were all in favour of granting the school\nschool the privilege of building the pasture provided it was built where the agent and Principal stated. They would want the school to provide gates wherever the fence crossed commonly used roads. With reference to payment for the privilege of stock grazing in the pasture he said the Indians thought the school should pay one dollar ($1.00) per head for all stock whether under or over one year old. After discussing the matter among themselves he said they considered the school should pay one dollar ($1.00) per head for stock over one year old and fifty cents (50\u00a2) per head for all animals under that age. As regards all other matters in connection with the fence the Indians knew that the Department would not make an agreement with anyone concerning themselves or their belongings which would be to their disadvantage and that the matter would now be left with the agent for him to report thereon and they would await the Department's answer. All of the Indians present, namely, Joe Lerat, Pierre Lerat, Norbert Delorme, Zac Lerat, Francis Delorme, Paul Peltier, Joe Peltier, Agecoutay, St. Pierre Aisaican, Francoise Jos. Delorme, Michael Le Vallee, William Aisaican, J.J. Stevenson, Stanislas Young, Emanuel Lerat, Patrick Redwood, William Trottier, Napoleon Sparvier and J. B.

B. Beys, O.M.I., of Cowessess Boarding School for permission to erect a fence on Cowessess Indian Reserve for the purpose of pasturing the cattle which are raised and kept in connection with the school.\n\nHitherto such stock have partly grazed on land belonging to the school and partly on reserve land, but now the Principal desires in the best interests of the industry which is carried on in connection with the boarding school to erect an enclosure which would keep the school's cattle all together during the seasons of the year when the stock are not stabled. Practically all of the land owned by the school has been placed under cultivation so that no private land of an area large enough for pasturage is available, consequently conditions are such that a pasturage on the reserve is necessary.\n\nA majority of the voting Indians of Cowessess Band attended a meeting at the office on the 12th instant. This meeting was specially called to discuss the question, and all present voted for the school to be allowed the privilege of erecting a fence and using the land which would be enclosed thereby as a pasturage for the stock which is kept by the school.\n\nThe land which it is proposed to fence, area about one mile by about one and a half miles, is not suitable.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school would provide gates wherever the fence crossed commonly used roads, but no government road allowance would be crossed at all.\n\nThe Principal wishes an agreement to be reached whereby the pasturage so made could remain and be used by the school for a period of at least ten (10) years, but in this regard I informed both the Principal and the Indians that I could not say whether the Department would be agreeable to lease the land on the reserves or not, although if the school were given permission to build the fence it should be on the understanding that the land should be available to the school for stock grazing purposes for many years.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of the minutes of the meeting had with the Indians, and I shall be glad to have the Department's advice or instructions at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) E.

This meeting was specially called to discuss the question, and all present voted for the school to be allowed the privilege of erecting a fence and using the land which would be enclosed thereby as a pasturage for the stock which is kept by the school.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe land which it is proposed to fence, area about one mile by about one and a half miles, is not suitable for cultivation and taken as a whole it is not choice grazing land, but it is the only available land which could be used conveniently by the school for such a purpose, and moreover the Indians will not be placed at any disadvantage by the land being used in the manner desired.\n\nThe school if given permission to build the fence would purchase all the materials necessary and erect same at its own expense, and in payment for the privilege of using the area enclosed as a pasture is agreeable to pay annually to the Band's fund one dollar ($1.00) per head for cattle over one year old and fifty cents (50\u00a2) per head for all animals under that age. The school would provide gates wherever the fence crossed commonly used roads, but no government road allowance would be crossed at all.\n\nThe Principal wishes an agreement to be reached whereby the pasturage so made could remain and be used by the school for a period of at least ten (10) years, but in this regard I informed both the Principal and the Indians that I could not say whether the Department would be agreeable to lease the land on the reserves or not, although if the school were given permission to build the fence it should be on the understanding that the land should be available to the school for stock grazing purposes for many years.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of the minutes of the meeting had with the Indians, and I shall be glad to have the Department's advice or instructions at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 23rd June, 1915.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your report thereon a copy of a letter from Mr. Agent Taylor, of the Crooked Lake Agency, covering minutes of a meeting held by Cowessess Band, relative to granting the application of the Principal of Cowessess Boarding School for a pasture field on the reserve in connection with the school.\n\nFrom representations made the Department would have no objection to granting this privilege, but as you are aware could not issue a lease. A permit might be given the school to occupy the land as long as it is used for school purposes, or at least ten years.\n\nA description of the land required should be given and a sketch forwarded showing the locality.\n\nThe terms offered by the principal appear to be reasonable.\n\nKindly attend to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In all about 1000 acres. This land is mostly situated on the hillsides of the Qu'Appelle valley.\n\nI note that the Principal is prepared to pay $1.00 for cattle over 1 year old and 50\u00a2 for cattle under that age. While this might seem reasonable, I fear it might cause a good deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the Indians, for they are not unanimous for a permit, and there will be no way of exactly checking up the number of cattle that are pasturing as they will be put in and taken out at all times. In view of this I would recommend that a fixed amount be charged and in my opinion, this amount should be $100.00 per year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nSir,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Your obedient servant,\n\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

K. McLean of this property but there is no copy thereof in this office, nor does there appear to be a copy of the roadway surrendered in 1902.\n\nI would be glad if you would let me have a copy of\nthe McLean Plan and either a copy of the Plan of 1902 or a metes and bounds description of the land contained therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRegistrar.\n\nThe Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCVT/NT:\nOttawa, 3rd January 1925\n\nSir,\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 13th ultimo, I am enclosing a blueprint made from a tracing of the plan of survey by J.K. McLean, D.L.S., in 1908 of the Cowesses boarding school lands.\n\nWith reference to the explanation contained in the description of the Grant issued for this property, I have to say that the tract surrendered in 1902 was not definitely described in the surrender at that time but was referred to only as to general location and the surrender stated that the survey was to be made at a later date. The survey which would cover description in the surrender is that made by A.C. Garner in 1908 and is shown on his plan of survey of new road through Cowesses Indian reserve No.75, dated 29th April 1910. A copy of this plan, which was forwarded here by the Province and recorded under No.Rd.1035, shows the following reference Nos.-File 2375 - S R B 2790.\n\nThe road referred to in the description in 1908 by the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan is that shown on plan of survey of new road through Oakman and Cowesses reserves Nos.73 and 74 by A.C. Garner 1908-09, dated 16th March 1911, recorded in the Survey's Branch of this Department under No.Rd.1054. This plan was forwarded by the Deputy Minister of Public Works under cover of his file No.3562 and the plan is referred to as being Provincial No.2755. This plan also shows Provincial reference Numbers as follows,- S R B 3011 - Field Book 342.\n\nIt is hoped this will give you the information you require.\n\nThe Registrar,\nLand Titles Office,\nWascana, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

Your file 108-2-9 Cowessess Boarding School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant together with blue print enclosed and thank you for the information contained therein which has assisted materially in clearing up the difficulty in this situation.\n\nThe Plan recorded by you as number 1033 is registered in this office as AP-1235 and Plan 1054 is registered here as AP-2688.\n\nThere is one difficulty remaining in this matter however. In the description given in the Letters Patent and on J.K. McLean's plan the boundary of this property from the West Bank of Weed Creek to the South shore of Crooked Lake is given as follows:-\n\n\"Thence South Seventy Six degrees forty five minutes West along the said North Limit two chains and eighteen links thence along said limit north thirty seven degrees forty eight minutes West Thirteen Chains Thirty-Five Links thence along said North Limit and said north limit produced North forty-eight degrees...\"\nfifty-four minutes West fifty chains and forty-nine links to the south limit of Crooked Lake.\"\n\nPlan AP-2688 shows the first bearing as being N77.00 E, the second bearing as being S 37.29 E, the third bearing as being S 48.29 E. The distance from R 77 to R 78 is also shown as 13.34 chains.\n\nI have submitted this matter to the Chief Surveyor at Regina who was the surveyor who originally surveyed this road and he states that Plan AP-2688 correctly shows the road as surveyed by him.\n\nI would be glad if you would check the copy of this plan which you have and see if the same corresponds with the McLean Plan.\n\nAs far as this office is concerned however, I am prepared to waive the difference and to describe the land as bounded on the South by the roadway according to Plan AP-2688, but as I understand that this portion of the land is to be retransferred to your Department, it is best that the difficulty be cleared.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\nREGISTRATION DISTRICT OF MOOSOMIN\nLAND TITLES OFFICE\n\nMOOSOMIN, SASK.\n\n- 3 -\n\nup before this is done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRegistrar.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nCVT/NT:\n\nIndian Affairs.

Should, however, a transaction of this nature be completed, I would suggest that it might be better for the whole property as transferred to the Oblate Order to be re-transferred to this Department and this Department would then issue a new title with correct description of the portion to be retained by the Order. If it should be decided that the whole property would be taken over by this Department rather than a part, it would appear that the transfer could be properly made by using a description identical with that used in the grant issued to the Order.\n\nThere is no doubt that it was the intention of the Department that the North limit of the road to Crooked Lake, surveyed in 1908 by the Province of Saskatchewan, and a portion of that road produced to Crooked Lake should be the southerly boundary of that portion of the property between the east bank of Wood Creek and the South shore of Crooked Lake.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive an expression of your opinion as to the procedure above outlined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Registrar,\nLand Titles Office,\nMoosomin, Sask.\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nWith reference to the formal offer of the Cowessess Indian Residential School property made in Father Guy's letter of December 15th, last, I wish to make the following observations. In connection with page 2 of his letter, under the heading \"Actual value of the property (church authorities' valuation)\" I wish to point out that under \"Lands\", 206 acres was purchased in 1908 from the Indian reserve at $15 per acre. The 295.7 acre parcel was secured evidently in the open market. This parcel is across the Qu'Appelle river, approximately a mile from the school.\n\nAs far as buildings are concerned, the main building was completed in 1917. The Department provided a total of $1344 capital expense (fiscal years 1907-10). With reference to chattels, (page 3, Father Guy's letter and Exhibit F.) farm implements $4,890 appears satisfactory. Under Shop Equipment, whiffletrees, irons, clevises, chains, oils, bolts, screws, nails, iron, solder, stove bolts and stove pipes, a total of $292 should be subtracted from $1461, leaving $1169. The live stock inventory is satisfactory, but from the dairy, laundry and bakery shops should be deducted the refrigerator, which was built by the Department, flour, soap and lye, leather, tacks and thread, a total of $1690, leaving a balance of $691. In connection with furniture, the desks, clocks, 12 sewing machines and kitchen outfit were supplied by the Department, and the trunks could not be allowed - a total deduction of $605, leaving $2967.70. The whole clothing item of $9442.70 should be struck out, as also should the chapel equipment of $924.\n\nI note that the bake oven, $266.14, and laundry machinery, $916, supplied by the Department, 1924-25, are not included in the inventory.\n\nTo recapitulate, the church valuation of the property that we should acquire is as follows:\n\n| Lands | $14,661 |\n|-------|---------|\n| Buildings | $55,756.** |\n| Chattels | $15,069.** |\n| Total: | $85,486 |\n\n**Department expense deducted.\n\nThe church is asking that the purchase price be\n\n| Lands | $10,000. |\n|-------|---------|\n| Buildings | $50,000. |\n| Chattels | $10,000. |\n| Total: | $70,000. |\nNov. 15th 1926\n\nTo the Honorable D Scott,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable and Kind Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed assessment notices and taxes notices for the lands you kindly took over last year.\n\nThe Grayson Municipality claims that they were not duly notified by the Indian Affairs Department regarding the ownership of these properties.\n\nKindly notice that all entries are entered by different names, but they are all the properties of Lee Reverend, Rev.

MacDonald, Esq.,\nSecretary Treasurer,\nRural Municipality of Grayson\nNo. 184,\nGrayson, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Cowessess Residential School is very anxious that the Department should purchase for the use of the school, for pasture, the fractional 135 acres of the S.E. quarter of section 3, Township 19A, Range 5, W 2nd, which is offered for sale for a price of $200.00 cash. This is good pasture land and contains a good spring. The land adjoins the school field and would certainly be very useful for pasturage. I may say that the school are using a half-section of land about nine miles away from the school for pasture and this is not very convenient. If it is possible to purchase this at the present time I would recommend that it be done. The price is a great bargain, of course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX D.\n\nOttawa, October 3, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S. 5/ of the 19th ultimo, with reference to additional land for the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I regret to state there are no funds for this purpose at the present time. As this fractional quarter section is for sale at a low price, it has occurred to me that perhaps the Church authorities would be glad to secure title. As you are, no doubt, aware they have title to land north west of the actual school site, and might be glad to add the parcel in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

On their property is a chapel and priest's house.\nDear Sir:\n\nA considerable amount of correspondence has passed between this office and the office of the late Indian Commissioner, regarding a road along the valley, which road is, at the present time, running along the field which is farmed by the Cowessess Residential School and is the property of the Department. From all the information I am able to obtain on the subject, the Catholic Church, which formerly owned this land before it was sold to the Government, had allowed the road to be changed and had ploughed up some of the mounds which marked the road; consequently, when the land was taken over by the Government, this fact was overlooked and the matter continued until about 15 months ago, when the Canadian Pacific Railways, and Mr. E. Kendrick, owners of adjoining lands, complained and asked that the road be completed in the proper place.\n\nThe survey is spoiled and it is impossible to complete the road, either on the proper site or the new site until it is re-surveyed. The present location of the road, although not in the proper place, is quite as good as the approximate location of the survey which was destroyed. The site of the original survey takes the road through the school field, from end to end, cutting the field in two long narrow strips and spoiling the field considerably. In conversation with the Secretary-Treasurer of the Municipality, yesterday, he informed me that the Municipal Council were in favour of the survey being changed, but that the Department will have to stand the cost of the new survey and part of the cost of the work on the new road, before the Municipality will consent to the change in the road.\n\nI beg to enquire whether it would be possible to have this road surveyed this year. I have been thinking that possibly the Department Surveyor will be coming west this year and could stop here and run the line without much expense. If possible, I think this should be done, as there is a possibility that the Municipality will proceed with the work on the original survey and the school crop will certainly be damaged, and the field spoiled for the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S.S\n\nI am enclosing a list of the lands held in the Cowessess Indian reserve for the Indian residential school. I have to request you to advise the Department in which parcel the road to which you refer in your letter of the 29th ultimo is situated. You should also enclose a sketch showing approximately the position of the road as at present in use and also the position of the road as surveyed.\n\nIt is suggested that if you were to apply to the provincial Department of Highways for a blueprint of the surveyed road through the particular section under discussion, you could add to this print the approximate position of the road in use at present and forward the print to the Department with your reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nJ.B. Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nComplaints have been made to this Department extending over a period of two or three years, with regard to the roadway as now travelled through the south-half of section 3, township 19a, range 5, west of the 2nd meridian.\n\nIn 1900 this Department surveyed the old Valley Trail through this and adjoining lands. The plan is registered and we hold title. It appears that subsequent to this the Oblate Fathers acquired the S.W.\u00bc of 3, and that they pushed the trail back towards the hills until it is in such a location at present that it is neither a good road in winter nor summer, and the settlers complain that they cannot haul their loads over it. Our information is to the effect that the trail has been moved back more than one hundred yards.\n\nThe Municipality of Grayson, No.184, I understand, concluded an agreement last year with the then Indian Commissioner, and with Father Carriere, but just what the nature of the agreement was we do not know. I understand however that your Department has not carried out the agreement.\n\nWe have been requested to take action in the matter and if we do so, we will have no other alternative but to make a retracement survey of the trail as originally surveyed, and advise the municipality that this is the location upon which ...........\n\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.,\nOttawa., Ontario.\nwhich roadwork must be done. This action would place the road a considerable distance out into your cultivated field and no doubt would be a considerable loss to your Department. I believe that a compromise might be reached between your Department and the Municipality acting for the settlers, whereby a road could be satisfactorily located somewhere in between the surveyed location of the trail and the road that is now used, and this location would not damage your field to anything like the same extent.\n\nThis Department therefore does not desire to take action, as we feel that the best arrangement would be for a compromise between the original location and the present travelled road.\n\nAs this matter has been hanging fire for several years, I would suggest that you endeavor to reach an agreement with the municipality as soon as possible in order that this vexed question might be settled without further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.S. Carpenter,\nDeputy Minister of Highways.\n\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, 25th July 1932\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref.

MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nH.S. Carpenter Esq.,\nDeputy Minister\nDepartment of Highways\nRegina, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nAugust 8th, 1932\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter 108-2-9 in connection with the surveyed road through the field being used by the Cowessess Residential School I beg to inform you that I went over this road very carefully yesterday in company with the Reverend Fr. Carriere and a half breed who knew the location of the destroyed mounds.\n\nI am enclosing herewith blue print showing road as surveyed in 1902. The approximate location of the road now being used and the approximate location of the proposed slight change. I have no doubt that this slight change will meet with the approval of the Municipality and the Canadian Pacific Railway if this Company are paid a small indemnity for land which they will have lost by the change.\n\nI may say that the road as now used encroaches considerably upon lands owned by the C.P.R. and Fr. Carriere informs me that he could purchase the land which this encroachment affects for $200.00 and it would be worth that much for pasturage.\n\nI am aware of course that the Department has no funds provided for the purchase of lands but I believe Fr. Carriere would be glad to purchase this land with school funds in the name of H.M. the King if it meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nIn any case a survey is necessary as the Municipality and the Department of Highways insist upon it failing which they insist on taking the old survey which would certainly seriously damage the field now being used by the School as it practically cuts it into two narrow fields from end to end.\n\nAll parties concerned are satisfied to make this proposed change if the Department will stand the cost of the survey but they are all insisting upon the survey being completed without further delay.\n\nKindly instruct me further in this connection and return the Blue Print when it has served its purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostanger\nIndian Agent.\nSchools Branch,\n\nPlease note Agent's letter of 29th June under, also letter from Deputy Minister of Highways dated 19th July and Agent's letter of the 6th instant.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence that the opening of the road in the location of the official survey would be considerable detriment to the school property and that it would be particularly advantageous to have it established according to the blueprint accompanying the Agent's letter of August 6th.\n\nYou will note that the Department will be expected to cover the cost of the survey and part of the cost of road construction. There are no moneys available this year for surveys in the Province of Saskatchewan. Please advise if your Vote will take care of the cost of survey in connection with the new location for this road. If so, I will enter into correspondence with the provincial Department of Highways with a view to having this matter settled. The cost of the survey should not exceed $200.00 and would possibly be in the neighbourhood of $100.00.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 12th August 1932\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter sent this day to the Deputy Minister of Highways, Regina, and as requested, I am returning the blueprint which accompanied your letter of the 6th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nYour ref.No.3060-2\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I have to advise you that the Department is now in receipt of a report from the local Indian Agent, Mr. J.P.S. Ostrander, Broadview, with which he forwards a blueprint on which is shown in black a road as surveyed by W.T. Thompson in 1900, and in red, the road which is in present use.\n\nThe Agent states that all parties concerned would be satisfied if the surveyed road were to be established in the position of the road at present in use, with a deviation in the S.E. Sec. 3, as shown in blue, provided the Department will defray the cost of survey. The Department is disposed to approve of this arrangement, but before finally committing itself to any expenditure it would be appreciated if you would advise me of the cost to this Department to have this survey made by your Department and in addition, any other costs to which you consider this Department might be liable in connection with the establishment of the road in this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nH.S. Carpenter Esq.,\nDeputy Minister\nDepartment of Highways\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, 1st March 1933\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref. No. 3080-2\n\nMay I ask if you are now in a position to give the information requested in departmental letter dated 12th August last referring to the establishment of a road in the S.\u00bd Sec.3, Tp.19A, R.5, W.2.M.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nH.S. Carpenter Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Highways,\nRegina,\nSask.\nI regret the delay in answering your letter of March 1st. in connection with forwarding an estimate of the cost of survey of the Valley road through section 3, township 19a, range 5, west 2nd meridian.\n\nThis is a very difficult place to undertake a survey on account of many monuments missing. I have been endeavoring to obtain an estimate from Mr. K.M. Crowther, D. and S.L.S., who has more information regarding monuments in this vicinity than any other surveyor, and I hope to be able to give you his estimate shortly.\n\nWe are of the opinion that it would be to the advantage of all concerned if your Department would instruct Mr. Crowther to make this survey, as he has made several surveys in this locality and has more information regarding the old mounds than anyone else. I doubt if this Department could have its own surveyors undertake this survey this year, and I believe Mr. Crowther could do the work in less time than could this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.S. Carpenter,\nDeputy Minister of Highways.\n\nA.F.

I am now in receipt of a letter from K.M. Crowther, D.S.I.S., in which he agrees to complete the survey of the road through section 3, township 19N., range 5, west 2nd meridian, including plans for registration, for the sum of $175.00. A copy of his letter is enclosed for your information.\n\nThis Department is of the opinion that Mr. Crowther can make this survey cheaper than can this Department on account of his local knowledge of monuments, and I would suggest that the work be given to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.S. Carpenter,\nDeputy Minister of Highways.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 19th September 1933\n\nMemorandum\n\nSchools Branch,\n\nPlease note my memorandum of the 10th August 1932 under and also note in Agent's letter of 29th June 1932 that the Department would not only be required to provide the cost of survey but also part of the cost of construction of the new road. You will also note in Agent's letter of August 6th 1932 that certain lands would require to be purchased from the Canadian Pacific Railway, the cost being stated to be in the neighbourhood of $200.00.\n\nThis Spring it was ascertained that a survey could be made for $175.00 and if necessary, this amount could be provided from the Survey Vote of this year.\n\nAs the total expenditure by the Department might easily amount to $500.00 for survey, land and cost of construction, it seems to me it would be advisable to be definitely assured that the damage to the grain field, cited in Agent's letter of the 29th June, is sufficient to justify this amount of expenditure. As we have had no correspondence on the subject from the Saskatchewan Government or the Municipality during this summer, I am not aware if action on the matter is as imperative as it seemed appeared to be last year.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nI beg to refer you to your letter of the 12th August, 1932, and my reply of March 27th, 1933, in connection with survey of road through section 3, township 19a, range 5, west of the 2nd meridian.\n\nThe secretary of the Rural Municipality of Grayson, No. 184, was enquiring today what steps your Department is taking in this matter and I would be glad to hear from you in this connection at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.S. Carpenter,\nDeputy Minister of Highways.\n\nper\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 31st October 1933\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref. No. 3060-2\n\nThe answer to your letter of the 14th ultimo has been delayed pending the receipt of further information from the Indian Agent which has not yet come to hand but as soon as it is received you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nThe Deputy Minister\nDepartment of Highways,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, 31st October 1933\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 6th August 1932, I have to advise you that the Secretary of the Rural Municipality of Grayson No. 184 has again inquired as to whether this Department will assist in establishing a surveyed road in the position suggested in your letter.\n\nIt appears from your letter that a certain portion of the right of way would require to be purchased from the Canadian Pacific Railway and you suggest that the Principal of the school would provide the amount necessary to purchase this from the per capita grant.\n\nIn your letter of the 28th June 1932, you stated that the Municipality expected the Department to not only defray the cost of survey but also part of the construction of the new road. The Department does not view this latter expenditure with favour, but in reply to this latter you are requested to inform the Department what amount the Municipality estimates the Department should contribute towards the cost of construction. It is suggested that you emphasize to the Secretary of the Council the fact that the Department considers that if it defrays the cost of survey and arranges for the purchase from the Canadian Pacific Railway of the new land required for the right of way that this should be sufficient contribution on the part of the Department.\n\nYou should also advise the Department if the Principal of the school considers he can provide the funds for the purchase of the land from the Canadian Pacific Railway without additional demand on the Department.\n\nJ.P. Ostrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nBased on the information you obtain as to the cost of the land, apart from the cost of construction, if insisted upon by the Municipality and the fact that the survey will cost in the neighbourhood of $200.00, you are requested to report whether you consider the inconvenience of having the Municipality establish the road through the school property in the position in which it now officially exists is sufficient to justify the amount of expenditure that would be involved if we proceeded with the suggested change.\n\nIt must be realized that if the road is constructed on the old location, the Department will not be put to any expenditure and the total cost will be borne by the Municipality and, as has been suggested, the road would not be in a satisfactory position. In view of this, the Department is inclined to be of the opinion that the Municipality may not be anxious to construct the road as now officially surveyed and it is suggested that if this phase of the matter were presented to the municipal officials, they may see that they are unreasonable in requesting the Department to share part of the cost of the road in a new position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 31st October 1933\n\nMemorandum\n\nSchools Branch,\n\nPlease note hereunder letter written to the Indian Agent regarding the road through the Cowesses residential school property. This I consider should have been written by your Branch on receipt of my memorandum of the 19th ultimo but as I have today received a letter from the Deputy Minister of Highways which was written on the 14th ultimo, I considered a reply should be made to his letter immediately.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6304, file 651-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 108-29 of the 31st ult. and have to advise that I have visited the Principal of the Cowessess School and we then tried to get in touch with the Secretary of the Grayson Municipality #154 and regret to advise that I found that the secretary was very ill and in fact dying and that his chances of recovery were very small indeed.\n\nInasmuch as the Secretary had this whole matter in hand and in the event of his dying the matter would have to be taken up when his successor was appointed, and in the event of his living it would be some little time before he would be able to attend to the matter it will be necessary to let the matter stand as it is for the present and I will take the first opportunity to get the matter attended to and then will advise you again.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

No. 3060-2\n\nThe Indian Agent's report in connection with the survey of road through Sec. 3-19A-5-W.2.W., to which I refer in my letter of the 31st ultimo, has been delayed. The Agent advises the Department that he has not been able to discuss certain matters in connection with this with the Secretary of the Rural Municipality of Grayson, No. 184, as the Secretary is very seriously ill, and that as the Secretary has had the whole matter in hand, there is no officer of the Municipality with whom he can take it up. As soon as conditions permit the Agent to obtain the information he requires from the officers of the Municipality, he will forward the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nH.S.

MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nJ.P.B. Astrander Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter 108-2-9 of the 22nd ult., I have to advise that the Secretary of the Rural Municipality of Grayson #184 writes as follows:\n\nApril 9th, 1934\n\n\"In reply to your letter of recent date I beg to say that the R.M. of Grayson #184 will take care of the roadwork on valley road & the Department will do the surveying and buy the land.\"\n\nSigned A.L. McDonald\nSecy. Treas.\n\nAs mentioned in previous correspondence the road now being used encroaches upon Fr.S# 3-19A-R5 W 2nd. I am unable to state the acreage involved which can only be determined by a survey. It would appear to me that either the Church or School funds should bear the cost of the settlement with the C.F.R. on this encroachment. In view of the fact that much of this land was purchased by the Department from the Church Authorities the matter was left unsettled and the misunderstanding came about in the first instance through the Church Authorities permitting their teams whilst working on the land to destroy the old survey.\n\nSubsequently the road was moved back to its present location adding a narrow strip of land within the school fence and cutting off a like amount from the C.F.R. lands.\n\nI am returning herewith Blue Print which will assist in the explanation of this.\n\nReferring to the 5th paragraph of your letter 108-2-9 of the 31st October last I beg to say that if the Municipality were to establish the road on the original survey it would be a great inconvenience to the school and I do not think that the land under discussion is priced very high by the C.F.R. and I would strongly recommend that some arrangement be made for the purchase of this land if at all possible.\n\nI also understand that if the matter were pressed by the Municipality the Church Authorities could be held accountable for the destruction of the original survey and I think that the matter would be more easily settled if the Church Authorities would pay for the encroachment and the Department would pay for the survey.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.E.S. Gatrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, 30th April 1934\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been ascertained that the road in use through the S.W. Sec.3-19A-5-W.2.M., is slightly to the North East of the actual position of the official surveyed road. The Rural Municipality of Grayson and the Principal of the Couesee Indian Residential School are desirous of having the road established in the position of the one in present use. To effect this it was the intention of the Department to donate the necessary land required in the S.W. Sec.3, which is part of the school property and I should like to be advised of the price per acre which your Company would demand for the land which would be required for the diversion through the S.E. Sec.3.

According to my records the land lying between the road as it is actually located and the original surveyed location, has been used by the school.\n\nIn view of this, I am of the opinion that your Department should purchase this area, in addition to that required by the actual roadway, and I am prepared to sell this land at the price of $100.00, which I think is very reasonable owing to the fact that the Department of Highways pays us $20.00 per acre for all roads and cut-off areas.\n\nWhen survey of the new location has been made, I shall be glad if you will have copy of plan forwarded to me, so that the exact acreage of the land in question can be determined, and arrangements for payment made accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nO.

The area for the new road would require approximately four acres in this quarter section.

It appears to me from the correspondence that it would be a decided disadvantage to the school property to have the road through this property opened in the location of the official surveyed road and that it would be a decided advantage to secure the proposed revision.\n\nI have ascertained that the Department could secure the land which it would be necessary to acquire from the Canadian Pacific Railway for the price of $100.00. The area to be purchased would be approximately 6\u00bd acres, which the Agent values at $10.00 per acre, or a total of $65.00. The C.P.R. might possibly reduce their price to this latter figure. The cost of survey would be $175.00 and I think this Branch could arrange to defray the survey expenses from the present allotment, if your Branch is prepared to complete the purchase of the necessary land from the Canadian Pacific Rwy.\n\nIt should be realized that, if the Municipality insists, the provincial Department of Highways could demand the establishment of the road in the location as at present surveyed.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 25th July 1934\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref.

A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter No.108-2-10 of the 10th ultimo, I beg to advise that the parents of this boy have again been to the office with a view to obtaining his transfer from the Crooked Lake to the Round Lake School. Mrs. McQuaid claims that at the time she took the boy to the Cowessess School she had previously been to the Round Lake School where Mr. Ross had informed her that he had no room. Having neither sufficient food or clothing at home and being under the impression that all Department schools were the same she proceeded to the Cowessess school where the Rev. Principal had the room and took the children in. Since that date the girl then admitted has been discharged owing to physical disabilities, the boy however was taken back to the school and while there was not well when the parents took him away and took him into Dr. Craig's Broadview, where he later developed pneumonia. In view of the parents actions with regard to taking the boy from the school in the first place the Rev. Principal kept the boy at school during the Xmas holidays.\n\nThis of course has again aroused the parents and they feel determined to go everything in having the boy admitted to the Round Lake School, both claiming that they know nothing of the Catholic faith have during their later years always attended the protestant church, both went to the Round Lake School, in fact Mrs. McQuaid was there during the greater part of her life and admitting that she made a mistake in taking the boy to Cowessess school as she did, she feels that cognizance should be given to her wish that she wants the children raised in the Protestant faith as she knows nothing of the Catholic faith. All of the foregoing is concurred in by her husband who was absent at the time the children were taken to Cowessess school and admitted. As it stands at present the parents did not have their boy home at the Xmas holidays and the father states that he was prevented from seeing the boy when\nhe recently visited the school.\n\nIn this connection I might add that I intercepted these people en route to Regina where they had intended taking this matter up through other sources, feeling that their former requests had not been favourably considered.\n\nAm again referring their case for the Department's consideration as they both appear very sincere and determined to have the boy transferred to the Round Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.

I went to his home a few days after to take the children to the school; fifteen miles, bad roads. The children had nothing to wear; so I bought them shoes, overcoats, dresses etc. Last Friday I sent to the Indian Office the forms for admission duly signed by the Doctor, Mr. A. McKenzie, the Indian Agent, wrote me the following letter.\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter with admission forms re the Redwood Twins and have to advise you that I have taken this matter up with Ottawa and they advice that your per capita grant is for 85 pupils and at the last return there were 93 on your roll.\n\nThey state that as your dormitories are full with all they can accommodate allowing sufficient air space for all pupils and inasmuch as these twins are only 5 yrs and 8 months old they will not sanction their admission at present.\"\n\nNow, Sir, if you had taken a look on the roll, you would have notice that there were 6 children discharged and 4 were transferred to other schools during January.\n\nBefore returning the twins to their home, I am waiting an answer from you and I do hope that you will sanction their admission.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.

(RG 10, Volume 6304, file 651-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.,\nApril 14th, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie:\n\nRe: Peter Keawayden or Northwind.\n\nI regret the delay in replying to your letter of March 22nd, re- above named Indian boy. Unfortunately your letter was misplaced.\n\nWhile I have not had an opportunity to examine this boy I beg to submit the following report in case the Department is waiting for this information before deciding whether or not he will be admitted to School.\n\nFrom the information obtained from his files and my recollection of the case both legs are completely paralyzed and one deformed due to ankylosis of the knee. His only method of moving about was to slide along the floor on his buttocks unless carried by someone.\n\nIt is impossible to say that he would be a menace, from a health standpoint to the other pupils until he was examined, but even if his examination revealed no evidence of activity I would not recommend his admission to any School as I consider he would be a great mental menace on account of his physical defects.\n\nWhile I do not consider the following is within the Medical jurisdiction, but as you have asked in your letter for my observations I will attempt to give them. Possibly I have wrong conception of the case, but this boy is fifteen years of age. He cannot ever hope to make any practical use of an education and at the most he has only one year to attend School for by then he will have reached the School age limit. He received some schooling while in the Sanatorium, how much I am not quite certain.\n\nMention was also made in your letter that he has been considerably neglected at home. From what information I have been able to obtain his parents are not old, decrepit or ruined, but enjoy good health and are well able to properly care for their invalid child. Previously to his discharge from the Sanatorium his parents interviewed Inspector W. Murison and wished their child home.\nThe Department released them of the worry of caring for the child as well as trying to restore him to health for almost six years at a cost of about $2000.00. Unfortunately the results obtained were not those anticipated.\n\nIf the parents are neglecting their duty I have not a doubt that the Department would back you up whole-heartedly in any proper action you may take to remedy this serious condition.\n\nI will be pleased to examine Peter any time arrangements can be made to have him brought to Fort Qu'Appelle. As it is now going on four years since his discharge I think he should be examined as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.B. Sines, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nMr. E. A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent,\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroedview, Sask.\n\nABS:EL\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.,\nMarch 22nd, 1937.\n\nDr. A.B. Simes,\nFort Qu'Appelle.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nRe: Peter Keewayden or Northwind\n\nYou will remember the above named lad was in\nthe File Hills Hospital for several years.\n\nSince he came back he has been considerably\nneglected at home and the Rev. Father of the Cowessess\nSchool figured that they would look after him at their school\nwhich would be much better for him than at home.\n\nHe appears to be mentally O.K. but physically\npoor.\n\nAn application for his admission has been submitted\nto Ottawa but before accepting the same they state as follows:\n\"The Department considers that this boy should be examined by\nDr. Simes who should report regarding his present condition\nof health and also state whether he would recommend that the\nboy be admitted to a residential school. Would he be a menace\nto the health of the other pupils of the school.\"\n\nYou know the history of the case well and it is not\nvery convenient to get him over to you for an exam at this time\nof the year and I was wondering whether you would be able to\ngive a report that would satisfy Ottawa on the matter.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your observations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.,\nApril 14th, 1937.\n\nDear Doctor Robertson:\n\nRe: Peter Keeneyden or Northwind\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Mr. R.A. W.R. McKenzie re a medical certificate to permit the above named boy to be admitted to Cowessess Indian Residential School also a copy of my reply for your information.\n\nThis boy was admitted to the Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium at four years of age with extensive tuberculosis of the lungs spine and right knee on March 2nd, 1937. He remained there until October 1st, 1937 when he was transferred to File Hills Colony Hospital. On December 15th of the same year he was sent home from File Hills.\n\nFor some time previous to his discharge from the Sanatorium the disease was arrested and all the sinuses healed. On account of the extensive involvement of the spine with the healing of the lesion paralysis of both legs resulted. His condition was further aggravated by an ankylosis of the right knee in an unsatisfactory position. It was realized for some time previous to his discharge that he could not be benefited by further hospitalization. His recuperation was not forthcoming and whether he could not after his at home. After making an inquiry I found there was absolutely no reason why his parents could not give him the necessary attention, as really the only important item was keeping him clean.\n\nI judge from Mr. McKenzie's letter that the main reason for his admission to the school is neglect on his parents part in looking after him properly. I can hardly think that he hopes to render him self-supporting by providing him with an education. On the other hand I do not think that it is the policy of the educational officials of the Department to authorize school grants for such cases as his.\n\nWith a full time nurse, farm instructor an Indian Agent who no doubt visits the house frequently there should be no reason for this child not receiving the small amount of care he requires.\n\nIf it is found that the parents are neglecting him and after being properly warned would not the Department expect the Indian Agent to take steps to see that they received the proper punishment for such an offense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.B. Smith, M.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nDr. T. Robertson,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nRe: Application to have Peter Keewayden or Northwind admitted to Cowessess School.\n\nI am in receipt of the enclosed correspondence on the above subject, which I also discussed with Doctor Simes on Sunday last.\n\nWe both feel that this boy should not be admitted to school. He cannot be made self-supporting by any education he will receive there.\n\nIt appears to us that the Department is being asked to assume this expense, not for the benefit of the boy but rather to relieve his parents, who are well able to look after him, or his care and incidentally our officials of the necessity of seeing that he is properly cared for.\n\nI would therefore recommend that this application be not granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

McKenzie,\nAgent, Crooked Lake I.R.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter deals with a charge made to you by certain Indians of the Crooked Lake I.R. that the children of the Cowessess School were infected with vermin.\n\nThis charge has been made by disaffected Indians on several occasions in the past and it should be hardly necessary to say that the present complaint is utterly unfounded and maliciously false.\n\nI spent a whole day (Sept. 10th) at the school. On this occasion I examined every child in the school for Trachoma and thus had ample opportunity to observe the truth or falsity of this serious accusation.\n\nMany of the children on their return to school on Sept. 1st after the holidays were badly infested, some worse than others.\n\nNo pains were spared to clean them up. The boys' heads were closely clipped and the girls were given special treatment. This has always been the policy of the school, and when the cleaning and disinfection has been completed, the greatest vigilance is exercised to see that the pupils remain clean.\n\nThe dormitories are spotless and each child has his own bed. The food is plain & good. No child in this school has ever suffered from undernourishment.\n\nTo say that such a charge as this is amazing, is expressing the case lightly. It reflects on the management of the school and also on its medical supervision. Besides it is most discouraging to those who have the welfare of the school and the Indians at heart.\n\nI append a list of those children who came back to school Sept. 1st infected with vermin. They were given prompt and energetic treatment.\n\nI would suggest that if ever again such a charge is laid against the school that the complainant be given every opportunity to justify his charges, and if they are proven untrue and false that some steps be taken to see that those responsible for the accusation be made to retract and offer suitable apology.\n\n\"George H. Craig M.D.\"\nM.O. for the School.\nD. A. MACKENZIE LL.B.\nBARRISTER, SOLICITOR\nNOTARY PUBLIC\n\nESTERHAZY, SASKATCHEWAN\nCANADA\nSeptember 16th, 1937.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Crooked Lake Indian Reserve (Sask.)\n\nReverend Father Chatelain O.M.I., principal of the Indian Residential School at Marieville has been in to see me regarding some matters that have arisen at the school.\n\nIt appears that in the past it has been the custom to grant the children a holiday at Christmas time. Recently, Fr. Chatelain received a circular letter from your Department announcing that there would be no Christmas holiday hereafter and that the summer holiday would be extended. Although Fr. Chatelain caused this information to be made known to the parents of the children a number of them nevertheless sent their children back at the time that the fall term heretofore opened. He was obliged to send them home and some of the disaffected parents started a rumour about that the circular letter from your Department was not genuine. Then when school opened they made a complaint\u2014to the Indian agent, I believe, that the school was infested with vermin and that the food was not good. As a result, I understand that the Indian Agent had the Medical Officer, Dr. Craig of Broadview make an investigation\u2014at least, if that is not so, Dr. Craig after making an investigation delivered a report to the Agent. I am enclosing a copy of this report from which you will note that the charges were entirely unfounded, and were obviously propounded through dissatisfaction because of your Department's decision in regard to changing the school holiday.\n\nFr. Chatelain fears that unless the Department takes a firm stand in the matter that there is going to be more trouble when December comes as the parents will be wanting to take out the children. It would appear that, in order to avoid such a situation arising, you ought now to give very definite instructions to your agent to take adequate steps in the matter. I would be obliged, therefore, if you would, at once, write Fr. Chatelain assuring him that this will be done, and at the same time send me a copy of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6304, file 651-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Holy,\n\nI thought you would like to answer this letter attached in reference to file in which circular letter re holidays was written.\n\nPP\nOttawa, September 29, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment a letter addressed to the Deputy Minister of the Department by D. A. MacKenzie, Esq., LL.B., Estevan, Sask., in which Mr. MacKenzie refers to certain problems that you discussed with him, in respect to the administration of the Cowessess Residential School.\n\nYou are probably aware that the summer holiday period at Indian residential schools throughout the Dominion was extended, in response to a number of requests that had reached the Department from the church authorities. The representatives of the churches assured us that, in their judgment, it would be easier and less expensive to have the pupils returned to school if the holiday period was extended and brought into conformity with the holiday period at Indian day schools and also at provincial public schools. There are a number of objections to the holiday period at Christmas. The Department has always hesitated to expose the pupils in attendance at residential schools to the epidemics that are usually prevalent at that season of the year. In addition to this, the expense involved in having pupils return home at Christmas is almost prohibitive, and a great many Principals have experienced the utmost difficulty in securing their return to school when the holiday period had expired. It was the hope of the departmental officials that the new regulations, requested and approved by the church authorities, would prove satisfactory to all concerned. I am very sorry indeed to learn that a certain amount of dissatisfaction exists at your school.\n\nI am today communicating with the Indian Agent\n\nRev. P. Chatelain, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCowessess Indian Residential School,\nMarieval, via Grayson, Sask.\nand asking him to cooperate with you in the solution of the problem insofar as it is humanly possible to solve it. If there is anything, other than this, that the Department can do to help you, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with us again.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Deputy Minister from Mr. D. A. MacKenzie, LL.B., Esterhazy, Sask. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. I am also enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter written today to the Principal of the Cowessess Residential School.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the Department is anxious that you should do everything within your power to cooperate with the Principal of the School in any attempts he may make to satisfy the Indian parents and pupils with respect to the holiday period for which provision is made in the new regulations. The thought has occurred to me that, if a meeting of the Indian parents could be held and the new regulations fully explained to them, this action in itself might go a long way to satisfy them. You may be interested to learn that this is the only letter received by the Department, suggesting that any dissatisfaction exists with respect to the new regulations at Indian residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nYe Francis Lerat #139 Cowessess I.R.School\n\nThe above named pupil has caused considerable trouble amongst the other pupils and the Revd. Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"I hereby make application for the discharge of Francis Lerat aged 15 on 8-12-36. He is a bad boy, disobedient and is not fit to mingle any more with the other boys of the school for he incites them to do wrong.\n\nIn view of this fact I recommend that he be sent to a reformatory for an indefinite period.\"\n\nThis lad has incited the other pupils especially the younger ones to grumble about the food un-necessarily, cause general trouble, and has instigated recently five pupils to run away from the school which in this kind of weather is likely to have very unfortunate results similar to the case when a boy was frozen to death running away from Round Lake School some years ago.\n\nHe seems unmanageable and especially in view of the fact that his mother and father are dead and his oldest brother George about 22 years old is trying to maintain the household and young children left by his parents and to ensure them a fair living have had to issue rations for the family from the Agency it does not seem right that his brother should be forced to keep him when they themselves need what food supplies they have without encouraging another boy to get him through misbehaviour.\n\nI feel that the Revd. Principal's suggestion as regards sending the boy to a reformatory for a while a good one as no doubt otherwise he will continue his lack of discipline and control at home and will spoil the chance of his ever making a man out of himself. Possibly the reformatory discipline will fill in just what is needed and would be well worth the trial if only for a year. This establishes a precedent that if all a lad has to do to get expelled from school is to become a general nuisance which would set a bad example for any other pupils.\n\nI would be glad to have the Department's instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBen.

Please let me know if either the Principal or yourself are aware of any such institution in the Province of Saskatchewan in which the boy could be placed. If so, you should ascertain what it would cost for his maintenance and also what steps should be taken to have him placed in the institution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReference your letter 108-2-10 of the 26th instant concerning Francis Lerat I have been talking over the situation with his uncle as he has no parents and this uncle thinks if he was given a chance at the Muscowequan I.R. School he would do much better.\n\nI have therefore written to the Revd. Principal asking him if he could take him in and if he replies in the affirmative I will write requesting his transfer.\n\nI do not think there is a reformatory school in this Province and probably this action will solve the difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nBen.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. V. de Varennes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCowessess Indian Residential School,\nMarieval,\nvia Grayson, Sask.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMarieval, Sask.\nMarch 1 1940\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nMines & Resources Dept\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am thankful to you for your information and I must confess that I have not seen the Indian Act Section 10 (1) regarding the discharge of such children 16 years of age.\n\nIn consequence, I beg the favour of discharging the said children Henriette Lavalle who already left the school last month, and Eveline Delorme who may get married after Easter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. V. de Varennes\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nMarch 5, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 1st instant the discharge of the following pupils from the Cowessess Indian Residential School is approved:\n\nHenriette Lavalle\nEveline Delorme\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA.

The immediate cause of death was\nBasal meningitis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was Influenza.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nThis pupil was ill less than forty-eight hours.

I regret to say that the very best that we can do at the present is to endeavour to begin in a small way the establishment of a Boarding School at that point, which could in time be increased. Even this I am not yet quite sure whether we shall be able to accomplish or not, on account of the very large expenditure that we are obliged to make at other points where there are more children and greater demands for educational facilities. However, I shall be glad to do all I can in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert.\nOttawa, 31st March, 1892.\n\nDear Mr. Dewdney,\n\nI enclose you a letter herewith which I have received from Bishop Pascal in reference to the establishment of an Industrial School for the Saskatchewan district at Duck Lake.

I return His Lordship's letter herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. H. Macdowall, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSavine-Albert 1er octobre 1892\n\n\u00c0 l'Hon. J.

C'est un premier pas; mais que peut-on faire sur une somme si petite!\n\nDonne depuis deux ans l'h\u00e9ritier de cette partie du Dioc\u00e8se de St-Albert que nous appelons Vicariat de la Saskatchewan, je me vois charg\u00e9 d'un nombre croissant qui augmente par le jour par l'immigration: ajoutant, je ne dois pas perdre de vue la civilisation de ces nombreux sauvages qui nous entourent et qui par leur vie primitive, leurs mille superstitions, font le d\u00e9sordre du pays et le scandale de l'Europe. Un grand nombre sont encore infid\u00e8les. Les beaux r\u00e9sultats obtenus dans le Manitoba, l'Ontario, l'Alberta, je les d\u00e9crirais aussi pour la Saskatchewan. Ces distances trop grandes ne nous permettent pas de faire participer les enfants de nos sauvages au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des \u00e9coles catholiques de qui appelle ou de High River. Il y a bien sans doute de petits \u00e9coles dans chaque r\u00e9serve, mais l'exp\u00e9rience apprend de plus en plus que le moyen est bien insuffisant pour civiliser l'indien. Quelques heures d'\u00e9cole ne transforment pas l'indien qui a tous les jours sous le yeux la vie et les exemples de ses vieux parents. Il faut lui donner des id\u00e9es de religion pour les filles, de ma\u00eetres d\u00e9vou\u00e9s pour les gar\u00e7ons, pour inoculer dans l'esprit et dans le c\u0153ur du sauvage les principes et la pratique du bien, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l'industrie.\n\nEn r\u00e9clamant pour mon Vicariat une \u00e9cole industrielle, je pr\u00e9vois les nombreuses difficult\u00e9s, les grands sacrifices et les d\u00e9boires qui m'attendent; mais je ne peux avoir d'autre ambition que de voir dispara\u00eetre totalement pour le boucher de ceux que j'appelle mes enfants et pour la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 de ma patrie d'adoption.\nLe grand cr\u00e9dit dont nous jouissons,\nHon.

La somme de $2000 allou\u00e9e dans le dernier suppl\u00e9ment ne me permet pas sans doute de commencer une construction de ce genre avec les d\u00e9pendances n\u00e9cessaires, pour quelque modeste qu'elle soit \u00e0 son d\u00e9but. Aussi, j'ose esp\u00e9rer que votre d\u00e9partement ira plus loin. Il me faudrait au moins $7000 pour b\u00e2tir ; $2000 pour am\u00e9nagement et fournitures ; $1000 pour l'entretien des enfants la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e. Avec la somme ci-dessus, je pourrai faire construire une maison de 40x30 ft et une cuisine attenante dont je vous enverrai le plan plus tard.\n\nJ'ai fait visiter et pris des informations sur les 16 acres de terrain que votre Honneur a fait r\u00e9server \u00e0 Duck Lake. Laissez-moi vous dire, Hon. Monsieur, que ce terrain est loin de me satisfaire. Il n'y a ni bois, ni fonte, ni eau en \u00e9t\u00e9, et les buttes de sable y sont nombreuses. En outre il est \u00e0 deux milles environ de la Station Hobart.\n\n\u00c0 la vue de ces grands inconv\u00e9nients, voici apr\u00e8s beaucoup de recherches ce que je veux vous soumettre.\nTrouveriez-vous des inconv\u00e9nients \u00e0 me laisser \u00e9tablir au nord de la branche nord de la Saskatchewan \u00e0 7 milles de Prince Albert pr\u00e8s du pont qui traverse la Riv. Coquille (Shell River)? Un grand chemin y conduit. Outre le bois, le four, la bonne eau, le poisson qui y abonde, je trouve un terrain l\u00e9ger mais assez bon.\n\nLa dans un pays isol\u00e9, entour\u00e9 de bois et de marais, je vous demanderai une demi-section ou 320 acres; une partie des sections 32-33 Tp 49 - 26 et une partie des sec 1 4-5 Tp 50 dans le m\u00eame rang, \u00e0 l'ouest du 2e m\u00e9ridien.\n\nOutre ces avantages immenses, celui de me trouver au centre des r\u00e9serves n'est pas \u00e0 d\u00e9daigner.

Je peux vous assurer Hon. Monsieur; que l'objection n'en est pas une bien difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre. Ces messieurs n'ont qu'\u00e0 s'occuper de leurs sujets et nous des n\u00f4tres seulement. Nos \u00e9glises sont voisines \u00e0 Prince Albert et nous vivons en parfaite harmonie.

J'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre\n\nHon. E. Dewdney\nS.G. du Dept. Indien\nOttawa\nHonorable Sir,\n\nPermit me to offer you my thanks for having taken into consideration the request I made relative to the Industrial or Boarding School for Catholic Indians in the Saskatchewan Vicariate.\n\nThe sum of $2,000 allotted in the estimates without doubt does not permit me even to commence a construction of this kind with the necessary outbuildings, however small they may be in the beginning. Therefore I trust that your Department will do more. I should require at least $7,000 to build; $2,000 for furnishing and $1,000 for the support of the children for the first year. With the above sum I could construct a house 40 x 30 feet with a kitchen adjoining which I would send you a plan later on.\n\nI have obtained information concerning the 160 acres of land that your Honor has reserved at Duck Lake and have had it visited. Allow me to inform you, Honorable Sir, that the land is far from satisfying me. There is neither wood, hay, nor water in summer; sand hills are numerous; besides it is situated about two miles from the Hobart Station. Seeing these great inconveniences and having well weighed the matter I wish to submit to your Honor the following points:\n\nWould you find it inconvenient to allow me to establish this school on the North side of the North Saskatchewan seven miles from...\nPrince Albert near the bridge that crosses Shell River? A high road leads to this spot. Besides wood, hay and good water, fish abound there. I find the soil light but good enough. There is an isolated locality surrounded with woods and forests. I would ask if you a half section or 320 acres; a part of Secs. 32-33, T.p. 49-26 and a part of Sec. 425 T.p. 80 in the same line to the west of the 2nd Meridian.\n\nBesides these immediate advantages that of finding myself in the centre of reserves is not to be set aside. There are six reserves on the Agency of Battleford and seven in that of Carlton while in that of Duck Lake I see but two.\n\nYour Honor will perhaps object that I should be too near the Anglican Church School at Emmanuel College. I can assure you, Honorable Sir, that this need not be any objection. These gentlemen have to occupy themselves only with their own flock and we with our old churches are near at Prince Albert and we live in perfect harmony. Our united efforts will not be too great to draw from barbarism and infidelity all the savages that surround us and to aid the government efficaciously in the noble work of civilizing the Indians.\n\nI venture to hope in your goodness that my request may be taken into consideration and that I shall soon see my hopes realized.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, in reference to the Industrial or Boarding School for Catholic Indians in the Saskatchewan Vicariate, and stating that the amount voted in the Estimates was very inadequate to meet the expense of constructing such a building; also representing that the 160 acres of land reserved at Duck Lake was not very satisfactory.\n\nAs to the smallness of the grant made in aid of the building, I can assure you I would have been glad had it been possible for the Government to have made a more liberal grant, but so many were the demands of a similar nature made upon it from other quarters that it was a very difficult matter to obtain the amounts desired.\n\nHowever, I shall take care to note your Lordship's representations, and see what can be done in the direction of meeting your wishes when next year's Estimates come up for consideration.\n\nI shall also endeavour to see whether some exchange of land can be arranged, and a reserve made which will be\n\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\n\nPrince Albert.\nbe more desirable than the one selected. I am now in communication with Commissioner Reed on the subject, and will see that you are advised promptly as soon as I am in a position to do so. I shall also see that the site proposed by your Lordship is fully enquired into.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSd. E. Dewdney.\nDear Mr. Vankoughnet,\n\nI received a semi-official communication from the late Supt. General, dated 3rd October, enclosing copy of letter dated 1st of same month, addressed to him by the Bishop of Saskatchewan (R.C.), relative to an Industrial or Boarding School proposed to be established in his diocese, also a copy of Mr. Dewdney's reply.\n\nIn connection with the latter I was asked to report regarding the Bishop's proposal to change the contemplated site in the vicinity of Duck Lake, to one on the North side of the North branch of the Saskatchewan, some seven miles from Prince Albert.\n\nSince\n\nL. Vankoughnet, Esq.,\nDeputy of\nSupt. Genl. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSince then I have received direct from His Lordship a copy of the letter sent to Mr. Dewdney, under cover of another in which he urges upon me the necessity of a regular Industrial Institution.\n\nI regret that I cannot see my way clear to concur in His Lordship's view as to the desirability of the site proposed by him, which would place the Institution in immediate communication with several Protestant Reserves.\n\nTo prevent encroachment by Churches upon each other's Indian Missions may be beyond our power but over the establishment of Schools at a distance from Reserves control can be exercised, and I am very much averse to anything likely to lead to dispute between various Denominations.\n\nActuated by the same views I induced in days gone by, the representatives of the Episcopalian Church to relinquish their strong desire to establish an Industrial School at Duck Lake, and more recently saved for a time at least, the Roman Catholic Mission at Alexander's Reserve, from encroachment at the hands of the Methodists who had determined to open a Boarding School there.\n\nIt\nIt has been suggested to me that an arrangement or understanding might be arrived at between the Churches concerned, which would remove the objection which I have just stated as in my opinion existing, to the site proposed by His Lordship, and if I can carry out my intention to visit the District before long and it can then be clearly shown to me that an arrangement can be made to provide a satisfactory safeguard against the disputes and trouble the danger of which I anticipate, I may then view the matter differently.\n\nSince however, the question of cost (whatever may be decided about the site) will apparently have to be considered before the completion of the Department's \"Estimates\". I think it will be well in the meantime to explain my views relative to the class of School to be granted.\n\nI am not aware that it was ever contemplated to allow anything more to His Lordship than a Boarding School at Duck Lake.\n\nThe wisdom of increasing the number of Industrial Schools already, or about to be established, seems open to question especially in view of the amount which the expenses\nexpenses of education now aggregate. The wiser policy seems certainly to be in the direction if necessary, of enlarging already existing Institutions, rather than in that of increasing their number.\n\nBut even if it were deemed advisable to establish another Roman Catholic Industrial School, experience has shown that the location should be in the vicinity of some centre of civilization more extended than Duck Lake is likely to be for long enough to come if at all, to say nothing about the locality spoken of on the North side of the North Saskatchewan.\n\nI may state that this matter was discussed upon the occasion of the Minister's recent visit, and he appears to concur in the views herein expressed.\n\nI will be glad to learn the result when a conclusion shall have been arrived at in the matter, as I will then be better able to frame a reply to the Bishop's letter to myself, and the class of School would have a hearing upon the choice of a site.\n\nAny provision for this School will have to be made in\nin a Supplementary Estimate as it has not been considered in those forwarded to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHayter Reed\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa 16 Dec. 1892\n\nWith reference to the letter of the 5th instant, addressed by the undersigned, having further reference to a proposed instruction Boarding School to be established within the diocese of the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. Vital, the original site for which was intended to be at Rock Lake, the undersigned begs to report that the following would appear to be the history of this matter:\n\nTo the Hon. T. Mayne Daly\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOn the 5th September 1870\nthe late Superintendent General\nwrote to Bishop Macdonald,\nof Edmonton, and, among\nother things, stated that he\nproposed recommending the\nestablishment of an Industr\nal School in his diocese,\nand that from his\nown personal knowledge\nof the Country he wanted\nto select the Saint mentioned\nby the Bishop in a com\nmunication received from\nhim, namely, Duck Lake,\nas being a central and con\nvenient locality for the\nsite, especially as the rail\nway had recently been\nconstructed to that point.\n\nOn the 21st December 1871\nthe Vicar Apostolic of Sas\nkatchewan wrote to Mr. Dewdney\nurging the expediency of estab\nlishing a Roman Catholic\nIndustrial Institution, etc.\nview of the number of Catholics on the different Reserves on the north side of the Saskatchewan and at Duck Lake in the Carlton district.\n\nThe Vicar Apostolic stated that it was his conviction that if such a school were established there would be from 60 to 100 pupils attending thereto.\n\nHe then referred to Mr. Dewdney's previous letter to Bishop Martin, above mentioned, and quoted the abstract therein which suggested Duck Lake as a central point, and the Vicar Apostolic stated that he agreed with Mr. Dewdney as to the site for the Institution.\n\nOn the 18th January 1892 the then Superintendent-General replied to the Vicar Apostolic's letter.\nreminding him of the large sums of money that had already been expended by the Government in the education of Indians both in Manitoba and the North West Territories, and stating that, until the institutions were filled and urgent demand for more accommodation made, the necessity for additional school-buildings was not apparent; but, however, in view of the correspondence had by him with Bishop Pandosy on the subject, to bring the matter before his colleagues, and, if the revenue would permit it, to endeavor to get their support to the scheme of establishing an institution at Duck Lake; that, if an Industrial School could not be established, at\nthat he might be able to establish a Boarding School at that Point which in time could be developed into an Industrial School. Mr. Dewdney stated that he would communicate with the Indian Commissioner at Regina with regard to an available site for the Institution, which he thought should embrace at least 300 acres of land, should the Government decide to carry an industrial part with them.\n\nAn even later Mr. Dewdney addressed a communication to the Indian Commissioner at Regina, reminding him of the promise made to Chief Grandin in September 1890, above referred to, and asked him to ascertain whether a half-section of land was available at or near Duck Lake.\nHe also enclosed copy of the letter written by him to the Vicar Apostolic for the Saskatchewan, above referred to, and stated that in case the government decided to convert the Boarding School into an Industrial School, it wanted the letter to secure the land then.\n\nOn the 19th ultimo a copy of the letter addressed by the then Superintendent General to the Vicar Apostolic of the Saskatchewan was enclosed in a letter to the Rev. Father Sandraine, of Edmonton.\n\nOn the 22nd February 1892 Mr. Commissioner Rock replied to the Superintendent General's letter, in which he stated that the Agent informed him that it would be difficult to find a half-section at\nDuck Lake containing fresh water and wood; that the first, however, mentioned several sections to which were available and had some wood and they on them, and stated their water came easily by not by sinking a well.\n\nHe recommended the purchase of half-section 16 in Township 44, 2 West at the 3rd R. T., about a mile from Duck Lake P.O., which contained a good deal of clay and wood and part of a nice lake with plenty good water. The land in question, the first thought came he obtained shortly.\n\nOn the \u2014 March last a letter was received without date, from the Vicar Apostolic, acknowledging the letter addressed to him by\nthe Superintendent General,\nand representing that\nwhat was wanted was\na regular Industrial\nSchool of the same\nstanding as those at\nSt. Boniface and St. John\nRiver, and that a Boarding\nSchool would not ac-\ncomplish the purpose of the\nCatholic Church, nor\nmeet the present want.\nThe Vicar Apostolic also\nstated that he was\nwriting to the Rev. Father\nPudde, who would\ncommunicate with the\nDepartment on the sub-\nject.\n\nOn the 5th March the\nSuperintendent General\nreplied to the above\nletter replying that\nnothing could be done\nat present than to en-\ndeavor to help in a\nsmall way the estab-\nlishment of a Boarding\nSchool at Duck Lake,\nwhich could in time be\nincreased. The Superintendent General expressed a doubt whether, on account of the very large expenditure that had to be made at other points where there are more children and greater demands for educational facilities, he could be able to accomplish even the establishment of a Boarding School at Rock Lake; but he promised to do all he could in the matter.\n\nOn the 8th March a letter was received from Mr. Macdonald to Mr. F. containing a letter from the Vicar Apostolic on the subject, and asking what reply he should send to His Lordship. Mr. Macdonald was informed by letter at the 2nd April that the Superintendent General had already promised to do what he could in\nthe way of obtaining a grant for the establishment,\nat least, of a Boarding School at that point.\nIn the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament\nfor 1892-93 an item\nof $1,300.00, towards\nthe establishment of a\nBoarding School at\nDuck Lake, was in-\nserted. This was how-\never, struck out by the\nTreasury Board; and\nthat, consequently, settled\nthe question for this\nyear, at least, of the\nestablishment of a\nBoarding School at the\nabove point.\n\nIn view of this fact\nthe Departmental Council\ndecided that the question\nof purchasing the land\nand quarter of the Section\nrecommended by the In-\ndian Agent at Duck\nLake should be the\npresent business in\norderance; but the Departmental\nof the latter in order to assist to withhold the adjoining quarter-section question from disposal; and on the 5th of July last this Department was informed that the Agent had been so instructed; and we reply to a letter from the Department of the Interior of the 1st day August, in which it was stated that he was requested, unless they heard to the contrary within a few days, to open the above Section to homestead entry, that Department was requested to cause the same to be deferred until the Indian Commissioner had been heard from.\n\nOn the 15th August the Assistant Indian Commissioner replied to a letter inquiring him of the proceedings.\nof the Department of the Inter-\nior to reply to above\nmatter. Return to Home-\nstead entry, and that the\nSuperintendent General\nhad decided not to pur-\nchase the North-east\nquarter of said Section\nas a site for the Pro-\nposed Industrial School,\nthat notwithstanding\nstill seem advisable to\nreserve the North-east\nquarter of said Section, as\nSurveyor Ponton had re-\nported it to be the best\navailable, and that it was\nnot impossible to find\na suitable location. The\nDepartment of the Interior\nwas, therefore, requested to\nstill reserve the North-east\nquarter of the Section in\nquestion, and on the 31st\nAugust a reply was re-\nceived that their Great\nat Prince Albert had\nbeen instructed to con-\ntinue the reserve of that\nquarter-section.\nOn the 1st of October last a further letter was received from the Reverend Apostolic of the Paskechewan District, stating that the sum placed in the Estimates for the \"Industrially Training School\" above referred to as being altogether inadequate either for the construction of the building or for the maintenance of the pupils therein, and stating that $500 of at least $2000 is required for building purposes, $2000 for furnishing, and $1000 for the maintenance of the children for the first year; and expressing the opinion that with the above sum ($2000) a house to hold 30 beds with a kitchen adjoining, of which a plan would be sent later, might be constructed. The Reverend Apostle also protested against the proposed...\nsite for the school as being altogether unsuitable, there being neither wood, hay, nor water on it, and numerous sand hills therein, besides being situated two miles distant from the railway station.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Maclean then submits, that the consideration of the Department in general, a proposition that the school be established on the north side of the North Portage River, seven miles from Prince Albert, near the bridge that crosses the Shell River. He states in support of his proposition that a highway leads to the section, and that there is wood, hay and good water therein, and that fish abound in the river. The said, though hard, may settle.\n\nMr. Maclean also asks for a half section of land in the locality, to be used in connection with\nthe Institution of Education among the other advantages quoted by him, that of the Institution of certain things in the centre of Reserve, there being six Reserves in the Colony at Battleford, and another in that of Carlton, while in that of Duck Lake there are but two.\n\nWith regard to the objection that cannot be made to the Institution being too close proximity to Emmanuel College, the Baptist Church Institute, the First Reformed Church, the Gentleman states that there need not be any such objection, as the Churches of both denominations were near one another at Prince Albert, and they had lived in perfect harmony, and that by combining their efforts they could assist the Government efficiently in the noble work of civilization.\nthe Indians.\n\nOn the 5th November last the Superintendent General replied to the Vice-Lieutenant's letter, stating that he \"cannot have been glad if had it been possible for the Government to have made a more liberal grant\" (the fact may be stated here that no grant whatever was made, as above shown; it was thrown out by the Treasury Board and never submitted to the Senate) but so many were the demands of a similar nature from other quarters it was very difficult to obtain the amounts desired.\n\nMr. Dewdney then promised to see what could be done in the direction of meeting His Lordship's wishes taken next year. Estimates came up for consideration; and with report to the site for the Institution Mr. Dewdney\nTranmitted to see whether some change of land could be obtained, and a report made which would be more desirable than the one selected. He also stated that he was in communication with Commissioner Peel, and he would see that his authority was allowed promptly so soon as he was in a position to inform him of the result. Mr. Secretary likewise stated in his letter that he would see that the site proposed by the Sioux Apaches was fully acquired into.\n\nThis brought the matter to a conclusion up to the date of the receipt, on the 12th instant, of the semi-official letter from Mr. Commissioner Peel, first referred to in this memorandum.\n\nMr. Peel, it will be observed, refers to a semi-official communication.\nof the 8th October addressed to him by the late Bishop Macdonald, in which a copy of the letter of the 1st of that month, received from the Vicar Apostolic, was enclosed; also a copy of his reply to that letter.\n\nIt will be observed, in referring to the latter letter, that he complies with the request that he should report upon the Vicar Apostolic's proposition to change the site of one of the North side at the North branch of the Saskatchewan, seven miles from Prince Albert. He expresses his dissent from the Vicar Apostolic's view, as to the site proposed by him to be used for the Institution, and would place the same in immediate communication with several Protestant missions, and it was\nundesirable to have at such a locality, as it would likely lead to disputes between the two denominations. Mr. Reed states instances in which, by his intervention, representations of Protestant Churches were prevented from establishing institutions at points which would bring them into collision with the Roman Catholic Church. He, however, says that a protestant has been made to him that the matter will be arranged by the churches between themselves, and that the objection to the proximity of the institution, above referred to, to the Reserve of Protestant Indians might thus be obviated; that an his appearance of visit to the district, which he says will be before long, it can be clearly shown that such an arrangement...\ncan be made to vary their views in another direction.\n\nMr. Peel then spoke his views relative to the idea of school to be created. In these views, Mr. Peel concurs. He says that it is questionable whether the number of Lutheran schools already or about to be established should be increased; and that it would be a more prudent policy, and certainly in the interests of economy, to enlarge, if necessary, the existing institutions and to fill them. Mr. Peel does not approve of Rock Lake as a site for a Roman Catholic Lutheran school where it decided to establish another of these institutions, as that region, he considers, is not sufficiently near a centre of civilization to justify the Government in establishing an institution there, and the same remarks apply.\nto the cate suspected by the\nVicar Apostolic on the north\nside of the North Saskatchewan.\n\nHowever, the suspicion of\nthe Indian Commissioner\nas to the insufficiency of\nestablishing another Institute\nof Instruction may present\nthemselves to one mind\nas being applicable in\nprinciple to the case, namely,\nthe establishment of an\nInstitution in the Roman\nCatholic Diocese of the\nSaskatchewan, the lack\nchanced may be that sort\nof that the Roman Catholic\ninfluences have been let\nto hope that at least a\nBoarding School would\nbe established.\n\nShould the Superintendent\nGeneral now decide\nthat a Boarding or\nInstructional School shall be\nestablished in the Diocese\nof the North Saskatchewan,\nit will be necessary to\nan amount\nestimated for the current\nyear for building, and\nan amount in the sup-\nplementary Estimates for\n1893-94 for the main-\ntenance of the Institution.\nIt will be noted\nfrom the estimate given\nabove of the Vicar\nApostolic's Letter to Mr.\nNewbery at October 1st\nthat the Right Rev. Vicar-\nApostolic takes exception to\nthe smallness of the\namount proposed to be\nprinted\u2014which he sup-\nposed was \u00a3200 0s\u2014but\nwhich was in reality\nonly \u00a3150 0s\u2014and insists\nupon \u00a3500 0s for\nbuilding, \u00a3200 0s for fur-\nnishing, and \u00a3100 0s for\nthe support of the Chil-\ndren for the first year.\nThe undersigned con-\nsiders that, if the Insti-\ntution is to take the form\nof a Boarding School,\n\u00a3200 0s ought to be ample\nfor the construction of\nthe same; and, say, $1500.00\nfor the maintenance and\ntuition of the children\nfor the first year; and\na similar amount for\nfurnishing the Institution,\nsay $4000.00 &c. &c.\n\nR. Van Horne\nDeputy Sup't General\nIndian Affairs\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th ultimo, respecting the proposal to establish a Roman Catholic Institution, of either the Industrial or Boarding School type, within the Diocese of the Bishop of Saskatchewan and in the eastern part of the said Diocese, I beg to inform you that, having submitted all the facts to the Superintendent General, with respect to this question, he has decided that the Roman Catholic authorities have been given sufficient reason to expect that at least a Boarding School would be established somewhere in that locality; and he has directed that the amount be included in the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament at its next Session, to cover the cost of erecting a building for a Boarding School, for which he considers $2000.00 to be ample; also, for the maintenance and tuition of the children for the first year. The total amount, therefore, to be included in the item for the above Institution would be $4000.00.\n\nI have now, with reference to the site whereon the building is to be erected, to request\nthat you will communicate with the Church authorities and report to the Department where it will be best to erect the same.\n\nIt is noticed that you state in your letter that you propose visiting the Saskatchewan at an early date, when you will perhaps be able to report whether an arrangement could be made to provide a satisfactory safeguard against the disputes and trouble which would arise were this Institution to be placed in proximity to Reserves principally occupied by Indians belonging to Protestant denominations.\n\nYr. Obt. Svt.\nMy Dear Lord Bishop,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, stating that you were given to understand that the Roman Catholic Church has received the promise of an Industrial School to be erected at Duck Lake, and pointing out that among the few Indians on the Reserve likely to be most affected by such a school only a dozen or so are Roman Catholic, and recommending that if a school be erected it be undenominational, and controlled by the Department.\n\nIn reply I may inform Your Lordship that some two or three years ago the Roman Catholics were promised a school at Duck Lake, or in that vicinity. From what I can gather it was considered that in view of the large Industrial School established at Battleford, which has been drawing pupils from the Reserves within the Carlton Agency and the Reserves East of Prince Albert, and the aid which the Government was extending to Emmanuel College, the Protestant Indian children within these districts were not suffering from the want of educational facilities. On the other hand the nearest Roman Catholic Institution was at Fort Qu'Appelle, and there being a considerable Roman Catholic population on One Arrow's, Beardy and Okemasis', Muskeg Lake, Mistawasis, and Attakakoop's Reserves, roughly speaking over 200, according to the Census returns, it was concluded to comply with the request made at that time, and begin in a small way the establishment of a School at Duck Lake. A small sum has been voted for a commencement, but whether anything has yet been done by the Church authorities I am not aware.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Mayne Daly.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary,\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary.\nREGINA, ASSA. June 9, 1893.\n\nDear Mr. Daly,\n\nI am glad to understand that the Roman Catholic Church here needs the services of an industrial school, to be located at Duck Lake; and I wish to point out that among the few Indians on the Reserve, likely to be most affected by such a school, say a dozen or so are Roman Catholics. An industrial school at Duck Lake should be able to draw pupils not only from all the reserves in that agency, but from those in the Carlton agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I enclose a copy of my reply to the bishop for your information. In addition to the promise being clear the $4000 item in the Supplementary Estimates specifies that that the funds are for the establishment of a Boarding School at Duck Lake under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, ($2000 for buildings, $1000 for furnishing, and $1000 for maintenance).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHaytor Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nOttawa, 28th March, 1896.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your queries during our personal interview last Monday, I have to make the following replies:\n\nAs to Bishop Pechal's desire to open a school at Prince Albert until the building at Lake Louise is completed, I think it would be better if such were not done, as I fear it would only tend to excite suspicion and ill-feeling on the part of others; and as it will be but for a few months, I think you will agree with me that, for the sake of that short time it had better not be done.\n\nAs regards the dormitory in the Fish River School, I am authorizing an expenditure in order that this may be made suitable for the little boys of the institution and thus increase the accommodation. I shall also instruct that the staircases inside the building be always kept perfectly clear and that the doors open outwards from the rooms; further that a fire-escape be made from the outside of the dormitory, as in other institutions.\n\nAs to the printing press, I find that a new one will cost between four and five hundred dollars. This, of course, includes the type, but, I fear, is a larger sum than\nour means will allow us to expend, for the present. Still,\nI will be on the lookout for some second hand press. Would\nyou kindly do likewise? Possibly in your tour through\nthe country you would be able to come across some suitable\npress which would do the work equally well as a new one.\nThe most likely part, I fancy, for this would be in the west\nwhere towns are increasing in size and printing establish-\nments are dispensing with the old presses.\n\nIn connection with the High River School, I have\njust read a lengthy and exhaustive report of Inspector\nMcGibbon's; and I find that if all the indebtedness has been\ncharged in the books, the school will not be behind more than\nsix or seven hundred dollars, and possibly less than that\nsum, when it is considered that the fuel will be greatly\nsaved from now until the end of the fiscal year. This being\nthe case, I have instructed Regina Office that every\neconomy must be practiced in order that the vote be not\nexceeded, even to the extent of reducing or temporarily dis-\npensing with the services of the staff. The Government is\nbecoming more than particular relative to the over-expendi-\nture of any vote. Consequently, we must use drastic measures.\n\nAs regards the Onion Lake School, as promised I\nam directing that the order for the re-building of this\nschool be given by the agency, and as much work as is pos-\nsible for them to give to be given by the employees.\n\nI find that we have estimated for 20 pupils to\nbe paid in money for the Onion Lake Institution, but if any\nmore are here, I think I can safely promise, at all events to\na reasonable number, that aid will be given to a limited extent by way of provisions as heretofore.\n\nFor Lac la Biche we estimated for 18 pupils; for St. Albert 50 pupils at $100.00. As the Estimates are printed, I fear I cannot promise more now; but as time goes on an opportunity may be offered to aid you more in the direction His Lordship and yourself desire.\n\nFor the same reason, I fear no hope can be held out to you now as regards a Boarding School at Bear's Hills.\n\nI beg leave to remain\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Father Lacombe,\nSt. Peter's Church,\nMontreal.\nTo The Honourable Thomas M. Daly,\nMinister of the Interior,\nSupt. General of the,\nIndian Department.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nAs your Department has already been informed, the Boarding School of Duck Lake has been established. The Rev. Father Paquette, officially named Principal of the establishment, has for the last two months, received twenty children at his own expense. The delay caused in the completion of the works has been much felt. It required all the zeal and also the resources of the Rev. Father Paquette to triumph over the numerous difficulties which are inevitable at the commencement of such institutions. Among these difficulties the privation of water, on account of the dryness of the season, was not one of the least. To-day I am happy to tell you, as also your Department, that all works well now. The children are satisfied and happy, and we are satisfied with them. Let me be allowed, Honourable Sir, to thank you for all that has been\nbeen done up to the present.\n\nAnd now I wish to apply to your Department for the enlargement and amelioration of this newly founded Institute, the only one I possess for Catholic Indians in the Vicariate of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe following are the reasons, which I have put forward in support of my demands:\n\n1st. The Rev. Father Paquette has been authorized to accept only twenty children; as the building has not been constructed to receive a great number. Therefore, what is the consequence? 75 children have been refused admittance. The Principal embarrassed in his choice, confined himself to receiving orphans, and the most abandoned children. As you understand; here, it is not necessary to press the Indians to give up their children, we displease them in refusing to take them for want of accommodation. Why should we not establish immediately an Industrial School, such as exists in the other Dioceses? If you do not wish to give it this title, at least enlarge the building in such a manner as to allow us to double or even to triple the number of children next summer.\n\nWe find this necessary for this reason:\n\n2nd. That experience shows us, more clearly every day, that the small Day Schools attached to the Reserves, are but a feeble and inefficient...\ninefficacious means of improving and forming the Indian child. It is absolutely necessary that they should be separated from their families, in order to bring them up as we desire.\n\n3rd. At the same time I cannot help calling your Honour's attention to the difficulty, I could almost say, the impossibility, we are under of continuing this work, so useful, with the small resources which are allowed us by the Department. It is easy to see, it seems to me, that it is difficult to furnish food, clothing, fuel, light, &c., in fine, to wash and provide for twenty children also to pay six or seven persons employed for the instruction of the children and the management of the house, with the sum of $1400.00 a year. The Rev. Father Paquette assures me that notwithstanding all his vigilance and his economy, he will have at the end of the term a deficit of at least $300.00. Permit me, therefore, Honourable Sir to entreat your Department to be pleased to raise the $72.00 a head per annum to $125.00 or at least to $100.00.\n\nCould not the $300.00 paid to the Teachers of the Schools on the Reserves be given to this Institution in proportion as these Schools are given up?\n\n2. Vote a reasonable subsidy for the enlargement of the building capable of admitting 100 children. We have shown our good will in accepting\naccepting this work under conditions so disadvan-\ntageous, that we could not hope for good re-\nsults, and for that reason we consented to give\nup to the Department 100 acres of excellent\nland and in one of the best sites of the Sask-\natchewan. It appears to us that we have on\nour side the right, that the Department should\nhelp us to continue this work of true civiliz-\nation, which does it so much honour.\n\nReceive Honourable Sir, my respectful\nwishes, with the assurance of my highest es-\nteem.\n\nx Albert O.M.I. Ev. de Mosynopolis, Vic.\nApost. de Saskatchewan.\n\nWe cordially and warmly endorse the foregoing and be-\nspeak for it the most favourable consideration of the\nMinister of the Interior.\n\n(Sgd) C.

You understand, Honourable Sir, that it is ridiculous to shut up a priest in a school with such a small number of pupils. I have, however, succeeded in obtaining from the government permission to receive thirty children instead of fourteen; and if the house were larger, within six months...\nI could have more than two hundred young Indians in my school. Having been a missionary in the midst of these tribes for more than twenty years, I am known by all and all wish to entrust their children to me. It is now and always will be impossible for me to maintain my school on a good footing with the small sum the government allows me for this purpose\u2014$72 per annum for each child, and I must board and clothe them, pay two schoolmasters\u2014one for the boys and one for the girls\u2014and also pay all the other expenses of the house. To sum up, they tell you that $72 for each child will not pay half the expenses. If I had from 150 to 200 children I might, perhaps, get back what I pay out; but\nthirty children only are the cause of considerable expense to me, as they require the same attention as I do would.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Macdonald, our Member for Prince Albert, whom no doubt you know. He tells me to write and explain the circumstances to you so that you may be able to support your request when he brings up the question in the House.\n\nI earnestly desire that my boarding school be changed to an industrial school and that it enjoy the advantages and privileges of industrial schools such as those at Red Appelle and Battleford.\n\nIn the hope that you will receive my request favorably, I am confident that you will do all you can to obtain this end for the\ngreat good of the Indians\nand the honour of the\nGovernment.\n\nPraying you to accept\nin advance my most sincere\nthanks for all that you\nwill be kind enough to do\nin order to accomplish the end\nin view.\n\nPlease accept, Honorable\nSir, my respectful regards\n\nM.

The superiority of Industrial Schools is recognized, but only a proportion of Indian children manifest ability to take such advantage of the training given them as would justify\njustify their cost, were that a less serious consideration than it is, and if there be found children worthy of greater educational advantages than can be expected for the annual per capita grant of $72 given to the Boarding Schools, they must be drafted to the existing Industrial Institutions as vacancies occur.\n\nThe Department has instituted all the Industrial Schools it can for the present, in face of the large aggregate expenditure on education of Indian children has reached, and has endeavoured to divide them among various churches desirous of conducting them, that with perhaps the exception of the Presbyterian Church, all have received a justly proportionate share.\n\nThe Department had, notwithstanding strong pressure, recently to refuse to give the Church of England an Industrial School at Prince Albert, in the same district.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSir A.

Dab et Caron, grands mercis pour votre trouble.\n\nIl est beau et bon que l'on se r\u00e9jouisse de nos enfants, mais ce n'est pas l\u00e0 notre but. Le D\u00e9partement devrait comprendre qu'il ne civilisera jamais les Sauvages avant qu'il enl\u00e8ve les enfants des parents et qu'il ferme toutes les petites \u00e9coles des r\u00e9serves. Ces \u00e9coles ne sont bonne...\nn'en grand d\u00e9but si le gouvernement ne veut pas que mon \u00e9cole soit industrielle, qu'il la laisse Boarding school mais qu'il me permette de recevoir au moins 100 enfants, il y a tant de petits sauvages qui causent les loges et le bois comme des petits b\u00eates, tandis qu'ils devraient \u00eatre bien form\u00e9s et intelligents s'ils \u00e9taient \u00e9lev\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole.\n\nAllons, mon cher Mr Macdonald, il ne faut pas nous regarder comme vaincus et dormir en paix. 1900 piastres ne suffisent pas pour l'agrandissement de mon \u00e9cole, on accorderait ailleurs de 15 \u00e0 20 mille piastres par ann\u00e9e pour une \u00e9cole, et ici m\u00eame nous pouvons par m\u00eame avoir 2000 piastres pour construction. La chose me para\u00eet tout \u00e0 fait injuste qu'on donne tous \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9e et \u00e0 Regina et qu'on ne donne presque rien \u00e0 Prince Albert et \u00e0 Duck Lake. Ces sauvages doivent \u00eatre aussi consid\u00e9r\u00e9s que ceux des autres provinces.\n\nSi il vous pla\u00eet de vous efforcer de faire conna\u00eetre les choses au gouvernement et de lui prouver que toutes les \u00e9coles Boarding schools\nlui co\u00fbte moins cher que l'entretien des sauvages qui sont sur les r\u00e9serves.\n\nJe demeure cher Monsieur votre tr\u00e8s humble\n\nM.

The Bishop was here yesterday & informed me the only way to make one of these schools pay at $7200 he had is to have a large number of pupils & that Father Paquet has added to the grant a sum of $7500 this year & yet can hardly make both ends meet, so he will have to further supplement it.\n\nYours truly,\nP.H.

I observe that this does not seem to the latter to be sufficient, but while we would gladly do all that is asked for his district, and indeed all over, we have only a limited amount of funds, and endeavour to apportion them as fairly as possible, and to the best advantage. In Father Paquette's own interests it would not seem advisable to risk having the whole provision for extending his school thrown out by asking Council for too much at one time.\n\nHe seems to forget, in arguing as he does, that although Industrial Schools must be located in certain Districts, they are open to eligible children from\nfrom other Districts, his own included.\n\nTo close Day Schools on Reserves and substitute Boarding Schools at a distance is our policy, but it must be remembered that the saving of a Teacher's salary made by shutting up a Day School will go but a short way towards maintaining an Industrial or Boarding School.\n\nThe policy is, moreover, when Boarding School accommodation can not be provided for all children of an Agency, to let those of the Reserve upon which the Boarding School may be established attend it as day scholars, and take those from more distant Reserves in as boarders.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

I feel sure your attention has been drawn to the good work we are undertaking and the many difficulties we have to contend with.\n\n1. That the Boarding School may be established as an Industrial Institution.\n2. That the Grant be increased to One Hundred Dollars a year per head, as I find after one year's time it almost impossible to clothe, board, teach and dress up the children in a proper way that will only be in accordance with the School Rules and the Indian Department.\n3. Closets are much wanted in the house for winter as it is not safe for young children to sleep out doors at night during the cold weather.\n4. A lister is greatly needed to collect...\nSalt water as the well water is too hard and unfit for washing and also for use in cases of fire to be of very recent.\n\nNo. 5. A surgeon is always much required, as not only is the store system very inconvenient but is dangerous by reason of the stop pipe.\n\nNo. 6. An ice house is very much needed to keep meat fresh.\n\nNo. 7. A barn for the horses as it is dangerous in case of fire to have it blowing about outside.\n\nNo. 8. A play yard for girls and boys separated by a walled fence.\n\nNo. 9. The school ground to be fenced in order to preserve building and gardens from intrusion of stray cattle.\n\nNo. 10. A carpenter's shop and a shop for shoe makers to work in is very much needed.\n\nThanking you for your most kind and interest.

In reply I beg to say with regard to\n\nParagraph 1. That the Department cannot at present entertain the proposition for the conversion of this school from a Boarding to an Industrial Institution. Later on will be time enough to consider this matter.\n\nParagraph 2. The Department regrets that it is impossible to increase the per capita grant to $100, but after not a few changes and opinions from different denominations, it has been decided to fix the grant to Institution of this class at $72. If the grant were increased as requested there would be a very large corresponding increase throughout the country.\n\nParagraph 3. With regard to the inside closets asked for, I beg to say that the Regina Office has been directed to have two sent.\n\nParagraphs 4, 5 and 6.

The Department would like to have an estimate of the cost of the fencing required to enclose the buildings and garden, and to divide the boys and girls' play-ground.\n\nParagraph 10. The Department regrets that it has no funds available to provide for the erection of carpenter's and shoemaker's shops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt.: [signature]\nof Indian Affairs.\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, No. 119698, and beg to state that the estimate of the cost of the fencing required to enclose the buildings and garden, to divide the boys' and girls' playground will be altogether $566.00, five hundred and sixty dollars, not counting the price of the work as the boys of the school can do it.\n\nAt the same time I beg to thank you for all your kindness, and for all you have done for us.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have been at One Arrows Reserve, Duck Lake Agency today, and baptised twenty-two children of the same reserve. All the adults requested to be baptised too, but I judged it necessary to make them wait until they should receive some instruction.\n\nAfter the ceremony all these Indians brought me sixteen of their children, who are of school age to be admitted into my school. As you understand I was obliged to refuse them, not being authorized by the Department.\n\nThese Indians were greatly disappointed when I told them so, and they did not seem to understand why I could not receive their children at once.\n\nI was sorry for them as my power and my purse were smaller than my heart. If I had authority I would not hesitate to put them in my own room, and even give them my own bed. Now I beg you will kindly obtain from the Department the necessary permission to place these children in my school as soon as possible.\n\nI know quite well there is no money voted for that purpose this year, but the Department can refund me the money later on, which will be the same to me.\n\nThe Indian Agent.\n\nDuck Lake\nI have every confidence that you will do all in your power to obtain my request.\n\nI remain, etc\n\nsgd M.M.P. Paquette Pte. O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Agents Office, Duck Lake.\n\n30th Oct., 1895.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev Father Paquette which speaks for itself.\n\nIn connection I may inform you that sometime ago I had a talk with the Indians of One Arrows Band with a view to inducing them to allow their children to be sent to the Industrial or Boarding Schools. They refused, so I let them know that if they would not let them go willingly that in all probability the Department would take them by force and send them to whatever school was thought best. The consequence was that when paying Treaty there on the 22nd inst., the Indians offered me all their children if I would place them in the Duck Lake Boarding School. I was however unable to accept them as the school has its full complement of children. I was sorry not to have been able to take them, and they at once went to the school and asked Father Paquette to take them. He was also obliged to refuse them.\n\nThese Indians do not wish to send their children to any other than the Duck Lake School and I would urgently recommend\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nrecommend that the Rev. Weather's suggestion may be acceded to if it is at all possible, as he will have sufficient room for 30 or 40 children more as soon as the addition now being erected is completed which will be in about 2 or 3 weeks, and I think it would be better now that the Indians have offered their children that we should not refuse them, for if we do it will make it difficult to get more in the future.\n\nHoping you will see your way to granting our request.\n\nI am, etc.\n\nsgd R.S. McKenzie.\n\nInd. Agt.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr Agent McKenzie forwarding a copy of a communication from the Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School in which he states that he was obliged to refuse admission to a number of children from One Arrow's Reserve on account of this school having the full complement of children provided for; and in reply I beg to say that provision will be made in the estimates for next year for an increased number of pupils at this school, which the Department trusts will be passed by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI have the honor of making application to your Department, requesting that the Duck Lake Boarding School (Saskatchewan) be recognised as an Industrial School.\n\nThe following are the principal reasons for which I make the request:\n\n1st. In a letter (dated Sept. 5th 1890) written to Mgr. Grandin, the Honorable E. Dewdney said \"I will recommend to my colleagues the advisability of establishing an Industrial School in your Lordship's Diocese, and from my own personal knowledge of the country I would suggest one point, which you mention, viz Duck Lake etc.\"\n\nIn April 1892 writing to D. H. Macdowall our member of Parliament he said \"I have promised to do what I can in the way of obtaining a Grant for the establishment at least of a Boarding School, which might probably in time develop into an Industrial School\".\n\n2nd.

The Indians of the Agencies of Carlton and Duck Lake incessantly beg of the Rev Father Paquette to receive still more.\n\nIn spite of the refusal of the Principal, the Indians of Batoche left eleven of their children in the snow at the door of the School. The Rev Father Paquette found himself obliged (though before being authorized to do so) to receive them in order to prevent their dying from hunger and cold. In less than a month one hundred and fifty children could be found, if there were the necessary accommodations.\n\n4th. On the occasion of the visit of the Governor General to Prince Albert last summer, Lady Aberdeen deigned to stop at Duck Lake, and promised the Rev Father Paquette to interest herself in this work; to obtain greater number of children and more resources.\n\nMore recent still, the Honourable Mackenzie\nMackenzie Bowell, Premier; T. M. Daly, Minister of the Interior and Superintendent General of the Indian Department; Hayter Reed Commissioner of the Indians etc etc during their visit to the North West were greatly pleased with the children of Duck Lake Boarding School seeing their rapid progress, which they had not expected.\n\nIn consequence, I earnestly ask that the title of Industrial School, and whatever results from this title, be granted without delay to this Institution. The Vicariate of Saskatchewan has not yet an Industrial School for our Catholic Indian children.\n\nThe Rev F Paquette (Principal) merits this encouragement and this school in which, I myself am deeply interested will be an honor to the Government.\n\nI dare to hope in your kindness Honorable Sir, that my request may be taken into consideration and that my legitimate hopes will not be frustrated.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\nAlbert Pascal O.

Perhaps you will kindly have it acknowledged in the meantime, and reported upon afterwards.\n\nA. Chisholm\n\nral.\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication addressed to the Superintendent General, Commissioner for Ontario and the North-West Territories, by Your Lordship, applying for the reasons given, for the recognition of the Duck Lake Boarding School, as an Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the previous promise of the establishment of a Boarding School at Duck Lake has been fully redeemed. It was opened in '92 with provision for fourteen pupils, which number was increased to thirty in '95, and in further mark of the Department's appreciation of the excellent work done at this school since its establishment, it has increased the number of pupils to be provided for in the Estimates for the next fiscal year by forty, which will make provision for seventy in all, or more than double the number included in this year's grant. In so doing the Department feels that it is showing substantial recognition of the progress made by the children at this school under the successful management and supervision of the Rev. Father Prequette, but for the following reasons it cannot see its way to carry out what you imply, was a second promise made by Mr Dewdney to Mr McDowall, namely to probably develop in time the Boarding into an Industrial School.\n\nRt-Rev: Albert Pascal, O.M.I., Vicar-Apostolic of Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere are now a number of Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the Territories, which have been in existence for some years, and as many of the pupils at these schools have now attained an age when it will be necessary for them to leave, the question of providing for them is forced upon the Department, and is a matter for serious consideration. Many of the pupils at these schools have been taught trades such as printing, making, tailoring, shoemaking and others which would be of no practical use to them should they have to go back to their own homes. The Department will therefore have to look out for employment for them in their respective trades, which can only be found in business centres, and unless it can place them satisfactorily, the time and money spent upon their industrial training will be practically lost.\n\nThe number of trades pupils that will, in the near future, be turned out annually, it is feared exceed the demand for such class of skilled labor. It is not therefore thought that it would be wise to increase the number of our Industrial Schools, but rather to provide increased accommodation, needed the present capacity, at the existing Institutions.\n\nIndustrial schools in the vicinity of thriving towns possess greater advantages than those in isolated localities, as pupils at such schools are brought into closer contact with the white population and from their social environment more readily acquire civilized habits. There is also this additional advantage\u2014pupils can be taught more trades and have freer scope for the exercise of any particular aptitude they may exhibit for one or other of the trades not taught at the school, as they can be and often are apprenticed to\nto local tradesmen who are always glad to secure their services, and by whom they are well cared for and instructed. Printing, tinsmithing and harness-making are thus acquired by pupils, while some are clerks in shops who if placed in a school on a Reserve, could not have similar opportunities and advantages.\n\nThe expenses connected with the maintenance and management of Industrial Schools are necessarily very high on account of the number of skilled instructors at high wages which are required on the staff, while the receipts outside of the work charged against the Institution are small, if any. While the staff required to carry on a Boarding School is small in comparison, besides which such schools are primarily missionary undertakings and are therefore managed at much less cost.\n\nFrom past experience the Department is forced to admit that the results obtained by Indian Day Schools in the Territories have been in most cases of little practical value and for this reason it is assisting liberally in the establishment of Boarding schools where the children can be removed from the harmful influences of the camp environment and religious training and instruction which will fit them for their future life on the Reserve.\n\nIt should be the aim of such schools to furnish a rudimentary education and inculcate habits of thrift and industry in the children committed to their charge. The pursuit of agriculture should form the calling of the boys who should also be taught the use of simple carpenter tools, while the girls are taught sewing, knitting and general housework. The education and training received at these schools should\nshould suffice for the greater number of the present generation of Indian children, and they should also be used as feeders for the existing Industrial Schools thereby causing a saving in time and money, and would enable the Industrial Schools to devote more attention to the teaching of handicrafts. A more healthy and intelligent class of pupils could be placed in the latter schools than is now possible.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say that the Department has no objection to this school assuming the title of Industrial School upon the express understanding that no claim will be made for an increased grant on that account.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant transmitting a copy of a communication from His Lordship, Bishop Pascal, addressed to the Superintendent General, requesting that the Duck Lake Boarding School be recognized as an Industrial School, in connection with which I beg to enclose you a copy of a letter from the Department to His Lordship setting forth its reasons why it is not thought advisable to comply with this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nmy dear Sir Adolph,\n\nReferring to your of 3rd Inst. relative to the application made by this Township to the Minister of Industry to have the boarding school at Dush take recognition as an Industrial School, we are the more astonished at first view the ground upon which such an application is based, you will observe that it is based upon the fact that I would remark that the hope held out by Mr. Drew in regard that the boarding school might be developed into an Industrial Institution cannot but be naturally be continued upon developments in other directions.\n\nSince that time Industrial Institutions have been increased in number, extended in capacity and number of the institutions, we understand that a large number of pupils have been learning trades, and we are now confronted with a difficulty not then foreseen, viz., that of finding suitable jobs for these pupils in the existing trade pursuit by the country has not kept pace with that of the schools, and consequently employment can not be found for the number of pupils who have been learning trades.\n\nUnder such circumstances it is only sound policy would appear to be for the present to confine the\nThe instruction of Indian children to what they can make use of when they return to their Reserves, and can be taught at the Boarding schools from which any pupil showing special aptitude can be drafted into the factory industrial institutions. Does this really meet the wishes of the Boarding schools to get any promising disadvantageless lives? The increased fees capitate grant to the Industrial school to enable to be consumed on the maintenance of a staff to give instruction in trades which are not permitted out of the ordinary to such trade instruction as I have not been permitted to do. It is not advisable to select for the present.\n\nThe excellence of the work being done by the Rev. Father Royalle is fully acknowledged, and this as a consequence provides an basis made to the new estimate to very largely increase the number of pupils.\n\nFor signature by the minister\nHon. John Bytten\nMinister of Marine Fisheries\nOttawa\nJuly 1796\n\nMy dear Bytten,\n\nIn reply to yours of 15th Inst. I probably can not do better than send you attached copy of letter to Sir A.P.

(RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nFor the last two years your Duck Lake Boarding School has been opened, and several times since then, the Indians of the Saskatchewan district have asked me to teach their children different trades, as they do in all Industrial Schools. Having refused their request several times and finding it impossible to make them understand the difference between Boarding and Industrial Schools, I have been obliged, in some measure, to consent to teach their children, as we do in such Institutions.\n\nThere is a Protestant Industrial School at Battleford, and one training school at Prince Albert, and only this Boarding School for Catholic Indians in this district. I should think therefore it would be only fair for the Department to give to these Catholic Indians an Industrial School with all the privileges attached to such an Institution.\n\nHoping\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nHoping that the Department will consider it an honour to place the Catholic Indians on the same footing and give them the same advantages as they do the Protestants.\n\nFeeling sure my request will at once be kindly taken into consideration.\n\nI remain, etc.\n\nsgd M.J.P. Paquette Pte O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal.\nRegina.\n\nJanuary 16th 1897.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter and Circular of the 26th March, No. 0154, I beg leave to say that we will do all in our power to conform to it.\n\nAs a reply to the desire expressed that the aid of the Department afforded for the support of the boarding schools should not be employed otherwise, nor diverted in any manner, I can assure you that there is no need to fear this at Duck Lake, and I can only give you the best proof of it, in telling you that I have been obliged to come to its assistance, for I have spent out of my own funds, the sum of $1300.00 (one thousand, eight hundred dollars) for keeping up the prosperity of the school and if the work has made such rapid developments, in so short a time, and at present causes the admiration of visitors, it is in a great measure owing not only to the zeal and industry and to the resources of the Principal, but above all to my own money.\n\nI am much surprised that the Department,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nwhich is aware that there is not a single catholic industrial school in Saskatchewan, and notwithstanding our reiterated applications, for almost the last five years, has not yet deigned to raise this one to the rank of industrial school, by giving it the means of meeting the obligations which they entail. Nothing would do it more honour, and this would be the best encouragement to give to the Rev Father Paquette and to all those who are interested in this institution.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd Albert Pascal, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Maryanopolis, Vicar Apostolic of Saskatchewan.\nTo the Honorable Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior and General Superintendent of Indian Affairs:\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have the honor to apply to your Department to obtain the erection of an Industrial School for the Roman Catholic Indians of the Saskatchewan. The Diocese of St. Boniface, Manitoba, Alberta, and New Westminster, B.C., have both Industrial and Boarding Schools; and for years I have been asking myself, why the Diocese of Saskatchewan does not enjoy the same privilege. Are its wants fewer? Have the Indians here less right to the favors of the Government than elsewhere? I do not, nor can I believe it.\n\nI find in the Diocese five agencies, which comprise 31 Reserves. 1st, the Agency of Battleford, with 7 Reserves; 2nd, the Agency of Carlton, with 9; 3rd, the Agency of Duck Lake, with 6; 4th, the Agency of the Pas, with 7. We have, moreover, the Reserves of Lake La Ronge and Montreal Lake, which are ruled by a special treaty.\n\nWith the exception of two or three Reserves, where there are but few Catholic Indians, all the others contain a great number of Catholics, and several have an overwhelming majority. Now these Indians are the children of the Dominion, they are, therefore, entitled to the same favors and privileges as their eastern brethren. Wherefore I, the Bishop of the Diocese of Saskatchewan, their father and pastor in the Faith, come once more to plead the cause of the poor Indians.\n\nCatholics must be treated on a perfect footing of equality with the members of other religious denominations. Protestants have an Industrial School at Battleford, towards which the Government has shown great liberality. They have also a Training School at Prince Albert. Catholics alone have none, and why they are left in the background we cannot understand. They had to fight for six years in order to obtain a simple Boarding School at Duck Lake.\n\nWhen I took charge of the Diocese in 1891, I found among the letters of the Conservative Government, then in power, strong recommendations made by the Hon. E. Dewdney to Bishop Grandin, then in charge of the whole Diocese. Seven years have since elapsed, and nothing more has been done. Since my appointment as Bishop, I spared neither time nor exertions to obtain the fulfillment of these hopes, which would be but an act of justice. I had the honor to present a petition to the Government in 1891, another in 1894. I likewise presented others in 1896 and in 1897. Seeing the uselessness of my efforts, I decided to come once more to the front in the present year. All that I have so far obtained is the establishment of a Boarding School at Duck Lake, with the hope that later on that school would become Industrial. These hopes are attested by a letter I had the honor to receive from the Hon. E. Dewdney on the 2nd of April, 1892. With full confidence in these promises, I have authorized the Principal of the school of Duck Lake to devote more than ordinary care to the development of this establishment, on grounds that have since become the property of the Government, by the deed drawn up in its favor. We have incurred private building expenses above $10,000, as is proved by our vouchers and receipts. We have not refused to incur such expenses, as they were necessary to insure the success of the school, the only one in the Diocese. I may say, to the honor of the Department, that the school of Duck Lake is an object of admiration to all visitors.\n\nWishing to comply with the desires of the Indians, and to meet the views of the Department, we have prescribed in the school the teaching of joinery and agriculture, there being no industrial school in the Diocese. Knowing the government to be animated with a strong desire of advancing the education and civilization of the Indians, and desiring Catholic Indians to be on the same footing as other denominations, I therefore beg the Government to give me an Industrial School in the Saskatchewan.\n\nIf the Government is not willing to transform the school of Duck Lake into an Industrial school, well, be it so; but then let the Government give us, without further delay, an Industrial School, either at Battleford or elsewhere. Protestants having two, by all means we must have at least one, otherwise we will never cease to complain and to cry injustice.\n\nMay I venture to make a suggestion?\n\nI have in present a beautiful large brick building at Prince Albert, with every desirable convenience\u2014heating apparatus, plentiful supply of water, large grounds adjoining. This house was built expressly for a first class Boarding School by the Nuns, who for several reasons were obliged to leave it, and we now offer this fine building to the Government at a very nominal price, to be used for an Industrial School.\n\nI hope, Hon. Sir, that this my sixth petition, will receive more consideration than those presented in the past, and that the Government will see how very essential it is that I should have at least one Industrial School in my Diocese of Saskatchewan.\n\nI have the honor to be, Hon. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that while there may be a great deal of truth in the statements made by Bishop Paschal yet it is a matter which it is absolutely impossible to take up during the present year. The large amount of money which has been expended on Industrial Schools during the past few years has led the Department to hesitate before authorizing any further expenditure in this regard at least until the question as to the merits or demerits of the system of Industrial Schools has been fully considered.\n\nIn the meantime, therefore, the application of Bishop Paschal will be placed upon file in the Department, and consideration given to it during the coming year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

The per capita allowance for maintenance is $72.00 per annum; but there are expenses such as medical attendance which are paid in addition to the allowance, and so during the last fiscal year the cost was $76.05 per capita per annum.\n\nThis Institution is what is known as a Boarding School, not an Industrial School.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Principal Charlebois called here yesterday afternoon and reported that an outbreak of Diphtheria had occurred among the children of the Duck Lake Boarding School.

It will take 100,000 units to inoculate all of the children, and 25,000, or may be required for those who now have the disease. On Sunday afternoon there were three cases at night four, this morning eight cases. I have thought it advisable to call in Dr Reavley of Rosthern\u2014who has had very considerable experience with this disease\u2014to get his opinion on what has been done, and his advice on the whole matter. I will meet him this afternoon. If the disease spreads a doctor should live at the school, and I will act accordingly.

Thinking the matter sufficiently grave I wired the Dept of Public Health Regina, asking that they send a Doctor to take charge and live at the School. They replied this morning that they could not get one to come up. I received today sufficient Anti Toxin, so that by now I expect all have been inoculated, if no more cases occur within the next 24 hours I think we will have the outbreak under control. I saw Dr Touchette an hour ago, when he told me that all of the nine cases are in a favourable condition. The outlay for Anti Toxin has been very considerable, but unavoidable. The nine cases have been placed in a large isolated house, and the nursing is of the very best.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Charlebois to the Superintendent of Indian Education that gentleman asked consideration of a plan whereby pupils, both boys and girls, of the Duck Lake Boarding School may during their last year be sent out to service in the homes of the neighbouring white people. The Principal's object is to give them a more practical training in conditions more nearly approaching those under which they will have to work when they leave the school. During this period they would still be under the control and supervision of the Principal.\n\nFather Charlebois thinks that during this period the school should be allowed half the grant, or if no grant is paid that they should be allowed to substitute others, if such are in residence. The earnings of the pupils are to be funded for them, except perhaps a small percentage that they might require for personal expenses. The Principal is to see that the homes they are placed in are satisfactory and that they are well used during their time of service, otherwise they are to be called back to the school.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I return herewith the list of drugs which are required for the Duck Lake Boarding School, and I have to inform you that you may purchase the same. It is desired, however, to draw your attention to what appears to be an error in the list, viz:- the request for 2 lbs of laudanum. If this is a mistake it should be corrected.\n\nI have to remind you that in future drug requisitions should be submitted in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, November 18th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to the correspondence had between yourself and the Superintendent of Indian Education in regard to allowing pupils of the Duck Lake Boarding School to be placed in service during the whole or a portion of their last year, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to try the experiment.\n\nThese boys and girls are to remain on the roll of the school and under the direct control of the Principal, but no grant will be paid for them during the time they are in service. The Department will, however, permit you to replace them as grant earners from the pupils on the roll in excess of the number provided for, if there are such, or by new recruits.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that only good homes in which to place these pupils are selected; homes where they will receive proper treatment and not be overworked, and the agreement with those engaging them should be that the Principal will have the authority to recall them to the school at any time, should circumstances in his opinion warrant such action.\n\nThey should be paid wages commensurate with their earning powers and the money earned should be funded by you for them, with the exception of an allowance for personal expenses. A separate account should be kept for each pupil, showing amounts earned and expended.\n\nRev. O. Charlebois,\nPrincipal,\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nA report showing the name of the pupil, the nature of the work, the name of the proposed employer, rate of wages and full particulars should be submitted to the Department for its approval before any agreement is closed, unless in cases where delay might be the means of losing a good situation. Under such circumstances the matter is left to your discretion, the report to follow in due course.\n\nThe Department trusts that under your care and guidance this experiment will prove eminently satisfactory, as, if so, steps will be taken to extend the system to other localities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, 1 December, -09.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo and in same time to inform you that today, December 1st, I have engaged two girls who are in their last school year. One is Flora Thomas, No. 45, who will work for Doctor Touchette in charge of this School and of the Reserves. He is a married man with young children. It is a good and honorable family where she will be as safe as in our School.\n\nShe will be employed to general house work such as cooking, washing, sewing &c. with the help of the mistress.\n\nHer monthly wages will be $6.00 payable at the end of each month. The agreement is that I can recall her at any time should the circumstances necessitate her return.\n\nThe other girl is Eliza Eyshpaise, No. 0.45. She is hired by Mrs. Alphonse Archambault, a widow with three young children. She is Doctor Touchette's sister-in-law. Her moral character is irreproachable.\n\nShe is engaged under the same conditions as Flora Thomas.\n\nI took the liberty of engaging these girls before sending you my report as these persons have been waiting long ago for servants and would have been annoyed had they not had them at the beginning of this month.\n\nTrusting that will give you satisfaction,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary of\n\nPrincipal\n\nDepartment of Ind.

H. Stucke\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, 22 Feb. -10.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was about to send you my report on the two girls, Flora Thomas and Eliza Eyhnpise, whom I placed out on service, when I receive your favor of the 15th inst., asking for the same.\n\nI am pleased to say both girls have given satisfaction so far. Flora specially would deserve a first class mild certificate if she was not so slow and timid. That's the only reproach that can be given her. She received many complimentary mentions for her nice sewing. Her behaviour is perfect, and she likes her position well.\n\nEliza deserves about the same testimony, only she is much slower and more timid and this keeps her of being as agreeable to her mistress as her companion; but she is willing to work and she is obedient. She likes her position fairly well too, although she suffers sometimes when she does not succeed to be agreeable to her mistress on the points mentioned.\n\nOn Sundays the two girls come and have dinner at the school where they meet their former companions and teachers. We take the opportunity then of giving them some good advice, so they go back with better courage.\n\nYou see, so far our attempt has been quite a success, but to have it complete, I think, the idea suggested by the Dr. Touchette in his letter attached to this, is a very good one; that is, I shall should be allowed by the Department to keep them under my authority for at least another year. It will complete their formation in private housekeeping, and it would prevent them from going home where they get spoiled while waiting to get married.\n\nTheir parents will surely take them home as soon as they get their discharge, and that time is near at hand now as it is in April next.\n\nSo for their greater benefit I ask you to mind in my\ncontrol for one year more over these two girls and over two other ones, Josette Kamiskishaw No. 0.38 and Madeleine Amans No. 0.74 who have to be discharged also in April. I will also find a place for these two last mentioned and I promise to do my best to have a good result with them. My only aim is to protect our pupils against the influence of their old parents.\n\nI hope you will grant me a favorable answer. In this case, please, notify the Agent of the same, so that he may be in position of certifying to the parents that my control is maintained over their children for another year.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S.\u2014 I forgot to tell you that I have in fund $12.00 for Flor.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the two girls, Flora Thomas and Elize Wahpaise, who were placed out at service by you last autumn, and it is a pleasure to learn that they are giving satisfaction to their employers.\n\nWith regard to your request that these girls should be left under your authority for another year I beg to say that the Department is prepared to grant the same, on the condition that they remain at service and do not marry within that time. Their names may be retained on the roll of the school, but not as grant earners, and you may fill their places as grant earners from those on the roll in excess of the number, if there are such, or by new recruits.\n\nThe same conditions are granted in regard to Josette Kamiskaw, No. 038, and Madeleine Ananas, No. 074, if you are successful in obtaining suitable places for them.

Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, 12 April, -10.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith the authority granted to me by your letter of March 2nd No.119695/1, I placed at service the two following pupils: Josette Kamiskish, No.0,38, and Madeleine Ananas, No.0,74.\n\nThe first one is at Mr. Gervais, one of the best families and farmers in Duck Lake. So far she has done very well. She is much appreciated for her knowledge of sewing and cutting dresses. Her wages are $5.00 per month to begin with. If she continue to give satisfaction her wages will be raised up to $6.00 per month.\n\nThe second girl is at Mr. Lamotheville, another good family and farmer. She has given satisfaction till now. Her mistress is very proud of her. She has the same wages and conditions as the above.\n\nThe two other girls, Flore Thomas and Elise Eyholtz, continue to please her employers and they are even much appreciated for their knowledge of general housekeeping as well as their ability in sewing, cutting and fitting all kinds of garments.\n\nThe trouble now is that their parents claim them and want them home. Because the usual time for their discharge has come, and they do not want to leave them any longer under my control and at service. What am I to do?... It would be a pity to send them home where they will find nearly nothing to do and where they will spoil themselves.\n\nOn the other hand it is hard for me to resist alone against their claims. Of course you give me full authority, but the parents do not believe it. They think that my object in keeping their children at service is my own interest I am seeking, and not theirs.\n\nI wish you will tell me what you think the best to do. If you decide that I must keep them under my control, please send me a letter in which you will clearly oblige me (not only authorize) to keep them.\nAnd also you will ask the Agent, Mr. Macarthur, to be kind enough to make the parents understand that I am forced by you to not let go their children. The Agent can help me very much were he willing.\n\nIn case you prefer I should give them their liberty to go home, you have only to let me know I will do it, although I will be very grieved because, I know, it will be a draw back for these girls.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe secretary of\n\nthe Depart. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in reference to the four girls, pupils of your school, lately placed at service.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided that these girls shall remain under your control for another year and Mr. Agent Macarthur will be written to and asked to so advise the parents. In the meantime the Department would be pleased if arrangements could be made to have these girls married to reliable ex-pupils or other Indians on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. O. Charlebois,\nSecretary.\n\nPrincipal,\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, April 22, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you have already been advised four girls, pupils of the Duck Lake Boarding School, have been placed at service with whites in the neighborhood of the school by the Principal, who now states that their parents wish to have them finally discharged from the school.\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided that it would be in the best interests of these girls to be retained on the roll of the school for at least one year more and you will be good enough to advise the parents of this decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. At a meeting of the Indians of the Beardy's and Okemassis reserves, held here on the 20th instant, they requested me to write you protesting against their children being kept, after they are of age, at the Duck Lake boarding school. I explained to them the Principal's good intentions in so keeping them, but they claim that they can take just as good care of their own children as the Principal can, and that it was neither fair nor right to keep them against their own and their parents' wishes. They all object to children who are in their last year at school, being sent out to work, saying that they are not sent there to work for others, and that if they are through with school they should be allowed to return home.\n\nI explained to them that the subject was one affecting the Department and the Principal, and with which I had nothing to do, but that I would forward their complaint.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in which you state that the Indians of Beardys and Okemasis reserves have protested against the retention of their children after the age of eighteen years in the Duck Lake Boarding school and also against the girls being placed at service during the last year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter received careful consideration and the Department, in taking the action it did, was actuated only by a desire to promote the welfare of the pupils. The greatest care is exercised to see that they are placed in suitable homes where they will be well used and the money earned, with the exception of an allowance for personal expenses, is funded for them. The main object is to give these girls a few months' training in the houses of white people under conditions more nearly resembling those under which they will have to work in their own homes in so far as management, etc., is concerned.\n\nThe Department has no wish to carry out this policy in opposition to the wishes of the parents. It is not, however, a new departure and good results have been obtained in the past.\n\nKindly lay before the Indians the attitude of\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nof the Department, at the same time assuring them of the good wishes for the welfare of their children and expressing the hope that they will concur in the action taken, at least till such time as the experiment has been given a fair trial under the supervision of Father Charlebois.\n\nShould the course of training not prove agreeable to the pupils and beneficial to the extent expected and should the Indians at a later time reasonably object their wishes will be respected.\n\nThe Department hopes that your influence with them will overcome their present objection and that the results will speak for themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsecretary.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo. 105\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nJune 28, 1910.\n\nReferring to your letter of 14th instant,\n\nNo. I9695/I, I have the honour to inform you that I have explained to the parents of those girls who are working out, as carefully and plainly as I could, the object desired to be obtained; that all is being done in the one desire of assisting the girls; but I have totally failed to get the parents in any way to consent or approve of them working out. I have hitherto refrained from expressing my personal opinion on the subject, either to the Indians or to the Department, but being on the spot, it is probably my duty now to do so. It may be taken as beside the question that Principal Charlebois is acting entirely in what he believes to be the very best interests of the girls; and the Principal is an able and earnest man. It should not be forgotten that these girls have been at school for 12 years; they know how, and can do household work just as good as white girls of their age; they can wash and iron, make or repair clothing. Indeed, in all this, as far as knowledge of the work, they are ahead of the average white girl. Now, this being so, what further object can be gained by placing them with strangers to work for a wage against their willing\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwilling consent? To my mind it is akin to slavery.\n\nIf twelve years of careful training has failed to make them competent to take up their life's work, a few months of compelled service will not mend matters. The principal is looking for results which will hardly be visible before another generation\u2014Just yesterday I was round the Beardy's reserve with Farmer McCloy; as we passed an Indian's tent I pointed out to the Farmer a young woman who had been educated at the Duck Lake boarding school; why, said the Farmer, she looks as if she has not washed for a week. A little later we passed another ex-pupil riding in a wagon with her husband; she had a shawl over her head, and was just as dirty and untidy as the other. Now both of these young people can do any household work as well as any white girl; more than that, they can take a piece of dress stuff, cut it out, make and fit a dress just as good as a dress-maker. In fact, they are exceptionally clever girls. Yet, after all this training, after twelve years of a life of cleanliness and comfort, they return to the life of their parents without the least desire to improve their surroundings. Now, there are occasionally exceptions, but the above is the general rule. I do not wish to convey the impression that all the labor, time and money has been wasted. On the contrary, it is the necessary foundation for the future, but to expect that in one generation you can turn this class of girl into anything approaching a white girl is as absurd as to expect to make a \"silk purse out of a sow's lug\". Those girls, who have to some extent made good are, as a rule, only nominally Indian, having far more white than Indian blood in them.\n\nTwo of the Indians have specially asked me to again write the Department regarding their daughters, One,\nSandy Thomas, says he wants his girl at home, she has been away twelve years. He had in the past other two girls at this school, both of whom, while there, became mothers. He does not want this to happen to the third, and claims that he is just as able to look after her as the Principal is, and that it is altogether wrong to keep the girl away from him.\n\nThen Eyahpaise wants his girl home as her mother is a helpless invalid, being bed-ridden for years. While this girl will not be 18 until November, she is working out. That being so, she should be at home taking care of her mother.\n\nI have written at this length, not from any desire to interfere with the work, but because of the constant complaints of the parents, that the Department should know my opinion and because I sympathize with the girls and their parents.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 7, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you state that you have been unable to obtain the approval of the Indian parents of the action of the Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School in placing their girls at service during their last year at school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the attitude of the Indians and your remarks on the subject, the Principal has been instructed to recall these girls from service and grant the final discharge of those who have reached the age of eighteen years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, July 7, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nProtests have been received from the parents of the Indian girls placed at service by you within the past year with the concurrence of the Department. In May, last, when the first communication was received, a letter of explanation was written in which the motives actuating you and the officers of the Department were fully dealt with, and it was hoped that no further objection by the parents would be forthcoming, but neither their consent to nor approval of the continuance of the system can be had.\n\nIn view of the attitude of the Indians of your district generally towards residential schools it is not considered politic to place their girls in service against their wishes, nor to retain them in the school beyond the age of 16 years, unless there are in any particular case exceptional circumstances which would warrant such action.\n\nThe greatest care must be taken not to antagonize the Indians, as all efforts to recruit will prove futile. For this and the further reason that they are quite within their rights in raising the objections it has been decided to recall to the school those girls who have not reached the age of 16 and grant the final discharge of those who have attained that age. To those to be discharged honourable\n\nRev. O.

V. Gabillon, C.M.S., as successor to the Rev. O. Charlebois. The new Principal can speak the English and Cree languages fairly well, and I am positive that he will follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, and will take the same interest in the prosperity of that Institution of which the Government has every reason to be proud.\n\nBelieve me to be Honorable Sir,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n+ Albert Pascal, O.M.S.,\nBishop of Prince Albert.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Charlebois as Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School and nominating for the position Rev. V. Gabillon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the appointment of Rev. Father Gabillon is approved.\n\nThe Department, while pleased to learn of the appointment of Father Charlebois as Bishop, regrets his removal from the principalship of the school, where he has attained a large measure of success. It is sincerely hoped that the standard of the school will be maintained and with this object in view I have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough to impress upon the new Principal the necessity of devoting his best energies to the work, so that future reports on this institution will show continued advancement.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Please excuse my mistake.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour humble obedient servant\n\nST. MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\n\nV. Gabrielon... Principal\n\n[Signature]\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nIn connection with the enclosed report on the Duck Lake Boarding School, I have the honour to inform you that the death rate in this school is again returning to its high mark, two of the inmates having died during the year and two others dying. For a time after the introduction of the steam heating and the excellent ventilating system provided by the Department the death rate was low, and I was in hopes that it would remain permanently so. Everything that can be done is done to keep the scholars of this school in health, but in spite of all, the above is the result. I have always been of the opinion that the building was not suitable for the purpose as it has altogether too many dark corners and a lack of light. I understand that Tuberculosis Bacilli dies in a very short time if exposed to sunlight, but will live on indefinitely if kept in the dark. It may be thought that the children catch the disease while visiting their parents, but it must be remembered that they only visit for a month of the year and that too in the summer, when they spend their time on the open prairie and sleep in tents. Eleven months of the year is spent at school, and no one responsible can get beyond the sad fact that those children catch the disease while at school.\n\nTo find how our day schools compared with this report on the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe Duck Lake Boarding school, I have looked back over the past 10 years with the following result, viz.- In 1900 there were 19 children from the One Arrow's Reserve at the Duck Lake Boarding school. Of these, 10 are living today and 9 are dead. Of 23 children on the roll of the LaCorne north school in 1900, 17 are alive today and 5 are dead; and of 15 on the roll of the La Corne south school in October 1903, 14 are today living and one is dead. While, in the latter case, the pleasing result may not be altogether due to the teacher, no doubt her motherly care materially helped to procure the result. It may be thought that the James Smith's people are, on the whole, more healthy than the One Arrow's people, but I find that during the past 10 years the average duration of life on the James Smith's was 25 years, while on the One Arrow's reserve it is a fraction over 27 years notwithstanding the heavy toll taken by the Duck Lake Boarding school.\n\nI have written the above for various reasons, all of importance. The Department should realize that under present circumstances about one-half of the children who are sent to the Duck Lake Boarding school die before the age of 18, or very shortly afterwards, and that because they are kept in a building whose every seam and crevice is, doubtless, burdened with Tuberculosis Bacilli.\n\nA further expenditure to provide waterworks is, I understand, under consideration. Before being sanctioned, a thorough examination of the building should be made.\n\nI have also made the report in the interests of the parents of both, Beardy's and One Arrow's reserves. They have asked for day-schools, and while they cannot very well get up and tell you just why, I know it is because so many of their children die at the Boarding school, or come home from the Boarding school to die.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a letter from Indian Agent Macarthur, dated Dec. 27th., a copy of which is enclosed herewith. The question dealt with in this letter is worthy of serious consideration and I have to request that you will give the matter your personal attention. It is possible that one cause which increases the death rate at this school is the lack of care in examining prospective pupils. If the medical attendant does not exercise great care and is not possessed of considerable experience in detecting the presence of tuberculosis, it may be quite possible that he is passing pupils who could not possibly be admitted under the restrictions laid down by the admission forms.\n\nThe impression exists that the dormitories and school-rooms of the Duck Lake school are properly lighted. The dark corners and lack of light which Mr. Macarthur refers to may be in other parts of the building. The outside closets which are certainly most unsanitary, should be replaced by a more modern system and that end a Civil Engineer presented a plan for improvements, but he omitted to make profile sketches so that it was impossible to say whether the fall from the house to the proposed cess pools was sufficient. The school authorities have under consideration the advisability of purchasing the property, in which case they would under the new arrangement be expected to provide sufficient space.\n\nWould you kindly report fully on Mr. Macarthur's letter.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nits various statements and the conclusions at which he arrives. You might also confer with him and the authorities of the school on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 17, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith duplicate agreement between His Majesty the King and Les Reverends Peres Oblats de Marie Immaculee des Territoires du Nord Ouest for the future maintenance and management of the Duck Lake Boarding School, which has been duly executed by the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nReferring to your letter of the 12th inst., enclosing copy of a letter from Agent Macarthur dealing with sanitary matters in connection with the Duck Lake boarding school, and requiring a report on the conditions referred to therein, I have the honour to state that on the 16th inst. accompanied by Mr. Macarthur I visited the school and consulted with the reverend Principal and the Sister Superior, and inquired into all matters affecting the health of the pupils, and now beg to report.\n\nAgent's statement.\n\n1. The statement made by the Agent regarding the death rate among pupils and ex-pupils of the school for the past ten years is based on accurate information gathered from the certified quarterly returns of the school.\n\nUnsanitary conditions.\n\n2. The conditions that might act as a protection for germs, and thus tend to the propagation of disease, are as follows:\n\n(a) The basement, with clay walls and floors, the latter deep with dust, in which the dried sputa of pupils engaged there from time to time at various kind of work must accumulate not only for days but for weeks and months, as there is simply no way of cleaning the place except by a process of further\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nexcavation. Sufficient quantities of fresh air find access to this basement, but no light whatever.\n\n(b) Floors.\n\n(b) The floors throughout the building are of B.C. fir or spruce. In some parts they were originally well laid, in others not so well; but in every part there are the usual cracks between the boards, where germs are liable, indeed certain, to be harbored.\n\n(c) Walls.\n\n(c) The walls throughout are of plaster, either painted or kalsomined; but in the older portions of the building there are numerous small cracks in the plaster, in which dust and germs are liable to collect.\n\n(d) Lighting.\n\n(d) There are a few passages and rooms on the ground floor and up-stairs that are but poorly lighted. The dining-room, which was at one time decidedly dim, is still only moderately well lighted, having but four medium sized windows all facing toward the east and screened in some measure by adjacent buildings. These windows receive but a very limited share of the direct rays of the sun. On dull days the room is dimly lighted, while on bright days there is all the light that the eye requires.\n\nBetween the dining room and the senior class-room there is a passage between 30 and 40 feet long which is almost without light.\n\nThe two hospital rooms, which are of the dimensions of large bed-rooms, have but one window each, and are not well suited in this respect for their purpose, but are the best the building in its present arrangement affords.\n\nThe clothing rooms, which are approximately 14 x 28 feet, have but one window each and are not sufficiently well lighted.\n\nThe class-rooms are each 24 x 35 feet and have four windows each, two on each side of the room.\n(e) Closets.\n\nThe outside closets, which on account of their unavoidable proximity to the school and for other reasons are a serious menace to the health of the pupils.\n\nRemedies suggested.\n\n3. In order to remedy as far as possible the conditions above described I would make the following suggestions:\n\n(a) Basement.\n\nThere is a shallow stone foundation under the entire building. A basement the full dimensions of the building is not required; but I would recommend that further excavation be made under the central portion of the building, so as to make the basement the full width of the building, 40 feet, and about 120 feet in length; and that the present surface foundation be under-built with stone or concrete to the full depth of the cellar. This basement should at the same time be deepened about three feet, as it was found necessary to sink the steam boilers nearly that depth when installing the present heating plant, in consequence of which they are very inconveniently situated in a hole. A cement floor would, of course, be an indispensable part of the improvements. Light sufficient for working requirements could at the same time be provided.\n\n(b) Floors, etc.\n\nFor the disinfection of the floors, baseboards, wainscots, and other woodwork, a mixture should be frequently be employed consisting of -\n\n1 part bichloride of mercury,\n2 parts muriate of ammonia, and\n500 parts water.\n\nPainted plaster might be washed with a dilution of formalin; and the same disinfectant might be mixed with kalsomine in cleansing other portions of the walls.\n(c) Cracks in the plaster should in connection with the process of disinfection be effectually closed with plaster of Paris or other suitable material.\n\n(d) Lighting.\n\nAn additional window should be inserted in each of the sick rooms and clothing rooms. An additional window might with advantage be inserted in each of the class-rooms on the left of the pupils, from which side light should mainly be admitted to a school-room.\n\nA limited provision of borrowed light only could be obtained for the dark passage between the dining room and class-room. This might be a convenience but would be of no value for purposes of disinfection.\n\n(e) Waterworks.\n\nThe installation of a system of waterworks, with provision for the disposal of sewage, would be a sanitary measure of the very highest importance. The matter is one that requires to be gone into thoroughly by an expert. One of the first difficulties that requires to be solved is the source of the water supply. I have an impression that a well dug to a depth of about 120 feet and with a diameter of 8 feet would afford the requisite supply; and the water would be suitable for all purposes except those of the laundry, for which it is very poorly adapted. Of other sources the nearest is Duck Lake, a shallow lake, with water of inferior quality.\n\nAs for the disposal of sewage, if ordinary cesspools were employed they would require to be situated at some distance from the school and the wells, and hence at considerable depth in order to give the necessary fall, as the land is perfectly level; while if septic tanks were installed they could with safety be located somewhat nearer.\n\nIn connection with the question of a water supply I may say that a soft water cistern of a capacity of 500 barrels was constructed several years ago. This\nis of great value; but it does not store half the available supply of rain water from the roofs of the main buildings, and its contents are insufficient for laundry use alone. All other water to be obtained here is extremely hard; and I would recommend that in connection with improvements to the basement four galvanized iron cisterns of large capacity, say 150 bbls. each, be provided for the storing of a further supply of soft water.\n\nGeneral character of building.\n\n4. The building is a plain and inexpensive one, but not on the whole an unsanitary structure, (apart from the basement and the want of waterworks), except for the fact that it has now for 16 or 17 years been occupied by pupils a number of whom are known to have suffered for months from tuberculosis.\n\nHeating and ventilation.\n\n5. The improved system of heating and the system of ventilation installed at the same time, two years ago, have given complete satisfaction. The weather was severe at the time of my visit; but the building was comfortable throughout; and the air was everywhere fresh and free from odor.\n\nCondition of dormitories.\n\n6. The dormitories, which are the most important rooms of the institution in regard to the health of the pupils, are particularly free from objection. They are large and airy, and free from nooks and irregular walls. They have abundance of light, from the east and west sides, which reaches every part. The walls and floors are in good condition; the rooms are sufficiently furnished, but there is not a superfluous article to be seen; and everything is clean according to every visual test.\n\nGeneral condition.\n\n7. So far as the efforts of the staff can avail evidently nothing more could be done in the interest of the health and well-being of the pupils. The visit of Mr. Macarthur and myself was made without the\nslightest previous intimation, and conditions throughout the building were undoubtedly normal. The most perfect state of order and cleanliness prevailed everywhere. All soiled clothing was at the laundry; clothes that required repairs was in the sewing room; and all other clothing was in perfect order on the shelves of the clothing rooms. In the dining room after each meal when the dishes are washed the tables are set for the next meal, and then each table is spread over with a cover of lawn, which protects the dishes from flies in summer and from dust at all times.\n\nMedical examination.\n\n8. I was not able to see Dr. Touchette; but his attendance at the school is entirely satisfactory to the principal and to the staff. I am also informed by the Sister Superior that his examination of pupils at admission is made with evident thoroughness and care.\n\nDr. Reid, of Prince Albert, and other physicians inform me that tubercular disease would be very slightly developed indeed if it were impossible to discover it by a careful examination of the lungs, the glands of the neck and chest, and the bones and muscles of the limbs. They agree with the suggestion that some help might be obtained in connection with the examination of pupils for admission by an inquiry into the health record of their parents and other near relations. There is no doubt that with the aid of information of this nature, which the Agent would always be able to furnish or obtain, some pupils of this and other schools would have been excluded who were admitted and died, and who during the progress of the disease no doubt helped to spread infection in the school. Such pupils may not have actually been suffering from the disease when admitted,\nbut the tendency to it was too strong.\n\nCalisthenics, etc. 9. Calisthenics and breathing exercises are practised regularly under the direction of one of the sisters who has made a study of these for the purpose. An evidence of the attention given to the matter was furnished in a series of exercises performed by the boys under the leadership of one of their own number, and a similar performance by the girls under the guidance of the Sister.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nTo be placed on file 109-1-1\nJan. 1912\nThough the Duck Lake Boarding School Buildings appear to be in an unsanitary condition, yet it is doubtful whether this defect is the chief cause of the excessive mortality at the school. The present medical attendant of the institution may be careful in his examination of candidates for admission as pupils; but if I remember rightly there have been several changes in that officer for the school since it was opened, some of whom, I fear, were not very careful in this matter. In the early days, too, when the school was in process of organization, the church authorities were very eager in canvassing for recruits, and the Indian parents more readily consented to permit their delicate children to go to the Boarding school than the stronger ones, whom they wished to retain for home work.\n\nFurther, in regard to the buildings, I do not think a few dark corners and passages, which are only momentarily occupied, are the real danger to the health of the pupils. The dormitories appear to be well lighted and ventilated; and the class-rooms also seem to be fairly satisfactory. The hospital-rooms, however, are insufficiently lighted and ventilated, and should as soon as possible be exchanged for more suitable rooms. The condition of the basement is an illustration of the unwise method school authorities usually adopted in former years of starting to build a school without proper plans. Want of funds in some cases may have led...\nled to laying insecure foundations and providing a suitable basement, a neglect which is difficult to remedy when later additions and improvements are made to the building.\n\nBut the principal cause of the unsanitary condition of the school is doubtless the want of a sufficient supply of pure water and a proper disposal of the sewage. Outside closets near the schools are a great nuisance and should be abolished as soon as possible. But in providing for the disposal of the sewage I would not discharge it into ordinary cess pools. They are now almost everywhere discarded as they saturate the earth at a depth where there is no aeration and thus often infect wells though not in their immediate vicinity. The conditions at the Duck Lake School are pretty much the same as those at the Elkhorn Industrial School, and the system of sewage disposal which is to be adopted at the latter ought to be suitable for the former school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Oliver just before going to your office, I drew his attention to the fact that the Indians around the Boarding School have made a demand on the Department to establish Day schools on their reserve, as well as Watotoe's and other small reserves. I told the Minister that if these schools were opened, it was useless to try to maintain the Boarding School, as the Indians would much better like to send their children to the Day school than to the Boarding School. I expressed also my opinion based on experience at Saddle Lake and other reserves that Day schools as a rule did not give any good results, and the Honorable Secretary answered me that he was more than myself wanted Day schools on the above mentioned reserves. Last week I heard at Dewar Falls that the Indian Agent was keeping the Indians under the impression that they could or could get Day schools if they wanted them, and as an immediate result of such conduct, the Indians refuse to send their children to the Boarding School where we have not just at present the full number of pupils. Will you please give instructions to your Agent at Dewar Falls, that we may know before making expensive improvements in the school, that we are sure of getting pupils for the same.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

After a careful survey made in my presence, Mr. Cole declared that it would be impossible to establish in the school a good system of water. The fall was too small and the pipe lines could not be built on account of the water coming from every side. In rainy seasons the whole flat south-west of the school is completely flooded. I asked this engineer to write a full report of his work and of his opinion; but so far I have not been able to obtain it. We wrote to him, tried to see him, but he is always too busy and cannot make his report. I gave orders to have at least an artesian well bored near the school, but at the time of my last visit last week Brother Babillon had not found in Prince Albert, Norburn and other places along the line, a man willing to undertake this work. I hope that this difficulty will be overcome before long, but I do not know what to do about the water works and sewer system. The Rev. Sister Superior told me last week she would prepare a plan of water closets that would remove the obnoxious state of the present state of things. I hope she will be able to do so as I hate any the present system.\n\nDo you remember the promise to send me a copy of Mr. Christie's report? I do not remember clearly enough all of his recommendations, and so I should feel any such obligation to you if you would kindly send me a copy of this report.\n\nI have ordered the windows in the infirmary which were recommended by the Inspector, to be opened promptly.\nOttawa, June 19, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided not to open a day school on Beardy's Reserve, but to allow the Duck Lake Boarding School to serve the educational needs of that locality.

In speaking of the accommodation Mr. Chisholm states that the dormitories afford between 580 and 600 cubic feet of air space for each occupant and that the class-rooms and dining-room are of correspondingly liberal dimensions. Mr. Chisholm states that the large attendance from some of the reserves, viz., Beardy's, Petaquakay's and One Arrows, is due to the fact that the population of these bands is made up to a considerable\nsiderable extent of ex-pupils of this and other residential schools and the parents who are themselves ex-pupils are so anxious to have their children enrolled that they bring them themselves to the Principal as they soon as they are eligible for admission. The school according to Mr. Chisholm's report is doing excellent work and, as they have accommodation for thirty pupils more according to Mr. Chisholm's figures, I think the Department would be quite justified in allowing them to take in twenty or twenty-five additional pupils. Mr. Chisholm states that the revenue of the school for the current year will be about $4,000 below that of the proceeding year through the failure of last year's crops.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nSept. 5th, 1917.\n\nTo the Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am by duty bound to acquaint you, and through your mediation, the Department of Indian Affairs; of certain events that have transpired at our school. Accidents of the kind must be conveyed to your knowledge.\n\nIn the spring of 1916, a few boys planned the destruction of the house by fire. The seniors surmising the mischief, routed the culprits and the plot fell through.\n\nIn the Fall of the same year, 1916, some little fellows were found in the act of setting fires. They were severely punished. At that time I intended asking the Department that I claim today; but my health impaired forbade me the accomplishment of any strenuous work; in fact I had to absent myself from home to take the rest I needed so badly.\n\nBehold! on the 28th of August at 2 O'Clock A.M., one of the staff was awakened by a crackling noise from the window. A light reflected on the church. In a moment, the alarm was given, the whole household including staff and children (106) was on foot and out of the building. We feared an explosion; the fire having been set under a window near the gas plant. The night before at about 8 O'Clock a boy had been seen lighting a match at the very spot. Caught in the act he blew on the match and probably thought it was out, but the fire had caught between the boards at the far paper making it's way slowly but surely until a light breeze fanned it to a flame.\n\nThe fire was mastered with a few pails of water. If we escaped the disaster it is through a pure providential protection of which we cannot be too thankful.\n\nYou realize, dear sir, the consequences; useless to comment.\n\nDoes it not seem just and even necessary that we should take means to protect ourselves against such attempts? It is impossible for us to proceed without the help and sanction of the Department.\n\nThis case, silent, would be tacitly encouraging the children in their criminal propensities and expose the lives of many. To send the guilty once back to the different reserves would be helping them to attain the goal; they would set fire at the first feeling of homesickness, sure beforehand of being expelled.\n\nIn my opinion such a child should be sent to jail or to a reformatory school. Such an example would prove beneficial to ourselves and other schools.\n\nAmong Indian children as among white there are characters who are not subdued, even by severe correction.\n\nOf the boys who attempted to set the fires in 1916, one alone did not repent, and he is the most guilty. Today I dread him and it is for him alone that I would beg of the Department to decide his case and prosecute as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Signed) Rev. H. Delmas, Pte. C.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nE. Pant Schmidt, Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Reverend H. Delmas, Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding school here, in which he reports upon a matter, which from a serious point of view, can hardly be surpassed.\n\nThe report is such that no comment from me is necessary. I trust however, that the Department will lose no time in advising me what steps to take in order to remove the danger that threatens the school, and the lives of those residing there.\n\nApparently the boy referred to in the last paragraph of the Principal's letter is undoubtedly in need of some punishment that would at least deter others from attempting to follow his example.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The staff turned out, and while unable to save the stack, kept the fire from spreading. The origin of the fire is unknown.\n\nOn Sunday, the 16th, at 5 p.m., one of the pupils heard what he thought was the crackling of a fire; he called other boys, and they discovered smoke coming from under the stairs in the boys recreation room. This stairs leads to the boys' Dormitory, this stairway is enclosed and the doors were locked.\n\nThe boys at once gave the alarm and the fire, which was yet small was extinguished.

As it is not for the first time that this same boy has shown such bad feelings, do you not think that some severe measures should be taken in order to prevent the recurrence of such criminal tendencies. It seems to me that this boy should be sent to some reformatory or even to jail, as if he is allowed to go free again, others may be tempted to imitate him, and by so doing endanger the lives of all the inmates of the school. The Indians themselves would understand the necessity of such punishment, as they know that if not checked such actions might imperil the lives of all their children.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the boy referred to in my letter of Oct 16th last. I have just returned from the school having been summoned there as a witness in this case. The case was tried at the school by Miss Ethel MacLachlan a Justice specially authorized by the Dominion and Provincial Authorities to deal with juvenile delinquents under the juvenile delinquents act.\n\nHarry Paul pleaded guilty admitting he had made and put it in a hole in the wall where the fire was discovered. His reasons for doing\nMEMO.\n\nSo sure that he was bad. However, the justice Miss Maclellan consented to have him in the care of the Superintendent of neglected children at Regina, for the purpose of placing him in the reformatory school at Waskesiu, for an unspecified term.\n\nShould the boy conduct be good and the principal of that institution report on him favorably, I would recommend that after a few months, that he be taken from the reformatory and placed in the Winneboujou Industrial School in Alberta.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the time of war, the newspapers carry us from time to time, the wording of new regulations; such as those issued by the Canada Food Board, with regard the flour. Bread is the vital nourishment of our children; and of it, they have never been rationed. How can we and how must we submit to such law?\n\nThen the Canada Registration Board demands that all people, male and female above the age of sixteen have to register! Our boys can help. According to the desire expressed by the Dept., in letter 150000/26, dated Feb. 19th, six four of our boys are working on the reserves and four are hired out to farmers. But our Indian girls are not fit to go out and work for white people. Experience has proved us that the Indian Girl when discharged from School, must be well taken care of and protected in a special manner until her marriage.\n\nBut could not our girls, those of the School as well as those discharged and living in the neighborhood, help to win the war? Could not the Depar send us wool with directions and they would knit socks, mitts, mufflers etc.? A slight compensation for the labor would be acceptable as a help towards the support of the School.\n\nOf course the above is a mere suggestion but could it not be realized for the benefit of our Canada & comfort of our soldiers?\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\nOur girls would then be contributing their mite to win the war.\n\nI respectfully submit the whole to your consideration.\n\nAn answer will greatly oblige me.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRev.

This school is subsidized by the Federal Government, and is only maintained thanks to the subsidies from the Federal Government, and as the French language is certainly still an official language, it has in this case the same right to be taught and spoken to the little Indians as English.\n\nWe hope that orders will rapidly be sent to this effect, and if it is otherwise, we would have to bring the matter before parliament through one of our friends.\n\nHoping for an acknowledgment, we remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nL'Association Interprovinciale\nRaymond Denis,\nSecretary.\nJuly 27th, 1916.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 4th, I have to say that it is not the policy of the Department to teach French in our Indian schools except in the Province of Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Je ne peux pas \u00eatre plus clair.\n\nLe fran\u00e7ais est une langue officielle au m\u00eame titre que l'anglais. L'argent qui est investi dans ces \u00e9coles indiennes devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour la population canadienne fran\u00e7aise tout comme pour la population de langue anglaise.

The money that maintains these Indian schools comes from various taxes levied on the French-Canadian population just as much as on the English speaking population.\n\nYour policy is, therefore, a flagrant injustice as well as being a violation of the agreement of Confederation.\n\nI ask you, therefore, in the name of the French-Canadian Associations which I represent, to kindly advise me that this policy will be modified.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRaymond Denis, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nL'Association Interprovinciale,\nVonda, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have an interesting case to put before the Department today.\n\nNo. 121 Paul Arcand has been working for a certain A. Pajot, Carlton P.O., for the past three months. While hired there, a life insurance agent accompanied by A.B. Stewart M.D. (employed by the Department) presented themselves and succeeded in making said P. Arcand take a policy. The medical examination was passed and the papers were signed when A. Pajot came in. Without reflection he writes out a check for $64.90 to pay the premium, on the insurance policy of said P. Arcand.\n\nThis accomplished, A. Pajot arrives to demand gives me the receipt of the $64.90 as a proof of the salary paid to P. Arcand. I refused it. This was of doing things being contrary to the regulations laid down by Department and against our mutual agreement.\n\nTherefore to conform myself to our regulations I exacted the full amount of the salary. Having worked 3 months and 4 days at $60.00 a month, I received of said Pajot $188.00 of which I gave to P. Arcand $133.10 keeping the $54.90 of the insurance policy. This was arranged amongst ourselves, the three interested.\n\nNow I come to the point; this is what I would like to know.\n\nIs this agreement re-insurance valid? The boy being an Indian and under 18 years.\n\nCan the Department cancel such a contract to protect the boy and turn against the Insurance Company? The doctor knew perfectly well that the boy was still under the control of the Principal of the School.\n\nTo whom must I return the $54.90? To the boy or to A. Pajot?\n\nHoping to hear from you soon; I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nThree months ago I hired as farm hand a young Indian of the Duck Lake School. In the course of that time while I was out threshing he took an insurance policy for two thousand dollars and it was only when he was examined by the doctor that I knew it. He asked me to pay for the premium as I owed him some money.\n\nI did not know just what to do nor did not like to stop him for I thought it would be a good way to make him save his money. The next day I went to Duck Lake and told Father Delmas about it and he told me that should not have paid that money without consulting him for and would not accept the receipt. I have settled Father Delmas since and paid the fifty four dollars over again.\n\nNow I would ask only one question am I entitled to the money which I paid twice if I am Father Delmas said he would return it.\n\nYours very truly, Andre Pajo.\nOttawa, 20th December, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the payment of a premium of insurance at the request of an Indian by the name of Arcand at his request, and note your enquiry as to whether this amount should not be deducted from the amount of his wages.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose a copy of a letter which has just been sent to Rev. Father Delmas setting forth the views of the Department with respect to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Andre Pajot,\nCarlton, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 20th December, 1916.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to Paul Arcand, a pupil of your school, who was working for a farmer by the name of Pajot, and note the circumstance with respect to the payment of the insurance premium and your inquiry regarding the same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if this boy had given a promissory note or other promise to the company to pay the amount of the premium it does not appear that the company could have enforced the payment, but the payment having been made it is not thought that it could be recovered from the company.\n\nSince the boy's wages were, it appears, to be paid to you Mr. Pajot should not have paid the insurance premium without your consent, and you were quite within your rights in insisting on the payment of the wages in full. However, Mr. Pajot appears to have made this payment on the boy's request and in good faith and it hardly seems fair that he should lose this amount. This insurance ensues to the benefit of the boy and as the premium was paid at his request it seems to the Department that the said sum should properly be repaid to Mr. Pajot.\n\nA copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Pajot in reply to one received from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

MICHAEL'S INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nDuck Lake,\nSask., Sept. 23rd, 1921.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI went to Regina last week to consult you concerning Duck Lake Boarding School. Unfortunately you were away and today I beg leave to state in writing the purpose of my visit.\n\nThe need of larger and more up-to-date buildings is well known to you personally, and to every officer of the Indian Department who has visited the school. During your first visit to the school three years ago you were struck by the dilapidated condition of the school.\n\nWe thought the time inopportune to ask the Department for new buildings because labor was scarce, the cost of building exorbitant, and the attention and efforts of the Government were absorbed by the all important problems of the war.\n\nNow that conditions are normal again, labour plentiful and price of building has considerably decreased, the Very Rev. Fr. Grandin, President of the Order of the Oblate Fathers, the Directors of the School, has petitioned the Department for new buildings.\n\nTo justify our request we submit to your consideration the following facts -\n\n1. The reports of the Inspectors show that since its erection in 1894, the School has a splendid record and has done excellent and efficient work.\n\n2. Since 1909 the School has been self-supporting and this is the first time we are asking for any financial assistance.\n\n3. The character of the training given by the School is shown by the number of former pupils who enlisted during the war, as well as the marked and increasing thrift and industry displayed by the pupils of the Reserves.\n\n4. The fact that the school is always full to its capacity shows that it enjoys the full confidence of the Indians.\n\nHowever, the Oblate Fathers see opportunities for more efficient work and greater assistance to the Department in training and educating Indian children, if they had an up-to-date building that would accommodate 150 pupils.\n\nMost/\nMost of the boys leave the Delmas and Onion Lake Schools at the age of fifteen or sixteen, that is before they have acquired fixed habits of work, thrift and industry. Could we receive them here we are in a position to give them a thorough training in mixed farming and domestic science.\n\nWe have 1500 acres of land for farming and stock raising. This land was bought by the Oblate Fathers for the exclusive use of the School. We have a good water supply and the farm is equipped with ample machinery and barns. All we need now, to have a first class and up-to-date Indian School, is a larger and more modern building.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers are not in a financial position to erect such buildings, this is why we are petitioning the Department for assistance.\n\nKnowing dear Sir, the special interest you take in the welfare of our Indian children, your long experience among them, and the great influence you enjoy with the Department in your capacity of Indian Commissioner, I confidently ask you to approve and recommend our request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H. Delmas.\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, copy of a letter I have received from the Rev. H. Delmas, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Boarding School, Duck Lake, pointing out the need of larger and more up-to-date school buildings at that point. These are desirable, and it is a question which should be given attention in the near future, and I beg to recommend the Reverend Principal's request to the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Octo. 10th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication which you received from Rev. H. Delmas, Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School, in which he draws attention to the need of a larger and more up-to-date school building at that point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the buildings and land in connection with this school are the property of the church authorities and it is a question whether the erection of a new building should not be carried out by them. The Department at the present time could not undertake the erection of a new building as there are no funds available for the purpose. We have an extensive building programme before us for next year and it is impossible to state at the present time, should the Department undertake the work, as to when it would be possible to provide the money necessary for the purpose. In the meantime, it is thought that the work can be carried on with the accommodation provided by the present buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 31, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nYou will remember that you placed the need for a new building at Duck Lake as of prime importance this year. I wish to have on file a definite proposal from you in this connection.\n\nWill you ascertain whether the Oblate Fathers will deed to the Department the 1500 acres of land that you own near the present site of the boarding school, if we proceed with the erection of the new plant to care for the educational requirements of the Roman Catholic Indian children of Central Saskatchewan. The Department will not place a building on property that does not belong to us. Your early attention to this matter is respectfully requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDUCK LAKE INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nRECONSTRUCTION:-This matter is again brought up for your attention in preparing the Estimates. The request was enclosed in last year's supplementary estimates and at the last moment was turned down. I do not need to lay a great stress upon the importance or rather necessity of this work. The Superintendent of Indian Education is familiar with the question and most willing to proceed with this work if there is any possible means to do so. I would refer you to the Principal's letter to Commissioner Graham, dated September 23rd, 1921, copy of which must have been sent to the Department by Mr Graham or myself. Also confer letter of Department in date of January 31st, 1922. I have visited that school during Summer and found it in a poor state. In view of those circumstances and on account of the exceptionally good results of the school I recommend most heartily the reconstruction of Duck Lake Indian Boarding School on the model of the modern schools lately erected by the Department and which are a credit for it.\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your strong recommendation has been noted and in reply I wish to assure you that the claims of this institution will not be overlooked.\n\nI am prepared to urge the Government to allow large appropriations for Indian Education, and I am hopeful that the most pressing claims will be satisfied in the very near future.\n\nI am grateful for Your Lordship's interest in our Indian wards, and I wish to offer you the Compliments of the season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. J. H. Brad'homme, D.D.,\nBishop of Prince Albert & Saskatoon,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I personally visited the Duck Lake Boarding School on the 17th of this month.\n\nThe school was scrupulously clean from basement to garret, in fact I never in all my experience with Indian work saw such a well kept home and this condition is found in the face of the fact that the building they are occupying is obsolete. There are twelve Sisters looking after the institution. There are ninety-six children on the roll, half boys and half girls.\n\nAll the butter used for these hundred children is made at the school, there are from eight to fourteen cows milking all the time and the children get an abundance of milk. About one hundred head of cattle are kept as well as eighteen work horses. They have an excellent farmer who is assisted occasionally by one of the Brothers. The school is working 470 acres of land and nearly all the work is done by the larger boys. The flour used in the institution is ground in the local mill from grain grown on the farm.\n\nThe children were very tidy and appeared to be in splendid health, they are happy and contented and the class room work that I saw was excellent and above the average of an Indian School.\n\nThe building is in such a state that I consider it would be a waste of money to make any extensive\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nrepairs, the time has arrived when the question of erecting a new school should be seriously considered, in fact I doubt very much if they can carry on much longer in the present building. I would like to see an amount placed in the Estimates this year for the erection of a school at this point next year.\n\nThe children here do all the washing and baking of the bread by hand. I wish the Department to take particular note of this as I consider it is very important that the girls leaving school should have a knowledge of washing in tubs and how to bake bread.\n\nThe farming done is excellent and the oats this year ran close to 100 bushels to the acre and the wheat over 30.\n\nNearly all the clothes used in the institution are made by hand and hundreds of garments have been made from old worn clothes shipped from the warehouse here from time to time, stuff that would be considered junk. I saw stockings and mitts that had been made from the wool balaclavas, the wool having been unravelled and re-knit into these articles. Nothing is wasted here.\n\nThe Department have an institution at Duck Lake that they might well be proud of and the Principal, Father Delmas, is alert, business like, turning out good material and deserves encouragement. If he can do the work he is doing with the handicap he is now under, he certainly will do a great deal better with a modern building to carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Grant was paid for the first time during the fiscal year 1894-5. In 1906-7 the Church Authorities spent about $10,000 on plant.\n\nIn 1911 there was a change in status. The Church was given title to the 100 acres on which the institution was built - the consideration to the Crown being $500. The land which the Department sold to the Oblate Fathers for this sum was L.S. 3 and 4 and W. & L.S. 2 of Sec. 4 T. 24 R. 2 W. 3rd. The authority for this transfer was P.C. No. 991 dated May 10, 1911. Of course the State equity in the buildings was transferred at this time. A total capital expenditure of $20,775 had been made by the Department at this time.\n\nFor 12 years the Duck Lake Residential School has been church-owned and has received the grant for that type of institution. Only $315 has been spent on plant by this Department in this time. Our total capital expense since the start of the school has been $21,091.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers are now requesting the Department to purchase the outlying land of 700 acres. The main building is worth nothing and the only valuable structure is the horse stable, which is but two years old. The farm equipment and stock are also of considerable value. Some 300 acres owned by the Oblates at or near this school is cultivated. It is understood that this cultivated land is on the 700 acres which they propose to sell to the Department.\n\nIt should be noted that in 1894, when the Department secured the 100 acres on which the buildings were erected, the Church received as a consideration some 320 acres worth roughly $960, by the authority of P.C. No. 345 dated February 22, 1897.\n\nConsidering our $21,091.00 capital expense, the Church should allow for barn, small buildings, stock. We might purchase the 700 acres at a nominal price, say $10 per acre.\n\nR.V.B.\nOTTAWA, Ont., January 18th, 1924.\n\nMr Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the rebuilding of Duck Lake Indian Boarding School I take the liberty of bringing the following propositions before the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWHEREAS the Department of Indian Affairs intends to build at its own expense a large residential school to cope with the present situation of the Western Provinces and also with the advanced state of civilization of the Indians of the said Provinces;\n\nWHEREAS in the past as also in the present the success of the Duck Lake Indian Boarding School has been achieved mainly through urging the Indians to develop the industries of their country, viz: agriculture, gardening and stock raising;\n\nWHEREAS the Corporation of the Oblate Fathers will not and cannot bind itself for an indefinite time to keep for the use of the school the 700 acres that it possesses and which have been exclusively used for the purposes above mentioned;\n\nWHEREAS the said land is absolutely necessary for the ends we have in view in carrying on our work with the Indian population:\n\nThe undersigned in the name of the Corporation of the Oblate Fathers respectfully requests from the Department to purchase from the said Corporation the 700 acres of land presently utilized for the school with the following buildings and chattels situated thereon; Granary, horse stable (entirely new and modern with accommodation for 20 horses), carpenter's shop, blacksmith's shop, 2 artesian wells (for the inmates and the stock), concrete septic tank (modern and most up to date), concrete cellars of the present buildings (to be used as vegetable cellars), all the farm implements and machinery, horses and cattle, all the beds and bedding in good order, school desks, chairs and teachers' desks.\n\nHOWEVER lo-The Corporation of the Oblate Fathers would reserve the right to keep on the above offered property the present graveyard which could be enlarged if necessity would require it and a parochial church for the exclusive use of the Indians living on the neighboring reserves,\n\n2o-The Corporation of the Oblate Fathers would reserve the right to take down, sell or remove the present buildings which will not become the property of the Department.\n\nI leave the above propositions to your judicious attention with the hope of a favorable consideration.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 2, 1924.\n\nDear Father Delmas:\n\nI have given careful consideration to your letter of January 18th, with reference to the transfer to the Crown of the property at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. This question has been discussed with the Very Rev. Father Blanchin and Father Guy and I am now writing to ask you to secure from the Oblate Fathers a definite proposal which I can place before the Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nPrior to 1911, when the institution with 100 acres was transferred to the Oblate Fathers for a nominal consideration, the Department expended more than $20,000 for buildings and equipment. I propose that you offer the site of the school comprising 100 acres, the outbuildings, stock and equipment, on condition that the Department arranges at the first opportunity for an appropriation to purchase from the Oblate Fathers the remainder of the farm, some 600 acres, at a fair price.\n\nIf this proposition commends itself to you and to Father Blanchin, I shall be pleased for an early reply so that work on the new building may commence as soon as possible. The price for the 600 acres should be mentioned, and during your deliberations in this connection I request you to keep in mind that the school has grown in size and value in the past 30 years, during which time the institution was largely financed by per capita grants from parliamentary appropriation. I consider that the 600 acre farm should be offered to the Crown for a very reasonable price.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Delmas, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOBLATE FATHERS,\nProvincial House,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\n\nApril 16th - 1924.\n\nFile No 109-1-1\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter April 2nd, addressed to Rev. Father Delmas, in connection with the transfer to the Crown of some property at the Duck Lake Indian Residence School.\n\nAfter lengthy and careful discussion, the Directors of our Corporation have agreed to sell the 100 acres, the outbuildings, stock and equipment, at the nominal price of ten dollars per acre. And we consider this price nominal, for the reason that the outbuildings, all in good condition, comprise the following, viz:\nGranery: $2500.00, Horse Barn: $3500.00, Two Shops: $2000.00, Two wells: $2000.00. - The Life Stock and Equipment figured at $10,000.00, are put down at a very moderate figure. The Farm Equipment is not inferior to any on the new Industrial Schools. - Moreover, 80 of these 100 acres are located inside the Town limits, and should be worth at least $100.00 per acre.\n\nIn your letter you state that prior to 1911, the Department expended more than $20,000.00 for buildings and equipment. True, but all this expenditure was made in the interests of the indian children, and the Oblate Fathers have in no way profitted by this expenditure. And in this respect we might perhaps surprise the Department in stating that since 1911 the Oblate Fathers have contributed to the Duck Lake Indian School to the extent of the following improvements, absolutely necessary, Well: $1000.00, Pump and Tanks: $1500.00, Septic Tank: $2600.00, Plumbing installation: $4500.00, Electric Light Plant: $2500.00, Concrete Cellar: $3000.00, Granary: $2500.00 New Horse Stable: $3500.00, Repairs to House and Shop: $4000.00. - All this expenditure was made by us solely for the furtherance of the progress of the Institution, and for the benefit of the Indians. The Indian Department has profitted by it, and the Oblate Fathers have received no financial profit from this large investment. We have never hesitated substantially to support the Principal, Rev. Fr. Delmas, who, as you are aware, has done great work for your Department in the Duck Lake Indian School. In fact, for several years, we have backed the Principal, while he had to face an annual deficit, which however in the latter years has been somewhat reduced.\n\nWith regard\nWith regards the all fenced, 600 acres, more or less, to be acquired for the farm of the School, and of which 450 acres are broken and under cultivation, the Directors of our Corporation have decided to place the selling price thereon of $50.00 per acre, which they consider very reasonable.\n\nIn your letter you state that we should keep in mind that the school farm grew in size and in value in the past 30 years, during which time the Institution was largely financed by the per capita grants from Parliamentary appropriation. As you know undoubtedly, the per capita grant is principally spent on tuition, board, clothing of children, salaries of employees, and ordinary expenses of the house.\n\nHere also we might volunteer the information that if the School farm did grow in size and value, if the farm work was extended and the advanced pupils were given the opportunity of acquiring the varied means of farming and stock-raising and the running of machinery, it was and is mainly due to the fact that the Oblate Fathers have put at the disposal of the School a very large tract of land.\n\nMoreover, since 1917, the Oblate Fathers have invested over $22,000.00 into farm land which also has been put to the same use; they have financed the purchase of machinery and implements, and not later than last fall the purchase of a complete new threshing outfit.\n\nIn all this we have acted with the sole object of making a real success of the Duck Lake School, in the interests of the Indian Department, but with the hopes, nevertheless, that in some future time we should be reimbursed for the moneys thus spent and placed on farm land put at the disposal of that Institution.\n\nTherefore, in connection with the price of fifty dollars per acre, if an official evaluator would consider it a little high, which we doubt, the foregoing explanation should go a long way to convince any one that, in the purchase of this particular land and at the stated price, the Department is granting no favor to the Oblate Fathers, but is getting very good value for its money.\n\nIt must be well understood, also, that the Oblate Fathers will transfer to the Crown the 100 acres afore-mentioned, with out-buildings, life-stock and equipment, on condition only that the Department will agree, by a document to that effect, to buy the other 600 acres, more or less, for the school farm, and at a fixed price; the latter will be paid to us, in the first opportunity, when the Dept. will have the discretionary appropriation.\n\nAnd in this respect it would be expedient to have your decision as soon as possible, so that we might avoid the paying of the Taxes either to the Town or to the Municipality, at least for part of the current year, by the fact that we can claim that the land has been transferred or considered as sold by Agreement of Sale to the Crown.\n\nWe might here also make reference to two items mentioned in the letter of Rev. Father Delmas, dated January the 18th, 1924, namely:\n\nTo The Oblate\n19. The Oblate Fathers would have the right to keep on the above offered property the present graveyard, to be enlarged as necessity requires it, and to be used only for the Indian pupils and Indians of the neighboring Reserve.\n\nAs for the Church, you are no doubt aware that we have here a large structure, which accommodates the ex-pupils, the parents of the present pupils and the Indians of the Duck Lake Reserve for all religious services. This Church may have to be removed to another location and to be improved; this would be done at our expense. But some 4 acres ought to be reserved for that purpose and the transfer of same made out in the name of the Church authority.\n\n20. The Oblate Fathers reserve to themselves the right to take down, remove, sell or dispose in any way whatsoever the present old main building and all its contents, except school desks, school books, school material, and the whole of the Pharmacy, which are the property of the Department.\n\nWe hope that the Department will find that we are very fair in our propositions, realizing that our intention is to continue cooperating with it for the further success of the Duck Lake Indian School.\n\nWe also trust that nothing shall interfere with the early commencement of the building of the proposed new School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nOBLATE FATHERS,\nper A. Haussen, a.m.j.\nProcurator.\n\nFather Guy makes a correction - delete 4 acres + substitute therefor 1 acre.\nMay 9, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIn the Estimates for Indian Education there is an item for $150,000 for the erection of a new main building at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, south of Prince Albert, Sask. The Oblate Fathers have title to the 700 acres which have been used in conjunction with the school for some years and which are necessary for its satisfactory conduct in the future.\n\nI have had an interview with the Provincial Head of the Order and have been corresponding with him, with a view to the transfer of this farm to the Crown. The Oblate Fathers have now made a definite proposal, which is in brief that the Department purchase, before building operations, 100 acres which is the site of the buildings, at a nominal price of $10 per acre and agree to the purchase of the other 600 acres of the property at $50 an acre, as soon as the necessary appropriation can be provided.\n\nPrior to 1911, when the institution with 100 acres was transferred from the Crown to the Oblate Fathers for a nominal consideration, the Department expended more than $20,000 for buildings and equipment. During the 30 years that this school has been in operation, the school farm grew in size and value while the institution was largely financed by per capita grants from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nAs the Department has been associated with the Oblate Fathers in the capital and current expenses for many years, I consider that the 600 acre farm should be offered the Crown at a more reasonable price. I should be pleased to have your instructions, so that I may reply to the Provincial Head's proposal.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nHonorable C. Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nWe are informed by The Rev. Father J. Guy, O.M.I., that you are not in favor of paying fifty dollars an acre for the farm land, with equipment and live-stock, in connection with the Indian Residential School at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe very much regret to see that the Department does not seem fully to consider the bearing of our arguments set forth in our letter dated the 19th of April last. In our estimation the Department does not appear to recognize all the sacrifices the Oblate Fathers have made for the Duck Lake Indian School, both in actual money and improvements, causing us to be burdened, for years, with a substantial deficit, which we undertook in carrying on the work for the Indian Education, the success of which stands to-day to the credit and honor of the Indian Department. We would naturally look for a little recognition and appreciation, let alone compensation.\n\nThe matter is not one of real-estate dealing, if everything is taken into consideration, for in the purchase price are included, we repeat, all the equipment, live-stock, etc. We have it from very good authority that the Department paid seventy-two and a half dollars per acre for land at the Methodist Indian School, Edmonton; and that still a higher price is demanded for any additional land, and this without any equipment or stock, or other improvement than the cultivated land.\n\nHowever, Honorable Sir, we are willing to cooperate with the Department and prove that this is not a hold-up or a matter of taking advantage of; for we still consider that the price set by us is indeed very reasonable. Therefore we will suggest the following proposition, viz:\n\n- 160 Acres, for School site, at the nominal price of $10.00 per acre.\n- 297 Acres at $45.00 per acre; this acreage can be seen on a map left by Rev. Fr. Delmas with Mr. Orr, the Architect, viz:\n  - 20 acres immediately west of the Railway,\n  - 48 acres, east of the Railway,\n  - 13 acres, Parcel C,\n  - 13 acres, Parcel B,\n  - 203 acres, Parcel A.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nVERY POOR COPY\nThis offer would include all the equipment, farm machinery, and live-stock. But on the condition that the Department will pledge to purchase the Half of Section 33, at the price of fifty dollars per acre, at some future time, say in two or three years. Even if the total sum for the 297 acres cannot be paid in this year, it may be divided into two or three subsequent annual payments.\n\nMoreover, Honorable Sir, we might here remind you that our previous offer for the one hundred acres at ten dollars per acre, was made by us conditionally, viz., the purchase of the other six hundred acres. Also the clauses re Cemetery and site for the Church building remain.\n\nHoping that you will deign to give this matter a more favorable consideration and see it in the light in which we have endeavored to expose it,\n\nWe beg to remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nOBELATE FATHERS,\n\nper A.

Schmitz, Principal\nJune 20, 1925.\n\nDear Father Delmas,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of an invitation to be present at the formal opening of the new Duck Lake Indian Residential School on the 15th of July, for which I thank you.\n\nI should be delighted to be present at the opening of the new school, but regret that it will not be possible for me to be there.\n\nI note with pleasure that you refer to the united efforts of this Department and the distinguished Order to which you belong. I beg to assure you that since I first visited this school many years ago, I had resolved to recommend the erection of a building befitting the quality of the work carried on there. I have been ably seconded in my efforts by the representative in Ottawa of your Order, Reverend Father Guy. Our present Minister, the Honourable Charles Stewart, has cordially supported these recommendations, and to him must be assigned the full credit of obtaining Parliamentary Appropriations which were necessary to carry on the work.\n\nI trust that the Staff will enjoy their new quarters, and that you may be highly successful as you have been in the past.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Mr. Melancon has asked for information regarding the Indian School at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, and we have advised him that his request in this connection is being referred to your office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. D.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 12th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Director of the Natural Resources Intelligence Service, Department of the Interior, has informed me of your request for information regarding the Indian Residential School at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan. This institution is one of seventy-six boarding schools for Canadian Indian children. Day Schools have proven more or less unsatisfactory in the Prairie Provinces and a large number of Residential Schools, of which Duck Lake is one, have been established in the West by either this Department or by one of the Churches that are interested in the evangelizing and education of our Native peoples.\n\nIn 1892 the Department of Indian Affairs, at the request of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, commenced the erection of a boarding school at Duck Lake. It was intended to give Indian boys and girls an academic education and some vocational training. The classroom activity corresponds largely to the Public School course of studies. Boys receive training in farming, gardening, the care of stock and the handling of carpentry and other tools. Girls secure a training in domestic duties.\n\nIn 1894 the school was opened with the reception of pupils - approximately thirty being enrolled the first year. The Department, from the appropriation for Indian education, provided not only the capital expenses attendant upon the establishment of the institution but paid the management, which was entrusted to the Oblate Order, a per capita grant for current expenses.\n\nClaude Malencon, Esq.,\nLegislative Representative,\nCanadian National Railways,\nMontreal, P.Q.\n\nSince...........\nFrom\n\nSince the commencement of this School to the present date the Department and the Oblate Order have been associated in its management and finance. Last year parliamentary appropriation provided for the erection of a modern main building which has accommodation for some two hundred pupils. This replacement of old and worn out buildings will permit the management to enter upon a new era of much usefulness to the youth of the Central Saskatchewan Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Le Chevallier O.M.I. to be acting principal of St Michael's Indian School in Duck Lake, during the absence of Rev. Father H.

Father J. Le Chevallier, O.M.I., who will act as principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School during the absence of the Rev. Father Delmas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Scott, esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I beg as a favour from you to let my assistant, Rev. J. Le Chevallier, go through the files of the Dept. at Ottawa in order to gather a few data covering the early history of Duck Lake's school. Our old diary for that period is missing (or perhaps was never kept). As we are trying to reconstitute the facts as accurately as possible, I shall send him to Ottawa for that purpose, if you deem it permissible. I know him to be a competent hand for such a work & very much interested in everything pertaining to local history & folk-lore. He was already a great help to me by establishing the genealogical records of all the Indian Families placed under my care.\n\nYours very truly\n\nRev. H. Selmes\nprincipal\nJanuary 31, 1928.\n\nDear Father Delmas:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to Father Chevallier's study of the early history of the Duck Lake School. If he plans to come East, I shall be very glad to let him examine our official files which, I find, date from 1892.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Delmas, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 1943.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: April 2nd 1943\n\nIndian Residential School\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended December 1943.\n\nPrincipal: J. W. Latimer\n\nDated January 2nd 1944 Indian Residential School\n\nDuck Lake Sask.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nResp.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper place.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake I. R. School for the Quarter ended March 1944.\n\nPrincipal: J. W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School School for the Quarter DUCK LAKE, SASK.\n\nended June 30th 1944\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 1st 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nthis July 11th 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 10th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this JAN 8 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended March 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 5th 1945\n\nIndian Residential School\n\nDUCK LAKE, SASK.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR 13 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended June 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 1st 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1946.

pupils during Quarter**: 17802\n\n**ALLOWED 17802 @ $2.50 = $4450.00**\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter**: $4450.00\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended September 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 4, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCT 8 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended March 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 16th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APRIL 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFomx No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 7th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IJA. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended December 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 29 1947\n\nIndian Residential School\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFond No. IPA 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Michael's School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 7, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 386             | Louis Prosper   | 16  | 1   |     | One Arrow       | 1 1           | Farm, Woodwork   | Sep 22-37             | Sep 22-37                 | 92 -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended September 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. G. M. Labine\n\nDated: October 7, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended June 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 14th, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 391             | Harris Wichihin     | 16  | 1   |      | Sturgeon L.    | Farm., Woodwork          | 280 Apr.12/38               | 91         | Would like to keep on his studies                                                               |\n| 395             | Albert Seenokeesick | 15  | 1   |      | One Arrow      | Farm., Woodwork          | 280 Sep.1/38               | 91         |                                                                                                  |\n| 498             | Marcel Bear         | 16  | 1   |      | Mis'awasis     | Farm., Woodwork          | 190 Sep.1/38               | 91         | To be discharged June 30                                                                        |\n| 400             | Narcisse Lafond     | 15  | 1   |      | Petaquakey     | Farm., Woodwork          | 190 Sep.1/38               | 91         |                                                                                                  |\n| 402             | Alex Greyeyes       | 16  | 1   |      |                | Farm., Woodwork          | 280 Dec.5/38               | 91         | Would like to keep on his studies                                                               |\n| 410             | J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended March 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 10th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated APR 12 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n| CRITIAL | P.A. | DATE | INITIALS | REFERRED TO | FOR REMARKS | INITIALS | DATE |\n|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|------|\n| EX'D.   |      |      |          |             |             |          |      |\n\n(If purpose for which referred cannot be expressed in one line, add minute to file, and enter here \"With Minute\")\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita rate. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated OCT 9, 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended December 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 29, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at this January 3, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 20th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Dick Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. G.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. G. Chown\n\nDated: Oct. 21, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nV. L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended Dec., 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 1, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Indian Agency,\nDuck Lake, Sask.,\n\nThe Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School when completing the March Quarterly Return claimed eighty-three days grant for pupil # 097 Della Bird. He further stated in the Remarks Column as follows: \"Gone home to help sick parent\". He has neglected to indicate the dates when the pupil left residence and later returned and no indication is given that this girl has attended class during the quarter.\n\nPlease advise as soon as possible when this girl left the Duck Lake Indian Residential School to help her parents and if she has returned to school please advise the date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at INDIAN AGENCY APR 9 1952 this BUCK LAKE, SASK. 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND ON RESERVE | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Duck Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 2nd 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: JUL 8 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0602            | Edna Omani           | 13  | 1   |      | Wapatoon      | Sew.Cook.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 5, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCT 6, 1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\nSEE CURRENT VOLUME\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 652-2 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT QUARTERLY RETURNS\nDUCK LAKE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM JUNE 1949 TO DEC 1952\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 109/23-26-652 VOLUME 1\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6305)\n\nFile 652-1, part 1\nDuck Lake Agency - Duck Lake Residential School - General Administration (Map, plan)\n1892 - 1898, 1901 - 1929\n\nFile 652-2, part 1\nDuck Lake Agency - Duck Lake Residential School - Admissions & Discharges. 1943 - 1949\n\nFile 652-2, part 2\nDuck Lake Agency - Duck Lake Residential School - Admissions & Discharges. 1949 - 1952\n\nFile 652-5, part 1\nDuck Lake Agency - Duck Lake Residential School - Establishment - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1894\n\nFile 652-5, part 2\nDuck Lake Agency - Duck Lake Residential School - Establishment - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1924 - 1925\nIndian Commissioner,\nNorth-West Territories.\n\nRegina, Oct. 27, 1893.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose you\n\nVouchers duly approved in favour of\n\nfor $10.00\n\nand request that a cheque in payment of same be sent\n\nand this office advised at your convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy of\nthe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nN.B.\u2014Cheque to be made payable to\n\nVouchers No.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In case either party refuses or neglects to appoint an arbitrator within two weeks of his being notified to do so, the Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories shall appoint one for him.\n\nSEVENTH. All figured or written dimensions on drawings or specifications to supersede the measurement by scale.\n\nEIGHTH. The Proprietor will not in any manner be answerable or accountable for any loss or damage by fire or otherwise that shall happen or may happen to the said works, or any part or parts thereof, or for any of the materials or other things used and employed in finishing and completing the said works, or for injury to any person or persons, either workmen or the public, or for damage to adjoining property from any cause which might have been prevented by the Contractor or his workmen or anyone employed by him, against all which injuries and damages to persons or property the Contractor having control over such work must properly guard against and make good all damage, from whatever cause, by fire or otherwise, being strictly responsible for the same.\n\nNINTH. The Proprietor shall insure the building from time to time to the extent of at least two-thirds of its value during the course of erection, the amount of the premium to be assessed pro rata on the several trades, and in case the Proprietor should not insure, he will be required to run all risks of loss so far as regards the value of the works.\n\nTENTH. All work and material as delivered on the premises, to form part of the works, are to be considered the property of the Proprietor, and are not to be removed without his consent; but the Contractor shall have the right to remove all surplus material after he has completed the works herein contracted for.\n\nELEVENTH.

Should any work be delayed beyond the time mentioned in this Agreement by the inclemency of the weather, or by reason of general strikes of a particular trade, the Contractor shall have full power to extend the time for the completion of the works, making a just and reasonable extension for that purpose.\n\nTHIRTEENTH. The Proprietor is not to be responsible to any Contractor for the non-completion of a prior Contractor's work, or any particular portion thereof, at the time named, but in case a Contractor is unable to get possession on account of the failure of a prior Contractor to complete his work within the time limited in his Contract, such subsequent Contractor shall be entitled to have for the completion of his Contract such additional time as the Proprietor may deem necessary or just, and such extended time shall be substituted for the time for completion named in this Contract.\n\nFOURTEENTH.

This brick will be put in at the same price as the common clay and willing to send sample.\n\nTrusting that you will do what you can for us,- The writer also saw the Honourable Charles Stewart this morning, and he referred me to Mr. Orr, telling me to call on him right away.\n\nThanking you for this, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Wilson, who is the owner of the Saskatoon Brick and Supply Company, has manufactured sand-lime bricks\u2014white, red, buff and other colors.\n\nWe have used this brick for inside work in a good many of the buildings in the City of Saskatoon, especially school buildings and they have some of the best school buildings in our Province. We also used it for inside work for our Normal School in Saskatoon and I understand they have sold twenty-four million bricks in Saskatoon and the surrounding country, in the last fifteen years.\n\nI notice you intend building an Indian School at Duck Lake and that you specify clay bricks for inside work. Now this brick is just as good as any clay brick and in fact we have found it better. I do not know whether this comes under your Department or not and it may come under the Indian Department but I wish you would take the matter up and allow your contractor to use the sand-lime brick\u2014provided it is as cheap and as good as the clay product. We are building a Sanatorium at Saskatoon and we are allowing them to use the sand lime brick for the inside work. Anything you can do for Mr. Wilson I will appreciate very much.\n\nI understand the contractor who tendered the lowest on this school building, is the same contractor who tendered on our Sanatorium at Saskatoon and who is building same\u2014Smith Brothers and Wilson. They are one of the leading contractors in the Province and they built a lot of the University Buildings in Saskatoon.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMinister.\n\nDr. King,\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nTransferred to the Deputy Superintendent General Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nJune 21, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. McNab:\n\nI have yours of the 18th instant recommending that the brick required in connection with the erection of an Indian School at Duck Lake be obtained from Mr. J.

Some of the buildings have been up for years and bricks have stood up extremely well.\n\nWe might say this is a Saskatchewan product and is equal to any other Saskatchewan clay brick.\n\nYou will note what we said in our wire regarding sand lime brick as manufactured by the Saskatoon Brick & Supply Company. They are a good brick. We would have no hesitation whatever in using these in the interior. We consider, however, the Prince Albert Brick would stand up better for exterior work.\n\nYou will also note how anxious we are to receive instructions to proceed. We do so want to place our orders\nfor materials, as it is possible that in some lines, especially lumber, prices may advance.

To date only one payment has been made on the contract. Inspector Teillon was instructed to send fortnightly reports to the Department through your office on the progress of the work. The certificates, for payment on the contract will, of course be forwarded direct to the Department by the contractors, but I will instruct the Inspector to advise you when he is issuing a certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nYou must be anxious to find out how the construction of our new building is progressing. Everything is going on well. The material has been arriving on time. There is no want of men for the work. Mr. Adrian Taillon does his duty in a conscientious manner, and Smith Bros., finding him to be a man who thoroughly understands his trade, respect him and follow his ideas.\n\nAfter serious consideration and after having consulted with Mr. Taillon and the Smith Bros., the following are a few suggestions which I would like to submit to your good judgment.\n\n1. - (water system) In order to make sure of having a sufficient quantity of water, I would ask you, dear Mr. Orr, to grant that our pressure tanks be temporarily placed in the garage so that the water from well no.1 be taken to these tanks as specified. I believe that the pump and engine which we use every day are in sufficiently good order to continue this work. Only the air pipes from the old building to the new, for which no provision was made in the specifications, will be required.\n\nI would also ask that water be taken from well no.2, as this water is of superior quality, clearer, softer, and in sufficient quantity. It is the water from this well which the contractors are using for the cement and mortar; the small pump has been kept constantly going for 10 hrs. per day and the water has not given out. This water when once boiled is like rain water, and scales made on the pipes are soft while the scales of no.1 well are as hard as stone.\n\n2. - For this purpose there is needed a brick house of 12'x14' large enough for an electric motor water pump and air pump. A 2 H.P. electric power should be placed in order to give an automatic supply of water.\n\n3. - Outside stairs from and to the chapel are necessary for Indians who come from the reserves.\n\n4. - We are also in need of a cistern for soft water outside the house. Our soil does not permit to dig down more than 9 ft., as at that depth we strike quick sand which caves in. To have a large supply of soft water for boilers, washing engines this cistern should be 24 ft. in diameter and should be connected with the metallic soft water tank specified in the plan.\n\n5. - Stairs that lead from the gallery to the chapel were forgotten in the plans. They are absolutely necessary so that the sisters and girls may enter the chapel and depart by this gallery.\n\n6. - I would recommend a cork floor for the kitchen and scullery, in order that the fatigue of those working in these departments may be lessened.\n\n7. - I would likewise ask for a gallery on the west side of the building (at the 1st.floor) for the use of the weak or sick sisters and children. This should be inclosed with sliding windows and screens.\n\n8. - In order to deaden the noise of the house, we would be very grateful to you, if we could be permitted to place one thickness of deafening paper between the rough and the finishing floor instead of building paper as specified.\n\nWe need also a reducing pression valve for our tanks.\n\nPlease find inclosed a detailed statement of the cost of these extras. As the season is quite advance an early answer would greatly oblige us.\n\nI sincerely hope, dear Mr. Orr, that you will not refuse our request, so that the construction of this new building will be a real credit to your department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev.

My first quotation was for a 520 ampere hour globelite storage battery and though it is capable of handling this load it would not last as long as the type E-13 Manchester Chloride if you decide to install the water pressure system which I have been asked to quote to you as the motor which is started and stopped by an automatic switch take a strong current each time it starts and therefor requires a battery with a very strong positive plate. This you will find was the trouble with the battery at Punnichy which warped the plates and started discharging. The difference of cost would be Six Hundred and Forty Nine Dollars $649.00. This would make the total plant installed Five Thousand One Hundred and Forty Nine Dollars $5149.00. The quickest delivery on this battery would be seven weeks from receipt of order at factory. The total weight of this battery would be 11500 lbs against the Globelite at 5000 lbs.\nI have also made a sketch of proposed lay out so as to have a straight belt feed for the laundry plant and also to have the electrical end close together. I trust this information will be satisfactory to you and that I may be entrusted with this work which I will install myself and promise to give you entire satisfaction.\nI may say if I am given this work I have promised Father Delmas to take his man who is to work this plant and learn him everything necessary.\n\nI beg to remain Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOR SERVICE AND FIRST CLASS WORK - PHONE 5944\nMATTHEW WYLIE\nELECTRICAL ENGINEER\n\n2631 RETALLACK STREET\nREGINA, SASK.

They, together with Inspector Taillon, have prepared a list of what they wish to have. If fixtures are installed in accordance with this list, they would cost the sum of Eleven Hundred and Ninety-three Dollars ($1193.00). Our Electrician further says as an alternative estimate, he would install fixtures making the following alterations: - Using #2727 5-light fixtures and #3007 1-light brackets in place of #2927 and #6895 4-light fixtures, and #6894 brackets; also install all fixtures with 40-watt clear lamps instead of frosted. This would cost the sum of Nine Hundred and Seventy-nine Dollars and Sixty Cents ($979.60). The Electrician says he is sure this will give ample light.\n\nMr. Millon, your Inspector, has also approved a list of extras as follows: - 2 lights and switch in sub-cellar; 2 switches in basement dining room; 1 plug in pharmacy and 1 extra push in staff-room of top floor for songs. This would cost the sum of Fifty-four Dollars ($54.00).\n\nYou will also remember $46.00 of the amount allowed for fixtures has already been charged against that account, as per your letter of August 7th.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith the list of fixtures which Father Delmas and Inspector Taillon have O.K.'d, together with cuts, for your consideration, and would be pleased to hear from you as early as you possibly can as to what your decision is regarding the whole matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.\nper\n\nL/B.

A.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to some items in connection with the building of the new school at the above Institution.\n\n1. PLAN OF ROOF. - I herewith enclose a drawing, showing sketch No 1, as per your Plan; and sketch No 2, as per suggestion of the Contractors, Smith Bros. & Wilson. The Contractors pretend that by following your Plan they cannot make a good job and will not guarantee same. You will note that on their Plan they leave out 3 leadings, and thereby save a lot of material and labor.\n\nIn my opinion your Plan is perfectly workable, and moreover will give a better and nearer drainage.\n\n2. PLASTERING.- The Contractors intend to start the plastering of the walls before the roof is completed. I think this should not be done, as in case of rain, the plaster would be greatly damaged.\n\n3. PARTITIONS: Walls between Wash-room and Recreation-room in Basement. The specifications do not mention whether these walls should be built with bricks or tiles.-I would suggest that bricks be used, and that this should be insisted upon by the Architect.\n\nAs these different works will be started in a few days, and as the Contractors might not accept my orders very readily, I would ask you to give me your instructions on the above matters by telegram.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:-\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Girdlestone, electrical supply agent in Winnipeg, enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to him on the 25th ultimo, in which he was instructed by you to communicate with me with reference to the lighting plant for the Duck Lake School.\n\nI have had no information whatever from the Department regarding this. Is it your desire that I go into this matter with electrical supply companies in this city, or what do you wish me to do?\n\nI may say that I have had no directions regarding the St. Paul's School on the Blood Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my semi-monthly report on the construction of the new school at Duck Lake.\n\nBRICK-WORK. All the exterior walls are completed up to the roof. The frame work on the roof can be proceeded with at any time. In fact the roof should be put on before any plastering of the walls be started.\n\nWOOD-WORK. The roof over the Chapel will be completed in a few days.-The wooden partitions in the Basement and Ground Floor are all up.\n\nWATER SYSTEM. The supply pipes all are laid in the trenches from the well to the building, and a number of the water and soil pipes have already been placed in the building itself.\n\nSTEAM HEATING. The two boilers, though set in their places, have not yet been lowered to their respective footings.-The main pipes in the Basement have been installed.\n\nMATERIAL on the grounds.-White enamelled bricks,-tiles,-and lumber for the roof,-roofing paper and pitch,-Fire Escapes,-steam and water pipes.Two cars of plaster have been delivered.\n\nREMARKS.I have had considerable trouble with the Contractors. On several occasions I have found that the general contractor is not very willing to comply with my instructions or advices when I try to interpret and follow the Plans and Specifications to the best of my knowledge and for the interests of the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1924.\n\nA. Teillon, Esq.,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nReference letter fifteenth instant roof drainage to be as shown on plans. No plastering work to be done before roof is completed.

Reference my nightlettergram twentieth brick forwarded by you not same quality as sample submitted by contractors and will not be accepted.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\n\nChm. D.I.A.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to say that the Principal of the Duck Lake School has taken up with the plumbing contractors, N. B. Roantree & Company, the question of installing electric fans in the laundry. Is it your intention that fans of this nature should be installed? I do not think they are necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nD. D. Smith, Esq.,\nSmith Bros. & Wilson, Ltd.,\nDUCK LAKE, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nRegarding extra work according to letter dated Aug. 1st, the following prices will govern:\n\n1. - Supply 2\" Galvanized Water Line from Well No. 2 to the Boiler Room, assuming approximately 420 feet, $588.00. Price does not include any work on tanks or air line.\n\n2. - Construct Brick Pump House 12'x14' with concrete footings, concrete floor, 8\" brick walls with gable-ended roof, gables in brick and the roof constructed of 2x4, shiplap and shingles, the building complete with two windows and one door, with all the outside millwork painted three coats, the sum of $525.00.\n\n3. - Construct a set of plank steps from the grade to the chapel corridor, painted three coats, for the sum of $40.00.\n\n4. - Construct Concrete Cistern 24' inside diameter inside, the whole of the work to be in reinforced concrete as per the enclosed drawing, for the sum of $1450.00. This price does not include any piping to or from the tank for the rainwater intake or the overflow to the sewer.\n\nThe following prices are for pipe installed and fittings installed, not including any digging or back-filling:\n\n- 4\" Galv. Iron Pipe. $1.90 per foot.\n- 4\" Elbows. $3.25 each.\n- 6\" Pipe. $3.00 per foot.\n- 6\" Elbows. $6.50 each.\n- 6\" Cast Iron Sewer Pipe. $2.15 per foot.\n- 6\" Bends. $3.75 each.\n\n5. - To construct Stairs inside the Chapel from the Chapel Floor to the Gallery, all to be constructed in B. C. Fir complete with newels, handrail and balusters, and a balustrade around the well-hole on the gallery floor, including the necessary staining and varnishing, for the sum of $110.00.\nSmith Bros. & Wilson, Limited\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS\n1420 EIGHTH AVE.\nRegina, Sask.\n\nD.D. Smith. (2).\n\n6. - To supply and install AA Battleship Cork Linoleum to the Kitchen and Scullery, cemented to the floor, for the sum of $248.00.\n\n7. - To install two Galleries on the first floor, each approximately 10'x30', and to have entrance doors on to the corridor, and to be constructed as shown on the enclosed drawing, with the necessary posts and beams, floor and ceiling joists, M.J. Fir Flooring to the floor; the ceiling and the underneath side of the floor joists to be sheathed with V-Joint; the balance trade up to the sill to be 2-ply V-Joint; above the sill to be entirely filled in with glazed sash and screen wire; roof to be 2x4, shiplap and shingles; all complete with the necessary fascia boards and mouldings. The price includes the painting and flashing to the brick wall, and the two doors opening out to the corridor, all for the sum of $1470.00. The price does not cover any electrical work as we do not know how many lights you would require. This is a small matter that could be easily arranged when we know what is required.\n\n8. - If deafening quilt is required all over the building under the wood floors, it would cost an additional sum of $910.00. This price is based on using Acme Keystone Hair Insulator.\n\nThe letter above mentioned also refers to \"a reducing pression valve for our tanks\". We do not know what is required, so are unable to estimate this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nJ.B.\nEncls.\n\nSuperintendent.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, #109-1-5A, enclosing a request that has been made by the Rev. Father Delmas, Principal of the Duck Lake Indian School, for a number of changes in the work in progress at that institution.\n\nI may say that on receipt of this letter I sent Mr. Inspector Christianson to Duck Lake to inquire into the various matters referred to. He has returned and has gone into the matter very thoroughly with me, and I shall deal with them here as they appear on the list furnished you by the Rev. Principal.\n\n1 & 2. Water System. There appears to be no good reason why the Department should build a pump house and install pipes from well No. 2. Well No. 1 is already connected up with the school, and has an ample supply of water for the institution. The argument for this change is that the water appears to be softer in well No. 2. This argument is not borne out by tests made of samples from both wells at the Provincial Laboratory here, and I see no reason for making an additional expenditure of from $2000 to $2500 to connect up well No. 2.\n\n3. The plank steps from the grade to the chapel corridor are necessary, and I would recommend that these be built, at a cost not to exceed $40.00.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n4. The concrete cistern appears to be necessary. You will note that the pipes and fittings in connection with this work are additional; probably $100.00 will have to be added to the price of $1450.00 quoted by Messrs. Smith Bros. and Wilson for this work. I am satisfied that it would be more economical to build this cistern now, while they have a concrete mixer and men on the job than it would be to put this off for another year. It is important that this work should be gone on with. To me it seems absurd to have this small tank of about 40 barrel capacity at an institution of this kind, and the expense of putting an overflow such as we have there has been very great.\n\n5. The chapel stairs are necessary and I would recommend that they be supplied. The cost of this is estimated at $110.00.\n\n6. Battleship Linoleum in Kitchen and Scullery. As there are cement floors in the kitchen and scullery, I am of the opinion that this linoleum is necessary.\n\n7. The two outside galleries asked for are necessary. I would recommend that they be constructed at a cost of $1470.\n\n8. The request for a deafening quilt between the floors is not recommended. This would cost at least $1000.00 and would be little or no improvement. This money can well be saved.\n\nThe documents forwarded with your letter are returned herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMEMORANDUM FROM REV. FATHER DELMAS.\n\nCOPY.\n\nWATER SYSTEM.\n\nIn order to make sure of having sufficient quantity of water, I would ask you to grant that our pressure tanks be temporarily placed in the garage so that the water from well no 1 be taken to these tanks as specified. I believe that the pump and engine which we use every day are in sufficiently good order to continue this work. Only the air pipes from the old building to the new, for which no provision was made in the specifications will be required.\n\nI would ask you also that water be taken from well no. 2 as this water is of superior quality, clearer, softer, and in sufficient quantity. It is the water from this well which the contractors are using for the cement and mortar; the small pump has been kept constantly going for 10 hours per day, and the water has not given out. This water when once boiled is like rain water and scales made on the pipes are soft while the scales of no. 1 well are as hard as stone.\n\n2. For this purpose there is needed a brick house of 12 x 14 large enough for an electric motor water pump and air pump. A 2 H.P. electric power should be placed in order to give an automatic supply of water.\n\n3. Outside stairs from end to the chapel are necessary for Indians who come from the reserves.\n\n4. We are also in need of a cistern for soft water outside the house. Our soil does not permit to dig down more than 9 ft. as at that depth we strike quick sand which caves in. To have a large supply of soft water for boilers, washing, engines. This cistern should be 24 ft. in diameter and should be connected with the metallic soft water tank specified on the plan.\n\n5. Stairs that lead from the gallery to the chapel were forgotten in the plans. They are absolutely necessary so that the sisters and girls may enter the chapel and depart by this gallery.\n\n6. I would recommend that a cork floor be put in the kitchen and scullery, in order that the fatigue of those working in these departments may be lessened.\n\n7. I would likewise ask for a gallery on the west side of the building at the 1st floor, for the use of the weak or sick sisters and children. This should be enclosed with sliding windows and screens.\n\n8. In order to deaden the noise of the house, we would be very grateful to you, if we could be permitted to place one thickness of deafening paper between the rough and finishing floor instead of building paper as specified.\nDuck Lake, Sask., September 15th, 1924.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nATTENTION OF THE ARCHITECT\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take the liberty of asking you if it would be in order to ask for a certain compensation for the board of Mr. A. Taillon, Inspector of the construction of our School.\n\nMr. Taillon takes his board and room at the School. I thought that the Department could do something on his behalf, as the salary of $6.00 is rather low for the nature of his work, as he is a very able and conscientious man.\n\nI also enclose account for one week board and room at the Allies Hotel, Duck Lake. If you think that something could be done in his favour for the payment of said account, and for the matter above referred to, I would be very much obliged to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. H. Selma\nPrincipal\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant with reference to allowance for board and room for Mr. Teillon I beg to say that the Department is prepared to allow for this, and I would ask you in future to indicate the amount on the voucher when submitting one covering his salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Selmas,\nPrincipal, Duck Lake Indian Res. School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wish to draw your attention to a number of matters in connection with the Duck Lake School, as follows:\n\n1. The contractor recommends that a change be made in the floor drainage in the laundry. This will only cost $15.00. A rough sketch of what is necessary is attached hereto.\n\n2. Fire Stations. On the first floor there are only two fire stations, one at each end of the main corridor, but I am of the opinion that another station should be installed in the corridor in front of the chapel, and hose would have to be supplied for this.\n\n3. There is no mangle in the laundry according to the plan. One is necessary, and should be installed at the same time as the other machinery.\n\n4. In connection with the three toilets in the basement, I wish to point out that the walls are not plastered, simply the tile walling. In my opinion it would be impossible to keep these places sanitary without having them plastered. Mr. Murray, the Provincial Sanitary Engineer, states that this is absolutely necessary. Mr. Smith states that the cost of the plastering would amount to about $188.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nCanada Life Bldg.,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe plumbing work which is being installed at\nthe new Indian school at Duck Lake was inspected a few days\nago by an official of this Division and I understand from the\nreport submitted that it is the intention to connect up the\ndrainage from the new building to the existing septic tank,\nand filter bed.\n\nAn examination was made of the latter and it\nwould appear that the filter bed is in very bad repair. The\ntrays and galvanized iron distributing troughs are badly\nbroken with the result that the sewage does not pass through\nthe filter, but discharges from the septic tank without any\nother form of treatment.\n\nI have before me a blue print showing the\noriginal design of the septic tank and filter bed of the\nDuck Lake school, which I believe was installed ten years\nago. It would appear that during this period the sludge\nhas been emptied from the tank on only one or two occasions,\nalthough I am informed that it was pumped out a few weeks ago.\n\nI would point out that with the opening of the\nnew school and with the operation of over one hundred\nplumbing fixtures the quantity of sewage will be considerably\nincreased and the maintenance of the disposal plant is a matter\nwhich will require constant attention. The solids in the\nsettling tank should be pumped out at least twice yearly, in\nthe spring and in the fall, and the filter bed should be\nreconstructed to conform to the original drawings.\n\nIt is possible that owing to the lack of fall\nat the outlet there may be a tendency for the sewage to\nfreeze and this might be overcome by constructing a shallow\ntank at the point where the sewage leaves the filter bed,\nand placing a siphon in this tank which would cause the\nsewage to be discharged at intervals, by means of a flush\nand thus avoid the possibility of freezing. This last\nrecommendation is submitted merely as a suggestion.\n\nThe main object of my writing you is to insure\nthat the plant is overhauled and placed in proper repair\nbefore the new building is opened.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Murray\nDirector,\nDivision of Sanitation.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from R. H. Murray, Director, Division of Sanitation for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will see from the letter that Mr. Murray recommends that the disposal vat be overhauled and put in repair. He claims it is not in good order, although I understand that Father Delmas was of the opinion that it was working satisfactorily.

Graham, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to say that I returned from Duck Lake yesterday, having gone there to straighten out difficulties existing between the contractors and the inspector.\n\nThe inspector on this job is a man who I would say has a good knowledge of general building, but has had little experience in the work that he is now doing, that is, supervising construction. He speaks very poor English, and does not appear to have the faculty of imparting his instructions to the different foremen on the job. He has a fault and that is that he is probably too exacting in details; however, it is better to err on this side than to be the other way. There was a certain amount of work that he let pass without personally supervising it and when he found out it had not been done properly he had all the work torn up. I refer to the drainage. He was supposed to inspect all drain pipes before they were covered; he did not do this and when he found that one or two joints had not been properly done he ordered the whole of the pipes uncovered. The contractors, on the other hand, say that he passed the pipes. There were a number of little matters of this kind, causing a continual wrangling.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith regard to the bricks, Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson were six to eight thousand brick short on the original lot decided upon for the veneering of this building. They tried to obtain the same kind of brick as that originally purchased, but were unable to do so; however, they got a very good substitute and, in my opinion, a brick equally as good. They paid $2.00 per A more for them than they did for the first lot which was passed by the Department. The inspector thought these bricks not equal to sample. I had them tested and find that they are practically the same brick. I also had them examined by the architect of the Provincial Government here, who expresses the opinion that they are the same. I then had them examined by Mr. Punten, Public School Architect, and he is of the same opinion. I saw some of these bricks placed in the wall and my opinion is that it would take an expert to see any difference. In view of this I authorized the contractor to go ahead and use them.\n\nThere is another matter that requires attention, and that is the matter of the placing of the roof on this school. I understand the plans do not give the detail, merely show where the water pipes are to lead from the roof. Mr. Punten tells me that it would be a mistake to have these down pipes so near the end walls. There will be a rush of water to this opening at times which is bound to reach the brick-work if the tar, pitch and gravel should fall away with heat and rain. He tells me this is not done on first class buildings, and Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, who brought the matter to my attention first, asked me to see whether the Government would not change this. They tell me they have a building in Saskatoon where they took every precaution to guard against water getting into the wall and in spite of this it has cost them a lot of money to keep the building in any kind of shape. The suggestion of the contractors is that they put in two 6\" down pipes, and one 4\" pipe. The cost of these pipes will be just as great as the six 4\" specified. They claim it will be an advantage in that there will only be three pipes running through the building instead of six. Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson claim that the fall of this roof to the pipes must be absolutely correct, otherwise the Garrett people will not guarantee the roof.\nDuncan J. Scott, Esq.\n\nSept. 30, 1924\n\nI would be glad to have your authority by wire if you decide to act on the suggested changes.\n\nI may say that there will be no additional cost.\n\nSketches of the roof are being mailed to you under separate cover.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe question of batteries to be used in connection with the lighting plant at the Duck Lake School is one that should receive serious consideration by the Department.\n\nI am told by experts that there is a great deal of difference in batteries, and if the Department should decide to install a thin plate battery, as it did in the case of Punnichy and Lebret, a serious mistake would be made. Both these batteries are now out of commission. They will not stand up against inexperienced handling, and even with expert handling the life of a thick plate battery would be double that of a thin plate.\n\nAs far as the initial cost of installing the thick plate battery as compared with the thin plate is concerned, it is made up merely in the price of the battery.\n\nIn view of our experience at Punnichy and Lebret I would strongly advise the Department to consider nothing but the thick plate battery.\n\nIn\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn the case of the batteries at Lebret which have gone out of commission in a short period of time, the Hart people's representative was here and the reason which he advanced for the rapid depreciation of these batteries was that the thin plate were used instead of thick plate. I can hardly agree with him, however, that the thin plate batteries should have exhausted themselves in such a short period of time, and I am told that when the representative was at Lebret he pointed out to the Principal that they had had a poor run of batteries and apparently those installed at Lebret were deficient to begin with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

H Selmer\nCommissioner Graham  \nDept of Indian Affairs  \nRegina  \n\nDear Sir,  \n\nI have today received telegram on Lister Brunton Automatic Plant for St Michael's School Duck Lake Sask and although it does not conform with the specifications on your telegram nor yet take care of your actual lighting load nor battery requirements I at least give you the price for you to decide.  \n\nEngine- one Lister 2 cylinder IO HP vertical water cooled enclosed type petrol engine speed 550 RPM  \nDynamo- An open protected type shunt wound having an capacity of 55 amperes at 110 volts.  \nBattery- 56 cells of 60 amperes  \nPrice installed Duck Lake Sask. $3200.00  \n\nYou will note no mention is made of countershaft as required in your letter as this is necessary for driving the laundry machinery. The amount I have allowed on my last tender for same is $110.00.  \n\nYou must also bear in mind that the connected load of the School is 120 amperes for light alone while this plant is only capable of 60 amperes a difference of one half. As your battery is only 60 amps and your load 120 amps your battery would only remain charged one half hour, while the other battery would remain for two and three quarter hours.  \n\nTo be more clear on the output this plant has an output of 300 lamps of 20 watts each while the fixtures selected is 300 lamps of 40 watt each just double. This plant is a splendid plant and can give splendid service but no plant is made to give double the service than what it is sold for without charging a higher price. I am quite willing to install this plant as quoted in a first class manner but bear in mind it is not to your specification.  \n\nYours truly  \n\n[Signature]  \n\nFOR SERVICE AND FIRST CLASS WORK - PHONE 5944\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Oct. 3rd, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI submit herewith for your consideration another tender from Mr. Matthew Wylie for the installation of an automatic plant at the Duck Lake Indian School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCommissioner Graham,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take pleasure in quoting you an electric light plant to be installed in St Michael's Boarding School Duck Lake Sask as per telegram received from Ottawa.\n\nAs no engine was specified I am quoting on the type Z and on the Battery I am quoting you on the Globolite also on belting I am quoting on single belt and switch board plain slate with necessary instruments to control this system.\n\nMy tender is for one IO hP Fairbank Morse Type Z engine, one 5 KW generator D.C. One 320 ampere hour storage Battery, one switchboard same as my previous Specification except plain slate instead of polished and Voltmeter receptacles and plugs being left out. This I will install for the sum of Three thousand five hundred dollars $3500.00.\n\nMy second tender is for IO hP special electric engine with sound muffler, one 5 KW westinghouse generator, one type 200 switchboard with Voltmeter plugs, one 320 ampere hour battery Globolite complete for the sum of Four thousand five hundred dollars $4500.00.\n\nMy third tender is the same as my second except the battery which will be the Manchester Chloride complete for the sum of Five thousand one hundred and forty nine dollars, $5149.00.\n\nThe last tender is my recommendation to give you long life and through satisfaction.\n\nCountershaft Belting and erection is included in each tender but no foundations for engine as most people lay there engine on the floor which is not satisfactory as a solid foundation saves vibration which is needed to any plant. My first tender is based on same as supplied to punnichy.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOR SERVICE AND FIRST CLASS WORK -- PHONE 5944\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSince receiving your telegram of the 29th ultimo, asking me to obtain prices for a ten horse power engine, five K.W. direct current, one hundred and ten volts generator, three hundred and twenty amperes hour battery switchboard complete, I thought it well to call on Mr. Wylie and explain to him that you have mentioned no special make of engine, generator or battery, and as there is a considerable difference in the cost of articles of this kind, I informed him that it would be well to specify the make of engine and battery in order that his tender would be fairly considered with the others, who might be tendering on a cheaper type.\n\nThe second tender of Mr. Wylie is herewith attached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

White enamel bricks all set in kitchen and scullery.\n\nSteam and water pipes are put in up to third floor. Boilers also are set. Chapel's roof completed. All sashes have been painted.\n\nMaterial on grounds: all plumbing, fixtures and radiators.\n\nRemarks (1) A car of bricks delivered on the grounds was not satisfactory to me as being too soft. I reported same and sent you a sample, which you also ascertained as not being up to sample submitted by the contractors and not to be accepted. A sample of these bricks was examined at Regina and declared to be of very poor quality; nevertheless by a telegram from the Indian Commissioner of Regina, Mr. W.M. Graham, these bricks were to be used after having been selected.\n\n(2) On specifications it is not said to put paper on both sides of the walls of the corridor going to the chapel. A ply of building paper on the inside walls before being plastered and a ply on the outside walls before receiving stucco will prove warmer. The cost is not very high.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSt. Michael's Indian School,\nDuck Lake, Sask., Oct. 4th, 1924\n\nMr. W.M.

Wylie, but before you authorize him to proceed with the work he should be instructed to obtain prices from the different manufacturers of engines, generators, and storage batteries and submit same to you for consideration. When you have received these you may authorize him to install the equipment which you think would give the best service. It is advisable, however, to give every opportunity to the various manufacturers to submit prices before the plant is decided upon.\n\nWhen you have decided on the plant to be installed kindly instruct Mr. Wylie to furnish the Inspector of Construction at the school with a sketch showing the layout of the proposed installation in order that he may make arrangements to provide a suitable concrete foundation bed for same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M.

H. Selmas,\nPrincipal.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the DUCK LAKE Residential School, October 15th and 16, 1924.\n\nAt the request of the agent and Father Delmas I examined the classrooms in the new school and beg to point out the following needs as to furniture and equipment.\n\nOur Department requires that all new seats shall be single and adjustable. It would be a pity to put the old ones in the beautiful new building. A suitable teacher's desk should be provided for each room. Blackboard space appears to be very limited according to the plans. Blackboards should be put along the entire side walls as well as at the front. In the two east classrooms the blackboards can be very satisfactorily hung in large frames. All blackboards should be four feet wide and 2\u00bd feet from the floor. The specifications call for the front blackboards to be placed entirely too high. The Sisters cannot reach within a foot of the top. I would suggest that a low bench be built along the wall under this blackboard.\n\nAbundance of book and cupboard space is a necessity in the modern classroom. I am suggesting that these be placed across the rear walls of the two west classrooms and along the walls in the corner spaces in the east classrooms.\n\nTranslucent blinds only are approved by our Department. These should be wide enough to extend a little onto the casing.\n\nJ. T.

The Rev. Principal has been pressing for this, pointing out very properly that it is unsanitary, as they can never expect to keep the walls clean in their present condition; clouds of dust will rise up from the floors when the children are playing and settle in the roughness of the mortar and on the side of the tiles, in fact it will be impossible to keep the place in any kind of shape. The benches run around the walls and the children will have to sit with their backs up against these rough walls, which would certainly tear their clothing.\n\nI have got a price from the contractors, and they tell me if we have the work done at once it will cost $375.00 for the two rooms. This is a trifling expenditure considering the great advantage of having the walls plastered. You will remember that I drew your attention to the fact that the walls in the closets and wash room were being left in the same condition and you authorized me to have them plastered. Had I known when I made this request that the recreation rooms were not being plastered I would have recommended that they be done at the same time.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe plastering contractors are now on the job, and will be there for three weeks. If you could authorize me by wire I would have this work done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1924.\n\nW. M.

The stable on the old site is pretty well beyond further use, but in addition to this it is situated about half a mile from the new site.\n\nIn addition to the above building, some kind of a store house will have to be provided. This need not be an expensive building. A house of at least six rooms is required for the married Farming Instructor. A root house is also necessary.\n\nI understand that these matters were brought to your attention in January, last, and as no definite instructions have been received from you, and the school is nearing completion, I again bring the matter before you to see what action should be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nV.

The work is going on well. On ground floor, first & second floor and chapel plastering is completed. On basement floor, concrete steps, concrete foundations for engines, generator finished. Also two coats of concrete on the walls. Engine and generator set in place. Metallic ceiling work started. Cistern & galleries completed. Finishing work started on ground floor.

Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr,\n\nRe Duck Lake Indian School:\n\nWe expect to finish up the above contract very early in the new year. There is one matter which we would be obliged if you would take up with Mr. Scott; that is with reference to the temporary heating. This of course is called for in the specifications to be supplied by us, but we feel we should have an allowance made for the time lost between the date the tenders were received; that was June 9th; and the date we received orders that we could start on the contract, which was July 2nd; approximately three weeks. This loss of time put us back more than the three weeks, and had we been able to have started right away, the building would have been so far advanced that instead of being finished, as we said before, early in the new year, it would not have been later than the end of November.\n\nWe, of course, are quite willing to abide by the decision of your Department, but we feel we should mention this matter, and we feel sure you will see the fairness of our request and make an allowance for, say, the three weeks temporary heating.\n\nAfter you have placed this matter before Mr. Scott, we would be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nL/B.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, Nov. 8, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Long:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to your request that the Department assume the cost for three weeks fire at the Duck Lake School.\n\nBefore submitting this matter to Mr. Scott I would ask you to please let me have an idea of the cost of the heating of the building, providing the Department made an allowance for this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

As this firm took this contract at a very low price, I would be prepared to recommend for your approval that favourable consideration be given to their request.

Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have asked Reverend Father Plourde to take up with you the question of the purchase of another of our four Indian Schools. The purchase of Kenora being completed and the necessary funds having been provided for the purchase of Lestock, we still have two schools to dispose of, namely: Camperville and Crooked Lake.\n\nI am desirous of disposing of Camperville School in the coming year, and Reverend Father Plourde will give you personally the reasons which prompt me to ask for its purchase.\n\nKnowing the very keen interest you have taken in all the affairs pertaining to our Indian Schools, I trust and hope that we may deserve a continuance of your patronage.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nReverend Father Plourde is just leaving for Ottawa. He is going to speak to your Department of our dear Indian schools. Two of them have already been bought by the Government and, according to the promises made, another has to be bought this year. I hope that you will help to have that done, because it is for the good of these poor children. You know it better than anyone else.\n\nI thank you in advance for the help you will give us and I can assure you that you can count on my sincere gratitude.\n\nYours thankful and devoted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Plourde, regarding the purchase of another one of the Indian schools now owned by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we shall endeavour to make provision in the estimates for the coming fiscal year for the purchase of one of the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Beys, O.M.I.,\nAdministration Provinciale,\nMissionnaires Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e,\nSaint Boniface, Man.\nDecember 18, 1923.\n\nDear Archbishop Mathieu,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, which was left with me a few days ago by Rev. Father Plourde, regarding the purchase of another one of the Indian schools now owned by the Oblate Fathers.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we shall endeavour to make provision in the estimates for the coming fiscal year for the purchase of one of the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. O.H. Mathieu, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Regina,\nRegina, Sask.\nDecember 13, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from His Grace Archbishop Mathieu, of Regina, I have to report that I am including in the Estimates an amount of $75,000.00 to purchase the school at Pine Creek. If you approve of this item and if it is finally included in the Estimates, there will be no difficulty in carrying out the purchase.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 9, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIn the Estimates for Indian Education there is an item for $150,000 for the erection of a new main building at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, south of Prince Albert, Sask. The Oblate Fathers have title to the 700 acres which have been used in conjunction with the school for some years and which are necessary for its satisfactory conduct in the future.\n\nI have had an interview with the Provincial Head of the Order and have been corresponding with him, with a view to the transfer of this farm to the Crown. The Oblate Fathers have now made a definite proposal, which is in brief that the Department purchase, before building operations, 100 acres which is the site of the buildings, at a nominal price of $10 per acre and agree to the purchase of the other 600 acres of the property at $50 an acre, as soon as the necessary appropriation can be provided.\n\nPrior to 1911, when the institution with 100 acres was transferred from the Crown to the Oblate Fathers for a nominal consideration, the Department expended more than $20,000 for buildings and equipment. During the 30 years that this school has been in operation, the school farm grew in size and value while the institution was largely financed by per capita grants from parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nAs the Department has been associated with the Oblate Fathers in the capital and current expenses for many years, I consider that the 600 acre farm should be offered the Crown at a more reasonable price. I should be pleased to have your instructions, so that I may reply to the Provincial Head's proposal.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDr. Scott\n\nI agree with you, that the Oblate Fathers are asking an unreasonable price for this farm. You might mention the matter to me when you are in the office again.\n\nMay 15, 24.\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nRe Duck Lake School Property.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of May 8th on this question, I beg to report that now that the authority of His Excellency has been obtained to enter into a contract with the lowest tenderer, Smith Brothers & Wilson, of Regina, for the erection of this school, it becomes pressingly important to decide on the price to be paid for the property. You will note in my memorandum of May 8th the suggestions that were made by the Provincial of the Oblate Order. If his suggestions were met we would pay as follows for the property:\n\n| Acres | Price per Acre | Total |\n|-------|----------------|-------|\n| 320   | $50.00         | $16,000.00 |\n| 297   | $50.00         | $14,850.00 |\n| 100   | $10.00         | $1,000.00 |\n\nTotal: $31,850.00\n\nFor the reasons previously given, I think this price is too high. There is no special point in having a reduction on the value of the one hundred acres on which the buildings are to be situated, and I think we might fix a price per acre for the whole 717 acres. You might care to consider an offer of $25,000.00 for the whole property, or at the rate of $30.00 an acre, $21,510.00, or at the rate of $25.00 an acre, $17,925.00. The authorities of the Oblate Order should give greater weight to the fact that there has been close co-operation and financial assistance in the conduct of this school. This real estate cannot be considered as the property of the Order self-improved and developed, and there would be no cogency in making an invidious comparison between what was paid at Edmonton and Claresholm; at the same time we must realize that the energy and administrative ability of the Order went far to develop the property.\nI am inclined to think that they would accept the offer of $25,000.00, but I am not so sure that they would be willing to agree to the proposal to pay $25.00 an acre. Whatever price is decided upon, I think it should be accompanied by the intimation that unless it is accepted with the Departmental view of the dual nature of the interest, we could not go on with the building of the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nArchbishop's Palace,\nRegina, Sask.\nOctober 24, 1924.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have again asked Reverend Father Plourde to go to Ottawa to see you in connection with the sale of the schools belonging to the Reverend Oblate Fathers. I need not relate again the reasons which prompted me to take such personal interest in this matter. They are well known to you and your sympathetic understanding of them has greatly facilitated the purpose I had in view.\n\nSo if I take the liberty of writing to you again, it is not that I am in the least doubtful of the final outcome, but I simply wish to prove you my interest in this matter has not waned in the least, and that I am as confident as ever that by the purchase of the Crooked Lake School, your Department will bring this entire transaction to a happy and final issue.\n\nAs this may be the last time that I have the pleasure of writing to you in this connection, I wish to take this opportunity of thanking you most sincerely for the great assistance you have been to me and to the Reverend Oblate Fathers. I feel confident that the steps taken by the Government will redound to your honor and good judgment and will materially help in the successful management of our Indian Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember 19, 1924.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Mathieu,\n\nI beg to acknowledge Your Grace's letter of October 24th, and I have to assure you that the matters therein mentioned will receive my very best attention. We are now considering our estimates, and the needs of your schools will receive sympathetic attention.\n\nI trust that Your Grace may be long spared to stimulate those interested in the work of Indian education, and I wish to send you the Season's Greetings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMt.

Duck Lake, whereas the price quoted by Messrs. Liston Bruston was F.O.B Winnipeg. As the freight charges from Winnipeg to Duck Lake would greatly exceed the difference in the two prices the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company quotation was the more favourable.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Adrian Corillon\nDuck Lake\nSask.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1924       | 26 days work: inspecting work on the building | $156.00|\n|            | Board & room                                 | $31.00 |\n\nDuck Lake Residential School\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MICHAEL'S INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\nDUCK LAKE, SASK.\n\nDuck Lake, January 8th - 1925.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Architect:\n\nI beg to call your attention to certain details in connection with the water-system now installed in the new building, and which have not been mentioned either in the plans or specifications, and which in my opinion are of all necessity and should be attended to without delay before the contractor delivers the building over as completed.\n\n1. The water-system, as at present provided, is not complete. According to specifications, a large air-pressure tank, now in the old building, is to be removed to the new building, as a reservoir for water to be pumped from the well; but no provision has been made in the plumber's contract to make connections with this tank.\n\nThis air-pressure tank and its valves are in very good condition.\n\n2. You are aware that a large cistern for soft water has been constructed, with a supply-pipe from same laid only as far as the floor of the laundry, and left in that condition is of no use. This should be connected with the Laundry Machinery, and could be done by placing a force-pump and an air-compression pump, which would pump the soft water into an air-compression tank, thence to be distributed to the different laundry machines and laundry tubs. This air-pressure tank can be supplied also from the old building.\n\nThe force-pump and the air-compression pump should be run by the power from the engine in the Electric-Light room.\n\nMoreover, for the sake of keeping the two Heating-Boilers in good order and preventing incrustation, it would be a very good plan to supply these boilers with soft water instead of hard water pumped from the well, and for that purpose it would be necessary to make a few little changes or connections.\n3. For the washing of the clothes in the laundry, it is absolutely necessary that the soft water also be heated and there is no provision for this. There is here a large galvanized-iron tank which could be very easily used for that purpose, by having same cut and connected with the air-pressure tank and the small upright boiler set up in the laundry, and from this tank a connection should be made to the laundry tubs, which are already provided with the necessary pipes and taps.\n\n4. A mangle has been added to the laundry machinery; but no provision has been made to bring the steam to this particular machine, as it is needed for the proper operation of same.\n\nI have sent a sketch of the above mentioned suggestions to the Plumbing Contractor at Regina, so that he may more readily understand and be prepared to give an estimate of the cost.\n\nI am making these suggestions to the best of my knowledge, with the idea that if they be done now it would be saving to the Department. I therefore trust that you will favorably take up this matter, as I consider that the suggestions made by me are of all necessity for the proper working of the water-system so far installed in the new building.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Works.\nDuck Lake, January the 8th-1925\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Architect.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you be kind enough to supply me with a copy of the list for the Electric Light Fixtures that are to be installed in the new building at Duck Lake, and the Catalogue from which they are chosen. I need that information to enable me to check the material and articles supplied here, and thus to be in a position to sign the Certificates for same.\n\nPlease favor me with an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAdrian Tailton\nInspector of Works.\n**LEMERY DENISON ELECTRIC Limited**\n\n11-23 STREET EAST\n\n**Exide BATTERIES**\n\nSERVICE STATION\n\nDISTRIBUTOR\n\n**Delco KLAXON REMY**\n\nDISTRIBUTOR\n\n**BOSCH DISTRIBUTORS and SERVICE STATION**\n\nSaskatoon, Sask., Jan. 8th, 1925\n\nSold to: The Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nAddress: Ottawa, Ont.\n\n| Terms | Quantity Ordered | Quantity Shipped | Shipped by | Date Shipped | Price |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|-------|\n|       |                  |                  |            |              | 52.87 |\n|       |                  |                  |            |              |       |\n|       |                  |                  |            |              |       |\n|       |                  |                  |            |              |       |\n\n**PARTICULARS**\n\n| Description | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------|----------|-------|\n| 200 ft.

You will understand that you have now installed a large Soft Water Cistern placed outside of Building, where all rain water off roofs discharge into, and a suction pipe is installed from said cistern to a point in floor of laundry, but no provision is made to pump this water from cistern or to supply it to the various Fixtures or if there any provision made to heat this soft water for the laundry purposes. We are submitting a rough sketch showing how this could be done and how we would recommend same and will outline it as under plan one.\n\nPLAN ONE\n\nWe will remove from old school a 800 gal. pressure tank that they have now on hand, and set it up along side of Hard water tank in Garage. Install one Electric Pumping unit complete with motor and Automatic switch, and Air Compressor. Connect Pump to Suction Line from Cistern, carry discharge from pump to the above 800 gal. storage Tank, carry Air Line to Pressure Tank and Connect to Various Laundry machinery and Laundry Tubs, also carry a line of Soft water to feed the two Tubiler Heating Boilers and the High pressure Boiler in laundry. Install one 85 gal. Hot water Tank with Coil Steam Coil. Run a line of Steam from High Pressure Boiler to Coil in Tank, taking care of Condensation from Coil with a Hot Trap, and carry Hot water from tank and connect to the fixtures in laundry. The cost as outlined above is $1013.00\n\nPLAN #2\n\nExactly as Plan #1 other than we would use an old Range Boiler from old school in place of the 80 gal. tank with Steam Coil, and just run a steam line into it to heat the water, feeding the fixtures from it by Gravity the cost of plan #2 is $661.00.\n\nPLAN #3\n\nBy using a power belt driven pumping unit in place of the Automatic Electric would mean a deduction of $75.00 from the price of either Plan #1 or Plan #2.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nROANTREE & CO.\nPer F.B. Roantree.\nSir:\n\nI beg to draw to your attention the fact that we have now completed, at the Duck Lake Boarding School, a cistern with a capacity of about 1500 barrels, for the purpose of conserving the soft water and using it in the laundry and boilers.\n\nThe work of piping this water from the cistern to the laundry has been completed, but the question is to get this water pumped from the cistern to the various laundry fixtures and boilers.\n\nI am enclosing herewith an offer from the H.B. Roantree & Company of Regina who have the plumbing contract for this building, and it seems to me that their specification is quite easily understood. It is for you to decide whether the work is to be proceeded with at once. I think it should, and I would recommend that Plan No. 1 be adopted.\n\nIf you will let me know by wire it will facilitate matters, as the men are leaving the school shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Grant,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 26, 1925.\n\nW. M.

We still have twenty-two men employed.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nAdrian Tailon\nInspector of Construction.\nDuck Lake Sask.\nJanuary 31st, 1925.\n\nTo The Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe contractor expects that by the\nFirst of February 1925 that the Indian Residential School\nof Duck Lake Saskatchewan will be completed and ready to\nbe received.\n\nBy that time everything will be completed with the ex-\nception of the grading and cleaning up outside and around\nthe building which can not be done before Spring.\nI will retain a sufficient amount of money from the contract\nto cover this work.\n\nAwaiting your instructions, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nIndian Residential School Duck Lake Sask.\nTO THE ATTENTION OF THE ARCHITECT 1 CONTRACTOR SAYS THREE FIRE BELLS ARE SPECIFIED BUT I SAY ONE ON EACH FLOOR 2 CONTRACTOR CANNOT GET EIGHT INCH BELL WANTS TO PUT SIX INCH IN PLACE 3 COULD WE HAVE A FIRE BELL IN EACH OF THE UPPER DORMITORIES 4 AND BREAK GLASS FIRE STATIONS 5 THIS IS ONE DOLLAR EXTRA EACH BELL 6 AN EXTRA BELL TWELVE DOLLARS 7 IS THE CONTRACTOR OR THE COMMISSION TO FURNISH MAIN SWITCH BOARD DON'T THINK THE SCHOOL WILL BE FINISHED BEFORE FEBY TENTH\n\nADRIAN TAILLON.\n\n3AM\nSend the following Night Letter subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nMr. Millon, M.D.,\nInspector of Construction,\nDuck Lake Indian Res.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the work of the new school is almost completed, may I be allowed to present another suggestion to your Department?\n\nIt is about the concrete floors of the dining rooms and of the corridor leading to the same. Should an accident happen; should grease or gravy be spilled, the greasy spots would always show and after a few years the places mentioned would be a real disgrace.\n\nTo obviate to this, I would ask the Department to have the concrete floors covered with two coats of paint.\n\nThis should be done also for the toilets' floor to render the deodorizing possible.\n\nAfter consulting the Catalogue of the Dominion Paint Works Ltd. and the prices of the local labour, I find that I could have two coats of paint applied to the different floors for the amount of $230.00. Please authorize me to buy the paint and to have this work executed.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAdrien Taillon,\nInspector of Works.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter that I received from Adrien Taillon, Inspector of Works, Duck Lake Boarding School. If you fall in with the suggestion kindly advise me. Personally I think it should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

I wish to explain that it is the custom in Western Canada, when work is performed on a basis of \"cost plus 10%\", that the percentage should be charged on every single item of expenditure, including the wages, if any, of the Principal who undertakes to do the work on that basis. It is a form of contract often employed when the jobs are small and the Principal invariably works on the job himself. In such instances he (in this case Mr. Wylie) could not sacrifice his time by supervising the work for only the amount of percentage which he would otherwise derive.\n\nMr. Wylie assumed charge of the work covered by the voucher, with the intention of being employed on it himself and receiving payment on the based percentage of all charges in connection therewith as customary in this country, and having assumed the work with this understanding I submit he is entitled to payment in the customary manner. I trust the Department will, therefore, pay the voucher, as there are other vouchers for work performed by Mr. Wylie on a similar basis which will shortly have to be submitted to the Department for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please note following items:\n\n(1) Re putting of metal ceiling on the underside of Gallery in Chapel, I have deducted ($44.00) Forty Four Dollars, i.e., $30.00 for metal and $14.00 for lumber. I never gave instructions nor orders to have this particular work done and payment is hereby refused.\n\n(2) Re fuel for heating building, I wish to allow an amount of $250.00 and no more. I consider latter a very reasonable allowance. Therefore I have deducted all of above sums from the total amount of extras as charged by Sith Bros & Wilson, in their Statement, of extras, Sheet No 4. Amount $5216.53\n\n(3) Re Propeller Fan which never was properly installed I have deducted an amount of $150.00 to insure completion of installation of same. I might add that the contractor is waiting for repairs for the said Fan, and as soon as latter are received the Fan shall be put in running order.\n\nPlease find also enclose Summary Report, Guarantee from Smith Bros & Wilson and trust shall be found a order and satisfactory to your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction of\nDuck Lake Indian Residential School\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a final report and estimate for the work on the Duck Lake Boarding School, prepared by Mr. Adrien Taillon.\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph of the report, it seems to me there is not much in this protest of Mr. Taillon's. A joint was put up in the room where the lighting plant is installed, instead of metal ceiling, as called for. No charge was made for this. The metal that would have been used here was placed on the under side of the gallery in the chapel, which called for no ceiling, and where the joists were left exposed in the plan. I think the $44.00 charged for this is a just one.\n\nRegarding the matter of the charge for fuel, you will note that Mr. Taillon reduces the account by $11.80. Smith Bros. & Wilson however contend that you gave them authority to include the sum of $331.80 in their extras, and it seems to me that this is a just claim and should be paid.\n\nWith regard to paragraph three, the Propeller Fan is not yet installed. I can get a marked cheque for $150.00 from Messrs Smith Bros. & Wilson, as a guarantee that it will be installed. If you see fit to send to me the cheque for the balance due the contractors, I will not hand it over until we get this work done. However, it will be finished within a few days, as I have been informed by Messrs Smith Bros. & Wilson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.
