The leaves persist in remaining monotonously upon the trees. It is warm in spots, out of doors, but very chilly in the house, and the thermometer never continues in one stay for half an hour at a time. It is too warm to wear an overcoat out-doors, and too cold to go without one. Oftentimes, to an unfortunate Canadian shivering in some draughty southern house, it seems that the proper place for overcoats is in-doors. In European houses the cold seems to sneak in upon one's back, and out-doors, if it never is cold enough to freeze a nose occasionally, it is always raw enough to make one's nose red and wet. Then it rains more than is pleasant, and when it does, it rains ice-water. All these considerations, and many more too numerous to dwell upon in carnival week, lead up to the paradoxical truth that if any one likes to be warm in winter he should go to a cold climate.\n\nCanada is highly favoured. She has two decidedly distinct and separate climates coming one\nafter the other. Canada does not mix climates like less favoured countries. She is not uncertain upon the subject. In January one may be absolutely certain he will need a great coat out-doors, and in July he may be absolutely certain that he will not. There is no need of taking anxious thought about it. Then, in Canada, in winter, nature is pleasing. The ground does not stick out through the dead grass, but it is covered up warmly with nice, clean, dry, white snow, until grass time comes again. The aspect of nature is totally changed; and, as the mind is rested by a total change of occupation, so the whole man, mind and body, is rested by the complete alternation of our thoroughly contrasted seasons. Each is welcome in its turn. The tender green of the young leaves looks vivider by the contrast with the white snow still fresh in our memories, and the white snow is welcome in the fall to cover the sere and sombre colours of autumn in its final exhaustion. Therefore it is that Canadians have inaugurated a carnival\u2014have organised cheap trips, and prepared festivities, so that others, besides themselves, might see and know how good their climate is, and how full of amusement a low thermometer can be.\n\nThese advantages were very early observed by judicious strangers. The excellent Governor of Three Rivers, in 1663, writing to Colbert, says\u2014\"people walk everywhere over the snow upon most convenient shoes called 'raquettes,' and, in truth, one is less inconvenienced here in winter by\nsnow than in Paris by mud.\" In later days when the more prosaic English got the country, they brought with them their national habit of grumbling at the weather. Then photography was invented, and unpatriotic artists photographed all the exceptionally disagreeable things they could find. Every heavy drift\u2014every high snow-bank\u2014every great ice-shove\u2014was searched out and photographed, and our bright winter sunshine was treacherously inveigled into multiplying pictorial libels of our country to be spread broadcast in foreign lands. Even the very rare indiscretions of our well-behaved river (when after twenty-five years of exemplary conduct it would burst out into some extravagant freak) were cruelly recorded and trumpeted abroad to our detriment. All these things will, after a few winter carnivals, be properly understood, and the world will be undeceived concerning our climate in winter.\n\nOf course, in winter there is good sleighing all the time, and everything which can run is got out and made to work. There is time to look after such matters, for the ships and steamers are all away, and the river, so busy in summer, looks wild, and weird and deserted. It looks as if there never would be summer again, and it intended to remain frozen till the crack of doom. But in the streets everything in the shape of a horse is lively; and the outskirts of the city are thronged with young people going to or returning from the toboggan slides, moving along with that quick elastic step\npeculiar to moccasined feet. The dry snow creaks even under the soft deer-skin. The sun is as bright and the sky as blue as in midsummer, and the air seems filled with light because of the whiteness of the snow. But colour is not absent\u2014the white blanket suits of the snowshoers and tobogganers are all gaily trimmed with the bright distinguishing colours of their respective clubs. Young men and girls alike wear these uniforms, and the bright colours are not confined to the uniforms, but faces are ruddy from exercise, and eyes are flashing with healthful excitement. A Canadian belle in white blanket suit, gaily trimmed, and with pale blue tuque jauntily set upon her head, stepping springingly along with moccasined feet is a sight worth going to Canada to see.\n\nIn the present place it is not possible to give in detail the arrangements for the Carnival. Programmes will be issued every day during the week, and widely distributed. From them the details, which may be modified by the weather, can be learned. The general programme is given below, but while that will be mainly adhered to, other attractions will be added, as may occur to the Committee of Management. An office for information has been opened at 178 St. James' Street, at the headquarters of the Central Committee.\nTHE CARNIVAL, FEBRUARY 4th to 9th, 1884.\n\nThe Carnival is held under the auspices of a committee of citizens, the sports being under the immediate direction of committees from the various athletic clubs.\n\nA detailed programme of each day's proceedings will be issued during Carnival week, and will include novel attractions which are now under consideration by the Executive Committee. Special Carnival excursion trains have been arranged for by the railways entering Montreal. Full particulars as to reduced fares, etc., may be obtained at railroad ticket offices in Canada and United States.\n\nExtensive accommodation for strangers has been secured by Mr. W. R. Salter, Chairman Lodging Committee, who may be addressed at 178 St. James Street.\n\nThe toboggan hills of the Montreal, Tuque Bleue, and Park clubs will be at the disposal of visitors during Carnival week, and members of these clubs will welcome strangers to their grounds.\n\nSpecial tickets for Carnival week, admitting holders to all the privileges of membership, will be issued by the Victoria Skating Club, whose rink is the largest and most commodious in America.\n\nVisitors to the city bringing fancy dresses will be allowed to participate in the grand Carnival to be held on Thursday and Saturday.\n\nMessrs. Wm. Notman & Son, with the co-operation of the various sporting clubs of Montreal, will publish a picture illustrating the principal events of the festival.\n\nHis Excellency, the Governor-General of Canada the\nMarquess of Lansdowne, The Marchioness of Lansdowne, and suite, will be the guests of the city during Carnival week.\n\nJoseph Hickson, Chairman.\nR.

Trotting races will take place on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nContractor's Drive.\u2014This is an entertainment provided by the builders and contractors of the city. After assembling, they will drive round the town, and then to Peloquin's at the Back River (Riviere-des-Prairies, at the back of the island,) for lunch. After lunch; they will drive to Lumkin's, at Cote-des-Neiges, for dinner at four o'clock, by way of St. Laurent. Tickets may be had of the Secretary.\nFancy Dress Carnival\u2014At the Victoria Rink. Two evenings\u2014Thursday and Saturday\u2014are devoted to this attractive amusement. The regulations are published as to the fancy dresses allowed. No dress of any religious order will be permitted on the ice.\n\nIndian Concert\u2014At Nordheimer's Hall in St. James Street, on Thursday and Friday evenings. The concert will be by Caughnawaga Indians, and in the Iroquois language. There will be war dances, and tableaux illustrating scalping, election of chiefs, and other pleasing avocations of the heroic days of Montreal.\n\nTorchlight Procession.\u2014All the Snow-shoe Clubs will take part in this, and it will be a very pretty and characteristic sight. (See page 123 for the Dufferin procession.)\n\nCarters's Sleighs.\u2014Cabmen or hackmen are commonly called carters in Canadian parlance. Driving is very cheap in Montreal, and sleighs are plentiful. For tariff of fares see page 27\u2014they are the same, summer and winter. A true French-Canadian is fond of swift locomotion, and will never walk if anything with four legs can be got to drag him.\nCURLING CLUBS.\n\nAs may be seen in all the programmes of the Carnival, a Grand Curling Bonspeil, open to all the clubs of the world, will be played, commencing at 9 A.M. on February 5th. The regulations may be ascertained from the circulars distributed. As has been stated (p. 122), curling is an old and favourite amusement of the citizens of Montreal. Most abundant facilities have been provided in the way of special rinks during the Carnival week. Nos. 1 and 2 of the flour sheds in Ottawa Street have been flooded. These are each 750 feet long and will afford twenty rinks. The regular Clubs are:\n\nThe Montreal Curling Club.\u2014About 80 members. St. Catherine, corner of Mountain Street. Subscription, $10 per annum.\n\nMontreal Thistle Curling Club.\u2014Organized 1842; numbering 110 members. Subscription, $10. Rink\u2014St. Monique Street, near Dorchester Street.\n\nMontreal Caledonia Curling Club.\u2014Organized 1850; membership about 80. Annual Subscription, $8. Rink\u2014Corner of St. Catherine and Mountain Streets.\n\nAt all these rinks there are club rooms. No special regulations exist as to strangers; but the hearty hospitality of curlers everywhere is fully exhibited in this city, and visitors are always welcome. All the above rinks are double\u2014that is, consist of two rinks side by side.\nMONTREAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.\n\nMONTREAL AMATEUR ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.\n\nThis institution has been referred to on p. 120. It is the centre of Athletic Sports in Montreal. Visitors are always welcome at the headquarters of the Association\u2014the Gymnasium in Mansfield Street. In summer they will hear all the gossip about Boating, Lacrosse, Base-ball, Bicycling, etc., etc., and in winter they will be disposed to think that there never is any summer in the country; for Toboggans, Snow-shoes, and Curling will be the all absorbing subjects. The great rendezvous for snow-shoers is \"Lumkin's,\" at C\u00f4te de Neiges, which is occupied every evening, in turn, by one of the City Clubs, who make it the objective point of their weekly tramps, and generally improvise a dance or concert by way of rest after their walk. Strangers are always welcome and may depend upon kindly and hospitable treatment, if they join any of these tramping excursions. Roughness, incivility, or misbehaviour of any kind never occurs, and a tramp over the Mountain is as free from any rudeness as a stroll on St. James Street. Sometimes the exuberant spirits of the young men break out into song, and the frosty air rings to the chorus of \"Alouette,\" or some other local melody; but the only exhilarants are the bright moonshine on the glittering snow, the rapid movement, and the keen frosty air. Under such circumstances, strangers cannot do better than to\njoin in. The choruses are easy to sing if there happens to be breath enough left after climbing the hill. The music is not difficult to manage\u2014the wind is.\n\nThe first great snow-shoe tramp on record is the expedition under M. de Courcelles in 1666. He started from Quebec on January 6, 1666, with a part of the Carignan regiment and a number of Canadians. The regular soldiers suffered much, but of the Canadians not a man was frozen. He went as far as Orange (the present Albany). He was looking for Mohawks, but they were not desirous of an interview, and were not at home. So M. de Courcelles returned, not having taken much by his expedition but many frost-bites and bad colds. He was unfortunate enough to encounter a January thaw which, in a cold country, is a calamity of itself.\n\nAt present the only scalpers who are troublesome are the men who scalp tickets; but then scalping heads was a popular amusement around Montreal. So in 1704, in February, M. Hertel de Rouville started on a snow-shoe tramp with fifty of the jeunesse dor\u00e9e of Montreal and some Caughnawagas (who are humourously called \"praying Indians\" in some of the old books). He tramped as far as Deerfield, Connecticut, which we sincerely regret to confess he burned, and marched back with all the people who were not killed as captives into Canada. These were wild days of border warfare.\nMany startling stories are told of the partisan leaders on both sides\n\nWild was the life they led,\nMany the souls that sped,\nMany the hearts that bled,\nBy their stern orders.\n\nFather Lafiteau, a learned Jesuit who wrote in 1724, goes back a long way further in his discourse upon snow-shoes. He never could forget his classics; and he quotes Strabo to prove that the inhabitants of the Caucasus and Taurus ranges in Asia wore snow-shoes. Then he says, on the authority of Suidas and Arrian, that the soldiers of Alexander the Great wore them in their winter campaign in Bactria. Of all which learned matter the young athletes of the Montreal clubs will be found very instructive, and strangers may safely join their excursions without fear of being bored with such useless information.\n\nSNOW-SHOE CLUBS.\n\nMontreal Snow-shoe Club.\u2014This is the oldest existing club. It was organized in 1840, and has a very large membership. It now forms a part of the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, and has its headquarters at the Gymnasium in Mansfield Street. (See p. 120.) On Wednesdays during the winter, at 8 p.m., the Club assembles there and starts for the weekly tramp over the mountain to\nthe general club house. The annual subscription is $2. Uniform\u2014white, trimmed with scarlet; tuque, blue, with scarlet tassel; stockings, scarlet.\n\nSt. George Snow-shoe Club.\u2014Organized in 1874. It has branches at Winnipeg and elsewhere. On Tuesday evenings at 8, during the winter, it starts from the McGill College gate in Sherbrooke Street, for a tramp over the mountain to the general club house at C\u00f4te des Neiges. Total membership, 500. Subscription, $2. Uniform\u2014white; tuque, purple and white.\n\nThe Canadian Snow-shoe Club\u2014Meet on Thursday at McGill College gate. Uniform\u2014white, with blue facings; tuque, red, white, and blue; sash, red; stockings, blue. This is the club which lately made a visit to Ottawa, and had an excellent time. The Governor-General is an honorary member. It numbers 605 members.\n\nLes Trappeurs Snow-shoe Club.\u2014Uniform\u2014navy blue, trimmed with white; stockings, white; tuque, blue, with white band and tassel; sash, white. Meet on Wednesdays at McGill College gate. 260 members.\n\nArgyle Snow-shoe Club.\u2014Meeting place, St. Matthew's School-room in Congregation Street, on Friday evenings. Subscription, $1. Uniform\u2014white; stockings, sash, and tuque of the colour of the Argyle tartan.\nMaple Leaf Snow-shoe Club.\u2014Organized 1883. Numbers about 70 members. Club-house, C\u00f4te St. Paul. Rendezvous on Friday evenings at Point St. Charles. Subscription $1. Uniform\u2014white; blue stockings; red sash; blue tuque, with red tassel, and with a maple leaf worked in front.\n\nTOBOGGANING.\n\nUpon this very important question see p. 122. Father Lafiteau cannot fish up any classic lore concerning this excellent style of vehicle, which suggests the thought that the Greeks and Romans did not know as much as they get credit for. On the occasion of a grand illumination when the toboggan has completed its swift downward career between the smoking and glaring torches, some well-known lines of Virgil suggest themselves irresistibly as one turns to ascend; but if Virgil had possessed a toboggan Father Lafiteau would have said so. He merely describes it, using the name \"traine.\" If the learned father, and others who write on such subjects, were really desirous of giving valuable information, they would say that steering with sticks is unscientific, and not allowed on the best managed slides; and that most of the pictures of tobogganing are wrong. To steer with sticks is lazy. The true way is to steer with the leg, and make a brake with the foot upon the snow. The steersman is kept awake all the time; and he\ncannot carry over his mocassins into a second winter, which is good for trade. During the carnival all the toboggan slides will be illuminated. On its allotted night during the week, each club will have a special outbreak of lights. Strangers will be welcomed everywhere, and any unsophisticated novice who would like to know \"how it works,\" will doubtless find a place on some down train. If any friendly visitor will invent a way of sliding up he will render this exhilarating sport perfect, and Montrealers will commemorate him by a statue in ice. The slides are all free to visitors during Carnival week.\n\nTOBOGGAN CLUBS.\n\nMontreal Toboggan Club.\u2014This club was organised in 1880. The slides are at C\u00f4te St. Antoine, near the toll-gate on Sherbrooke Street, and are open every day. There are three slides partly artificial, each 1,500 feet long, and a natural hill which affords a slide of 2,400 feet. Flights of steps render the ascent easy, and large sheds afford shelter to spectators and storage for toboggans. Members are elected. Annual subscription $2, admitting all members of a family under 15 years of age. Ladies free. Badge, pink and green.\n\nPark Toboggan Club.\u2014The slides of this club are in a most picturesque spot in Mount Royal Park, at \"the Pines.\" There is a double slide giv-\ning a run of 1,300 feet, and the total fall in that length is $84\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The artificial erection is 20 feet high. Each slide is 10 feet wide. The club numbers 450 members. Family tickets $5. Gentlemen's tickets $2. Ladies free. Badges, cardinal with navy blue border. Omnibusses leave McGill College gate on Saturday afternoons at 2, 2-30, and 3-30 o'clock; and on moonlight evenings at 7, 7-30, 8, and 8-30 o'clock.\n\nLansdowne Toboggan Club.\u2014This club was organised in 1884, and is called after its patrons the present Governor-General and the Marchioness of Lansdowne. It has its headquarters at the head of Park Avenue, Upper Bleury Street. The slide is twenty feet wide, without division, and consists for the most part of a natural hill. The platform of the shoot is fifteen feet high, and is reached by steps in the rear. The total run is 1,800 feet, starting from the Golf Club House. The ascent is easy. Refreshment rooms are provided, and private rooms for ladies. Badge, dark blue with red border. Subscription, gentlemen $2; boys $1; ladies free.\n\nTuque Bleue Tobogganing Club.\u2014This club was organised at the beginning of the present winter. Its grounds are on Sherbrooke Street, corner of Mackay Street, and are the nearest of all to the city. There are four shoots, divided for the whole length of the run, which is 1,200 feet. Total drop 55 feet. Comfortable rooms are provided for ladies.\nMembers are admitted by ballot, and the subscription is $3.00. The club has about 400 members. Badge\u2014white.\n\nSKATING.\n\nVictoria Skating Rink, (See p. 121.)\u2014During the Carnival, special tickets will be issued to strangers only, giving admission to everything going on at the rink, and the privilege of skating during the whole week. Gentlemen $3, ladies $2. Single entrance fee to strangers on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, 50c.; Thursday and Saturday $1. Every skater on Thursday and Saturday evenings must wear fancy dress.\n\nCrystal Skating Rink.\u2014Corner of Dorchester Street and Dominion Square. This is a private enterprise. A band is generally playing in the evening, and masquerades are frequently held. On Tuesday evening a Fancy dress Carnival will be held.\n\nPrince of Wales' Skating Rink.\u2014On the Champ-de-Mars. A private enterprise. A band plays frequently, and masquerades often take place.\n\nOutdoor Skating Rink.\u2014During the Carnival, the Hockey Tournament will be held on a rink to be improvised on the McGill College Grounds, and\nthe Lacrosse match on skates will also probably take place there.\n\nOther Rinks.\u2014There are many other places for skating. There is a rink on the old reservoir on Laval Avenue, or Upper St. Elizabeth Street. At the corner of St. Catherine and St. Dominique Streets is another, and on the river are many places swept and kept in order where a skate may be had for five or ten cents.\n\nTHE ICE PALACE.\n\nThis unique structure is on Dominion Square, and the festivities of the Carnival will very largely centre round it. As it is opposite the Windsor Hotel many of our visitors will have it constantly in view. The building is entirely of ice. No timber or other material has been employed. The blocks of ice are cut out of the canal and are of a uniform size of 40 x 20 inches. The fa\u00e7ade on Dorchester street is 160 feet wide. The main tower is 76 feet high. The depth of the building is 65 feet. Three thick partitions of ice will divide the space inside, but, as they will be pierced with doors, communication will be unobstructed throughout. The walls at the base of the tower are 6 ft. 9 inch. thick. There is no roof. The style is castellated with towers and tourelles, loopholed and battlemented. Ten thousand blocks of ice have been employed in\nthe construction. Messrs. Hutchison and Steele are the architects. The cost will be $3,200.\n\nTHE WEATHER.\n\nThere are two things dreaded by Canadians, a cold day in summer and a warm day in winter. Both are bad; but fortunately they seldom happen. The winters and summers usually go steadily on without a break. When the sun is very bright it thaws a little on the sunny side of the streets at mid-day. On the subject of the prospect for the Carnival, the weather-prophets are oracular, but on the whole they are propitious and bland. The weather last winter was just what it should be. The enormous number of visitors from the south did not bring enough caloric with them to raise the mercury one degree.
