Please furnish a report as soon as possible regarding the repairs required to the wall, stating approximately the cost of having same carried out. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to authorizing having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nInspector Harison's report on the schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report in connection with a visitation to the schools in the Carlton Agency. There are 7 day schools included in this Agency and I visited them all, with the exception of that at Montreal Lake and am reporting upon them in the order of visitation.\n\nROUND PLAIN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the United Church. The Rev. J. C. Meek, B.A., is in charge as teacher. He is well qualified. There are 7 Indian children enrolled, 3 boys and 5 girls. That is all that are of school age on the reserve at the present time. It is expected that 4 more may attend in the spring. Of these, 3 attend every day, 2 are fairly regular, and 2 are irregular in their attendance. The children were warmly clad and looked well nourished. They go home for their mid-day meal.\n\nFor recreation a toboggan slide is provided for the winter. They have a swing and a football for the warmer weather. I noted that the swing requires a new rope.\n\nThis school was re-opened, not only for the Indians, but to provide schooling for the neighbouring white settlers. The school is built of logs and although an old building, it is fairly comfortable. Some repairs are required.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nROUND PLAIN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nare required which can be done during the summer holidays. The cost will be about $20.00. Being a log building and old, certain repairs are necessary each year.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a neat frame cottage.\n\nW. Morrison\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., April 15th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nYou will notice that the Round Plain School is an old log building, and while it is comfortable, it requires some repairs which could be attended to during the summer at a cost of about $20.00. The Agent has placed an item of $200.00 in the Estimates to look after unforeseen repairs to schools in the agency, part of which could be used for this purpose.\n\nConditions at the Little Red River Day School appear to be satisfactory. I note that the teacher's residence is a small cottage divided into a kitchen, dining-room and two bedrooms, and that there are no porches. There is nothing in the Estimates to provide for a summer kitchen, and I should have thought the Agent would have inserted an item for this had he thought it necessary. I think we should allow $75.00 for a fence to enclose the school and make a small pasture for the teacher's driving horses.\n\nIt is hard to know what to recommend at the Sturgeon Lake Day School in order to get these children to school. It is a pity they could not be sent to a boarding school. The teacher's residence will be considered if the amount asked for in the Estimates is allowed.\n\n-It seems-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIt seems to me there is room for a change at the Big River Day School, but I do not know what to suggest. The school has just been started and perhaps another year will make it clear as to what should be done. I hesitate to recommend a new building for the teacher. However, if one could be built of logs for four or five hundred dollars it might be a good investment. I doubt if Mr. Settee is the man for this job, in fact I do not think he is.\n\nThe Sandy Bay School seems to be doing good work. It is an old, established place. I notice that 12 additional desks are asked for at this institution. These could be supplied if the Department would grant the authority. We could provide ladders for the school residence if the Department wish to grant them. I do not know what the cost would be, but probably three ladders could be supplied for $75.00.\n\nYou will note that the Mistawasis Day School is being taught by Miss Sadie McQueen, who took up her duties on the 26th of November last. She appears to be working under very unsatisfactory conditions. My own opinion is that she has too much to do, and there is an open quarrel on here which should not be allowed to continue. Miss McQueen should be encouraged and I think if the matter set out in the Inspector's report were brought to the attention of the proper authorities there would be a change made before long.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 303-11 of the 15th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his inspection of the various schools in the Carlton Agency. These reports have been read with interest and it is noted that progress is being made in the work at the schools.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's report regarding the repairs required to the Round Plain Combined White and Indian School, you may arrange during the coming summer to have the repairs required made to this building. It is noted that the Inspector estimates this work will cost approximately $20.\n\nYou are being written in separate communications relative to the requirements at the other schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The local Trustee Board laid it. So I hope that the Department will reconsider the plastering of the school. I had the work done and paid the Indian, Tom Standing, who did the work, $5.00.\n\nThe Department has always been generous and helpful, so I am sure that there must be some slight mistake, perhaps by a clerk at Ottawa. But I do not know just how to get it rectified.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6292, file 620-5, part 1)\nLeask, Sask.,\nOctober 15th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIf you have any agreement with the Church regarding residence and school buildings on Sioux Wabapotan Reserve No. 94A, I wish you would furnish me with a copy, as sometime ago when I wrote you regarding repairs to residence furnace I had no idea that building did not belong to the department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, October 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the arrangements made with the authorities of the United Church of Canada for the upkeep of the school building and teacher's residence on the Sioux Wahpaton reserve, No. 94A.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in April, 1922, the Department agreed with the authorities of the above named Church to reopen a school for the benefit of the Indian children on the Reserve and the white children in the neighbourhood. At that time, a school district had been formed by the white settlers and trustees appointed. This school was to be carried on in the old school building, which was the property of the Church. The Church authorities agreed to hand this building over to the Government, on the understanding that the Department would incur the expenditure required in making the necessary repairs to place it in a suitable condition for classroom work. Since that time, the Department has incurred expenditures in carrying out certain repairs. This school was to be conducted as a combined Indian and White school, under the joint auspices of the Department and the Board of Trustees for the district. The school building and grounds belong to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the residence used by the teacher, I have to say that this building belongs to the Church authorities, and the Department is not responsible for any part of the costs of upkeep.\n\nWe were in error, in our letter to you dated August 16th, last, in stating that the Department does not own the school building.\n\nYou may, therefore, incur an expenditure in the purchase of the lime required in plastering up holes and white-washing the school building and for the labour required in doing the work - the total cost of which should not exceed your estimate of $8.30. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the lime and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. S.

There are 16 children of school age on the north side, and 7 on the south side; and these live here for the most part, I understand, throughout the year. The river is half a mile wide here, and a number of the children would have to be taken across daily by canoe.\n\nThe usefulness of a school here would depend largely on the character and qualifications of the teacher that might be put in charge; and it would not be possible to secure a well qualified teacher for a day school here except at very high pay. Besides, a day school would, at the best, supply the educational needs of less than half the band. Sooner or later a boarding school will be required here, and it is probable that it would not be advisable to expend money on a school here until the question of the establishment of a boarding school is considered.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have, &c.,\nW.J.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nExtract of a letter received from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, addressed to Mr. Scott, dated Feb. 28, 1913.\n\nI am very anxious to have a day-school started at Stanley, on the Upper Churchill river. There should be one. The children are very numerous, and the Indians a nice set of people. They are always asking for a school. It would also make a fine preparatory school for Lac la Ronge boarding school. It might either be a 7 month school, or else all the year round, when either some of the mothers would remain over winter to take care of the children, or there could be a sort of semi boarding school with an Indian Matron. It is a shame to leave them without school.\nOttawa, April 25, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of February 28th, last, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, in which you deal with the establishment of a day school at Stanley on the Upper Churchill River I have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough to state whether there is at this point now any building which might be used for school purposes.\n\nThe establishment of a day school at this point was given consideration sometime ago and it was found at that time that there were sixteen children on the north side of the river and seven on the south side. The location of these Indians, therefore, somewhat complicated the situation. If, however, there is any building available the Department would be pleased to try the experiment of conducting a day school, which might, at a later date, develop into a semi-boarding school, as suggested by Your Lordship. I should be glad to hear from Your Lordship further in regard to this matter at your convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A.

It is a matter of such importance that I would ask you to bring it before the Minister of Indian Affairs at the earliest possible opportunity, & also to see that the matter is not dropped after it has been opened up.\n\nThe work the work of my missionaries among our Indians gives us opportunity of learning their state, their needs, their desires, in a way that you will rarely learn from your Indian agents & instructors. They therefore press upon your Dep't the pressing need of day-schools as follows (among others perhaps not mentioned):\n\n1. We are sure the I.D. knows of the non-existence of such schools, & the desire of the Indians to have them, & perhaps has been considering the matter. But I would urge the building & maintaining of these schools immediately.\n\n2. The Indians are retrograding & suffering for lack of education.\n\n3. It does not seem in accordance with \"Treaty\" terms without day-schools they desire & ask for them. I am not of correct names, but I think what I write is sufficient.\n\nVerry Poor Copy\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\nTo correct them out correctly.\n\n1.

They will no\n   longer do so, as they want the Day School system. I have sent\n   a free teacher there, Ch. Inukley, an intelligent educated man\n   (half-breed, I think) to open school as best he can in his own\n   house or in the Indian houses. I have to build a house for him.\n   This is not fair to the Church funds which are not meant for\n   schools. I beg to apply (1) for his salary (2) for purchase of the\n   residence for him (3) for a school to be built (4) for an Im-\n   proved Day School to be maintained.\n\n2.

M. B. Edwards, in which he suggests, in case a qualified teacher can be secured, that the school be opened in the early part of the coming summer in temporary quarters. He is of opinion that a fairly suitable building can be had in the locality for the summer. The reasons that he advances are that a new building cannot be ready for occupancy before the beginning of next winter, which is the time when the Indians scatter abroad to their hunting grounds, for the most part taking their families with them, though the greater part of the band is assembled during the summer months around the Mission. The best attendance that can be had during the year will be from June to September.\n\nThere are several Indians' houses of fair dimensions in the locality; and I have little doubt that one of these could be had for a small rental; but as everything is high-priced in that country I think $10 per month would be moderate.\n\nProvided a suitable teacher can be secured I would recommend that Mr. Edwards' suggestion be adopted; and in that case I would recommend that a moderate quantity of school material be sent in before the winter roads break up.\n\nI may say that Mr. Edwards expects to take up his duties as missionary at Stanley in February; and his services\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwill be at the disposal of the Department in making the necessary arrangements for the opening of the school. He states that he will do his utmost to make the school a success.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 15, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the establishment of a school at Stanley.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided a qualified teacher can be secured to take charge of the school, the Department approves of renting a building for this purpose at the rate of $10.00 per month. The building should not be rented, however, until a teacher is obtained. A supply of school material will be sent in as soon as the Department is advised that a teacher has been secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to my letter of Jan. 3rd, and to your reply (which I have not before me) expressing the approval of the Department to the suggestion of opening a school at Stanley in the early part of the summer in a temporary building provided a qualified teacher can be procured, I have the honour to state that the services of Miss M. E. Coates, who is a sister-in-law of Rev. M. B. Edwards, will be available for the duties of teacher as soon as Mr. Edwards moves from Lac la Ronge to Stanley, which will be early enough to admit of the school being opened by the beginning of May, or the last of June at latest.\n\nI expect the question of Miss Coates' appointment has been submitted to the Department by Ven. Archdeacon McKay; and as she has fulfilled similar duties in the past, while in the employ of the Department at The Pas, her qualifications are already known; and in case these are satisfactory I would recommend that stationery and school material, as shown in the accompanying requisition, be supplied, in order that it may be sent out on the winter roads. I have figured on an attendance of 24; and though it will at times be larger, yet this will probably be for only short intervals and need not for the present be considered.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 24, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant stating that the services of Miss M. E. Coates will be available for the duties of teacher of the school to be opened at Stanley.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has not as yet received any communication from Venerable Archdeacon MacKay in reference to this appointment. Kindly state the salary that has been agreed upon.\n\nYou will be further advised in reference to the supplies asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nIn connection with the opening of a day school at Stanley I have the honour to state that while the proposed site for the school will be convenient to the larger part of the band there will still be some whose homes are at some distance. There are a few families, in particular, who live on the side of the river opposite to the Mission, adjacent to which the school is to be located. The river at this point is about three-quarters of a mile wide, and children who are brought across in canoe in the morning cannot very well return home until evening. There will, I think, be about one-third of the children who cannot conveniently return to their homes at noon; and as it would be a substantial benefit to the Indians generally and a help in maintaining a full and regular attendance, I would recommend that a noon meal corresponding in some measure to that of the improved day schools be served to all the children who attend.\n\nIt would be necessary to make provision for 30, as there will at times be quite that number in attendance. The knives, forks and spoons can be supplied from the industrial school here after its closing; but cups and soup plates would have to be purchased, as there are very few of these on hand here that would be worth the cost of their transport to Stanley.\n\nWith regard to material for the meal, I would recommend that in addition to the biscuits already allowed 2 sacks of flour be allowed, with which occasionally to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nmake bannock or bread; also 150 lbs. of bacon, 50 lbs. of rice, 20 lbs. of tea and 100 lbs. of lump sugar; and that the teacher be authorized to arrange with an Indian for a regular supply of whitefish, at 3\u00a2 per lb. The quantity of fish required would depend on the attendance and would vary from time to time; but it would probably average 4 c.: 5 lbs. daily and should not at any time be larger than 10 lbs. With this material a warm meal could be prepared which would be wholesome and nutritious, and also quite palatable to those children.\n\nWith regard to a place to prepare and serve the meal, I may say that Mrs. Edwards, wife of Rev. M. B. Edwards, who is to presently assume charge of the mission there, informs me that in case no more convenient place is to be had the children's meal can, until permanent buildings are provided, be prepared and served in the kitchen of the mission house.\n\nIn case the Department approves of providing the noon meal as above suggested a few cooking utensils will be required, namely, 1 large tea pot, 1 dish pan, 2 granite bowls, 1 kettle, 1 sauce pan, 1 frying pan, 1 water dipper, 2 small dippers (for soup ladles). A few additional articles can be supplied from the industrial school; and if it is found on making an inventory that any of the articles here requisitioned for can be supplied from the school equipment at closing such articles will not be purchased.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nReferring to your letter quoted above, dealing with the question of employing Miss M. E. Coates as teacher for the day school which it is proposed to open at Stanley, I beg to say that I had not mentioned the matter of salary with Archdeacon McKay, who has now left for Lac la Ronge and will be absent for some four months. Miss Coates, who is at present employed as girls' matron on the staff of the Battleford industrial school, is willing to accept $400 per annum for her services, and for this remuneration is prepared also to direct any work connected with the preparation of a noon meal, concerning which I am sending a separate communication under this date.\n\nMiss Coates has no special qualification for teaching, but she conducted an Indian day school at The Pas for some two or three years at intervals. I have an impression that she would give satisfactory services at Stanley.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 13, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 5th instant in reference to the appointment of Miss Coates as teacher of the day school it is proposed to open at Stanley.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept Miss Coates' services and will pay her at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to purchase the equipment and supplies necessary for providing a mid-day meal for the pupils who will attend this school, as stated in your letter above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On the following day we paid Treaty to the Amos Charles Band and distributed the Government supplies. We also had a meeting with the Rev. Mr. Edwards and the Band in connection with the school the Rev. Mr. Edwards was trying to arrange to open. However, the matter had to be dropped in the meantime as the Indians could not see their way clear to provide for the children this winter while they were away, the price of fur being so low, and the fishing and hunting right around Stanley being poor necessitates their going away some distance to live, and they therefore could not send their children in to school from whence they are located.\n\nI have the honour to be sir,\n\nTo the Hon.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nRe Stanley Day School.\n\nWhen at Ottawa I had a conversation with Mr. Martin Benson regarding the above School.\n\nI have had an interview with Rev. Mr. Edwards who has been confined to a private hospital in Prince Albert and beg to report as follows:\n\nIn March 1911 permission was granted to open this school and in view of this, supplies for mid day meal were sent to Stanley. Salary of Four Hundred ($400.00) Dollars was authorized for Miss M. S. Coates, there was also authorized a grant for the renting of a temporary building for school purposes of Ten ($10.00) per month. This, however, was never taken advantage of. The school was built from the grant made from the Department but was not opened until January 1st of this year. Since the opening there has been an average attendance of ten pupils. Mr. Edwards, however, expects a total enrolment of twenty-five pupils during the summer months.\n\nThe custom of the Band of Indians located at Stanley would appear to be that they go north in the summer and leave their children in the care of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nMission and request that a house be provided for their accommodation and a woman hired to look after them when out of school. According to Mr. Edwards he made arrangement for a building for this purpose and agreed to pay Five ($5.00) a month for rent of same, also Ten ($10.00) Dollars per month to a woman for looking after the children when out of school. This arrangement Mr. Edwards claims was made on the strength of promises made by Mr. Chisholm that Fifteen ($15.00) Dollars per month would be granted for this purpose. So far as I understand no such permission has been granted by the Department covering this arrangement.\n\nI explained to Mr. Edwards that, so long as he was running a day school it would come under the regulations governing same and that he could not expect the Department to extend assistance as given to Boarding Schools where a day school only was established. He intimated that if the Department could not grant the assistance asked for to take care of the pupils when their parents were away during the summer months, he was afraid it would be necessary to close the school.\nSir,\n\nI understand that most of the supplies already provided for the mid-day meal are on hand so that very little supplies in addition would be required at the present time.\n\nI am not aware if Mr. Edwards has communicated with you direct, but in the event of his not having done so I should feel obliged if you will kindly advise him as to what your wishes are in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nStanley Day School.\n\nSir,\n\nYou will find by returns sent in that the above school was opened on January 5th. The average was about 10 for the March quarter but is now on the increase. In spring time the Indians have not returned from their winter camps. When they return I feel sure that the average in school will be over 25. On account of the migratory habits of the Indians we had to provide the subjects of a widow & look after the welfare of the children who were left to attend school. The progress of the children has been very satisfactory. We would like to know definitely from the Department what is to be the teacher's salary, and likewise what amount of provision will the Department allow for the mid-day meal. At present there is very little provision on hand. At the commencement of the school...\nthere were only two sacks of flour. This has been distributed and we have had to procure two sacks more. There is still a little bacon, tea, sugar & rice on hand, but these provisions will all soon be used. We have likewise had to procure cooking utensils, cups, plates, spoons etc.\n\nI had to pay for lumber for decks & roofs and likewise a carpenter's wages in making the above. I have so far spent close on $35.00 in procuring the above.\n\nThe Indians are much interested in the school and I hope the Department will supply all necessary requirements.\n\nWe have only a monthly mail and it will take fully three months before I can receive a reply from you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Rv) M. B. Edwards.\nOttawa, July 20, 1916.\n\nRev.

Crombie, Esq.,\nPrince Albert.\n\nDear Mr. Crombie,\n\nEnclosed please find returns for Stanley School for last quarter. You will notice that the average is rather lower than it was for the same quarter the two previous years. This is easily accounted for. The price of all food is so high here that the people have had to stay out longer at the fishing and hunting camps, and consequently the children have been away more. When the children are here they attend school well, and I have had as many as twenty seven.\n\nI am also enclosing return for provisions used, and vouchers for work done in connection with the noon meal.\n\nYou will no doubt have heard that the Contractor failed to get the freight through last winter, and we have been very short of supplies. But things are now coming in by canoe, and no doubt everything will be here shortly.\n\nI beg to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of school material which arrived last mail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) M. E. Contas.\n\nP.S. Am also enclosing quarterly return of Indian supplies for quarter ending June 30th.\nSept. 3rd. 1918.\n\nW. B. Crombie, Esq.,\nPrince Albert.\n\nDear Mr. Crombie,\n\nI wish to send in my resignation as teacher of Stanley Indian Day School. The Indians did not want me to leave, and I was sorry to do so, but wished to be nearer town for a while.\n\nYours sincerely,\nM. E. Coates.\nSir,\n\nRe Stanley Day School, Isle a la Crosse Agency.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter just received from Miss M. E. Coates resigning as teacher of the Stanley Day School.\n\nI understand that the Church of England have sent a missionary and his wife to Stanley to take over the work there formerly done by the Rev. M. B. Edwards who was transferred to Little Pines Reserve, Battleford. No doubt the church authorities will be taking up with you the question of having the missionary's wife teach school at that point. I have not seen Bishop Newnham in connection with this as he is absent from the City at the present time. There is no person that I know of who would be willing to take on the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSeptember 16, 1918.\n\nSIF,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from Miss M.

Crombie, Esq.,\nIndian Inspector,\nPrince Albert.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nPardon my neglect, in not informing you of the reopening of Stanely Indian Day School, early in October. I was asked, by Archdeacon McKay, to take charge in the event of Miss Coates resigning the post. I find that the salary, four hundred dollars, is an inadequate sum for this isolated spot, where the cost of living is so high. I hope you will kindly pardon the liberty I am taking, but will you kindly use your influence in procuring for me the salary I had at Chawawawin ($500.00 as Teacher and $50. for dispensing medicines). I resigned the position at Chawawawin on account of my husband taking over this Mission District. I am enclosing requisition. Will you kindly allow me all the articles? No official forms on hand and the things needed badly.\n\nAgain thanking you in anticipation, Believe me\n\nYours truly,\n\nPas Agency. (Sgd.) Mabel Morris.\nSir,\n\nI am just in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Mabel Morris, Teacher, Stanley Day School, Isle a La Crosse Agency, addressed to Inspector Crombie, a copy of which I enclose herewith, in which she asks that the remuneration should be increased to $500.00, the same as she was receiving at Chemawawin, Le Pas Agency.\n\nI note that it has been customary to forward vouchers from month to month covering assistance for preparing the noon meal at this Day School, at the rate of $10.00 per month. I would suggest that in making an adjustment of salary, the extra allowance be cut off and the Teacher advised that she will be expected to get the assistance of some of the older pupils in the preparation of the noon meal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 8, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo enclosing a copy of a letter from Mrs. Mabel Morris, teacher of the Stanley Bay School, in which she asks that the remuneration should be increased to $500.00, the same as she was receiving at Chemawawin, Le Pas Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow Mrs. Morris a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum for her services as teacher of this school and she will also be allowed $50.00 per annum for dispensing medicines. Kindly inform her accordingly.\n\nIt is noted that she states that she re-opened the school early in October. She should prepare and forward a return showing the number of days she taught during the December quarter, last, when a cheque for the amount of salary due her will be forwarded.\n\nIn reference to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to say that, as you suggest, the allowance of $10.00 a month for assistance in preparing the noon meal at this school will be discontinued. You will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly and also that she should get the assistance of some of the older pupils in the preparation of the noon meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You also inform me, that the Government will no longer continue the monthly payments of $10.00 to the Indian woman who prepares the mid-day meals and that the older pupils must do that work. Maybe the Gov't. is unacquainted with conditions existing on this Reserve.\n\nAt the present time there are only two Indian families residing here. The others left last fall and will not return until the end of May. During their absence who is to look after these children? With a Gov't. house attached to the Mission, I, with the help of the older girls could manage well, but there is no house close and the children are housed and mothered by the woman who prepares the noon meals. At the present time eight are living there and these, with the children of the two families previously mentioned and non-treaty children, total eighteen in daily attendance at School. Young girls cannot be left to live alone on this Reserve and if Mrs. Maggie Bear is removed it will mean closing down the School. The Chief and all are strongly against this step being taken, as they greatly appreciate the School and hope you will use your influence in retaining the services of this widow woman. This house is unsuitable or I would house the children here. Even if the girls did prepare the mid-day meals where would they sleep? They are so happy and doing such good work that I would be sorry to see the School closed. Life would indeed be quiet in this isolated place without the school children. My husband, who is Missionary in charge here, also asks you to do your utmost in the matter and to allow Mrs. Bear to remain until the end of May.\n\nThanking you for an early reply.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Mabel Morris.\n\nTo Commissioner Graham,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\nIn further reference to file No. 377,899-1, of the 8th January, regarding increased remuneration to Mrs. Mabel Morris, as Teacher, at the Stanely Day School. I now beg to enclose herewith Return for quarter ended 31st December, 1918, together with report of provisions used for noon meal over the same period.\n\nThe question of preparing the noon meal I took up with the Teacher, and from information received, it would seem that the conditions existing at that point are such that it would not appear to be possible at all times for the Teacher to get the necessary assistance from the older girls attending the School.\n\nFor your information I enclose herewith copy of letter received from Mrs. Mabel Morris, in this connection, and in view of her explanation I would recommend that she be allowed to continue hiring the necessary help, at the rate of $10.00 per month, as formerly.\n\nThere is also enclosed herewith receipts in duplicate covering payments made by Mrs. Mabel Morris, for the months of November, December and January.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A cheque for $30.00 will be forwarded, this being the amount paid by Mrs. Morris for this assistance during the months of November, December and January, last, for which receipts are enclosed.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask\nOttawa, September 24, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to inform Your Lordship that Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, has forwarded the resignation of Mrs. Mabel Morris, teacher of the Stanley Indian Day School, from the end of the present month. The teacher states that she is leaving to reside in England during the coming winter, and, if no other teacher can be found in the meantime she will take up her work again on her return in the spring.\n\nIt is considered that it would be in the best interests of the Indian children to have the school continue and the Department has, therefore, to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to nominate a suitable person as teacher to succeed Mrs. Morris. The name of the teacher selected by you, together with the age, qualifications, experience, etc., should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Department would like you to be good enough to give this matter your early attention and endeavour to secure a teacher, as it is not desired to have this school remain closed longer than is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\nDear Mr. Lean,\n\nAs by my request of 24th requesting me & endeavoring to secure a teacher for the Stanley Ind. Day School to succeed Mr. Morris. I should be glad to nominate a suitable person if I could find one; but it seems impossible now so these days as the salary hitherto offered. I have been trying.\n\n1. The teacher must be found at a distance from Stanley. The cost of getting there is great. Who will pay this? I can not. If the teacher pays it, it will take many months salary.\n\n2. Mr. Morris would like to remain in his retired, & he has done the work capably. To send a teacher for 6 or 9 months would be an enormous expense for the work done.\n\n3. The winter is the hardest time to get a teacher to go such a place, & the worst time for any good results in the way of attendance. I was there lately, & I understand that if the Indians did not hear of a teacher at once, many children would go away for winter.\n\n4. Please tell me what you think of the matter: What salary you are prepared to offer, & whether you will pay the travelling expenses thereafter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.T. Saskatchewan\n\nBishop\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have not noticed that Mr. Macdonald is to return to Stanley in the spring. I think the school might remain closed until his return.\n\nR. F. Macdonald\nOttawa, October 17, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant in reference to the securing of a teacher for the Stanley Indian Day School to succeed Mrs. Morris, who resigned.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is considered, owing to the difficulty in securing a teacher and the expense of transportation and also in view of the fact that a number of the Indians are away with their families during the winter, that it would be well to allow this school to remain closed until such time as Mrs. Morris returns from England. If this meets with Your Lordship's approval you may arrange with Mrs. Morris to resume duties as soon as possible after she returns. The question of the amount of salary the Department will pay her will be considered when she is ready to resume her duties.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nStanley mission,\nvia Prince Albert,\n& Lac La Ronge, Sask.\nOct.4th, 1920.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI am writing to you on behalf of the Chief\nand Band of this Reserve, re the school rations and pay\nof the Woman preparing meals:\n\nFirstly - the children are allowed a mid-\nday meal only, consisting of 4 oz. flour per head, bacon,\ntea etc. maybe the Department is ignorant of the fact\nthat these children (ten in number) are left here on the\nReserve, during the winter, while the parents are away\nhunting. They send in when they can, meat etc., but\nsome are hunting at a distance, and only come in at Amas\ntime. Then again, four of the children are orphans, with\nno one to provide for them. Now my wife has been obliged\nto increase the ration, and is now issuing 5 lbs daily,\nincluding Saturday and Sundays (5 lbs for ten children)\nWhat I ask is that the Department increase the rations,\nand this coming winter forward a double supply of food for\nuse during winter 1921-1922, as the children situated as\nthey are here, require more than a mid-day meal.\n\nMRS MAGGIE BEAR RECEIVES THE SUM OF TEN\ndollars per month for doing same; she not only prepares\nthe noon meal, but provides, fish, rabbits, wood etc and\ntakes complete charge of those ten children out of school\nhours. You can see that the sum of $10.00 is quite in-\nadequate for the work she is performing. Will you kindly\nput the matter before the Department re increase of salary\nfor her?\n\nAnother Matter:- The Bishop last year ad-\nvised me, to hand the drugs and destitute supplies over to\nMr. Bear H.S.C.O., manager, ere leaving for England. He\ndistributed same last winter, but informs me that he has\nnot received payment for same (Oct. 1st, 1919- June 30th\n1920.) Mrs Morris was obliged to get a few things locally\nfor school children and she trusts she has not infringed\nthe rules of the Department by so doing.\n\nBut for this woman, the school could not be\ncarried on during the winter months. Philip McKenzie has\nkindly loaned his house and there Mrs. Bear and the child-\nren live. An improved Day School is needed here with\nsleeping accommodation for about 10 children. As the build-\ning of a house for the children, Archdeacon Mahay has promi-\nsed to take the matter up with the Department. This is\nquiet Reserve during winter months with just the Storekeeper\nSchool children, and ourselves around.\n\nTrusting that you will give these matters\nyour attention. Thanking you in anticipation,\n\nfaithfully yours\n(cgd.) C. Morris (Rev.)\nMissionary in charge.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of letter received from the Rev. C. Morris, Missionary in charge of the Stanley Mission, Lac la Ronge, in which he refers to certain matters relating to the school at that point.\n\nIn regard to the ration allowance for the children, I am not conversant with the arrangements made by the Department but it would appear that the request for additional rations is not unreasonable.\n\nIn regard to the preparation of the mid-day meals, I did not know that Mrs. Maggie Bear's duties comprised more than the preparation of the mid-day meals for the school children, but it seems that she has other work to perform for which $20.00 a month would seem to me a not unreasonable sum to pay her.\n\nIn regard to the handling of supplies by Mr. Bear, Manager of the Hudson Bay Company, I am not able to make any comment as I did not know what arrangements the Department has hitherto made.\n\nThe last paragraph in Mr. Morris' letter relates to the building of a house for the children, another matter in regard to which I have no information.\n\nI also enclose copy of a requisition by Mrs. Morris for supplies required at the school, which no doubt the Department will fill and forward to her. A copy of the Stanley Day School Quarterly Return also accompanies this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. C. Morris, missionary in charge of the Stanley Mission, Lac la Ronge, referring to certain matters relating to the school at that point.\n\nIn regard to the supplies for the mid-day meal I beg to say that supplies consisting of bacon, flour, tea, etc., for this purpose have already been forwarded and it will not be possible to increase the supply this season. The Department was not aware that a number of children are being boarded while their parents are away hunting. It is considered that the parents should provide meat and other supplies for the maintenance of their children over and above the amount provided by the mid-day meal. With reference to the building of a house for the accommodation of these children, I beg to say that there are no funds available for this purpose.\n\nRegarding an increase in salary to Mrs. Maggie Bear for the preparation of the mid-day meal I beg to say that at present the sum of $10.00 per month is allowed her for this work, but, in view of the fact that her duties comprise more than the preparation of the mid-day meals, the Department will allow her an increase to the rate of $20.00 per month, as recommended by you, payable for the ten months the school is in operation each year, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded from time to time covering her salary at that rate.\n\nWith reference to the dispensing at this point I beg to say in connection with this matter that Mr. Crombie, late Inspector of Indian Agencies, in a letter to the Department, No. 18-6, of March 4th, 1920, recommended that in future pay lists for the dispensers in the Isle a la Crosse Agency cover the period from September to September, and the Department in its reply of the 9th of March stated that it approved of his suggestion. No pay lists have been received for the salary of the dispensers in that agency covering the amount due from September 30th, 1919, and I have to request that you will be good enough to submit pay lists for the year ended September 30th, last, and you may include the name of Mr. Bear, who acted as dispenser at Stanley Mission during the winter, Mr. and Mrs. Morris were absent, namely, from October 1st, 1919, to June 30, 1920. Each of the dispensers is allowed $50.00 per annum for this work. As soon as these pay lists are received the amount of salary due the dispensers in this agency will be paid.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Morris, the teacher, purchased a few things locally for the school children. If she will forward an account with proper receipts attached covering the expenditure incurred by her, payment will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Morris has been advised of the contents thereof.\n\nReferring to your instructions to forward pay lists covering the services of Dispensers for the year ended September 30th, last, I beg to enclose one in favor of Mr. Bear, as directed therein. In regard to other Dispensers performing services in the Ile a la Crosse Agency, I beg to inquire whether those whose names were submitted under cover of Inspector Crombie's letter of the 4th March last, are still acting in the capacity of Dispensers, and if not what changes will be required to make the return complete.

Will you kindly have all cheques due me sent to that address? I am sorry that I cannot forward school returns but being quite out of forms I must procure some when at Pas from Indian agent there? I was obliged to close school early in month but the Indian woman continued to prepare meals for the school orphans.\n\nFaithfully yours\n\n(Sgd) Mabel Morris\nOTTAWA, Sept. 8th, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nA communication has been received from Mrs. Mabel Morris, the former teacher of the Stanley Indian Day School, in which she states that she has closed that school as her husband has been appointed missionary in charge of another district, and that she was leaving Stanley on the 20th of June last, to take up work on the Moose Lake Reserve, in The Pas Agency. Your Lordship is, no doubt, aware of this change having been made.\n\nIt will be necessary to secure another teacher for the Stanley school. However, in view of the fact that a number of the Indians are away with their families during the winter, and, owing to the difficulty in securing a teacher to take charge and the expense of transportation, it might be advisable to allow this school to remain closed until the Spring. The above is submitted for your consideration, but, if you think it advisable that the school should be continued, and you can obtain a teacher, the Department will consent to the school being reopened.\n\nThe name, qualifications and experience of any teacher nominated by you for the position should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased to have Your Lordship's views regarding the continuing of the school, and whether you can obtain a teacher or not.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

It is a difficult thing to carry on successfully especially, and it will be advisable, in accordance with your request, to allow it to remain closed until the spring.\n\nWhen the new school at Lac la Rouge is opened, the Stanley Indians will have the opportunity of sending a good number of children to the Boarding School.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

If a suitable teacher can then be obtained the Department will consent to the school being re-opened.\n\nI have the honour to be, Very Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

R. Taylor, enclosing a requisition for supplies for the Stanley Indian Day School. These are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nIt is noted from the agent's letter that you have appointed Rev. W. J. Paul as teacher. As you are aware, the arrangement made when you were in the Department was that the salary allowed the teacher would depend on his qualifications and I would, therefore, request you to advise me in this matter.\n\nI would also point out that it is advisable to notify the Department regarding the appointment of a new teacher before corresponding with the local officials.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It was the Rev. Canon Paul who made the requisition for the supplies asking that they be sent either to him or to the teacher on certain dates so as to get them before they leave for the North.\n\nBut Canon Paul is not the teacher, but the Superintending Clergyman of the whole of those Northern Missions. The teacher is Mr. Myatt who is recently out of the Normal School in Saskatoon with a second class certificate.\n\nThe understanding I had with the Department was that he would be paid $4 for every teaching day and I think it will be quite in order if the Department allow something for his travelling expenses.

He will be allowed salary at the rate of $5 for each day the school is in operation. Payment at this rate is made in lieu of any allowance for travelling expenses or for bonus, and is the full amount that can be allowed.

In this respect I would ask that a daily register, and a quantity of blank quarterly returns for day schools be sent to Mr. Myatt, to enable him to comply with instructions given him. These will be sent to him by mail to Lac la Ronge Sask., as this is his nearest Post Office. These forms should go direct to Mr. Myatt, as I will not be here to forward them to him, if they are sent to me, as I leave for the north this week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA. CANADA.\nStanley Mission,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.,\nAugust 10th, 1924.\n\nCommissioner W.M. Graham,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to send you a few lines with regard to a matter which affects the welfare of our band. During the present summer the children are attending the Day School here, as Mr. Agent Taylor saw when he visited Stanley. The school will be closed for the winter in September, but I hope that arrangements can be made to re-open the school next June, and to keep it open during the following winter. The band would provide a suitable house and a woman to look after the children if you could arrange for her to receive wages from the Indian Department. The men would help with the food by giving fish and moose meat when possible, if the Department would supply the other rations. This arrangement worked successfully when Mrs. Morris was teaching here about four years ago.\n\nWe should also be grateful if during the summer months the midday meal could be provided for the children. Some of the children have to cross the river to go to school and there is not time for them to paddle back across the river to get their dinner at home.\n\nOur band would be grateful to you if you could help them in these ways.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours faithfully\n\nSigned\n\nAmos Charles (Chief)\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a petition that I received from Chief Amos Charles, requesting that the school at his reserve be re-opened next spring and continued through the winter.\n\nI do not think it will be possible to carry on this day school during the winter months; it would mean sending a married woman up there to look after the children and would entail considerable added expense. We are paying a teacher $130.00 per month, which is a lot of money.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 307-11A of the 9th instant, with reference to the Stanley Indian Day School. I have read the copy of Chief Amos Charles' letter; but I agree with you that for the present this school should be conducted during the summer only.\n\nI wish to point out that the salary is not at the rate of $150 per month, but is $5 per teaching day, without bonus. This is in harmony with the Department's practice in the case of outlying schools where the teaching services are likely of an intermittent character.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n9. Stanley. This school has done very well during the summer months. Thirty children were on the roll with an average attendance of twenty-seven, in addition to the fifteen children sent away to Lac la Ronge Residence school. The Indians are asking for an all year teacher, such as they had with Mrs. Morris. They have a large Indian house and they want the Department to find the rations and pay for a woman care-taker so as to keep the children there during the hunting season just as they did a few years ago. They say the Indian Agent promised to support this. This was the method adopted in Mrs. Morris' time. They would still send the present children (15) to Lac la Ronge Boarding School.\n\nBibb Floyd\nInterview\nOctober 24\nOttawa, November 11, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the advisability of conducting a ten months' day school at Stanley, I have now to inform Your Lordship that Mr. Commissioner Graham reports as follows:\n\n\"I do not think it will be possible to carry on this day school during the winter months. It would mean sending a married woman up there to look after the children and would entail considerable added expense.\"\n\nThe Department considers that the present arrangement, which allows a salary for a qualified teacher, is all that can be undertaken at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The children will be left in the care of some family, that they might be enabled to attend school. To assist in this scheme, they ask for an advance from funds at their credit in Ottawa to purchase some provisions for the keep of these children. I think this would be a good plan, but I would suggest that, if the Department agrees, Mr. Taylor should be paid a straight salary and not $5.00 per teaching day as at present. In the matter of food asked for, I would advise the following to be supplied:\n\n- 10 sacks flour\n- 300 lbs. bacon\n- 50 \" beans\n- 50 \" rice\n- 25 \" tea\n\nTo this will be added fish and meat supplied by parents.\n\nW. R. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a long report on the Treaty 10 trip which was written by Mr. Indian Agent Taylor.\n\nWith regard to the school which is taught by Mr. Taylor in the Stanley district, I would say that little would be gained by sending in the supplies asked for. If the Department see fit to do this, very well, but I do not think this is very necessary.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your letter of the 8th instant covering Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's report on Treaty 10. The Department is not disposed at the present time to continuing the Stanley Indian Day School during the winter months. His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan understands this, and when in June, last, he nominated Mr. F. J. Taylor, the present teacher, it was for a period of three months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nUnder cover of your #132-4-1 dated the 16th September last, you advised me that the Department is not disposed at the present time to continue the Stanley Indian Day School during the winter months, and that this was understood by the Bishop of Saskatchewan. The latter recently addressed a communication to the Agent, Mr. W. R. Taylor enclosing one from the Rev. Canon W.E.J. Paul. The latter advises Mr. Taylor that the school teacher at Stanley is remaining at that point for the winter and keeping the school open. The children are being looked after by a widow, Mrs. Hardlot, in a house lent for the purpose, and the Canon asks if the Department will pay Mrs. Hardlot $10.00 per month. A similar monthly payment was I believe made by the Department on a former occasion under like circumstances, and the arrangements might be put into effect again. I assume of course that the keeping open of the school will not result in any other expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Nov. 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 307-11 of the 20th instant, with reference to the Stanley Indian Day School continuing its activity during the winter months. I note that a request has been made for a payment of $10 per month to a woman who is looking after the children. I regret that the Department cannot give favourable consideration, as it was clearly indicated that this was a summer school only. I am satisfied that, if we allowed the present request, the Department would be asked to pay the teacher's salary and other expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI forward herewith the return submitted by Mr. F.J. Taylor the teacher at the Stanley Day School for the quarter ended September 30th, 1925.\n\nIn forwarding this report Mr. F.J. Taylor the teacher says that he remained at Stanley and kept the school open until the end of December. In fact, it was not until the 15th of January that he received instructions from the Bishop of Saskatchewan to close the school. He asks that what can be done for him will be done to endeavour to obtain for him the payment for the December quarter.\n\nIt is quite clear from the correspondence on file in this office that the blunder in retaining him at Stanley was not the fault of the Department at Ottawa or at this office. The Bishop of Saskatchewan admits that he was aware of the arrangements that Mr. F.J. Taylor was only to remain during the summer months. He stated in a letter dated the 26th of December that he did not then know who authorized Mr. Taylor's remaining at Stanley after the summer term was over. The Department therefore is under no obligation.\n\nMr. F.J. Taylor does not seem to be at all clear as to how the mistake was made, but states that he was given to understand by Mr. Wallace, who I believe is the Secretary of the Synod, that this Department would be willing to keep open the school provided he would be willing to remain. This of course was not the understanding with the Church Authorities, and I cannot recommend payment to Mr. Taylor by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 25, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Stanley Day School. A cheque in payment of the amount due the teacher is being sent to him.\n\nAs you state it was distinctly understood in previous correspondence that this school was to be open for three months only and, therefore, the Department is not prepared to allow Mr. F.J. Taylor salary for any further period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M.

Canon Paul. There is still the open question about the teacher last year, Mr. Taylor, carrying on the summer school right over into the winter and early spring. He claims that he had the recognition of the Indian Agent, and he thought the support of the Indian Department, and thinking that it depended wholly on the willingness of the Indians to keep their children there, he carried on. Of course he has had nothing but the summer stipend and feels that he has a strong grievance against the Department, and has made no return of the money the Synod advanced to him to make the journey up there. I was in England at the time or I should have questioned his staying there long before I did, but he seems to have acted in a bone fide way, though the letters of the Department to our Synod Office gave no authority for anything but the summer school.\n\nG. H. Saskatchewan.\nBishop.\nRegina, Sask., August 27th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am submitting my report on the annuity payments throughout Treaty No. 10, for 1926.\n\nAMOS CHARLES' BARD\n\nThe day school is being kept open during the summer months. This means about four months in the year. I cannot see what use this will be to the children, as they go to school six hours a day for four months, and the rest of the year they are forgetting all they have learned. I visited the school for a short while before I left, but cannot say anything as to progress. The pupils appeared to be all beginners, doing elementary work. I found these Indians happy and contented.\n\nW. R. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE.\n\nPellicam Narrows Detachment.\nAugust 27th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nSTANLEY\n\nA summer school is maintained on the reserve. I visited there during school hours and found only five pupils. Mr. Strong the teacher informed me that the attendance was low on account of the sickness (Whooping-Cough) among the children. I went over the register with him and found the names of several children absent who were not sick or who had recovered. I visited the patients of the absent children and also took the matter up with the Chief and Councillors with the result that when I visited the reserve a few days later on my way back from Lac La Ronge there was thirteen children attending the school, seeing that the school is operated at no little expense to the government, I impressed on the Indians and all concerned that it was the Government's wish that it be well attended.\n\nG. L. Jennings, Supt.\nOTTAWA, May 10th, 1926.\n\nRight Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAppointment of John Strong to Stanley and Raymond\nHerfield to Pelican Narrows Summer Schools approved STOP\nSalary Five Dollars per teaching day for three summer months.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\n\nChg. Dept., I.A.\nOn the 17th ult., accompanied by Sp. Const. Canada, with power canoe, I left on a police patrol to Stanley and Lac La Ronge, Sask. I arrived at Stanley the following night, staying there until the morning of the 21st ult., when I left for Lac La Ronge settlement where I arrived the same evening. The patrol had good travelling weather, but very low water was noted and two extra portages had to be made. Residents report the water the lowest they have ever seen it; slight frosts have already visited the district killing some garden vegetables and flowers. No. 3 Photographic Detachment of the R.C.A.Force (3 aeroplanes) on survey work were found engaged working out of the settlement, the patrol put up at La Ronge until the morning of the 27th ult., when a start was made for Pelican Narrows, where the patrol arrived back on the evening of the 9th ult.\n\nAt Stanley settlement I met four prospectors, and learned that others had visited the district during the summer, a number of the Indians were staying at the settlement, while others were camped nearby where the fishing was good, their health appeared to be good and no cases of destitution came to my notice, the amount of destitute supplies for this band has been increased this year. No serious crime came to my attention. I learned that Solomon Cook, Charles Cook and Phillip Charles, Indians, were contemplating trapping west of Lac Du Brochet and intended leaving their families at the settlement all winter. Solomon Cook did so last winter and did not arrange for sufficient upkeep for his family. I took this matter up with the men and told them they had to take their families with them or else arrange for their upkeep during the winter. I visited the day school and learned from Miss B. Allcock-teacher, that with one exception, the attendance had been satisfactory during the past summer months, the exception was Samuel Charles, age 13, son of Osidian Charles, this boy will not attend school regularly, out of 40 teaching days he has only attended on 14 days, and last year out of 69 teaching days he only attended 11 days. I spoke to this boy and also his parents. I would respectfully suggest that perhaps the Dept. of Indian Affairs would arrange to have this boy sent to an Indian industrial school, this as an example to others. I did not take any action against the parents as there is no Justice of the Peace at Stanley.\n\nIndians of this settlement who trapped near Hatchet Lake (Hollaston Lake on maps) last winter, did not have a very successful fur hunt; it is reported that there were too many trappers in that district.\n\nAt Lac La Ronge I investigated a drowning accident in which Simon Morasty and Solomon Hallett-Indians, lost their lives, and a shooting accident which proved fatal to Alfred Rat-Indian. I have\nsubmitted separate reports regarding these. A large number of prospectors have visited this district during the summer, and aeroplanes are a common sight there. I did not hear of any case in which prospectors interfered with the Indians; a number of Indians have obtained work as guides, fighting bush fires and clearing the channel in the Montreal River; this work has proved a great help to them, and has enabled them to pass the summer comfortably.\n\nRegarding the use of Indian medicine, mentioned in my report of Jan. 26th last, Miss O.J. Gibson, registered nurse at the school and mission, states that more Indians and half-breeds are now opposed to her for drugs and treatment; she has not heard of John Ross or Mrs. Irwin prescribing Indian medicine since last winter. I made what other enquiries I could regarding this matter, and believe the practice has now stopped. The girl Mary Charles\u2014mentioned in my report of Jan. 26th\u2014died two weeks after I visited her.\n\nI heard rumours that a white trapper named Frank Russell, had run off a batch of brew, on an island a few miles from the settlement, towards the end of last June, as far as I could find out, no Indians were mixed up in it; Russell had left for his winter trapping grounds before the patrol reached the settlement, and I did not think it of any use to patrol to his trapping camp and to search it.\n\nThe supply of destitute rations for the Indians in the district has been increased; these rations are distributed by the Principal of the Indian Boarding School, who was away on holidays while the patrol was at the scene. The residents of the settlement were preparing for the winter commercial fishing season, and everything points to them passing a good winter.\n\nI was away thirteen days on this patrol and covered 320 miles by canoe.\n\nCorpl.\n(J.J.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nWith reference to establishing ten months' schools at Stanley and Pelican Narrows, Saskatchewan, we understand that the Department's Agents have decided that the three months' schools are not a success./ Rev's E. Ahenakew and H.E. Hives have talked the matter over with the Indians at Stanley and they are ready to let children of school age stay at Stanley for the Winter while they themselves go trapping if suitable arrangements are made for the care of the children. When Mrs. Morris was in charge of this School up to the year 1921, a widow woman was allowed $10 per month by the Department to cook for these children and I believe they slept in one of the Indian houses. Will the Department be willing to make some arrangement of this kind for the care of the children? We expect to have no difficulty in finding a teacher when the time comes. We beg to recommend strongly that this school be carried on as a ten months' school instead of a Summer School. With regard to rations, the Department used to send up bacon, rice, tea &c., and the Indians helped with fish and moose-meat.\n\nRe \"Pelican Narrows\" School, the Indians have decided that Sandy Narrows would be a better site for the School than Pelican Narrows. They would leave their children there during the Winter and provide fish and wild meat as at Stanley. They were disappointed at not having a School last Summer, but are pleased now at the thought of having a ten months' School.\nThere is no school building or teacher's residence at either Pelican or Sandy Narrows. When the Summer School was held, the Church building was used for a school and the teacher lived either in a tent or in an Indian house. New buildings would therefore be needed at Sandy Narrows and all school equipment and supplies. The Indians at this point have had very little chance of getting their children educated and we strongly urge that this new effort be undertaken. Rev. E. Ahenakew talked over this matter with Mr. Russell Ferrier in Ottawa in September and I believe he will give a favourable report on the matter. Another reason why Sandy Narrows seems to be the better site is that there is good soil there and the Indians have quite large potato gardens at that point and the fishing is better than at Pelican Narrows.\n\nHoping that this application will receive favourable consideration,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul\n\nArchdeacon.\n\nWEJP: NH\nOttawa, November 20, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to establishing an Indian day school at Stanley and at Pelican Narrows during a ten months' period in each year.\n\nRegarding the school at Stanley, I have to say that the Department will be pleased to give favourable consideration to the operation of this school for a ten months' period each year, starting from next spring. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and the earliest date we could place this school on a permanent basis would be after April 1st, next. In due time, you could nominate the services of a teacher, and when forwarding the nomination, I shall be pleased if you will give full particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the person whom you nominate for this school. The Department would also be favourably disposed to provide a certain amount of supplies in the way of food, also an allowance for the person who prepares and cooks same.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding your request for a ten months' school at Sandy Narrows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul, M.A., L.L.B.,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter (No. 132-4-1) of the 20th inst., and I am very pleased to hear that the Department will operate Stanley School for ten months each year, starting from next spring. We shall look out for a suitable teacher and give full particulars as to qualifications or experience as requested.\n\nI note that the Department will provide a certain amount of food for the children and an allowance for the person who prepares it. This will be a great help to the Stanley Indians.\n\nYours faithfully,\nW. L. J. Paul.\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of Nov. 20th. (no. 132-4-1) re Stanley Day School,- the Mission Board of the Diocese of Sask. met today, and I asked to notify you, that the mission house at Stanley is an old building and not suitable for winter residence. It has only been occupied in summer during recent years.\n\nThe Mission Board presumes that the Dept. will build teacher's quarters at Stanley as at Sandy Narrows as the Mission building is not suitable. Will these quarters have a room in which the children can have their midday meal?\n\nMy remarks as to the best time for holidays in my letter to Sandy Narrows would apply to this school also.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I regret that there has been no provision for a teacher's residence. If the work at Stanley is to be permanent, you will, no doubt, want a resident missionary on the reserve, and I wish to enquire if the Church intends to provide suitable accommodation.\n\nRegarding the annual holiday period, I have to say that the Department will approve of this school being closed during the two months' period the Indians are away at their winter trapping or during the muskrat season, whichever of these periods is considered to be the most advantageous by the Indian Agent. As the Indians will be on the reserve during July and August, the school could be conducted during these months in place of the two month's period that may be chosen as the annual holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

L. J. Paul\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the Day-school at Stanley, the Rev. H.E. Hives has been asked to arrange for the re-modelling of the Mission House there so as to make it habitable all the year. It may be necessary to pull down the old house, discard the lower logs which have rotted, and rebuild a smaller house, using the old lumber but new logs where necessary. The Mission Fund has very little money to put on buildings, but we will do the best we can. I have already written to two teachers. Would you kindly let me know what salary would be allowed (1) for a 1st class teacher, and (2) for a 2nd class teacher.\n\nAs to the date of opening the school. The Indians do not come in from their trapping-grounds till open water, i.e., about the beginning of June; and from early April till June it is almost impossible to get to Stanley, unless by air, as it is half ice ad half open water. I should suggest therefore that the school be opened\nOttawa, March 9, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the proposed Indian day school at Stanley, and requesting to be informed as to the salary that would be allowed for teaching services.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, if the teacher appointed devotes his full time to teaching duties, we would allow a considerably higher salary than if he has to carry out both missionary and teaching duties. In this connection, you could be guided by the salaries allowed in cases of other schools in the Diocese of Saskatchewan. If you will state whether the person engaged is to perform teaching duties only or whether he will also be required to act in the dual capacity of teacher and missionary, the Department will be in a position to decide the salary that would be allowed. The qualifications and experience of the teacher appointed should also be forwarded. It is noted that it is hoped to have this school opened about the beginning of June, next, at which time the Indians will be returning from their trapping grounds. The school could be conducted during the summer season and the holiday period arranged for some time convenient during the winter.\n\nIt is noted that arrangements are being made for the remodelling of the mission house to provide suitable living accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gilmore who is a fully-qualified First-class Teacher. He is at present Principal of the Village School at Leask, and was for some time Principal of the Birch Hills School, both in Saskatchewan. Mr. Gilmore has a desire to work amongst the Indians and is willing to give up his present position in order to take up this work. He is a widower and his children are practically grown up and would not be with him at Stanley. I enclose his last Inspector's Report. He cannot leave his present school till the June examinations are over, therefore he could not reach Stanley till almost the middle of July, but Mrs. Alan Nunn (n\u00e9e Miss Barbara Alcock) who taught the Stanley School in 1927 is living now at Lac la Ronge and is willing to go to Stanley on June 1st and teach until Mr. Gilmore can come. She is a first class teacher and her work there before was satisfactory. Her husband is head Manager of Revillon Freres Posts in that district and she would probably stay at the Revillon Co. House while she is there. We are having the Mission House put in order for Mr. Gilmore.\n\nI hope that this arrangement will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. Paul\n\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, May 12, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, nominating the services of Mr. F. M. Gilmore for the position as teacher of the Stanley Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Gilmore. It is noted that he will not be able to take up duties at Stanley until the middle of July, next, and, in the meantime, Mrs. Alan Nunn (nee Miss Barbara Alook), who taught this school in 1927-28, will go to Stanley on June 1st, and teach until Mr. Gilmore arrives. This arrangement is approved. Mrs. Nunn will be allowed salary during the period she teaches at the rate of $5 per teaching day. She should prepare a return on the form for that purpose showing the attendance and days taught by her, in order that the salary due for her services can be paid.\n\nI have to request that you will inform Mr. Gilmore of his appointment, and arrange with him to take up duties on or about the time mentioned by you, viz., the middle of July, next. You might also inform Mrs. Nunn that the Department approves of her temporary appointment - from the 1st of June until Mr. Gilmore arrives.\n\nYou have not stated whether Mr. Gilmore will carry on missionary as well as teaching duties. As stated in our letter of March 9th, last, a considerably higher salary would be allowed if he devotes his full time to teaching duties only. If you will state the duties it is intended that he will perform at Stanley, consideration will then be given as to the salary this Department will allow him for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI visited this school on July the 16th and found eleven boys and thirteen girls present. Mrs. Nunn, a properly qualified teacher was acting in a temporary capacity, pending the arrival of the regularly appointed teacher. The average attendance for July, up to the time of my visit, was twenty pupils.\n\nA married man.\nmarried man named Mr. T.M. Gilmore, has been appointed as teacher, and his arrival was daily expected when I was there. It is, I understand, the intention to keep this school open all the year round, and in order to do this, there are certain difficulties which will have to be met. It is impossible for the parents to reside at Stanley steadily, inasmuch as their sole source of livelihood is derived from hunting, fishing and trapping, and these occupations necessarily entail them being at widely scattered points. If they were to reside steadily at Stanley, they could not make a living. They appreciate this, and the members of the band and myself had a long talk over the question. They appear to be very anxious to have their children given an opportunity to acquire an education, and in particular a knowledge of the English language. Very few members of this band speak English. They stated that they had two houses available for the use of the children, and proposed that the girls be given one house and the boys the other, and that each house should be in charge of an Indian woman who would do the cooking for them and give them supervision. A man would remain to provide fish and fire-wood for them. They want to give this a trial and agreed to request the Department to expend sufficient from the funds of their band to provide flour, tea, sugar and lard. They will find the meat and fish. I would recommend that their request be given consideration so that a trial may be made of this plan, during the coming winter, as it would be difficult at this time of the year to get supplies in to them, I would suggest that if this plan receives favourable consideration that the teacher be authorized to purchase what is necessary locally. There\n\nis a branch\nis a branch of both the Hudson's Bay Company and Revillon Freres at this point, and they allow the Department 25% off their regular prices, but I think it would be worth while to ask Revillon Freres to apply the goods at the same price as the destitute supplies were delivered under contract.\n\nI am attaching hereto the resolution signed by the Chief and Head Men and witnessed by myself.\n\nSchool is held in a log building, which was intended to be a 1\u00bd story building, but there is no upstairs. The Indians promised to replaster and put this building into proper repair for the winter months. They have no school furniture, but just a few rough benches and tables.\n\nPart of the equipment asked for by the Indians was a team of horses and a bob-sleigh to enable them to haul wood for the school and bring in supplies from Isle a la Crosse. I would not advise sending a team in until we are assured that sufficient hay has been put up to feed them during the winter. I may say in this connection that the school is built on a point on the Churchill River and the wood has to be rafted in in the summer and hauled by dogs in the winter. In the event of horses being supplied, the teacher would have to be made responsible for their care.\n\nThe Indians appear to be really anxious to have this school kept open all year round, and I found them very willing to promise to do their share in making this possible.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 8th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThere has been some difficulty in keeping the children in school at the Day school of the Amos Charles Reserve at Stanley, as the children have to accompany their parents on the hunt, which is their only means of making a livelihood. With regard to the Indian boys and girls being left in charge of an Indian woman or man, I doubt very much whether this would be a satisfactory arrangement. I might, however, suggest that, if there were a large number of children, it would be wise to employ a white man and his wife to supervise these boys and girls. It is so late in the season that it would be practically impossible to complete arrangements for this plan, but I would ask that this matter be given consideration by the Department, so that it might be carried out in the manner which I suggested, probably next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Besides, the teacher would find it hard to get out at that time - almost impossible in fact.\n\n(2) The people are in for Easter now and will want to take their children home to the bush with them as the rat & beaver season is open and they could not come back for them at end of April.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the March quarter return of the Stanley Indian Day School, on which it is stated that, owing to local conditions, it would be preferable to have the holidays taken during the months of April and May, and the note appearing on the return would indicate that the teacher closed the school on March 31st.

It is presumed from the teacher's remarks that the school has been closed since the first instant on account of the Indians being away on their trap lines.

REGINA, SASK., 11th April, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department letter No. 132-4-1, dated last instant, I beg to forward herewith copy of the quarterly attendance return for the Stanley Indian Day School for the quarter ended December 31st, 1932. I may explain that early in January an attendance return was received from the teacher on plain paper, as she had apparently run out of forms. This return was forwarded immediately to Ottawa, but may have been overlooked or gone astray. Subsequently I received a copy on the proper form, which I am attaching hereto. With reference to the return for the March quarter, I think this must have been forwarded also as I cannot locate it in this office. In the event of its having gone astray I have written the teacher requesting her to forward another copy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLeask, Sask.\nJuly 17th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWould the Department consider spending $170.00 per teaching year in order to pay women for looking after children in order that they may attend the Stanley Indian Day School? Members brought this question up when I was paying Amos Charles Band. No doubt you are aware that hunting is the sole means of their livelihood, which means that if children cannot be left in charge of some person on the reserve they must go with their parents. There are twenty-two children enrolled at this school, and with proper cooperation I think the present teacher Miss Merritt would accomplish good work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n2506-8-31.\n\nOttawa, August 9, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the supplying of a grant to the amount of $170, to pay Indian women for taking care of children, in order that they can attend day school while their parents are absent from the reserve at the hunt.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation this year has been so greatly reduced, I regret it will not be possible to provide the amount required to pay for the care of these children. If the Indian parents are unable to arrange for the proper care of their children during their absence, without cost to the Department, the children will have to accompany their parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, August 14th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 8-31 of the 5th instant, enclosing a requisition for supplies for the Stanley Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher requests 12 boxes of Esquimo biscuits. In this connection, I would refer you to your Voucher 7493, dated April 26th, last, covering the cost of 5,100 lbs. of biscuits supplied to your agency by the Independent Biscuit Company. Our records show that this includes the following:\n\n- 600 lbs. - Sturgeon Lake\n- 500 \" - Mistawasis\n- 900 \" - Ahtahkakoops\n- 600 \" - Big River\n- 300 \" - Montreal Lake\n- 500 \" - Little Red River\n- 600 \" - Stanley\n- 600 \" - Pelican Narrows\n\nIn view of the above, the Department considers that you must have on hand 600 lbs. of biscuits intended for the Stanley School. I note that you do not intend to send them until they can be shipped via winter freight.\n\nYou might let the Department have a report immediately regarding the advisability of keeping this school open during the winter months of 1933-34. Do you consider that the attendance during that time will justify keeping the school open?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nL'ASK, SASK.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 132-44 of the 14th ultimo, wherein you ask for a report regarding the advisibility of keeping Stanley Indian Day School open during the winter months of 1933-34.\n\nThe administration of this school was only turned over to this agency this year and on account of the distance, it is only possible to visit this reserve once a year. This summer I paid my first visit to this school. Miss Merritt, who is in charge, is doing excellent work, though is rather handicapped through parents having to make a livelihood solely from hunting and trapping, which means that the children do not attend as regularly as they should. In my opinion, I think it would be worth while keeping the school open during the coming winter months and, if it is found that the attendance does not warrant operating this school, that same then be closed. If this course is followed, it would mean that children would have to be sent to the Lac La Ronge boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Stanley Day School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, I beg to say that this school may be kept open during the winter months of 1933-34. You should keep as close a watch as possible on the attendance during that period, in order that we will be in a position to decide what action should be taken during the winter of 1934-35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find Day School Return for Amos Charles Band, Stanley, Sask., for quarter ended March 31st, 1934.\n\nWill you please advise me if it is the intention to keep this school open as Miss Merrett writes as follows:\n\n\"The school is now closed until June, when the people will be returning after the spring hunt. I have not received any letter yet from the department to say this is in order, but am afraid there is no option.\n\nI shall be glad to know what the department decide with regard to the school next winter at the earliest opportunity, as our plans have to be made so long in advance.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nLeask, Sask.,\nAugust 6th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRelying to your letter No. 132-4-1 dated July 30th, 1934. I certainly would recommend that Stanley Indian Day School be conducted on a summer basis. Indians of this Band make their living from hunting and trapping and are very little at home which means it is impossible to have a good attendance during winter months. Miss Merritt last winter boarded children out of her own private funds, and she does not feel like continuing to do so. If you have a vacancy on any reserve for a teacher I certainly would recommend Miss Merritt, as there is no doubt she is a first-class teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, August 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, in which you recommend that the Stanley Indian Day School be conducted on a seasonal basis. The Department, therefore, understands that this school will close at the end of the present month.\n\nAbout March first, next, you should write the Department stating the date on which you consider this school should be reopened, in order that arrangements may be made to secure a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, September 14, 1934.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Stanley Indian Day School.\n\nIn advising Mr. Agent Davis that we approved of the school closing on August 30th, the Department was acting on information that we had received from him, indicating that this was the date on which Miss Merritt intended to close the school. I note from your letter that you have made arrangements with her to continue the school until November 30th, and Mr. Agent Davis is being informed that we are prepared to allow her salary until that date. If, however, it is considered advisable to close the school before that time, the Department has no objections.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 132-4-1 of the 14th inst., advising me that it will be in order for the Stanley Indian Day School to remain open until November 30th next. I am not sure if Miss Merritt has already left Stanley, if she has not I will advise her next mail October 2nd, of your instructions.\n\nI may point out that when I was at Stanley during June last it was the full intention then of Miss Merritt to close school at end of August.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 132-4-1 dated August 15, 1934, re Stanley Indian Day School. I would recommend that this school be re-opened as from June 1st. to October 30th. 1935. There is no use opening school before this date as no doubt parents will be only returning from trap lines about that time.\n\nI am doubtful if the expense warrants continuing this school and results obtained. However, we can try out school for another summer. In my opinion children should be sent to Boarding School, as parents are very little on their own reserve as hunting and trapping is their main source of livelihood.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should request him to forward a return showing the names of the pupils in attendance, days taught, etc., during that month.\n\nAt the end of each month, the teacher should submit a return to the Department through your office and, when this is received, his salary will be paid.

Paul, Synod Office, Prince Albert, Sask., re Stanley Seasonal Day School, which please return after perusal.\n\nRegarding his suggestion that Spence go around to camps I believe it would be just a time and money, most of these Indians are on the move and they are certainly not equipped to have school at home.\n\nThe people at Stanley arrive in June and leave end of August for their trap lines, this means children are only in school at the most three months of the year. I would suggest that this school not be re-opened this summer, and children now from Montreal Lake Reserve where there is a day school who are at present attending the Lac-la-Ronge Boarding School be sent home where they could go to their own day school, and children taken from Stanley to Lac-la-Ronge. This would be more satisfactory as Day School at Stanley is more or less a waste of money as no results can be obtained where children are not going all the time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDirector,\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nRe Stanley Seasonal School.\n\nMr. Ahab Spence will finish his College course at the beginning of May, and the Bishop has asked me to nominate him as Teacher of above School for the coming season.\n\nLast year the Department said the school should be kept open from June 1st. to Oct. 31st, but it seems impossible to do this, as the people all go away to distant trapping grounds in September. Do you think it would be possible to arrange for the school children to be looked after at Stanley while their parents were away as was done a few years ago?\n\nSpence himself would rather spend the remainder of the year doing missionary work exclusively, but it will be easier for us to find the balance of his salary, if he receives a salary from the Department for some considerable portion of the year. And of course the children will make better progress if the school term lasts longer.\n\nHe plans to visit the trapping camps during the winter, and to stay a good many days in each camp, and perhaps in this way he could help the children to go on with their studies during the winter. I believe in this way he could earn the $475, (5 months @ $95 per month) which the Department offered last year. Would you be willing to recommend this suggestion to the Department?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L.

W. E. J. Paul, with reference to the Stanley Seasonal School.\n\nThe last return of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School has been reviewed but this does not show any children at that school from Montreal Lake. If you are aware of any children from that reserve at the Lac La Ronge School, please let me know the approximate number.\n\nThe Department is inclined to favour the continuance of the Stanley Seasonal School for the summer of 1937, at least. If such action is taken, it will give you more time to consider the matter and, possibly, you will have an opportunity of visiting Stanley during the coming summer. The attendance at this school last summer was, approximately, thirteen (13) pupils.\n\nPlease let me hear further from you in connection with this school with the idea in mind that it will only be conducted from June 1st to August 31st.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nF. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.\nMarch 29th\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 132-4-1 of the 17th inst. re Stanley Seasonal School. I have to advise you that there are 12 pupils of William Charles Band (Montreal Lake) attending Lac-la-Ronge Boarding School.\n\nAt Stanley there about thirty children of school age, and as these are travelling Indians they are only at Stanley for three months as mentioned in your letter. Probably for this year it would be better if school was re-opened for months of June, July and August 1937, though children derive very little advantage when opened for such a short time.\n\nIf a school was operated for the full year the only way it could be done would be to get some of the old widows to stay around the Post to look after these children with department furnishing food supplies. In my opinion it would accomplish more than a Boarding School as children would be leading their natural lives.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 7, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, the Stanley Seasonal School may be continued during the summer of 1937. It is understood that Mr. Ahab Spence is prepared to resume duties at this school, and he will be allowed salary at the same rate as last year, viz.: $95.00 a teaching month. You should arrange with him to prepare and forward to the Department the usual returns, showing the attendance, days taught, etc. His salary will be paid on receipt of these returns, which should be forwarded through your office.\n\nAs mentioned in official letter of the 17th ultimo, you should report further on this school if you have an opportunity of visiting Stanley during the coming summer.\n\nI doubt if the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your letter of the 29th ultimo could be put into effect. It would probably involve supplying relief, both for the children and for those looking after them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nH. S.

The returns for the\nmonth of June went out on the steam\nfrom Red Deer River the 1st Wednesday in July.\nI marked them personally.\n\nThe returns for July & August went\nfrom Prince Albert where I marked\nthem. And so know that there's\nno mistakes. I am enclosing\nMr. Murray's letter which speaks\nfor himself. The very same thing\nhappened last year when I was\nup North in Stanley. I did\nnot get a clue from Mr. Murray\nhow do you know prices\nin a place like Stanley at No.\nH. 13 and Revell's is the excellent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-3, part 1)\nyet because I was not receiving my quarterly salary I had to pay these fines. Here I am in much a Reserve without salary and at the very time he says a man needs his money to buy his winter's supply of vegetables, fruit and meat. The situation is unbearable and I would suggest you write Mr. Murray if the delay not writing him on this matter. The fact remains I have to send them over again. I mean that my letter to Mr. Stanley, teacher in Stanley about Dec. 15th and perhaps not until Jan. 15th. Then he would be there a month and I might receive a reply in February or March. Therefore I must be matter adjusted without further delay.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gilmour, whose services as teacher at the Stanley Day School, Ile a la Crosse Agency, terminated on September 2nd. Mr. Gilmour stated in his letter that he had left the school returns in the school register at Stanley and, as it would take some time to get them from there, he urged that his salary be paid at once. I replied informing him that on the same date his letter was received here a copy of the school returns for the period he mentioned came to hand as well and I therefore concluded that the original return must have gone forward to Ottawa direct from Stanley. I am today in receipt of a further urgent letter from Mr. Gilmour stating that he is hard up for cash and asking me to wire particulars of the services to the Department to avoid delay. This however I do not consider would meet with your approval. I am therefore forwarding the copy of the school return which was sent to me and trust that a cheque will be forwarded to Mr. Gilmour as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Hurison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your No. 307-11 of the 1st instant, I beg to say that cheque in payment of Mr. Gilmore's services at the Stanley Indian Day School for the months of June, July and August is being sent to Rev. Henry Wallace, Synod Office, Prince Albert, Sask.

Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your recent letter, it is noted that you taught at the Stanley Indian Day School during the months of June, July and August. The Department is, therefore, issuing a cheque for $285.00, less 10%. This is being drawn in favour of the Diocese of Saskatchewan and sent to Rev. Henry Wallace, Synod Office, Prince Albert, Sask.

Henry Wallace, Synod Office, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nThe delay in paying the teacher's salary for the quarter ended December 31st, last, is due to the fact that no return has been received.

At the end of May you should issue a cheque in his favour for the period April 29 to May 31 inclusive. At the end of June a cheque for one month's salary should be sent to him. The cheques should be sent to the following address:\n\nRev. A. Spence,\nc/o M. & C.

Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nVery much appreciated the receipt of a cheque for Eighty-five and fifty cents ($85.50) as payment for the teaching month of June, and Ninety-six ($96.00) for the month of May. I understood the salary for each teaching month was Ninety-five ($95.00) straight. May I inquire why the difference?\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Rev.) Ahab Spence\nMissionary.\nOttawa, July 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I may say that the monthly salary rate for the teacher of the Stanley School is $90.00. The information that we received indicated that you commenced duties on April 29; consequently, you were paid for 2 days in April, or 2/30 of 90 = $6.00 plus $90.00 for the month of May, making a total of $96.00.\n\nBy a recent Order-in-council we are required to deduct 5% from all salaries of employees in the Public Service appointed to temporary positions since September 1, 1939. This money is deposited and principal and interest is repaid when you give up duties as teacher of an Indian day school. Consequently, 5% was deducted from your $90.00 salary for the month of June and a cheque for $85.50 was sent you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Ahab Spence,\nThe Stanley Mission,\nc/o M & C Aviation Co.,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a requisition dated May 16th for supplies for the Stanley Indian Day School. Any delay that may occur in having these supplies delivered will be due in part to the fact that the requisition was not forwarded promptly to this office.\n\nIf at all possible, the Department desires to avoid shipping classroom supplies by air owing to the expense involved. However, in the present instance, there appears to be no other alternative in view of the delay in forwarding the requisition.\n\nMr. Spence was paid salary to July 10th, 1941, but did not forward any return for that period. In order to complete our records, it would be appreciated if you would arrange to have him forward the usual return for that period.\n\nPlease instruct Mr. Spence to forward a return at the end of each month during the period the Stanley School is in operation. Payment of his salary will be withheld until his return is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Edwards to arrange for the use of benches and desks of a temporary description. On the closing of the Battleford Industrial School there will be a sufficient equipment of desks to spare for the Stanley school, after present needs of the day schools of the Battleford agency are provided for. These can be shipped by the earliest freighting next winter, and will be in time for the furnishing of the new building which Ven.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-5, part 1)\nIn a departmental letter which I have not at hand I was authorized to purchase, among other articles of equipment and school material for the day school which it is proposed to open at Stanley, 2 doz. slates. These were purchased of J. N. Merritt, of the Book Arcade, Prince Albert; and I now beg to enclose a certified account for payment.\n\nIt was expected that school would open at Stanley sometime during June; but the teacher, Miss Coates, has been delayed in leaving for the North. She now expects to go in via The Pas during July, and may be able to take up her duties about the beginning of August, which will be immediately after the annuity payments.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReferring to your letter quoted above, in which it is stated that the Department would pay for material bought and paid for by the Anglican Church to the extent of $250.00 for the purpose of erecting a school building at Stanley, I have the honor to enclose herewith accounts which I have received from Ven Archdeacon McKay, and which aggregate $250.00.\n\nIt will be observed that one of these accounts is for freighting material for the building from Lac La Ronge to Stanley. This one amounts to $44.10; a second amounting to $179.79 includes an item of $34.10 for labor in preparing material for building, and other items amounting to $69.00 for Rubberoid roofing, while the balance of the account is made up of provisions which no doubt were issued to pay or ration the men engaged upon the work. These two accounts amount to $223.89, and to cover the balance of the $250.00 which Ven. Archdeacon McKay regards as a grant towards the building, he has submitted an account for \"door, windows, lumber, nails, etc.\" amounting to $26.11, in favor of the Lac La Ronge Boarding School. In explanation of this account, the Archdeacon states that the lumber and hardware was all supplied by the Lac La Ronge School and that it amounted to very much more than the sum shown in this account, but that he has shown only $26.11 as being the balance of the \"Grant.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nWith regard to these, I have to inquire whether they may be submitted for payment, as they do not exactly comply with the terms of authority I have at hand. I would refer particularly to the last account, as I am aware that the Department does not ordinarily make payment of accounts without the details having been furnished. I have no time to refer these accounts back to have them amended before the end of the present fiscal year; but if the Department should see fit to authorize the payment of any or all of them, I shall certify to them and submit them in their present form.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, March 31, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd instant, I beg to say you may certify to the account therein referred, which you received from the Ven. Archdeacon McKay, and which aggregated $250.00, for expenditure in connection with the erection of a school building at Stanley by the Anglican Church.

McKay, Paying Officer Treaty 10, before attending to the matter of supplies for mid day meal. I found, however, that Mr. McKay did not receive the necessary information regarding supplies when at Stanley, and I, therefore, wrote Mr. Edwards asking him to give me an estimate of the average attendance expected during the coming winter.\n\nAs it was impossible at that time to arrange for the freighting in of any supplies until the freeze up, I requested Mr. Edwards to purchase locally a small quantity of supplies to keep the school going until I sent in a shipment of goods early in December. I note from the quarterly return that he has purchased four sacks of flour and this I will take into account when making up shipment in December.\n\nI also enclose herewith account in duplicate rendered by Rev. M. B. Edwards, Stanley, for $64.85. It will be noted that there is no detail given for lumber and the cost of making three desks, $15.00. I am writing Mr. Edwards asking him for a detailed statement of this, which I shall forward to you immediately on receipt.

Today the mail arrived & with it a cheque for teaching (March quarter 1919) & another bonus cheque for quarter ending Sep. 1919.\n\nIn your last letter you state that I have received the whole of the money which I paid the Indian woman for preparing mid-day meals. I believe there is $30 (thirty dollars) still owing me. The woman prepared meals from Oct 1st 1918 - July 31st 1919 making $100 in all.\nI was paid in the first place $50, covering the first five months from Oct 1st 1918 - Feb 28th 1919. Then I next received $10 for month of June, & another, for same amount, for month of July. If the $30 was forwarded to me before crossing to England, I am sorry to trouble you, but I cannot remember receiving same, but if you have a cheque for that amount bearing my signature then I must be at fault.\n\nThanking you for an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\nMabel Morris.\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Mabel Morris who has recently returned from England and intends to again take charge of the Stanley Indian Day School.\n\nShe claims that there is a balance due her of $30.00 in order to pay the Indian woman who prepared the mid-day meals from October 1, 1918 to July 1, 1919, a period of ten months.\n\nThe Department has made the following payments:\n- Ck. No. 1219 sent on the 17th of September, 1919, for $10.00 in payment for the month of July, 1919.\n- Ck. No. 968 for $10.00 sent on the 6th of August, 1919, for the month of June 1919, and ck. No. 947 for $50.00 sent on the first of August, 1919, payments for the months of February, March, April and May, 1919 and October, 1918.\n\nFrom the above it would appear that no payments were made for the months of November and December, 1918, and January 1919. As the school was open during those months it is apparent that there is a balance due Mrs. Morris of $30.00 for preparing the midday meal, and I would request that you forward a voucher for this amount for the months stated above.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW.

H. E. Hives. Children were just learning again all that they had been taught in previous years and had forgotten. They were crowded into a little school, sitting on boxes and using saw horses for desks. They were all humped up in a position, the exact opposite from that considered the right way to sit. I asked for seats for this school last year, but no notice was taken of my recommendation.

The Church has fixed up the missionary's residence, where the teacher can live. I promised to give this favourable consideration for another year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from letter to Archdeacon Paul from the Rev. H.E. Hives, January 1932.\n\n.... The school has proven a great success owing to the work of preparation and continuation done by the chief. The people all responded to his appeal for workers to attend to the various tasks and the W.A. provided the food for those who worked. The two houses belonging to the chief are the ones being used for the children as the grant promised by the Indian Department could not come in time to be fitted up for the fall. Other arrangements will have to be made another year as the chief says he cannot always give his house as he might have occasion to need it himself.\n\nMr. Gilmore told me that after having seen you he was of the impression that a new school was to be built this coming summer. If this is the case the material in the old school could be used to build the two houses necessary to accommodate the children. In any case whether the present school is refashioned or other houses built for the children's use the following hardware will be necessary:\n\n- 30 lbs 4\" nails\n- 25 lbs 1\u00bd\" nails\n- 30 lbs 2\u00bd\" nails\n- 2 door locks\n- 2 sets door hinges\n- 25 lengths stove pipe 6\"\n- 4 elbows 6\"\n- 2 rolls wire for pipes\n- 2 dampers for pipes 6\"\n\nThis material should be sent this winter so that it can be used during the summer. The necessary doors and windows and shingles should be ordered also. Some grant for lumber should be included which could be secured from the mill at Lac la Ronge. The money for all this expense was voted last summer by the Indians to be taken from the band funds. The Inspector, Mr. Muirison, would have the record of this. This is for the children's houses and not for any school building which might be contemplated.\n\nRegarding Mr. Gilmore he has done very good work in the school and is very much liked by both the children and the people.\nDear sir -\n\nWhen I saw you last September you told me that you thought the Department would build a new Class-room for the Stanley School next Summer. Would it be possible for the material for this building to be sent up during the present Winter? The freighting of heavy material is almost impossible in Summer when travel is only by canoe, but teams and sleighs go up in Winter. If you contemplate a lumber building, the dimension lumber at any rate could be obtained from the Lac la Ronge School mill. But a good log building with hewn logs with lime and sand plaster between the logs would, I think, meet the requirements. I enclose an extract from a letter to me from the Rev. H.E. Hives, the Missionary in charge of that district, mentioning the fact that the Band have voted money from their Fund to erect two houses, one for boys and one for girls, for the accommodation of the children during the Winter when their parents are away trapping, and giving a list of hardware needed for these houses. Inspector Muirson is acquainted with the whole situation and would, I am sure, give you whatever information you require. I would like to suggest that the Department supply the necessary hardware, doors, windows, shingles, stoves &c., and the Indians at Stanley would cut and hew the logs gratis if rations could be given them while working, both for Class-room and children's houses.\n\nMr. Gilmore, the Teacher, was out for a short time during the Christmas holidays. He appears to be doing very good work and the children are getting on well. Mr. Hives\ncarried out the erection of a new Mission house last Summer with only local help. Mr. Gilmore is living in it this Winter and finds it comfortable. I think therefore, that Mr. Hives' list of material needed could be relied on, but he is estimating for the children's houses, not the Class-room.\n\nI know that the estimates are not passed till April, but I hope it will be possible to make arrangements for the necessary material to be sent to Stanley during the Winter.\n\nMr. W.A. Bear has the contract for hauling all the supplies for Lac la Ronge School from Prince Albert. He is a Treaty Indian, but a capable man, and I should recommend that he be given the contract for hauling the material. The material could be sent to him c/o Northern Cartage Co., Prince Albert, Sask. He gets his mail at the General Delivery, Prince Albert.\n\nMr. Gilmore is arranging to have the annual School holidays during April and May during the musk-rat season. All the Indians are home at Stanley during June, July and August, so it is best to teach during those months.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J. Paul\n\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, February 9, 1932.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the erection of a new classroom at the Stanley Indian Day School. I regret to inform you that the Department will have no funds to provide for the erection of this building next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. W. E. J. Paul, M.A., LL.B.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMr. Murchison  \nCommr. of Indian Affairs  \nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir\n\nI closed the Stanley School for April & May as the people were going away after Easter, and would want their children with them, and if they did not take them they could not get back for them until June.\n\nI would like you to see that Maggie Bear, John Charles & his wife get paid for their services during the winter from about Oct. 1st till Easter, six months. If they do not receive some remuneration there would be no use in trying to keep the school open another winter. John Charles was promised $50. for his work and Maggie Bear & Mrs. Charles $10. a month. I would like to put a recommendation to you. The Indians expressed themselves as well pleased with the results of the winter's work and by all accounts there will be a lot more children stay in the village next year. If you, when you are up in the summer, could arrange for responsible overseers of the children at home, in two houses, and a man to look after the collecting of food and fire-wood, and tell them what they are to be paid, then I believe there would be a good response. As Archdeacon Paul is to be resident in Stanley this summer, and I expect to return around June 1st we shall see to various other things that I found out, by experience, need to be attended to.\n\nNow Mr. Murchison I am sending you the quarterly returns ending Mar. 31st, and would like you to request the powers that be at Ottawa to cut out some red tape and pay the salary now. I am not likely to get a school at this time of year, and one cannot save money at Stanley on Company's prices for things, so I shall need this cheque as soon as possible. I did not get the Sept. 31st cheque till January and the Dec. 31st cheque in March. At that rate, I would be back in Stanley before this one would come through so please hustle them up. It's impossible for me to carry on out here unless you do so.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain, Yours truly\n\n(Sgd) F. M. Gilmour\nI beg to forward herewith the quarterly school return for the Stanley Day School in the Ile a la Crosse Agency for the quarter ended March 31st, 1932. The teacher, Mr. Gilmour, in his covering letter to me makes a request that his cheque be forwarded to him at the earliest possible date stating that he is badly in need of money.\n\nI am informed that an Indian named John Charles was engaged to supply wood for the school during the winter months and was promised $50.00 remuneration, also that Maggie Bear and Mrs. Charles, two Indian women were promised $10.00 per month for taking care of the girl and boy pupils respectively during the winter while their parents were away on their trap lines. So far as I can ascertain the teacher took it upon himself to engage these people with no other justification than Indian talk. When making the payments at Stanley last July the Amos Charles Band passed a resolution authorizing the Department to expend $200.00 from their band funds, a portion of the money to be used in obtaining food supplies and the services of two women for looking after the children during the winter months. I explained very carefully to the Indians through the Interpreter that I could not promise that the Department would accede to their request, but that I would bring their request to the attention of the Department and if the Department acceded to their request the teacher would be notified. I repeatedly told them that this matter would have to be confirmed by the Department, but notwithstanding this apparently the Chief misunderstood. Mr. Gilmour had not yet arrived and was not present at our meeting. He has taken a great deal upon himself in accepting the Indians' statements without having them duly confirmed by the Department. I am attaching a copy of the teacher's letter to me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have your 307-11 of the 7th instant, enclosing the March quarter return of the Stanley Indian Day School, together with a copy of a communication which you received from Mr. F. M. Gilmore, the teacher. A cheque in payment of the salary due Mr. Gilmore for the above quarter will be sent.\n\nRelative to the wood supplied this school during the winter months, and also to remunerating the two Indian women for taking care of the girl and boy pupils during the winter, I have to say that if you consider payment for these services is a fair charge against the Department, I would request that you prepare and forward a voucher in favour of John Charles covering the cost of the wood supplied. This expense would be paid from our Appropriation for Indian Education. A voucher in favour of Maude Bear and Mrs. John Charles for the amount due them for taking care of the children should also be forwarded, properly certified, and same would be payable, as relief, from Band Funds, Account No. 190. It is considered that the above parties acted in good faith in supplying the wood and in the care of the children, and it would, no doubt, be in the interests of the future work at this school to pay for the services rendered. The Department will, however, leave this matter in your hands to decide whether payment should be made, and, if so, you should prepare and forward vouchers, properly certified. The teacher is to be informed, however, that in future he is not to authorize any expenditure in connection with this school, as the Department will not be responsible for the payment of same.\n\nYou should instruct whoever makes the treaty payments at Stanley this summer to make definite arrangements for the supplying of fuel for next winter's use.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it will not be possible for the Department to authorize any expenditure in the care of the children while their parents are away on their trap lines next winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-5, part 1)\nFurther to the above and to the letter of the Officer Commanding, R.O.M.Police, Regina, Sask., dated at Regina on the 24-3-32 and the request for statements to be obtained from parties having knowledge of this case.\n\nOn the 23-3-32 I patrolled from Pelican Narrows to Stanley, Sask., via Police dog-team and arrived there on the p.m. of the 25-3-32. On the following day I made enquiries in the village and learned that the parties likely to have most knowledge of the matter in question were away tramping. These men being Walter McKenzie (Chief of the Amos Charles Band) and Murdoch McKenzie (Councilor of the same Band). Word was sent by me to these two men requesting them to come to Stanley so that I might obtain certain statements from them.\n\nAt this time there was no interpreter attached to Pelican Narrows Detachment and as there was no one in Stanley sufficiently qualified to act as interpreter I was forced to go to La Loche Settlement, 48 miles west, where I hired one Heiver Minnew on the 29-3-32.\n\nThe return trip was made and Stanley was reached in the late a.m. of the 30-3-32. Here I found Walter and Murdoch McKenzie awaiting me and from them I obtained the following signed statements:\n\nStatement of Walter McKenzie taken at Stanley Mission this 30th day of March 1932.\n\n\"During the 1931 Treaty Payments at Stanley, Sask., I was talking with Mr. Murison, Inspector for the Department of Indian Affairs. Phillip McKenzie and Murdoch McKenzie were there at the same time. We were talking about the school at Stanley and other matters to do with the Amos Charles Band. The Inspector said that he would arrange matters so that $400.00 could be taken from funds held for the Amos Charles Band to be used to repair the school and to build fences. Mr. Murison did not say that the Indian Department would provide the money. Though he did promise to send or provide a team of horses for the use of the Band. With regard to the man engaged to hunt and fish for the school children, this money was to be paid out of the funds belonging to the Band. The Inspector said that the two women, who were to care for the children, would be paid by the Indian Department, although he did not say how much they would receive.\"\n\n(Signed) Walter X McKenzie\n\nWitness, Heiver Minnew, Interpreter.\n\nContinued on page 2.\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\nRe:- Ames Charles Band of Indians,\nStanley Mission, Sask.\n\nStatement of Murdoch McKenzie taken at Stanley Mission this 30th day of March 1932.\n\n\"I have read over the above statement made by Walter McKenzie and find same to be correct.\"\n\n(Signed) Murdoch X McKenzie\n\nWitness, Melver Kniew, Interpreter.\n\nIt appears that certain moneys are being held in trust for this Band by the Dept. of Indian Affairs, and that these Indians had voted for an amount to be used for the aforementioned purposes. But during my first talk with the chief I was given to understand by the interpreter (Arthur Morin) that cash had been handed over by the Indians to the Inspector. The Chief's words were that the Band had handed over a certain sum of money ($200.00) to be used to purchase articles for the Band's use. What he really meant was that the Band had voted that the money should be taken from funds held in trust. This was undoubtedly a mistake upon the part of the interpreter when repeating, in English, the Chief's words to me. However the sum of money mentioned by the Chief in my first interview with him was $200.00; whereas he now says it was agreed upon to vote $400.00.\n\nA statement was not taken from Councillor Phillip McKenzie as he was away hunting at the time and could not be located.\n\nExpense sheet attached hereto.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.Police, Sask.

However, very shortly after being placed in charge as Inspector for this Province, I wrote Mr. Gilmour informing him that in future he was not to authorize any expenditure in connection with the Stanley school before first taking the matter up and receiving authority to do so, as the Department would not be responsible for the payment of unauthorized accounts.

Gilmore as teacher. The pupils appeared clean, healthy and well clothed.\n\nIn taking the classes in their various subjects I noticed some of the pupils were much further advanced than the majority, in spite of there being little or no difference in their ages. In questioning Mr. Gilmore regarding this he informed me the backward pupils were those who attended school during the summer months only. He also advised me that owing to the fact that these children attended school for three or four months, and then lived with their people during the balance of the year, resulted in them forgetting what they had learned at school.\n\nIn view of this it would appear to be a wasted effort in trying to teach these children under those conditions. However I found the children who had attended their classes during the winter months well advanced in their studies. These appeared keen and interested in their work, and all seemed anxious to return to their school this winter.\n\nThe Chief and members of this band are very anxious to keep this school open during the yearly school term and have voted the sum of $600.00 to be taken from band funds for that purpose. Dispensation of same as follows:\n\n- $50.00 a year for housing, cooking & washing for girl pupils.\n- $50.00 a year for \" \" \" \" \" \" boy \"\n- $50.00 a year for labor to supply fuel and fish for above\n- $200.00 a year for food supplies from Revillon Freres Trading Co., Stanley.\n\n$250.00 to ship in the following: 5 sacks flour, 100 lbs. pot barley, 100 lbs rolled oats, 50 lbs sugar, 25 lbs tea, 36 lbs lard and 200 candles.\n\nThese people advised me that if they could be assured this school was to be kept open the year round they would guarantee to increase the yearly average daily attendance from 24.01 to 45. In doing so the provider of each family would be able to give more time to his hunting and trap lines during the winter months.\n\nI am attaching hereto the resolution, signed by the Chief and Head man which was witnessed by me, and would recommend it be given favorable consideration.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nS.H. Simpson.\n\nPaying Officer.\nRegina, Sask., 22nd September 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward a report on the schools included in the Isle a la Crosse Agency submitted by the Paying Officer for this year, Mr. S.H. Simpson.\n\nSTANLEY DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe report in connection with this day school is not encouraging in view of the living conditions of the people. As these people derive their living by hunting and trapping, it is absolutely impossible for them to reside continuously at Stanley. Their means of livelihood takes them considerable distances from that point and it is obvious that unless residential facilities are provided for the school children to enable them to remain at Stanley all the year round, we cannot expect a regular and satisfactory attendance. It will be noted on Page 8 of the report the Paying Officer states that the Chief and members of this band are anxious to keep the school open during the term and have voted the sum of $600.00 to be taken from their band funds for that purpose. I question the advisability of doing this. The funds of that band are very limited and after all the granting of this money would only be a temporary expedient, as, if the funds are to be used from year to year for this purpose, they would soon become depleted and we would be confronted with the same situation as exists at present. In view of the resolutions having been passed, I am submitting them herewith.\n\nW. Murison.\nInspector.\nOttawa, October 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 307-11 of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. S. H. Simpson, paying officer for the Isle a la Crosse Agency, on his visit to the Beauval and Lac la Ronge Indian Residential Schools and Stanley Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to his report on the Stanley Day School, and your remarks thereto in connection with the providing of the sum of $500 from the funds of the Band to cover the cost of food supplies, housing, cooking and washing, for the pupils during the coming winter, I have to say that the Amos Charles Band, to which these Indians belong, have not sufficient funds at their credit to provide the expenditure required. The funds at our disposal, from the Appropriation for Indian Education, are so limited this year that, as you were informed by official letter dated April 15, 1932, it will not be possible for the Department to authorize any expenditure in caring for the children while their parents are away on their trap lines this coming winter.\n\nWe will, however, be prepared to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of fuel. If arrangements have not already been made to that end, you should take the necessary action to have the quantity of fuel required delivered. The fuel could, no doubt, be supplied by the Indians; the teacher keeping a record of the quantity delivered by each, which she should forward to you, when you could prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the amount due.\n\nThe teacher should be definitely informed that funds cannot be provided to board the Indian children during the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection, I would refer you to your Voucher 7493, dated April 28th, last, covering the cost of 5,100 lbs. of biscuits supplied to your agency by the Independent Biscuit Company.

I note that you do not intend to send them until they can be shipped via winter freight.\n\nYou might let the Department have a report immediately regarding the advisability of keeping this school open during the winter months of 1933-34. Do you consider that the attendance during that time will justify keeping the school open?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

However, out of the 5100 pounds, there will be enough for Stanley, namely: 600 pounds, which I will ship at a convenient time.\n\nI note that 600 pounds were allowed for Pelican Narrows.

These biscuits may be retained in your warehouse and distributed to the Indian day schools in the Carlton Agency as required.\n\nI wish to refer you to the last paragraph of official letter of the 14th ultimo.

Murison Esq.,\nInspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a meeting of the Chief, Councillors and Members of the Amos Charles Band held on August 21st 1933, the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"We, the Chief, Councillors and Members of the Amos Charles Band wish to withdraw the sum of $130.00 from our Band Fund with which to pay those who looked after the children at the Stanley Day School during the winter term from September 1932 to June 1933. The salaries were to have been $50.00 for the man, and $40.00 each for the two women who looked after the children.\n\nThis reaffirms our decision made at the Annual Treaty in July 1932 but which, through an error on the part of Archdeacon Paul who interpreted a later letter, was countermanded. The letter interpreted by the Archdeacon ought to have stated that we wished our Band Fund to be used for the above purpose for the winter term 1932-1933 but that we do not wish any further funds to be used for this purpose after June 1933.\n\nSince the above amounts have been advanced in part by Mr McLean of Stanley, we would request that the total amount of $130.00 be sent to him so that he may pay the amounts owing to Horace Charles, Bella Charles and Maggie Bear and also reimburse himself for the amounts that he has advanced.\"\n\nProvision has been made for the operation of the school for the coming winter without using the Band Funds for this purpose.\n\nThanking you for your attention,\n\nWe remain,\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 621-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter and petition from the Chief, Councillors, and members of the Amos Charles Band expressing their wish to withdraw the sum of $130.00 from their Band funds with which to pay Horace Charles, Bella Charles, and Maggie Bear for services rendered in connection with looking after the children attending the Day School at Stanley during the period when the parents were absent on their trap lines. In this connection I would refer you to Departmental letter No. 132-4-5, dated October 7th, 1932.\n\nOn October 12th I wrote Miss Merritt, teacher at the Stanley Day School in part as follows: \"I am in receipt of a letter from the Department in which they wish me to inform you definitely that funds cannot be provided to board the Indian children during the coming winter and there are not sufficient funds at the credit of the Amos Charles Band to provide for the expenditure required. The funds at the disposal of the department for Indian education are so limited that it will not be possible for the department to authorize any expenditure in caring for the children while their parents are away on their trap lines. I will be glad if you will so inform the Chief and Councillors\". I may inform you also that I notified the Venerable Archdeacon Paul, of Prince Albert, regarding the department's decision with reference to this matter, but notwithstanding this warning apparently the Chief and Councillors took the matter in their own hands and made arrangements for the care of the children. In view of the circumstances, I feel that the Indians responsible for this action should be called upon to pay for the services rendered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 7th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 25th ultimo reporting on the petition received from the Indians of Amos Charles Band, asking that payment be made for the services of persons looking after the children while the parents were absent trapping.\n\nOfficial letter of the 7th of October 1932 definitely stated that provision could not be made for these Indian children during the winter and if the members of the Band have gone ahead in the face of these explicit instructions, the responsibility of making payment rests entirely with them. The Department must refuse to use the limited funds at the credit of this Band for the needless expenditure incurred contrary to the instructions from the Department and yourself.\n\nI may inform you that on the recommendation of Mr. Weir, Indian Agent, the Department has approved of keeping the Stanley Day School open during the winter but this does not include providing food for them during the winter season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I feel sure that they would give the children good care.\n\nAt the present time there are twenty-eight children attending this school but this number would likely be reduced in the winter. I estimate that there would be approximately twenty children attending the school during the winter months. The parents of most of the children, that is the Hunting Indians, have agreed to leave their children at the village to attend the school.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition, form 37, for the rations that I believe will be necessary for these children. The following supplies should be shipped in as soon as possible by the M & C Aviation Co. in order to keep the children until the balance of the groceries arrive by winter freight:\n\n- 100 lbs lard\n- 100 lbs sugar\n- 100 lbs oatmeal\n- 1 case prunes\n- 48 lbs syrup\n\nThe Indians of the Band have agreed to supply the fish and potatoes that are necessary.\n\nThe school is now open for the usual 6-month period, and I would suggest that it be kept open for an additional 10 months, or until June 30th, 1939. After this year the school would only be open for the usual term. It is necessary to do this owing to the fact that the Indians go north to the trap lines and must leave their children at the village.\nTHE PAULIN CHAMBERS COMPANY LIMITED\nMANUFACTURERS OF BISCUITS AND CONFECTIONERY\n\nSOLD TO: Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nQuantity: 500 lbs\nWeight: 20/25\nPrice: .13\nMisc.: 67.50\n\nConsigned to: Indian Affairs Branch,\nc/o G.

They will need all the supplies asked for in the requisition. Trapping is very poor in the North and anything the Indians have to buy is such a high price that they cannot get proper clothing and supplies for their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

At the same time we cannot allow everything the teacher apparently thinks should be supplied. As you are aware groceries and flour have been provided at a cost of approximately $300.00. It is hoped that you feel assured that the children attending the school will receive the benefit of this.\n\nThe cost of operation of this school for the coming winter must be kept under control as no special provision was made for the operation of this school during the winter.\n\nThe tooth brushes will be sent to you from this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Under the circumstances the combs should be returned, a credit note obtained and a new voucher forwarded for the balance of the account. We will then make arrangements to forward combs from here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. S.

In looking over these, you will see the attendance has been very irregular; and the only way to overcome this difficulty is a boarding school. After consulting with Archdeacon Mackay, who has recently been here, he has promised to assist in the matter; and after any conversation with you, I have concluded, with your permission, to start the school on a new footing, as soon as accommodation can be given, and all other necessary arrangements made.\n\nIn talking over the subject with the Indians, they are favourable towards the movement, and willing to give up their children as long as they are fed and clothed. Upon my arrival here, in October, I had a little difficulty in getting a school together, as the Indians said they would not send their children, unless promised to feed and clothe them. I then made a compromise that I would consult you and Archdeacon Mac-\n\nH. Keith Cop\nIndian Agent,\nCarlton.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Perhaps I have been too hasty in taking so much into my own hands, yet something should be done here, for there are lads growing up who are following into the ways and vices of the older people, and after appealing to the Throne of Grace, I come to you for such assistance as is needed to keep the body and mind together. You saw, when here last month, the accommodation we have, and the steps I have taken in providing quarters for my family. I am glad to say that Archdeacon Mackay has confirmed all, and is anxious for the work to go on as soon as the weather will permit to build; but I would rather that you should see him, that a thorough understanding can be arrived at as regards the expenses, he is ready to help as far as he can.\n\nTrusting what I have done will meet with your approval,\n\nI have, &c.,\n[Signature]\nJ. F. D. Parker\nIndian Affairs Office, Carlton,\nAldina, 29th Jan., 1894.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter lately received from the teacher at our Sturgeon Lake school in which he mentions a wish to start a boarding school at the reserve, as the best means of securing a successful attendance.\n\nThe Indians being hunters, often go away when they have to take their children with them whereas if we could board say 12 children, the difficulty would be overcome.\n\nMr. Parker told me he was going also keep a few of the children on his own account, or that the Church were going to foot the bill.

We went over the new building and there was nothing to prevent the teacher starting school the very next day if he so desired.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\nattendance or not.\n\nIt could not have been during the September quarter I instructed the teacher to close the school.\n\nI recollect exactly the circumstances of the case; during the month of May, on the 4th, I visited the school and found no children attending, the teacher complained that he could not have the Indians children in same house with his own, as they brought him sin and suggested closing the school, so as he could see the quarters, when perhaps the church would make some move towards providing accommodation for himself and family, thus they did and the large addition was completed and ready for use by the 24th July, statement. It can hardly be seen, how the fact of my agreeing with the teacher, that for the good reasons given, the school might be closed for a short time from the 1st of May, can in any way strengthen the claim for grant for the September quarter.\n\nI am sure that the Archdeacon is mistaken in saying that the school was closed, it is true there was no attendance, but I am aware that the teacher was at his post during the whole period, and personally assisted in the erection of his new quarters. The same trouble seems to exist.\nexist as before, that through a want of energy he has been unable to overcome the objections the Indians have to send their children to school.\n\nIn view of this I beg to recommend that two-thirds of the regular grant be allowed him, more especially as he is a married man with a family to support and is in poor circumstances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Signed) H.

Kindly report fully as to the statement that the school was closed by instructions \"from the Indian Agent\" and your views as to what amount of grant should be paid.\n\nThe Archdeacon's letter seems to imply that the school was closed during the entire quarter, though your report for July last says that the teacher's quarters were completed at the time of your visit, and the 24th of that month, and that school would re-open the following month.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nCarlton\n\nAss't Commr.\nRev.

Having had eighteen years of missionary experience, will you allow me to say that a school at a mission station is a most valuable handmaid not only in the spiritual work, but also in helping to educate the rising generation with a view to usefulness in the Dominion. I was engaged, in conjunction with my wife, in educational work at York Factory, thirteen years, 1879-92. Several of our late scholars are now employed in good positions in Winnipeg & elsewhere. Without the advantages they doubtless would have followed the hunter's life, which in the present day is extremely precarious. Now a few have succumbed to starvation. I am sorry to say that the attendance has not been as good as we could have desired; but now that the Indians have heard of the possibility of closing the school they are greatly disturbed and promise to encourage the work in the future.\n\nI ought add that, in the stronghold of heathenism in the district, the Indians do not take kindly to the blessings of civilization; but by inculcating Christian principles into the children I might be the means of elevating the entire band.\n\nWe understand that the Department intended closing the school on Mistawasis Reserve, but that the petition...\nfrom the Presbyterian minister T.

During the interval between his arrival at the school and his starting home with them again, the driver would not be able to return to his own home and accomplish any other work, and as the day would thus be lost to him so far as the chance to earn any other money would be concerned, I would ask that the sum of $1.50 per day be offered for the work if the Department approves of this suggestion.\n\nOur Indians at Mistawasis claim that $1.00 per day is too small a sum for the service rendered and I find it difficult to get the transport work started there, though the routes are much shorter than the one at Sturgeon Lake will be.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 21st, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant recommending that the children on the Sturgeon Lake reserve be transported to and from school, and in reply I beg to say the Department prefers to wait until it sees the result of the experiment in this direction at Mistawasis before making any extension of the system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThomas Berthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, March 3rd, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nAs Your Lordship is aware the improvement of Indian day school conditions has been for sometime receiving consideration and already marked improvement is noticeable in many instances. Some months ago particular attention was paid to the schools in the southern part of the North Saskatchewan Inspectorate, and, with a view to extending the work, the situation as existing on the more northern reserves has been looked into and reported upon, and the Department now wishes to try to effect an improvement at the Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake Schools.\n\nYour Lordship will readily recognize as one of the first essentials to success the procuring of efficient and interested teachers, and to obtain and retain such the cooperation of the authorities of the church directly interested is much to be desired. This matter is, therefore, being brought direct to Your Lordship's attention with the hope that it will receive early consideration.\n\nThe Ahtahkakoop school is in charge of Mr. Louis Ahenakew, an Indian who attended Emmanuel College. The very poor enrolment and attendance at this school are evidences that there is something wrong in the management and the conclusion has been reached that the fault lies largely with the teacher. Mr. Ahenakew is reported to be\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Brownham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nlacking in scholarship and energy and to take no interest in his work. During the six years he has been in charge of this school he has evidenced no desire to improve himself intellectually and thus better fit himself for his duties. The first step, therefore, is to procure the services of a qualified teacher who will devote all his or her energies to the work. It is considered that a married teacher, male or female, would be most suitable and to a competent person the Department would pay a salary of $500.00 per annum. If a male teacher could be secured, whose wife would be able and willing to take up nursing and field nation work on the reserve, a larger salary would be allowed.\n\nThe above remarks apply in a large measure to conditions at the Sturgeon Lake school and Mr. Grain should be replaced by an efficient teacher, to whom the same salary as that at the Ahtahkakoop school will be paid.\n\nThese changes may be made after the summer holidays and Mr. Ahenakew and Mr. Grain should be notified at once that their services will not be required after June 30th, next, and in the mean time the names of successors may be submitted to the Department for consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1930.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to official letters of March 3rd, last, in which you were asked to advise the teachers of the Ahtahkakoop and Sturgeon Lake schools that their services would not be required after June 30th, next.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department has under consideration the transfer of Mr. MacLeod, the farming instructor on the Big River Reserve, to either of the reserves above mentioned. In the event of this change being finally decided upon the services of Mrs. MacLeod would be available as teacher of the school. Excellent reports on her work at the Big River school have been received and presumably Your Lordship would have no objection to her appointment at Sturgeon Lake or Ahtahkakoop.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nRight Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\nSturgeon Lake\n26 April 1910\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI am going to retire from school teaching on the end of June, after teaching a number of years. I am now indentured fifty dollars after calculating the sum I am to earn till June, as we could not live on the salary we are getting, for paying too much for our grocer's bill, and I am going back to John Smith's farm to try and live on farming, etc., which I wish to get aid from the Dept. in the way of farming implements and cattle as I have not an animal to start with.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\nGeorge Cain\nOttawa, May 4, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you enclose your resignation as teacher of the Sturgeon Lake school and ask for assistance to enable you to start farming on the John Smiths Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your resignation is accepted and your application for assistance should be made to the Department through the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\n\nGeorge Crain, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nAlingly, Sask., Ont.\nThe Sec.\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\n\n24.6.10\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI write to know what the I.D. is going to do about the promised improved school at Sturgeon Lake Reserve. The long delay over Mr. Smith's Reserve, & the change of post at Atahkakkoop's Reserve, have not encouraged me to engage a qualified teacher. But G. Crane's time is almost up, & I ought to know what you wish done. As far as I could learn, the improvement in\nthe Sturgeon Lake Hds. are not going to be such as Mr. B. Swick promised when I agreed to hand over the our house. Not so much done as yet; while the estimating & contract seem to have been man-\naged more with a view to the profit of those concerned than of the J. D. or the Indians. However that may be, I have a possible married man in view, Englishman; but I wish just to know positively.\nI. What lodg. accommodation will there be for a) school b) scholars' dining room kitchen c) teacher & family?\n\nII. When will this be ready, & when do you wish the new teacher to begin?\n\nIII. What terms am I to offer you to the teacher & the wife\n\nBefore I leave the subject of the Hargen Lake School I may say that G. Crane complains that in spite of frequent requests he has not been able to procure a piece of\nsoap, a broom, or something for about a year! And that there has been no biscuit for the children for over a month. The Indians are at home now she has an average of about 14 scholars.\n\nThe Agent never takes any interest in the school, never visits it to inspect the state of things, etc.\n\nThey to remain faithfully,\n\nJ. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, July 8, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to Indian school matters in your Diocese.\n\nIn connection with the Sturgeon Lake school I beg to say that instructions have been given to have the school-house thoroughly repaired. These repairs call for an expenditure of close to $300.00 and, when completed, it is hoped that the building will be quite comfortable and much improved in appearance. As this expenditure is somewhat higher than was anticipated the matter of enlarging the teacher's residence will have to stand over till next year and in the meantime it is hoped that the present accommodation will suffice.\n\nThe contract for the erection of a teacher's residence and pupils' dining room on the John Smith's reserve was let sometime ago and the work is now under way. Any delay that occurred in proceeding with this work was unavoidable. The Department wished to erect a creditable building and had careful plans and specifications prepared. Following this tenders were called for, but all the details were attended to as promptly as was possible and the building should be ready for occupation by the Rev. Mr. McDougall and his family early in the autumn.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nA change of teacher at the Ahtahkakoop school at an early date is no doubt most desirable, but, as in the case of the Sturgeon Lake school, repairs to the building in order to make it comfortable called for an outlay of $232.00 and funds are not available this year for the erection of a teacher's residence; owing to this fact it is deemed advisable to allow Mr. Ahensakew to remain in charge for at least another year.\n\nIt is noted that Your Lordship has in view a married man to take charge of the Sturgeon Lake school and the Department would like to know whether the present dwelling, which was erected by your Church, will provide temporary accommodation. As Your Lordship has already been advised a salary of $500.00 will be paid a teacher and, if his wife is competent and willing to take up field matron work among the Indians on the reserve, an additional grant will be made for her services. In the absence of fuller information, however, a definite amount cannot at present be decided upon.\n\nIn reference to accommodation for teachers on these two reserves I may say that the Superintendent of Indian Education contemplates visiting the Carlton Agency in the near future and while there he will make special inquiry with a view to having the necessary work undertaken early next year.\n\nMr. Borthwick, the Indian Agent, has been written to in regard to Mr. Crane's complaint that he has not been furnished with necessary supplies during the last year and it is hoped that there will be no further difficulty in this respect.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to assure Your Lordship that the improvement of day school conditions in your Diocese is\nearnestly desired, but as it is quite a large undertaking\nand as similar improvements in many other districts have at\nthe same time to be considered progress must necessarily be\ncomparatively slow. However, it is thought that a decided\nadvance has been made during the past year and it is hoped\nthat results next year will be even more satisfactory. In\nthe meantime a communication from Your Lordship in reference\nto the qualifications of the teacher and his wife referred to\nabove will be awaited.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nJ.

He also suggested me to subscribe the\nschool & home for was in the school, and this\nI did, as I was going to continue with the teaching\nwhen I received instructions from the Bishop to retire,\nand then I sent in my resignation as School Teacher\nand Mr. Chisholm Inspector promised to help me\ngetting loan oxen and farming implements etc.\nHe told me to write to the Indian Agent Mr. Martin\nto give me those mentioned above, so I wrote to the\nAgent and he never answered my letter until I\nsaw him, and he did not give me a satisfaction\nreply about it.\nAnd this I am getting quite dispair of getting aid\nfrom the Agent so I determine to try and find a job\nof any kind to support my family,\nIf this could be done of my getting the job as Teaching\nI do not intend to take the service as Catechist again\njust the teaching.

Cumberland School. I hear that Mr. Nathan Settee has resigned the school, though he has not informed me of it. I at once wrote to Mr. John A. Reddie of Cumberland, and asked him to take it up from Oct 1st. Your Dept had already, long ago, accepted his appointment, when I thought the school was vacant; but the school was not then vacant, so he did not take it. Mr. Reddie is well educated, and I believe do his duty. I trust you will accept him, and notify him of his appointment, and instruct him as to his duties, reports, etc.\n\n2. More Like School.\n   a) In accordance with your request of some time ago, I have had the repairs of the school attended to.\n   b) Mr. Conlant notified me that he was quitting the school in Sept. I looked in vain for someone to take his place.\nBut Mr. Lamb, a trader, & a former teacher, brought a \nMr. Mitchell to my missionary, Rev. A. Fraser, & recommended \nhim for teacher. Mr. Mitchell only promises to take it till \nJune next. He is an American Protestant, & promises \nto \"try to fill all the requirements of Church & the S.D.\" \n& to begin at once. I knew nothing of him, except that \nMr. Lamb recommends him, & I have found Mr. Lamb \nreliable, & good to the Indians. It is not the most satis-\nfactory way of filling the appointment, but I have no \nother in view. I have desired my missionary to watch \nmost carefully, & to report the first sign of trouble or \ninsufficiency. I would request your Department to \ngive him a trial, & to notify him to Head Office. Address \nto Mr. C. T. Mitchell, % Mr. Lamb, Moose Lake, % The Pas.\n\n3. I am still without a teacher for Sturgeon Lake, but I \nam corresponding about it. Would you be disposed to appoint \nMr. Mrs. Godfrey near Big Head's school, Port \u00e0 la Corne, \nin the following terms & conditions:\na) Mr. Godfrey to teach school, his wife at first guiding \n& helping him with her experience & proved ability.\nThe Diocese of Saskatchewan\n\nREV.

They would also like the change, as Mr. Godfrey has had once a twice the report on the faults of local officials at Big Heads.\n\nI am as anxious as you are that the Indian schools really progressing, but can not make do without clothes, nor get good teachers without suitable salary & accommodation.\n\nI am corresponding with another, a former teacher from Nechako, head, Skeena, who might take Sturgeon Lake, & replace Mrs. Godfrey at Big Heads.

In recognition of her good work as teacher and field matron her salary has been increased to $600.00 per annum since April 1st, last.\n\nThis is an evidence of the value placed upon Mrs. Godfrey's present services and the matter of transferring her to another field under changed conditions requires the most careful consideration.

Mr. Eaton is an Englishman, educated at a Public School and taught for a short time at Freshman's Head, a year or two ago. If you think fit I would suggest his having a trial at Sturgeon Lake at the salary of $500.00 on the understanding that if his wife can and will do some work among the women of the Reserve, teach the Indian girls to cook (at the mid-day meal) and to sew etc., (or you name the work you want her to do) you will give her $200.00 per annum.

In this connection I beg to refer to previous correspondence in which the suggestion was made by Your Lordship to appoint Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey as teacher and matron respectively on this reserve. I may say that it is the wish of the Department to make some provision for Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey and it is considered that it would be advisable to transfer them to Sturgeon Lake as soon as suitable accommodation is ready.

Mr. Godfrey feels satisfied that if it is introduced, transportation will make a great change in the average.

Your statement shows that there are at present twenty children on the reserve who should attend if means of conveyance are supplied. In a previous communication from you you stated that you thought that those from the eastern part of the reserve might be transported for $1.50 per day, which has now been increased to $2.00. If at all possible you should try to have this work done for $1.50 a day. If this cannot be done you are authorized to pay $2.00. You may also engage to drive those from the head of the lake for the sum of $1.00 per day.\n\nThis arrangement in the first place is to last only until the closing of the school at the summer holidays and between now and then the Department wishes to have the teacher prepare and submit through you a weekly statement showing the time\n\nThos.

The Indians point out that the task necessitates the travelling of 20 miles per day with a team,(10 miles each way) the teamster having to start at 7 o'clock in the morning to ensure the attendance of the pupils at the opening of the school,and that the Indian doing the work is practically prohibited from other employment.\n\nI have engaged Big-head to drive the pupils from the Eastern end of the reserve at $2.00 per day,and Sol.Nahtononhow from head of lake @ $1.00 per day,and an account of their service will be forwarded from time to time as reports come to hand.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nCarlton Agency.\n\nJune 6th, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the weekly statements required, re the transport of school pupils at the Sturgeon Lake reserve, and also a similar statement from the teacher of the Mistawasis Day School.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on File 117330/6.\n\nSTURGEON LAKE\n\nRESERVE 106A.\n\nOn Reserve 106A there are 8 children of school age. Two of these, as indicated above, have been in attendance here; but the Indians who have kept them find themselves unable to keep them permanently; and at any rate such young children should not be sent away from home to live with other Indians, except under very exceptional conditions.\n\nI have little doubt that if the residence accommodation in connection with this school could be utilized, the parents of all these eight children would gladly send them to board at the school during the week, at least from Monday to Friday. This would necessitate some further equipment of the residence, and furnishing Mrs. Godfrey, a good reliable woman, to act as matron or at least as help. However, this would probably be the best solution of the problem of education for Reserve 106A, where it is not likely it will ever be found advisable to establish a school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nSgt. W.J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mrs. Godfrey, in which she asks that during the excessively cold weather the school hours be 9.30 to 3, instead of 9 to 4, as at present.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the long distance that a number of these children have to be driven to school, the Department is prepared to grant this request for the months of January, February and March and you may advise the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I would suggest that an increase of $100.00 be allowed, as the combined salaries would then be within the amount usually allowed for similar services elsewhere in the West.

Godfrey\nPrince Albert\nSask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI trust you will pardon me for addressing you direct instead of through the Indian Agent, but it is on his verbal advice and sanction that I am taking this liberty, as he personally could not give me any satisfactory replies regarding salary of myself, Mrs Godfrey the matron, and Miss Winnipeg Godfrey who has acted as matron during Mrs Godfrey's illness.\n\nOn Dec 18th I addressed the Indian Dept through Indian Agent Mr. Borthwick asking for an increase of $200 per annum to my salary, as I found my salary very inadequate, and much below that paid to other teachers.\n\nOn Feb 7th Mr. Borthwick replied stating the Dept had raised my salary $100 per annum.\n\nOn March 26th Mrs Godfrey the matron addressed the Dept asking for an increase of her salary stating that she had to pay a girl $120 per annum to do the housework, as the matrons time was fully occupied in attending to the Indians, thus leaving very little out of her $300 for her own use.\n\nOn May 2nd the Agent replied to the Matrons' letter a copy of which reply I enclose.\n\nOn May 23rd, the day I conveyed Mrs Godfrey to the Victoria Hospital Prince Albert, I met the Agent in U. and spoke to him concerning the third paragraph of his letter. He verbally instructed me to forward to his office every month, an application for a voucher to be made out to Miss Winnipeg Godfrey (who was carrying on Mrs Godfrey's work in the interim) for $10 per month, and that he himself would forward to the Dept a voucher for the month of April.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI respectfully wish to tender the resignation of my duties at the Sturgeon Lake Day School, Carlton Agency, owing to the complete breakdown of the health of the Matron (Mrs. Godfrey) who, under the doctor's orders, is compelled to leave the isolation of the Reserve & to reside in the city to be under the constant supervision of her medical attendant.\n\nThis will necessitate me seeking employment elsewhere to be near her.\n\nI therefore, with the Department's permission beg to be released from my duties on May 31st.\n\nThis resignation will also apply to the Assistant Miss Winnipeg Godfrey.\n\nThanking the Department for its kindly consideration in the past.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours Obediently\n\nW. Godfrey.\nMay 2, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. McKay,\n\nReferring to our conversation of yesterday I beg to say that the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey has been received. They ask to be released at the end of this month. We have been paying Mr. Godfrey $600.00 as teacher and Mrs. Godfrey $300.00 as matron, and we also provided some help to the matron for the preparation of the midday meals and other work in connection with her duties.\n\nThere is a commodious and comfortable house erected a couple of years ago.\n\nWe should have for this work a married teacher with proper professional qualifications, if at all possible to obtain such, whose wife would be in a position to undertake the field matron work. This includes the preparation of the midday meal and work among\n\nJames McKay, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nthe Indian women and children on the reserve.\n\nThis is a Church of England school, and, in accordance with our practice, the nomination of a teacher would rest with His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan. This always has been the policy in dealing with day schools conducted under the auspices of the different Churches.\n\nIt occurs to me that it would be well to allow this school to take their holidays during June and July and reopen in August instead of on the 1st of September; this will give ample time to make inquiries and secure the services of suitable people.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 4, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, tendering your resignation as teacher of the Sturgeon Lake day school on account of the ill health of the Matron, Mrs. Godfrey.\n\nThe Department regrets that you have found it necessary to have to take this step, more especially for the reasons given, and it is hoped that Mrs. Godfrey will soon be restored to her usual health.\n\nIt is understood that the resignation embodies the teacher, matron and assistant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Godfrey, Esq.,\nBox 915,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMay 4, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham,\n\nWe have just received the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey as teacher and field matron, respectively, at Sturgeon Lake. We regret that they have found it necessary to resign, more especially as the reason is the ill health of Mrs. Godfrey. This resignation is to take effect at the end of May, and I would suggest that the holidays be taken during June and July; this will give plenty of time for you to make inquiries with a view to nominating successors. I think we should continue the same plan and obtain the services of a married man, he to teach and his wife to perform the usual duties of field matron.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from Your Lordship at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, May 5, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has received the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey, teacher and field matron respectively at the Sturgeon Lake School, to take effect on the 31st of this month. Steps are being taken to secure successors and this school should take their holidays during June and July and reopen in August, as this will give ample time to make inquiries and secure the services of suitable people to take charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am very sorry that the ill health of Mrs. Godfrey renders this step necessary. I like your proposal that the school take holidays for June and July. I hope by that time to be able to suggest to you some likely successors. I have a very good couple in view at present, but, as was the case with the Godfreys, the wife is far the best teacher, and stronger woman than Mrs. Godfrey, while the husband is a far better educated man than Mr. Godfrey and though never trained to teach (nor was Mr. Godfrey) would I think be better fitted to teach than was Mr. Godfrey. If other things are suitable, would you be willing to accept these, at all events to give them a trial? They would be ready by August. I am this week going out to Montreal Lake to visit the Indians there and Mr. J.R. Settee, the teacher and I shall pass through Sturgeon Lake. Mr. J.R. Settee is a poor stick of a teacher; no initiative or ambition, but of good character and has stuck to the work faithfully for years on his $300 (or $400 is it?)\n\n(Sgd.) J.A.

I have sent a man\u2014formerly an Indian Farm Instructor\u2014to the Pas, to have the ground cleared, ploughed, planted with potatoes, etc., to lay up store wood. I have told him the care not in accepting tenders for any of this work, which expenses down, I will send me accounts and vouchers, etc.\n\n2. I agree with your Agent at Bathford, Mr. Rossland, that it would be throwing away money to pay the transportation of the Pas of the aged horses, somewhat mature cows, and the more venerable portions of furniture. Better to sell them and buy new. I think you may safely consult him or Rev. Carr, Maclean as to what to transport and what to sell. I think some of the least valuable lots might go to the Red Pheasants', Smith, & Little Pines Schools.\n\nRe: Red Pheasants' Reserve\n\nI have just visited this most carefully. Mrs. Marshall is doing very good work, giving extra classes as a night school, etc. Mrs. Brown is doing most valuable work (she is our employee) visiting the Indians on both reserves, whole & sick, daily & all day long, looking after their morals & spiritual welfare as well as their health & comfort. She has her own horse & drives round among them from end to end. Agent, Instructor, Teacher, are all loved in their places by her. Mrs. Marshall has a baby & can do very much among them. Of course we say Mrs. Brown, a pitiable. If the S.D. could in any way compensate her splendid work I should be glad.\n\nExtract made\n\nJ.M. Macdonald\nMay 23rd, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham,\n\nI received this morning your letter of the 18th instant dealing with matters in connection with the Sturgeon Lake, Pas, and Red Pheasant schools. I am leaving town for a short time but the questions referred to in your letter will be dealt with in the meantime.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. West,\n\nI must add yet another sheet about Sturgeon Lake School vacancy. I have a very good missionary resident there, Rev. L. Leclair, a French half-breed\u2014I suppose, though practically an English half-breed. He has always worked among Indians for our Church, formerly in Mani- toba. I understand that the Agent for Mistawasis Agency, Mr. Milligan suggests to Mr. Leclair that I should get a single teacher, male or female, (A) that the Sectairs should live in the Teacher's house & the Teacher board with them (B) that Mr. Leclair should be Matron, & give the mid-day meal to the pupils, & Mr. Leclair (who has been accustomed to dispensing medicine to the Indians, & who visits the sick in any case as a clergyman) should dispense the medicines, etc. (C) that the J.D. should pay the teacher ($600, I suppose) & pay Mr. Leclair as Matron & dispenser ($200 or $300, I suppose) & pay $10 a month for a girl to cook the dinner, etc. (as I hear was done for Mr. Godfrey). I should like to know whether you would approve of this.\n\nI know of no man suitable for the position as yet. It might be easier to get a single teacher than to get a married couple suitable. As an alternative, I had thought of asking you to appoint Mrs. Brown, widow of Rev. Jas. Brown, a splendid matron & nurse, & of trying to get a female teacher to live with her. The Sectairs wish to get the position, & I hear the Mistawasis Indians' doctor backs Mr. Milligan in his suggestion as to the Sectairs. I should like your opinion soon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

She was referred to Your Lordship and informed that there is a vacancy at Sturgeon Lake. Before dealing with the suggestions contained in Your Lordship's letter above quoted the Department would like to know whether Miss Hawley communicated with Your Lordship and, if so, whether you are favourable to her appointment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

But she is difficult, restless, & not very reliable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Saskatchewan\nBishop\nOttawa, July 30th, 1914\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 2nd instant in regard to the appointment of a teacher for the Sturgeon Lake School, I beg to say that your suggestion that the resident Missionary should be given the use of the teachers house and that a single teacher should be secured who could board with the Missionary whose wife would act as matron in giving the pupils their mid day meal, does not appeal to the Department which would prefer that the services of a married man should be secured as was suggested in our letter to Lordship of the 4th of May last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to submit herewith my application for this work.\n\nI am a second year student of Emmanuel College, Saskatchewan, and hold seven class certificates at the Saskatchewan University viz.: 3 English, 3 History, and 1 Philosophy classes. In the junior matriculation tests I passed Arithmetic & Algebra, Geometry, English and Greek and Chemistry.\n\nI was born in May 1885. I held the appointments of Sorting clerk and Telegraphist for the English Post Office from 1902 until 1910, and resigned in order to take up my present occupation which is that of Student mission under the direction of the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nWith regard to the post of Field Mission\u2014 I am unmarried but have an aunt who is a trained and certificated nurse. My aunt is at present in England but was to arrive here next spring to assist my father. If necessary in order for this post, my aunt would take passage as soon as possible.\n\nI have had no practical experience in day school teaching, but, I attended the short Normal training course of lectures provided for students at the University of Saskatchewan during last session.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nGeorge Swift.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI receive Mr. Swift's application with my approval. I have no other candidate in sight, that is no suitable one. Mr. Swift has had no experience of teaching, but has had a good education & has had a short Normal course. I can testify to his high character, & am sure he will be diligent & pains-taking. If you accept his appointment I should be glad to hear from, also what salary you will give.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sep. 7th, 1st ap. proved by the correspondence July 2nd at least for the present as matron & the ability to dispense the medicines &c. &c. as in my letter of July 2nd.

He states that if appointed he would get an aunt, who is a trained and certified nurse, to come out and take up the field matron work on the reserve.\n\nI would recommend this arrangement in preference of the former proposition of the Bishop, which was to allow the half-breed missionary and his family to occupy the teacher's house and get a single teacher to board with them and allow the missionary's wife to act as matron, as it would be better to keep the school work and missionary work as separate as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

George Swift,\nTeacher.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI think you are aware that Mr. Swift, teacher at Wargent Lake Reserve, has resigned his post, left at the end of March, having enlisted in the 188th Battalion here. I could not but approve of his decision when he gave me his reasons. I have been unable to obtain a teacher in any way fit for the post. But I have the prospect of two well trained & certificated ladies, who desire to take up Indian work, either of whom will do well, after the summer holidays. I have therefore notified Mr. Crombie, Inspector, & hereby apply to you for your sanction, that I have, as the only visible solution, asked Rev. Mr. Leclair, my missionary there, to teach school for May & June. I will keep him busy work a little for the present, but it will be better than closing the School.\n\nI have told him that it is only as teacher that he is appointed, & that the mid-day meal &c. dispensing, &c. will be left to the matron, Miss Swift, unless Mr. Crombie sees fit to make any other arrangement. I also told him that the S.D. would settle with him as to salary. I suppose you will pay him at the same rate as Mr. Swift, $600 per ann., I think, according to the no. of school days kept. I believe he is at least as competent a teacher as Mr. Swift; he has the advantage of talking Cree, nothing but Cree plain things to the pupils, &c. &c. &c. I am anxious to hear from you with kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Newnham, Deputy Superintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your application, however, did not accompany His Lordship's letter and he was written to and advised that the Department would like to have full information in regard to your age, qualifications, experience, etc., and also to know whether you are any relation to Miss Swift, who is at present field matron on this reserve. As soon as this information is received your application will be considered. I may inform you that the Bishop has been advised that the Department wishes to retain Miss Swift's services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRobert Swift, Esq.,\n421 Avenue H. North,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nI acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter of the 10th inst regarding my appointment as school teacher for the Sturgeon Lake Indian School. I regret however to state that circumstances prevent me from accepting the position and would ask you to kindly consider my application cancelled.\n\nIt pleases me to know that Miss Swift is to be retained as Missionary as she is my aunt and it was chiefly on her account that I desired to fill the position. I understand that the Rev. Leclair is taking the school at present, and so long as he is in the position to fill the requirements of the Department there is no object in making any changes. I am writing to this Lordship the Bishop regarding my action in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\nRobert Swift\nOttawa, July 29, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn that you will not be able to take charge of the Sturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRobert Mift, Esq.,\n421 Avenue H., North,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nOttawa, July 29, 1916.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Robert Swift, whom Your Lordship nominated for the position of teacher of the Sturgeon Lake Day School, stating that he will not be able to accept this position. Mr. Agent Milligan in a recent communication in regard to this school states that the Indians are not at all satisfied with the arrangement of having a preacher and teacher combined and I have to ask Your Lordship to be good enough to try and secure the services of a suitable teacher to take charge of this school after the holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. Le Clair,\n\nI was unable, for various reasons, to reply to your former request regarding Sturgeon Lake School & Mr. Swift.\n\n1. There was no need to answer June 30th because Mr. Swift withdrew his application. He was nephew to Miss Swift, the Field Matron.\n\n2. I wrote what Mr. Milligan says as to the Indians desiring a lady teacher. I have been trying to get one ever since last spring.\n\nI have a very capable & experienced one who could come in December. She has taught very acceptably in one of our 2nd Boarding schools. I have another in view\u2014only after 2 days! I thought that if the Indians would be content to let the school remain closed till Nov. 1st instead of having the \"preacher\" turn teacher, or if the S.D. would sanction that I could engage this good teacher, Miss Harmon, to come by Nov. 6th. I can not hear of any other suitable teacher. I am sure that under present conditions a lady to live with Miss Swift, would do better than a male teacher. I never intended to have \"a preacher-teacher combined,\" but the Indians should be thankful that Mr. Le Clair consented to keep the school open for the few weeks.\n\nI shall await your reply as to Miss Harmon & your consent to wait till Nov. 6th.\n\nYours Truly,\nJ. H. Newham\nBishop of Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 22, 1916.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 15th instant with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Sturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Your Lordship states that you have a very capable and experienced teacher who would be able to take charge of this school on or about the 6th of November, next, the Department will wait until that time before appointing a regular teacher for this school. In the meantime the Department would like to be informed as to whether it would be possible for the Rev. Mr. LeClair to teach this school until that date. The Indians would no doubt consent to that arrangement. The Department would like to have this school in operation, so as not to deprive the Indian children of the benefits of an education until such time as Miss Harmon, the lady named by Your Lordship, would be able to begin duties. The Department would be pleased to hear from Your Lordship regarding this matter and, if it is not possible to secure the services of the Rev. Mr. LeClair temporarily, this school will have to remain closed until November, next.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime and in order that the school may not remain closed His Lordship is being requested to consult the Rev. Mr. Leclair in order to secure, if possible, his services as teacher temporarily until the first of November. If Mr. Leclair is unable to take up this work this school will have to remain closed until such time as the teacher the Bishop has in view for the position is able to take up the work at this point in November, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. LeClair was going to teach their school they were not going to send their children and that they are in favour of having the school remain closed until a qualified teacher can be secured.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not wish to have this school closed and, as the lady teacher the Bishop has secured cannot take charge until the early part of November, it is considered that the Indians should not object to the Rev.

I believe that Mr. Leclaire was unable (unavailable) to carry on the school during Sept., Oct., that it remained closed; but of this I am not quite sure. But I write now to tell you that I have just seen the lady I proposed & you accepted for the school, Miss Kate Harmon, & she will open the school on Monday, the 6th November. She needs till then for a rest, holiday, & for the attention of dentist & doctor. As I informed you, she is a highly trained & experienced teacher, first in England & then in Saskatchewan, & has given very great satisfaction to us & to the parents by her teaching in the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nI shall be glad to receive from you any information or instructions you may wish to give her re., her appointment. I will pass all on her, as she has left me her temporary address.\n\nAmong other things, I would like to be able to tell her privately what her salary is. I can not find a definite mention of it in any of your letters re. her appointment. But from letters about similar schools, & from what Mr. Swift received, I understand that it will be at least $600 for teaching only, & that...\npresent, at all events, the rest of the S.D. remittance for salaries, goes to the Matron, Miss Swift, who is giving such satisfaction. I have an indistinct idea that there was, either promised or actually remitted, a small monthly grant for payment of a girl to cook the mid-day meal, that Mr. Swift received this when he was the Teacher. As Miss Swift, Matron, & Miss R. Harmon, Teacher, will share the S.D. Teacher's house, & probably combine their housekeeping, it is important that these matters of Salary & allowance should be laid down clearly to avoid misunderstanding. I would ask therefore for a reply to this letter, & for information & instructions for Miss Kate Harmon.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

As you will remember we brought this matter up before you some time ago, and we understand you to say then that you took a favorable view of the matter, and would recommend it to the Department. As we have not heard of anything definite with regard to this request, we wish you would kindly bring it before the proper authorities and ask them to grant us our desire.\n\nAs this reserve is about the center of the reserves to the North, East, South and West of here, we think the site, where the school is now on this reserve, would be a good site for the proposed Boarding School. Hasting you will take the same view as we do of this matter, and hoping you will recommend it to the Department in the near future.\n\nMembers of the Band\n\nGeorge Charles John Green\nCharles Erminie Edward Wilson Chief Thomas Charles\nWilliam Charles Alex Robertson Councilor Joseph Hunter\nRoger Daniels Albert Ballantine Rig Hard\nJohn Daniels Joe Pelt George Williams\nLong John John Badger\nAlbert Edward Scott Peter Scott\nJohn Macdonald John Turner\nDavid Anderson Thomas Pelt\nSquawing Johnson Fred Ballantine\nJames Pelt\n\nNote: These Indians on this reserve held a meeting among themselves on Sat.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I am having considerable trouble in getting any one to do the transporting of pupils from the east side of the Sturgeon Lake reserve to the school; it will be noticed by the vouchers forwarded since the first of November last that there has been a great many changes. James Peter is doing it at the present time, but intends quitting at the end of the month, unless he is furnished with a team, and an increase of pay of 50\u00a2 per day.\n\nHe would be willing to pay $20.00 per month from his transporting money until the team is paid for, and continue the job till then, while $2.50 per day appears high, this man travels fully 10 miles in making his trip from the time he leaves home in the morning until he reaches the school, and the same in the evening, the distance being too great to go home after nine, and return before four O'clock. In the meantime there is nothing for him to earn anything at. He draws on an average 10 pupils a day. Considering all things there is not much in it for him even at $2.50 per day.\n\nThe question is would the money paid the two transporters $4.50 per day not furnish breakfast and supper for the children, they get their dinner now, and a biscuit or two at 4 O'clock, they could furnish their own blankets and sleep in the dormitory, and their parents could come after them on Friday nights and return them on Monday mornings.\nNo doubt that in the event of this change taking place the Assistant Matron would expect an increase in salary, but in my opinion it would be adviseable to give it a trial before purchasing horses.\n\nEnclosed find letter forwarded to me some time ago.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, April 3, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the transporting of the children to and from the Sturgeon Lake Day School and enclosing a communication signed by a number of Indians of this reserve asking that a boarding school be erected at this point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to furnish James Peters, who has been driving the children from the east side of the reserve, with a team of horses and give him an increase of pay of fifty cents a day.\n\nThe Department has decided to discontinue the transporting of the children on this reserve to and from school after the end of this month and you will be good enough to inform the Indians who have been doing this work accordingly and also the teacher.\n\nIn reference to the Indians request for a boarding school I beg to say that the Department has no funds available at the present time for this purpose and you will be good enough to inform them accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. A. Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to yours of the 3rd inst., No 117330/1 I have the honor to report that owing to the way the Indians are located on the Sturgeon Lake reserve, there would be a very small attendance, if the transporting of children is discontinued.\n\nThe school is situated about the centre of the reserve around which there are only five families; another bunch are on the west end, some seven miles distant, the remainder scattered East of the school which necessitates a trip of ten miles to gather them up.\n\nFurthermore, we have recently outfitted Roger Daniels the West end transporter, with a team of horses on which he still owes a balance of $260.00, with a credit of $40.00 in his favour on the team in question, authority dated October 20th '16 No 427018/7 on which there might be some trouble in collecting if he were to lose his job of transporting.\n\nI have seen Barney Weechen who has one horse, and all the necessary equipment, but another horse, he is willing to take on the work at $2.00 per day and continue it until the extra horse is paid for at the rate of $20.00 per month, on the conditions that the Department will purchase him the horse, I think a suitable mate to his present one could be purchased for $150.00.\n\nI would recommend this small expenditure in preference to the discontinuance of the transporting under the existing circumstances.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has been credited with the sum of $40.00 of this amount and it is a question whether the horse should be taken over by the Department and a refund made to him of the $40.00 already paid.\n\nIf Daniels is farming and there is any likelihood of his being able to pay for the team, the Department would be willing to allow him a reasonable time to complete the purchase, if not it would like you to make the best disposition you can of these horses.\n\nMr. Milligan gives the name of Barney Weechen who has a horse and needs another to make a team.\n\nWhen you next visit this reserve the Department would like you to look into this matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Milligan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI note that Miss H. Harmon's resignation of the Sturgeon Lake Day School is accepted. My suggestion of finding a male teacher whose wife might be field-matron was owing to the fact that I understood that Indian Agent Mr. Milligan wished Miss Swift to go to Mistawasis or Snake Plain Reserve. I value Miss Swift's work and have no wish to lose her services. I have not yet secured a teacher for Sturgeon Lake, though I am corresponding with some suitable persons. My failure to secure one yet is partly due to the fact that I have not been sure whether to get a lady, a gentleman, or a married couple. I have not been able to see Mr. Milligan to find out whether he wished to move Miss Swift or not. If not, I shall have to get a lady, who can share the residence with Miss Swift. I will notify you as soon as I secure one. The school must, I suppose, remain closed till I can find a teacher. Teachers are very scarce.\n\nYours faithfully,\nJ. A.

The Department regrets that you have not been able to secure a teacher for this school, but it is hoped that you will be able to do so in the near future.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Agent suggests that a doctor be not appointed for that Agency, but that Dr. Duncan be continued on as they are doing at present on the call system. Therefore it has been costing the Government about $125.00 a month with a resident physician, and at the present way it costs only about $25.00 a month, and I understand it is very satisfactory to the Indians. He also suggests that Miss Swift, the Field Matron at Sturgeon Lake be transferred to the Agency, and as they are having difficulty in securing a teacher for the school there, that it would be a splendid idea for a man and wife to be stationed at Sturgeon Lake Reserve, the man to act as teacher and his wife to be appointed field matron. Miss Swift could live at the Doctor's house at the agency.\n\nI think by taking these measures it would give efficient services and would be very economical. Anyway it would be almost impossible to get a doctor to go there on salary given by the Department. When Dr. Duncan was there he had a large outside practice which enabled him to get along. He now retains that same outside practice which a new man would be unable to get.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) O.I.Grain.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shaw, owing to the small attendance on account of the migration of many of the families to the south end of the reserve, and it is thought that Mr. Shaw and his wife, who has been acting as field matron, might be transferred to Sturgeon Lake.\n\nA few days ago Archdeacon MacKay wrote to the Department suggesting that, as it has been decided to close the Pas Hospital, a nurse be sent to the MacKay Boarding School. This suggestion was approved of and, if Mr. and Mrs. Shaw are transferred to Sturgeon Lake, Miss Swift, who is acting as field matron there at present, might be sent to the MacKay Boarding School as nurse.\n\nKindly advise the Department as soon as possible as to whether these arrangements meet with Your Lordship's approval.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

This was negatived by your department as it said that it desired to retain Miss Swift as matron. I therefore abandoned that plan. About a week ago I notified your department that I had secured the services of Martha Coburn, a teacher with a 3rd. class certificate, & I asked the Department to appoint her. I told her father to send for her, & have her ready to begin work. I have now little chance of procuring a married man, having refused two because of the Department's decision about Miss Swift, & I hope that the Department has appointed Miss Coburn. Please let me have your decision as soon as possible. I may add that the delay in opening the school is largely due to the lack of co-ordination between the Ottawa & local I.D. officials hindering my action.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nyours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nYour latest information about the Sturgeon Lake School, & your request as to change in appointment, was rather upsetting. I had previously, in accord with your letter of 26th, notified Miss Martha Coburn of her appointment. You ask my approval of these new arrangements. Certainly, under the new conditions at James Smith's Reserve & the Mackay Boarding School, I heartily approve\u2014if we can get Miss M. Coburn to acquiesce, or if the I.D. takes all responsibility. We must not forget that Miss Coburn was appointed last week. I have at once written off very fully to Miss Swift & Miss Coburn, telling the whole state of affairs, asking Miss Swift to accept the Pas Nursing position, & Miss Coburn to cancel the appointment & look elsewhere. I will write you further as soon as I hear.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A Saskatchewan Bishop\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 22nd ultimo, No. 407,555-7 regarding the transfer of Miss Swift from Sturgeon Lake Reserve to the Agency, I have the honour to report that I have consulted Bishop Newnham with a view to making room for a married man and his wife to act as teacher and field matron respectively at Sturgeon Lake. As he has already nominated Miss Coburn as teacher, and the same has been confirmed by the Department, he is not in favor of the transfer. Therefore, in looking at it from all angles, I would recommend that the question be left in abeyance at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 20, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant in regard to the changes at the James Smiths and Sturgeon Lake Schools and the appointment of Miss Swift as nurse at the MacKay Boarding School.\n\nThe Department would like to be advised as to whether Your Lordship has yet received any word from Miss Swift and Miss Coburn.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI write once more about the Sturgeon Lake School. I hope that this time the matter may be settled finally. Miss Swift will not go to The Pas, nor is she wanted there, as Archdeacon MacKay has a nurse. But she will go to the Mistawasis Reserve, if the I.D. is still of the same mind & desires her as Field Matron there. This will agree with the recommendations of Inspector D. Grant & Ind. Agent Milligan (your Lett. 22nd & Mr. Milligan) & will enable me to carry out your wish as to a married teacher for Sturgeon Lake. Then Mr. & Mrs. Shaw will be glad to go to Sturgeon Lake when you close the North James Smith Reserve School (your #117330/1, Lett. 36). Miss Owen has, after all, just accepted the Sturgeon Lake School, & this has opened the way for the above plan.\n\nI beg, then, to approve heartily of your proposed arrangement.\n\n1. Miss Swift to Mistawasis & 2. Mr. & Mrs. Shaw to Sturgeon Lake.\n\nMay I ask you to notify Mr. Milligan of this, & also (if you think fit) Mr. Shaw & Miss Swift, as they would appreciate getting the authoritative notification from the I.D. You do not say when you will close the James Smith Reserve. I suppose at Christmas; but I should like to know when to expect the change.\n\nI would add that Miss Swift has found it impossible to get either the Farm Instructor at Sturgeon Lake, or Ind. Agent Milligan, to attend to necessary repairs to the furnace & to the broken windows.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe digging of the well has also been very dilatory; the young men at work idling half the time, & putting the S.D. to very unnecessary expense; & the Farm Instructor seems incapable of authority or supervision, while Mr. Milligan is inaccessible. All this especially furnace windows, should be attended to before the new teacher comes.\n\nI do not wish to intrude in your department, or meddle with your business, but I would like to suggest that as Mr. Milligan is so hard to reach (a letter takes about a week from Sturgeon Lake to Wistowosis) most delays are caused,\n\n(1) that Mr. Milligan should be instructed to attend promptly to the \"idents\" for furnace, windows, etc. (2) that the Farm Instructor should have authority to do what is needed at once, & to make your workmen earn their wages, &c. If he can not make his authority felt he should be superseded by one who can. A lady can not see after these things; it will not be so bad when a male teacher is in residence.\n\nI trust you will see your way to the above appointments of Mr. Shaw & Sturgeon Lake & Miss Swift & Wistowosis.\n\nVery D. remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

At the present time Miss Swift has a younger\npister living with her, acting as assistant and preparing the mid-day meals for the school children for which she is receiving $100 per year, this would not be necessary here. In event of this school being opened it is too far distant for her to act in that capacity; so that they would either have to separate or live on $300 per year. The Matron herself would be quite helpless, if left alone, in the way of attending furnace, cutting wood, setting in water. \u2014 So considering everything the expense of moving, fuel & salary \u2014 I am of the opinion her services could be dispensed with. Further the Bishop has no jurisdiction over the Reserve, it being Presbyterian in the way of recommending any of the appointments.

We are all very anxious that our children should attend school regularly and not grow up without any knowledge of English.\n\nCould arrangements be made whereby our children could be taken as boarding pupils at the Sturgeon Lake Day School. The residence there is large and would accommodate a number of boarders if fitted up for that purpose.

He was transferred as teacher to the Sturgeon Lake school from the school on the James Smith's Reserve on January 1, 1918. His salary while at the James Smith's school was $500 per annum, and he was transferred to Sturgeon Lake at the same salary, which he has continued to receive up to the present time. He is also provided with a residence. His wife performs duties as field matron on the Reserve. In addition to salary, he has been allowed bonus at the rate of $150 per annum from April 1, 1919. He has a First Grade State of Iowa Certificate. The Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, and he was nominated for the position of teacher by the Bishop of Saskatchewan, and his transfer from the James Smith's school to the Sturgeon Lake school was also made at the request of the Bishop.\n\nI may say that no promise was made by this Department to grant Mr. Shaw an increase of $50 per year in his salary until such time as he would receive $900 per year. We do not give annual increases to teachers in Indian schools. When increases are granted, such are made on the recommendation of the Indian Agent or the School Inspector and in consideration of the work the teacher is performing.\n\nWe will take up with our Indian Agent the question of granting Mr. Shaw an increase in salary for the coming school year, beginning September 1st, next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Shaw, Teacher of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nAt present Mr. Shaw is receiving salary at the rate of $500 per annum, plus bonus provided by law. He is also provided with a residence. As you are aware, his wife performs duties as Field Matron on the Reserve for which she is paid a salary.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish a full report as to the success Mr. Shaw is meeting in his work at this school, and whether you consider he is entitled to an increase in salary, and, if so, the amount you suggest he should receive by way of an increase. You should also state the qualifications which Mr. Shaw possesses.\n\nAn early reply is expected in order that if any increase is granted it can date from the beginning of the present school year, viz: Sept. 1, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Shaw, Teacher of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Shaw has only one arm, though this does not in any way interfere with him carrying out his duties. He is very energetic, has always one of the best gardens in his district, not only providing for his own use, but for the Day School throughout the year, all kind of vegetables. He will do all kind of small jobs around the buildings, without expecting the Department to re-imburse him, as some of the other teachers expect. He gets on exceptionally well with the Indians and White Settlers, and is always endeavouring to draw them together.\n\nHis qualifications are:\n\nState of Iowa, First Class Teachers Certificate.\n\nState of Iowa, Department of Interior Civil Service Certificate.\n\nI find that Mr. Shaw obtains very good results with his pupils, and no doubt if the children attended regularly, better results would still be obtained, the trouble is, that when the parents go hunting and trapping, they take the children as they have no place to leave them.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Shaw be granted an increase of $200.00 per annum.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, September 30, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, furnishing a report on the work which Mr. Henry W.

This will make the salary allowed him from that date at the rate of $600 per annum. He will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Shaw accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Shaw, is quite careless about his personal appearance.\n\nAs you are aware, it is most important that the personal appearance of those instructing Indian children should be beyond criticism, and I would request you to bring this matter to the teacher's attention, and it is hoped that there will be no cause for the Inspector to remark on this on the occasion of his future visits to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Shaw, teacher, Sturgeon Lake Reserve school, personal appearance.\n\nI quite agree with Mr. Tomlinson as regards his remarks, though I consider some allowance should be made on account of Mr. Shaw's disability. No doubt you are aware that he has only one arm, he is very energetic, and will not allow any person to wait upon him, he doing all the chores himself, such as attending to the furnace, garden etc., which means that he cannot keep his clothes in the condition that a person can who has two arms.\n\nIf Mr. Shaw lacks in his personal appearance, he certainly makes up for it in his work, always having a good garden, keeping the buildings in a neat condition, and helping the Indians and White Settlers whenever possible.\n\nOn my next visit to Sturgeon Lake, I will take the matter up with Mr. Shaw, with an endeavour to have him improve some.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJohn Weir\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussel T.

He further states that the farm instructor suggests that the settlers on each side of the river take week about in providing transportation for all those children living at that end of the reserve.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be feasible to have this done and you should make every endeavour to arrange this matter. It is understood, of course, that there will be no expense to the Department in this connection, as it is considered that the Indians should show their interest in the education of their children by arranging for their transportation to the school.\n\nThe method of transporting them, as suggested above, should not cause any undue inconvenience to any of the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There was an epidemic of La Grippe on this reserve and this school was closed on that account before I left the reserve. There are two centres of population on this reserve. The school is situated at the west end. There are eleven pupils enrolled which is all the children of school age residing within a reasonable distance of the school. The children of school age whose parents reside at the east end of the reserve are attending the residential schools at La-la-Ronge, Duck Lake and Onion Lake.\n\nThe school room has been repaired since my last visit one year ago. The windows on the north-west side have been closed and light now comes in from four windows on the south-west side of the room. The building is very comfortable. The room is 18' x 26' with a 12' ceiling. The exterior has been white washed and presents a neat appearance.\n\nMr. H.W. Shaw has been teacher here for many years, and is doing good work. His influence is good on the reserve. He works in harmony with the Department officials and the Principals of the residential schools. The Teacher's residence is a large well built frame building, and it is in good condition, it has been repainted and presents a good appearance. The furnace had burnt out beyond repair. This was reported at once to you and action taken to replace it.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nWith regard to the Sturgeon Lake Day School, there is nothing that requires particular attention, further than to mention the fact that the furnace in the teacher's residence which is reported as having burnt out beyond repair is being replaced at the present time.\n\nThere is nothing requiring attention in connection with the Day School on the Sioux Reserve.\n\nThe Big River Day School does not amount to much, and I doubt whether it would pay the Department to build a new school. My own opinion is that the time is coming when there will be a boarding school in the north to take care of the children on all these reserves.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding Mr. Hutchinson, teacher at the Sandy Lake School, the Department are well aware of the situation at that point, and know all about Mr. Hutchinson. He has been reported on quite frequently. He is a hard man to get along with but his wife is doing good work as Field Matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nDecember 6th, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nSTURGEON LAKE SCHOOL.\n\nIn the event of Mr. and Mrs. Shaw being appointed to the New Reserve (Little Red River) I shall be very glad to nominate for the appointment to the school at the Narrows, Sturgeon Lake, the Rev. R.J. Fife, and Mrs. Fife for the matron's work on that Sturgeon Lake Reserve only.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Fife: his educational qualification is as follows:\n\nSaskatchewan 3rd class teachers' Certificate, dated April 25, 1917.\n\nTaught in the Battle Bank school from 1915 to 1918, and afterwards in Lindsay and Ridge schools near Prince Albert to 1921.\n\nHe then went to the University of Saskatchewan and passed in the following subjects: English, I - II - IV.\nHistory, I - II - III.\nPhilosophy, I and IV.\n\nHe also took from President Murray, Education I, and I believe this entitles him to a higher educational certificate, but he entered the Ministry instead, so that although he has not any further certificate, yet his educational standing ought to rank with a first class.\n\nMr. Fife is an exceptionally fine character and will I feel sure make an ideal Indian teacher. He offers for this work at my strong request, because for quiet, earnest steady teaching we shall have few better. Of course if you only rank him as a 3rd class teacher, I am afraid the recommendation would be off, because I cannot expect a man to give up an appointment of $1500, together with his house and car, etc., for that. He is quite willing to give it up and take $1200, but he cannot do with less. We will give the $250, for Sunday duty if you will give the $950 for his teacher's experience and ability.\nWith regard to Mrs. Fife, she has brought up a young family of five children, and is quite prepared to be tested by any medical practitioner as to her knowledge of simple medicines and remedies, and therefore would be quite competent to take the matron's work in the restricted area of Sturgeon Lake if the other part on the New Reserve is given to Mrs. Shaw.\n\nI am particularly anxious that we should get Mr. and Mrs. Fife into the Indian work.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nG.

Mr. Fife's appointment, at a salary of $950 for the ten teaching months, is approved. Mrs. Fife will receive the post of field matron, at a salary of $240 per annum. There are different regulations governing the salary payments to teachers and field matrons. It is desirable that field matrons' salaries be divisible by twelve.

The average for 16 days during the month was a little over 13. The children who are enrolled reside from 1/2 to 4 miles from the school. The attendance is not at all satisfactory. The Indians appear to take their children away from school when they go hunting, digging root, or when they have occasion to leave the reserve, and it is a difficult matter for a teacher to show satisfactory progress with an intermittent attendance. The Rev. F. J. Fife has been in charge as teacher since last March. I would judge that he is qualified and is attentive to his duties in connection with the school.\n\nThe children had a healthy appearance. For recreation they have a swing and play baseball. A mid-day meal, consisting of vegetable soup, biscuits and tea, is provided.\n\nThe school premises were fairly tidy. The interior of the classroom has been re-decorated and presented a bright and cleanly appearance.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good condition as regards paint, in and out.\nRegina, Sask., Nov. 14th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nReport on schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nI visited this school on October 24th, and found 4 boys and 5 girls present out of an enrolment of 19.

This is not the first time I have received complaints about this school and the Agent has been written to but apparently is unable to improve matters.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSTURGEON LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was also closed at the time of my visit. The premises were neat and tidy, and the buildings are in a good state of repair. The Rev. F. J. Fife, a fully qualified teacher, is in charge. There are 11 boys and 11 girls enrolled, the average attendance being ten. This school is situated near the west end of the Sturgeon Lake Reserve, and the attendance is practically drawn from that end of the reserve. The Indians are divided into two communities, one at the extreme east, and the other at the extreme west of the reserve. Those residing at the east end of the reserve are too far away from the school to attend, unless some arrangement could be made for bringing them to the school.\n\nSq! [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRev. Fredrick Fife - Age 50.\n\nQualifications:- Third Class Saskatchewan (expired); partial University work.\n\nSuccess:- Average. It is difficult to pronounce with any finality as the school was upset for reasons indicated below.\n\nSuggestions:- The work would be more effective if more systematically organized, better order established and closer supervision of seat work maintained.\n\nMr. Fife has the good will of his pupils. They obey with reasonable promptness, appear to try to please their teacher and show satisfactory interest in their work. The beginners class have made good progress and satisfactory standards are maintained for them. The other grades did not appear to be up to grade in all subjects examined, nor did their classes do so heartily. The pupils were probably more upset than their teacher by the irregular session of school.\n\nI believe that Mr. Fife is carrying on satisfactorily. I believe it would be well, if possible, for a means to be provided for the raising of the professional standing of those Indian teachers who do not hold permanent certificates of average class.\n\nIt would be more satisfactory to teacher and inspector if two visits were made each year.\nApril 23, 1932.\n\nMemorandum - Concerning the Services of the Rev. E. V. Bird,\nAt present Teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School.\n\nRev. Mr. Bird was first employed by the Department at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. He served there for 3 years, 1920-23, with considerable success. He applied for the principalship of the Mackay Indian Residential School and was given a fair trial there, somewhat against the advice of departmental officers. He was relieved of his duties in 1927, and Bishop Lloyd, when nominating him for the James Smith Indian Day School, stated that he had not been a success in the residential institution \"as expected\" (this file) (The appointment, of course, had been made by the M. S. O.). The trouble which led to his removal from the Mackay School was in connection with corporal punishment. Both the Church and the Department investigated, and the Church, on its own initiative, relieved him of his post. (128-1-1).\n\nFrom 1927, Mr. and Mrs. Bird were at the James Smith Indian Day School (Fort a la Corne North). In October, 1930, the Church notified the Department that Mrs. Burbridge, teacher of the south end of the reserve, was leaving. A month later, Mrs. Burbridge put up a fight against her retirement and complained of the activities of the Rev. Mr. Bird. (109-9-1). Mr. Bird retaliated in January, 1931, by interesting the Honourable Mr. Weir in his behalf. Further, Mr. Bird wrote the Superintendent General, complaining of Indian Agent Schmidt (D. M.'s Private File 329) and she wrote the Department, protesting about the procedure in calling the medical officer to the reserve (9-109). In February, the Chief of the Band and the President of the Canadian Legion at Kinistino protested concerning Mrs. Burbridge's dismissal and complained about Mr. Bird. In March, Archdeacon Paul investigated conditions and found the reserve rather divided in its allegiance between the two workers (109-9-1). Mrs. Burbridge left in April, 1931.\n\nIn October, 1931, the Superintendent General asked the Department to remove Mr. Bird from the James Smith Indian Day School and arrangements have been made for him to leave in June, 1932. Bishop Hallam has had an interview with the Superintendent General and it was agreed that he would be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\nMy dear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nIn my letter to you of today, regarding Sturgeon Lake Day School, I nominated Mr. T. M. Gilmore, who is at present teaching at the Stanley Day School.\n\nTo fill the vacancy caused by his going to Sturgeon Lake, I nominate Miss Merritt, who has been a teacher with your Department for some years. As you know, she took her Normal training in England, and secured the Board of Education Certificate for England. She is in Saskatchewan. She secured a permanent Second Class Professional Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan. She has considerable teaching experience, two and half years at Abbey, Sask., two years at Judge Point, Cumberland House (Indian School), one year at Sturgeon Landing, (Indian School), and one year at Ille La Croix, (Indian School).\n\nIn addition to these courses, she took her St. John's Ambulance Certificate and First Aid. It is with confidence that I recommend her for the position at Stanley. She will proceed in by airplane, so an early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Doodt\n\nA. F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 6, 1932.\n\nMy dear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nFor the teacher at the Sturgeon Lake Day School, I nominate Mr. T. L. Gilmore, who is at present teaching under your Department at Stanley. As you are aware, he has done good work and he would welcome a position nearer to Prince Albert, so that he might see his children in the holidays.\n\nYou have his qualifications from the previous appointment, so I take it will not be necessary for me to repeat these. He will be ready to take over the work on the first of September. As you observe, Mr. T. L. Gilmore is not an ordained man.\n\nThe mail service at Stanley is very irregular, so an early reply will be of great help.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.T. Oggdachman\n\nA. F. McKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 11, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant, nominating Mr. T. M. Gilmore, the present teacher at the Stanley Indian Day School, as teacher for the coming school year at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School. The Department will approve of the transfer of Mr. Gilmore, and he should arrange to take up duties at Sturgeon Lake when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 1st, next. The salary allowed him will be at the same rate as he is at present receiving, viz., $95 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year.\n\nRegarding the vacancy at the Stanley Indian Day School, the Department will approve of the appointment of Your Lordship's nominee, Miss Merritt. It is noted she possesses a Second Class Professional Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, and has considerable teaching experience. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year. The holiday period at the Stanley School was taken during the months of April and May, last, and it is presumed that this school has been in operation under Mr. Gilmore's charge during the months of July and August. Miss Merritt should take up duties at Stanley on September 1st, next. I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will inform the Department of Miss Merritt's Christian name, as this is necessary for our records.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Lordship will inform both the above named teachers of the approval granted for their appointment. The Department is informing the local Indian Agents of the above appointments, and requesting that they give these teachers every assistance they can in their work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nEmmanuel College,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nOttawa, August 11, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has nominated the services of Mr. T. M. Gilmore, who is at present teaching at the Stanley Indian Day School, for the position as teacher at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School for the coming school year. The Department is approving of the transfer of Mr. Gilmore as from September 1st, next. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year.\n\nI have to request that when Mr. Gilmore takes up duties at Sturgeon Lake you will give him any assistance you can in his work and in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 107-9-1 of the 11th inst. informing me that Mr. T.M.

It is a mistake to think that there is economy in the purchase of single non-adjustable seats. 11 new seats have been set up; 6 of the pupils sitting in these seats are unable to rest their feet on the floor but have their feet dangling and their arms on desks nearly level with their shoulders.\n\nDate of Report,-June 4th, 1924.\nOttawa, August 15th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report to the Department on his inspection of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the desks which were recently purchased for the use of this school. He states as follows: \"6 of the pupils sitting in these desks are unable to rest their feet on the floor, but have their feet dangling, and their arms on desks nearly level with their shoulders.\"\n\nThe 12 new desks which you obtained from the Western Seating Company in December, last, are for pupils between the ages of 10 and 20 years, and, it would appear, are too large for the pupils who use them. In our letter to you of October 31st, last, giving you authority to purchase these desks, you were requested to consult the teacher as to the sizes required. I shall be pleased if you will explain why desks that are unsuitable were ordered and suggest a remedy for this unsatisfactory condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest.

The class room is 18 x 26 and the ceiling is 12 feet high. The teacher reports that it is very easily heated, and he has no trouble in keeping it comfortable even in the coldest of weather notwithstanding the fact that there are no storm windows. The room is lighted by four windows, two on each side, each having four lights with glass 15\" x 30\". This is an old size and hard to replace. To conform with the public school standards the two windows might be taken from one side of the building and placed on the other so as to bring the light in over the left shoulder, but except from this the building is quite suitable in my opinion and will serve the purpose satisfactorily for some time yet. I note that one panel was broken out of the door and think it would be better to supply a new door, as they aren't very expensive, rather than attempt to repair it.\n\nWith further reference to the windows I may say that the old sash is in a decayed condition and the window sash will have to be replaced very shortly. It would be advisable when replacing these windows to obtain them of a standard size.\n\nThe teacher's dwelling is a large two storey building with a basement heated by a hot air furnace. This building has not been repainted since it was built in 1911. It was originally white with green trimmings, and the paint has stood remarkably well. It should, however, now be repainted.\n\nCommissioner Graham forwarded the above under cover of his letter of February 19, 1926, and states:\n\n\"The first school dealt with is Sturgeon Lake. Certain repairs are required at this school such as replacing the sash, supplying a new door, etc. It seems to me that this could be done for less than $50.00 and if money is available for this I will have the work done at once. If there is money available for painting the teacher's residence I could buy the paint now and have it put on after the 31st of March.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

When timely, you may supply a new door and replace the window sash, as recommended in Mr. Inspector Murison's report. You may also make arrangements to have the teacher's residence painted during the coming year. Do not purchase the materials at the present time, as the appropriation for the current fiscal year is exhausted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

It is assumed that this article is quoted at $24.50 a dozen and, if such is the case, the amount extended at $2.16 is an overcharge of $1.00.

Your F. 107-9-5\n\nIn reply to your favor dated Oct. 11/27, with reference to our Invoice No. W 2322, dated May 13/27, we beg to advise that price of $24.50 is per case of 6 x 10 lb. Tins, as shown on enclosed price list.\n\nWe trust this explanation of our invoice will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE DRIMILK COMPANY, LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentative.\nSTURGEON LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on November 25th, and found 7 boys and 9 girls in attendance, out of an enrolment of 20. The average attendance for the month was 15, which is very good for cold weather. Of the children enrolled, 10 are under 7 years, 7 are 12 years and under, and 3 over 12. The teacher at this school co-operates in influencing the parents to send the older children to the boarding school. He now has a lot of very young children, but they are bright and very interesting. I found them clean and warmly clad. They speak up well and I found conditions I think more satisfactory than I have ever found them at this school. Mr. Henry Shaw continues as teacher at this point. He has had many years experience teaching Indian day schools.\n\nThe building I found clean and comfortable. The teacher has no desk and I would recommend that one be supplied. I noted that the heating stove is pretty well burnt out and it should be replaced with a new one.\n\nThe teacher's residence has been newly painted and the interior partly re-decorated. There is material on hand to finish this work. It was noted that the kitchen floor, 10 x 16, is badly worn and should be replaced.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the five Day schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nThe average attendance at the Sturgeon Lake Day School is not bad, considering the conditions under which the Indians are living. This is undoubtedly the best school of the lot. You will note that the teacher has no desk. It might be a good idea to send one from Eaton's as it would cost very little. There is nothing in the Estimates to provide for a floor for the teacher's residence. This, however, would not cost more than $25.00. The heating stove in the building should be replaced without delay. This will cost about $35.00.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your No. 303-11 of the 23rd ultimo regarding the report of Mr. Inspector Murison on his visit to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a suitable desk for the teacher's use. You may also purchase and have forwarded to the school a heating stove of a type considered by you to be satisfactory to heat the building. You may also arrange to have the kitchen floor in the teacher's residence replaced.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of supplying the desk and stove and the material and labour for the floor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was a very stormy day and only 2 girls and 1 boy were present out of an enrolment of 12 boys and 5 girls. This school is under the auspices of the Anglican Church. Rev. F. T. Fife had been in charge as teacher for three weeks previous to my visit. His wife has been taken on as assistant teacher. The average attendance for January and February at this school was about 6. These were very cold months and the children have, in some instances, a long way to come to the school. At one time drivers were provided in connection with this school, and owing to the fact that there are two centres of population, one at the east and one at the west end of the reserve, it does not seem probable that the average attendance will be satisfactory.\n\n- 4 -\n\nSTURGEON LAKE DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nsatisfactory unless some means are provided to bring in the outlying children.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good shape.

In view of the necessity for economy, it is felt that the services of an assistant to prepare the midday meal at the Montreal Lake, Ahtahkakoops and Sturgeon Lake Schools could be dispensed with from the end of the present quarter. This will result in a saving of $27 a teaching month. The Department feels that the teachers and older girls should be able to prepare and serve the midday meal without cost. You should, therefore, notify those who are at present engaged to prepare the midday meals that their services will not be required after the end of December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Department surely cannot realize the amount of work this means. I was asked last March to continue my work of dispensing drugs and caring for the sick on this reserve, without salary, and I have done this as faithfully as when I drew my salary, and have saved the Indian Department some big hospital bills, for which I would refer you to Doctor Boucher of Deben.\n\nIt is asking a great deal to expect any one person to continue all this besides being tied to the kitchen five whole mornings out of each week for the preparing and serving up of a hot nourishing meal for thirty odd children. This meal is most necessary as some of these children walk a distance of five miles to attend school, and for most of them it is the only nourishing meal they get during the week.\n\nI would ask that this matter be reconsidered.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) C.E. Goodman.\n\nMrs. E.E. Goodman,\nMont Nebo, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 107-9-5 of the 4th inst., wherein you informed me that the services of assistants to prepare midday meals at Montreal Lake, Ahtahkakoops and Sturgeon Lake School would be dispensed with at end of present quarter.\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter received from Mrs. E.B. Goodman, of Sandy Lake Reserve (Ahtahkakoops) for your consideration. I quite agree with her contention that it entails considerable work preparing meals, and I feel sure it would not prove satisfactory if older girls were allowed in the kitchen to prepare meals, as it is they render considerable help cleaning dishes and cleaning dining room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Weir\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mrs. E. B. Goodman, wife of the teacher at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School, in which she requests that her services be continued in the preparing and serving of the midday meal.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no further funds this fiscal year for this service, and I regret that it will not be possible to allow Mrs. Goodman any remuneration for her services in connection with the preparing and serving of the meal after the end of the present quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I noted the condition of the buildings. The school building was built many years ago of spruce logs and has served its purpose. This building, according to information given me, was built over fifty years ago at the east end of the Reserve and was later moved to its present location.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a large frame building, heated with a hot air furnace. This building was originally intended as a semi-residential school, the rear wing being added so that outlying pupils could be accommodated with sleeping quarters from Monday until Friday night. It has however not been used for this purpose and this addition is not required by the teacher. I examined the wing and found that by making some alterations a classroom, 16' x 28', could be provided as well as cloakrooms. This could be done, I am satisfied, at very little cost and would make it unnecessary to provide a separate school building. The ceilings downstairs in the part occupied as a residence by the teacher require replastering. There are two basements under the building, one under the wing mentioned and the other under the portion occupied by -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nportion occupied by the teacher. In the event of remodeling this wing for classroom purposes, I would suggest that a small pipeless furnace be placed in the basement for heating the wing.\n\nI noticed that the outside toilets were in bad condition and should be replaced with new structures.\n\nThe premises appeared to be fairly neat and tidy.\n\nThere were 17 pupils enrolled, 11 girls and 6 boys, and the average attendance for February was 10.13. For the December quarter the percentage of attendance was 84.42. The highest percentage of attendance was in November 87.50.\n\nThe present teacher, Mr. T. E. Macdonald, is a young married man. He holds a second class Saskatchewan certificate. His wife is also a qualified teacher. Mr. Macdonald impressed me as being energetic and capable. I am looking for conditions to improve under his management, as I believe he is the best qualified teacher we have had at this school for many years.\n\nI saw the children in their homes and was favorably impressed by their cleanly appearance. I may say that the Indians of the Sturgeon Lake Reserve generally keep their homes and persons in a clean condition. This particularly applies to the families in close proximity to the school from which the pupilage is obtained.\n\nW. Morrison\nOttawa, March 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Inspector Murison with reference to his recent visit to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Murison states that the rear wing of the teacher's residence is more suitable for school purposes than the log building which is now used. He considered that, by making some alterations, a classroom, $16' \\times 28'$, as well as cloak rooms, could be provided. In the event of this being done, he recommends that a small pipeless furnace be placed in the basement for heating this wing. He also reports that new toilets are required.\n\nPlease give this matter your early attention and advise the Department fully what expenditure would be involved in carrying out Mr. Murison's recommendations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 107-9-5 of the 8th inst. relative to improvements suggested by Inspector Murison on his recent visit to Sturgeon Lake Reserve No. 101 Indian Day School.\n\nAltering the rear wing of the teacher's residence to accommodate school children will take about $100.00. Regarding suggestion that a pipeless furnace be installed at the present I do not think this expenditure necessary as it would take $125.00 to $135.00 to install same, whereas we could use stove at present in use at Day School.\n\nTwo new toilets can be constructed for $30.00. On June 30th, 1934, I took up the question of these but no authority was authorized to build same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, March 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your 303-11 of the 26th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School in the Carlton Agency, I have to say that the Department has received a report from Mr. Agent Davis, Leask, Sask., relative to fitting up a classroom in the teacher's residence, the installation of a pipeless furnace and the building of two new toilets. Agent Davis estimates that the cost of altering the rear wing of the teacher's residence would be approximately $100 and that two new toilets can be constructed for $30.\n\nRegarding your suggestion that a pipeless furnace be installed, Agent Davis reports that he does not think this expenditure is necessary, as it would take approximately $135 to install same, whereas the stove at present in use in the day school would be satisfactory.\n\nThe Department will have funds available in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to carry out the above mentioned improvements; also the replastering of the ceilings downstairs in the part occupied as a residence by the teacher. This work should be carried out during the coming summer holidays, as it is not considered advisable to make any change between now and the end of June. I would request that you arrange with Agent Davis for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, of any materials required, and for the labour in carrying out the work.\n\nThe Agent should obtain itemized accounts, giving full particulars as to the materials and cost of same, and also for the labour. These he should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nMr. Agent Davis is being informed that the above work has been placed in your hands, and that he will likely hear from you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-5, part 2)\nOttawa, March 20, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the improvements suggested by Inspector Murison on his recent visit to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWe are placing the matter of the altering of the rear wing of the teacher's residence, erecting of new toilets, etc., in the hands of Mr. Murison, to have the work carried out during the coming summer holidays. You will, no doubt, hear from Mr. Murison in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. S.

I found that the young children of the Reserve had done this damage and advised the parents that they would have to replace this glass.\n\nThe Indians have now taken up this matter with me and wish to pay for the glass from their Band Funds, the parents of the children putting the windows in free of charge. They also assure us that there will not be a repetition of this occurrence.\n\nIf the Department will grant this request, I will forward a resolution from this Band with the bill of glass.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nLeask, Sask.\nSept. 18th. 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the Sturgeon Lake Reserve we have about seventeen children who live from eight to three and one half miles from the school. Most of these people want to send their children to Boarding Schools but in my opinion it would be far more economical to have a bus take these children to the Day school in the morning and return them home at night. This would be an easy matter as the road passes near most of these homes.\n\nThe cost, to hire a man and team to do this work, at the present time would be about forty dollars ($40.00) per month and an outlay of about fifty dollars ($50.00) for a caboose.\n\nWould you kindly take this matter up with the Dept. and see if there is anything that can be done in this matter. In the meantime I am withholding sending these children to the Boarding school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Davis re transferring children to Sturgeon Lake School, for your instructions.\n\nAs you are aware I am strongly in favour of day schools as opposed to residential, not only in the interest of economy but also in the advancement of the Indian. I have no hesitation in recommending that Mr. Davis' suggestion be approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A.

Instructions will be given to you to retain the cost of the glass from those who were responsible for breaking it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR.S. Davis, Esq.,\nLeask, Sask.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of September 30th, enclosing letter received from Indian Agent Davis with reference to transporting children to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that there are seventeen children who live from 3\u00bd to 5 miles from the school and that the Agent considers these could be taken to school each morning and returned in the evening.\n\nYou may authorize Indian Agent Davis to arrange for the transporting of these children at a cost of $40.00 a month, plus an outlay of approximately $50.00 for a caboose.\n\nFrom the date of commencement of this service until the school closes for the Christmas holidays a list should be kept each day showing the names of the children that used this method of coming to school. This information should be forwarded to the Department when the Christmas holidays commence in order that we can ascertain if the attendance obtained justifies the expenditure that is being incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We regret the error in first computing the rate as set out in our previous voucher.\n\nThe reason that we have vouchered for only part of November for Mr. Brant is because he was replaced on Nov. 29th by an Indian, Wm. Kingfisher, of the Sturgeon Lake Reserve. The voucher for Wm. Kingfisher's wages at the end of December will contain the two days of November.\n\nThe reason for the change was that Mr. Brant did not possess a team of horses, having used his car up to the 27th., when the roads became impassable for this vehicle. And further we thought that it would be advisable to give this Indian an opportunity to earn some money to support his family. At the time the bus was first started the Indians were all busy and it was difficult to get a good man but since the winter has set in there was a better opportunity to get a capable Indian for this position.\n\nWe trust that the above will be meet with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                  | FOLIO | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|--------|---------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|\n| Nov 30 | 28 glass, 14x28, @ 35\u00a2    |       |               |              | 9 80  |\n|        | 6 glass, 12 x 24 @ 30\u00a2    |       |               |              | 1 80  |\n|        | 8 glass 12\u00bd x $5 @ 20\u00a2    |       |               |              | 1 60  |\n|        | 20 lbs putty, @ 10\u00a2       |       |               |              | 2 00  |\n|        | 1 package points          |       |               |              | 20    |\n\n$15 40\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Kernaghan Hardware Ltd.,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Prince Albert, Sask.\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. 30 | To glass and supplies as per invoice to replace windows broken by the children of the Sturgeon Lake Reserve in the School and Residence. | 15.40  |\n\n---\n\n**Authority Letter No. 107-9-5, Oct. 7th, 1937.**\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506**\n\n**Voucher No.:** 717\n\n**DATE:** Dec. 22nd, 1937.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

This average was small on account of the epidemic of Typhoid Fever on the Reserve. In the month of December the average was ten children per day. Most of these children come from the far end of the Reserve, which is about eight miles away.\n\nI have kept the bus running through the month of January, though after looking up my authority, I realize that I should not have done this without first receiving your authority. The bus is still running and I wish you would advise me whether it should continue.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nCopy sent to Dr. Robertson\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the transportation of the children to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School. When this matter was first brought to our attention it was stated approximately 17 children would take advantage of the bus. However, it is noted from your letter that there were only 5 during the months of October and November and 10 during the month of December. Provided the number using the bus does not go much below 10 the Department is prepared to continue the transportation of the children until the end of June. At that time you should forward a statement showing the average number of children transported each month during the academic year 1937-38 and when this information is received the Department will be in a position to decide if this service should be provided during the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.

In forwarding this requisition you made no comment and before approving the teacher's request the Department would appreciate receipt of a recommendation from you. While it would like to encourage Indians to raise chickens at the same time it would want to be assured that if this project was started at the Sturgeon Lake Day School it would be conducted for the benefit of the pupils and it would further require definite assurance that you feel that such action would be beneficial to all parties concerned.\n\nIn the event of the teacher leaving for summer holidays who would be in charge of the chickens?\n\nOn the requisition the teacher also requests a water pump. Please let me know the approximate cost of this and if you consider it necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJune 4th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 27th, file 107-9-5, in regard to the requisition for chickens for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School; I believe that the raising of chickens at any school would be a wonderful thing.\n\nHowever, at this point, the teacher employed by the Department is a young girl, Miss Dessie O Brant. Her father, mother, brother and sister live with her. Her father is employed by the Church as Missionary and is the one who would be looking after the chickens.\n\nMr. Brant would like to take over the school duties from his daughter and I believe that Arch. Deacon Paul will be taking this matter up with you later. In this event the chickens would be well looked after, but if Miss Brant continued as the teacher she might get married or leave the position, and it would then be necessary for the family to move and the next teacher appointed might not be in favour of the experiment.\n\nI feel quite sure, if Mr. Brant was the teacher, that the chickens would be used for the right purpose and he would not leave the Reserve for very long in the summer holidays.\n\nI would recommend that the matter be left in abeyance until next year until the question of the Teacher is definitely settled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to purchasing chickens to be raised at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department is not prepared to take any action in this matter at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

As April was near the end of the term I considered that it would be better to wait for the end of the term and requisition for new desks for the new term; Miss Brant, the teacher at that time was so informed.\n\nHowever, there was a change of teachers and the requisition was not submitted until November. On November 6th I forwarded a requisition for 10 desks for this school for children 12 years old. The proper size, according to your letter, would be size 3, ages 10 to 12.\n\nI am very sorry that the Department has been criticized by Inspector Tomlinson but I would like to point out that it not altogether my fault as, unfortunately, I have one of the largest Agencies in the Province and have less help than some of the smaller Agencies and it is impossible for me to keep my work up to date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

M. Bailey, Departmental Purchasing Agent. The subject matter of this memorandum, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI may state that the Multi Use Cream to which the Purchasing Agent refers costs $6.45 per gallon. He is of the opinion that first grade paint, equally if not more serviceable, might have been secured at $3.00 to $3.50 per gallon.\n\nI am not, as you are no doubt aware, responsible either for the employment, suspension or dismissal of Indian gents. I do feel, however, that I should in fairness to myself point out to you that I have been called upon altogether too frequently during the last few months either to explain or justify or defend the actions of Indian Agent Davis. If this man is over-worked, he should be supplied with additional help; if the agency is too large, ways and means should be considered of reducing it; or if he is dissatisfied with conditions in the Carlton agency, consideration should be given to his removal to another agency. In view of the number of complaints that have reached me with respect to his work, I have no alternative other than to summarize these complaints and to send them on to the higher officials for their consideration and for whatever action they may deem necessary, in view of all the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The cribbing in the well at this school now in use is not in very good condition, and would be unsafe to have the well dug deeper. I would recommend a new well be dug which would be about 50 feet deep. The cost would be around $200.00.

(RG 10, Volume 6293, file 622-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that I have just had a letter from Mr. Raymond G. Robinson, teacher of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School at Sturgeon Lake, in the Carlton Agency, and in this letter he points out that the boys and girls who are attending the school devoted much time and labour on the school garden and their efforts were not in vain as the school have a good supply of potatoes, onions, cabbages, carrots, and turnips in the basement. I know this to be true because I saw their garden and they had a fine crop.\n\nMr. Robinson further mentions what a Godsend it would be to the children if they could have some meat to put in with their stew of vegetables. He states the $50.00 they are allowed for noon-day lunches is spent on the following: flour, cocoa, rice, beans, lard, yeast cakes, pepper, salt, macaroni, etc., therefore they have nothing with which to buy meat.\n\nI would recommend that this man be given $25.00 with which to buy beef. This would make an allowance of $75.00 in all.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, recommending an additional amount for midday meal purposes at the Sturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nAs you state in your letter, we are allowing an amount of $50.00 for the current academic year for this purpose and I note that the school garden has produced a plentiful supply of vegetables which can be used for making soup. I do not see the necessity for purchase of flour and yeast cake.\n\nI would also point out that this year we have forwarded 550 lbs. of the new biscuit to the Sturgeon Lake School. Each of these biscuits weighs 2 ounces and consequently 4400 biscuits were forwarded. The average attendance at this school has been 17 and this means that there are available approximately 270 biscuits for each child. When the formula for these biscuits was prepared the opinion was expressed that they are sufficiently nutritious to dispense with other foods. However, as you are aware, we did not do so but are still allowing the same amount as in previous years.\n\nWith the contents of this letter in mind the Department does not see any necessity of increasing the amount.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-9-5 of the 3rd instant regarding mid-day meal for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School, Carlton Agency.\n\nPersonally, since I first entered the Indian work I have always tried to help those who try to help themselves and are accomplishing something for the Indian work. Here is a teacher who is doing a splendid job of teaching, and both he and his wife are interested in the welfare of the children under their care, and then you ask what they are doing with flour and yeast cakes. They are trying to give the children a little change in food and in all probability they are doing what the teachers used to do with the biscuits they had before, that is hand them out to the children just before they start for home at 4.00 P.M. I do not say they were the same biscuits as those given out today but that is how they were used. You must be aware that the feeding of youngsters on the reserves is not what it should be and the only good meal they get in many cases is what they are given at the school. Many Indian Day School teachers have told me that as soon as the Indian children started to go to School they gradually began to gain weight. Also, we know that the reason many of our Indians are suffering from T.B. today is lack of nourishment.\n\nIn your letter you mentioned that the school garden had supplied a plentiful crop of vegetables. This is quite true but only through the efforts of the teacher who, instead of going away for the Summer holidays stayed at home to work for just this purpose. I am sure the writer of the above mentioned letter knows what soup tastes like without any meat. However, if you say that we cannot have any meat the children will simply have to do without it.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 11, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina,\nSask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department will allow an extra amount of $25.00 for midday meal supplies at the Sturgeon Lake School. This will make a total amount of $75.00 for the current academic year. It should be understood that this amount is being allowed in view of your special representation and is not to form a precedent for future years.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Acct.

It is in a deplorable state of repair, both inside and out.\n\nWith a view of having the greater part of this work carried out next year, an estimate of the work has been made. It is my intention to place this item in my estimates for next year.\n\nIn addition to the above, a requisition has gone forward to Mr. Ostrander for a new heating unit, which must be installed before winter.\n\nIt has been many years since repairs have been carried out at both this and the Little Red River Day Schools. A contributing factor to the run down condition of these buildings has been the fact both buildings have been closed for several months in the past on account of not having teachers, at which time weather conditions have had its effects on plastered walls and the whole structure in general, to say nothing of the havoc wrought by the pupils themselves during months when the buildings have not been occupied.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate of the cost to put this building in repair.\n\nE.

Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nPost Office Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am enclosing requisition referred to in letter 1547-6-18 of June 23, 1949.\n\nThe $645.69 requisition covers a coal and wood furnace. The $675.69 covers a straight wood burning furnace. I would recommend the coal and wood furnace. It would be more satisfactory for our requirements. As stated in my letter of June 22, at the present time the classroom is heated by a separate stove. It is my intention to have installed a furnace with sufficient heating capacity to heat both the teacherage, which as you know, is a 12 room building, and the classroom, which is built into the main building.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nPost Office Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a requisition in connection with a new furnace for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School. You are aware the Sturgeon Lake School re-opened last September after being closed for some months. During the winter it was brought to my attention the furnace was not functioning satisfactorily. Temporary repairs were made at that time.\n\nI have at last been successful in obtaining the services of a member of the M & K Plumbing and Heating Co. Prince Albert, to go over the furnace with me. It is very evident the present furnace will have to be replaced.\n\nIn the past the classroom has been heated by a wood stove set up in the classroom. When the new furnace is installed, it is my intention and understanding that the unit quoted on will have sufficient capacity to heat both the residence, which is a twelve room house, and the classroom.\n\nWhen forwarding this requisition, I realize provisions were not made in the Estimates last year. As previously stated, the school was not in operation when our estimates were prepared and no complaints had been received regarding the heating plant up to that time.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nRegina, June 29th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of two letters from Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, and tender of the M. & K. Plumbing Company, and requisitions for the installation of a coal and wood furnace at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThe furnace at present in the school was temporarily repaired to carry on for the winter, but it is not satisfactory for another winter, and I would recommend that Mr. Jones be given authority to proceed with the installation of the new furnace in accordance with the requisition.\n\nJ.P.B.

There are at present 25 children of school age in the band, of whom 17 claim to be Anglicans and 8 Roman Catholics; but their homes are so scattered that it would be necessary to provide a conveyance, as has been done elsewhere.\n\nFor this reserve, as well as Moosomin's, provision has been made in the estimates for the teacher's salary and for the erection of a school building; but it was not thought best for this year to make any provision for a teacher's dwelling or a pupils' dining room, until the school takes shape and the requirements are more definitely known.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nSgd. W. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nBattleford,\nNov. 15th, 1911.\nOttawa, January 31, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report in which you deal with the establishment of a school on the new Thunderchild's Reserve I beg to say that you have today been written to in regard to the erection of a building on the Moosomin Reserve. In view of the fact that the Indians on the Thunderchild's reserve are divided as to religion the Department is not prepared at the present time to undertake the erection of a school building. The matter should, however, be kept in mind and reported upon by you again next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nI have the honour to say that the Thunderchild Indians requested me, when recently making the distribution of Interest money to them, to make the strongest plea possible, so that they might have a Day School on their Reserve. I might say that there are about 17 children who are of school age; their homes are somewhat scattered; but a good central location for the School is available, so that it would, as far as possible, minimise the distance to be travelled by the children attending school. The School would be conducted under the auspice of the Church of England.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY & SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nSuperintendent of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir \u2014 As I am the missionary in charge at Henderick's and as he asked me to write his letter re the school, for him, I told him I would write a few explanatory remarks on the matter.\n\nThere are at least twenty-five children of school age in the Reserve and it is sad to see them growing up year after year in total ignorance. Their future prospect is indeed very poor, both for themselves and also for the government who will have to look after them in the future.\n\nI am told the Chief has been asking repeatedly for a school; even since they moved in to the new Reserve, after the sale of their old one.\n\nIt is sad to feel that for another generation at least these Indians will not rise any higher than did the generation before them. I feel this, sir, because myself was at one time exactly like one of these, an ignorant Indian.\nunable to speak a word of English, but perhaps I have had better opportunities, and today I can stand on my own feet and will never be a drag on the Canadian government. Why can't other Indian boys attain to a position of self support? All they need is education and that is what the Chief of Thunderchild's so wanting for the young of his Reserve.\n\nHoping that the department will see their way to supplying a good school to this band.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nEdward Akenahew\n\nAddress of Chiefs\nChief Thunderchild\nc/o A. Sufferin\nMewin\nSask.\nThunderchild's Reserve\n\nApril 20th, 1913\n\nSuperintendent of Department of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to ask you about a matter which has been on my mind for two or three years past. We have no school in our Reserve and we have many children of school age who ought to be in school.\n\nYesterday I saw as many members of my band as I could get at, and they are all of one mind that we ought to have a school.\n\nThere has been some talk of our getting a school this summer, but it is so uncertain that I think the safest course for me to take is to appeal directly to you, as the children are growing up fast and soon their chance of education will be gone unless something is done at once.\n\nHoping that you will be kind enough to look after this for me, and thanking you for same in anticipation.\n\nI am\n\nYour friend\n\n(Chief) Thunderchild\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The homes, however, were then much scattered and the success of a day school was problematical.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report fully upon the conditions as they exist, stating also whether there is any building available which might be used temporarily for school purposes. In your report you should deal with the number of children of school age and the distances they reside from the school and give such other information as will enable the Department to deal intelligently with the question.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say, with reference to the necessity for a Day School on the Thunderchild Reserve, that the number of children of school age, within a radius of 2 miles, are 12 Boys and 11 Girls, a total of 23. There is no suitable building available, in which school might be conducted until a proper building is erected. There is an ideal site for a school, centrally located on this reserve.\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RE,\nASSISTANT DEPUTY AND SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nAugust 4, 1913.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI address this letter to you as instructed, and I ask your assistance and advice towards obtaining my request. It is a matter of such importance that I would ask you to bring it before the Minister of Indian Affairs at the earliest possible opportunity, and also to see that the matter is not dropped after it has been opened up.\n\nMy work and the work of my missionaries among our Indians gives us opportunity of learning their state, their needs, their desires, in a way that you will rarely learn from your Indian agents and instructors. I beg therefore, to press upon your Department the pressing need of day schools as follows: (among others perhaps not mentioned) I am sure the Indian Department knows of the non-existence of such schools and of the desire of the Indians to have them, and perhaps the I.D. has been considering the matter. But I would press for the building and maintaining of these schools almost immediately.\n\n(1) The Indians are retrograding and suffering for the lack (2) It does not seem in accordance with \"Treaty\" to leave them without (3) They desire and ask for them. I cannot be sure of correct names, but I think what I write is sufficient to point them out correctly.\n\n1.- Frog Lake, Nos. 121 and 122, but especially Concepowhao (121) We have worked here for years but there has been no school. They sent a few children to Onion Lake boarding school. They will no longer do so as they want the day school system. I have sent a Cree teacher there, Ch. Quinaly, an intelligent, educated man (half breed) I think)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nto open school as best he can in his own house, or in the Indian houses. I have to build a house for him. This is not fair to the Church funds which are not meant for schools. I beg to apply (1) for his salary, (2) for purchase of the residence for him, (3) for a school to be built for him (4) for an improved day school to be maintained.\n\nN.B., I would recommend the closing of Onion Lake School as Boarding school and opening it as improved day school.\n\n2.- Island Lake Band, Nos. 161 and 161A.\n\nWe visit them and hold service there. They belong to our church more than to any other. They come in at times to Onion Lake Church. They should have a school and we are prepared to undertake it on the usual terms.\n\n3.- Thunderchild Band, South from Bright Sand Lake\n\nIt is really a shame that the I.D. has (I believe) given them no school or teacher since they were moved to this location. My Missionary visits them, but only too rarely, since they were moved so far away from his other bands. They should have a good improved day school. The Church of England should be intrusted with its management.\n\n4.- Nut Lake Band, No. 90.\n\nNothing in this lake has ever been done for them. Settlers are now closing in round them, and they need and desire a day school. This ought to be given them without delay. The Church of England is will to try to manage it for the I.D. if the funds are forthcoming. I believe I could get an experienced man and wife (teacher and farm instructors, etc. on U.S.A. Indian reserves) if house and decent salary is forthcoming.\n\n5.- Kinistino Band.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n5.- Kinistino Band, No. 91. Nothing has ever been done by Church or State for this band. They are heathen still. I understand they now desire the school, etc., which formerly they refused. The I.D. ought to give them one.\n\n6.- Stanley Falls\n\n7.- Pelican Narrows\n\nI have already written for these, if not to you, then to Duncan Scott, Esq., Superintendent of Indian Education. They should have, each, a day school for the little ones. They would form capital feeders for the Lac la Ronge and the Pas (when we get it) Boarding Schools.\n\nI should be glad to learn what the I.D. will do and what I, or my missionaries, can do to hasten matters.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.A. Newnham\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, August 25, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's communication of the 4th instant in regard to the establishment of a day school on the Thunderchild's Reserve I beg to say that some few days before the receipt of Your Lordship's letter the Department had written to the Indian Agent asking him to report on conditions on these reserves, as called for in a letter sent to him on May 13th, last.\n\nThe proposition of the Department was that, if any building was available which might be used temporarily for school purposes, a teacher could be sent in. As Your Lordship is aware the homes of these Indians are somewhat scattered, but if there is a possibility of a fair attendance the Department will be prepared to assume at once the responsibility for the salary of a teacher and also to erect a school-house in due course. It may be that your missionary will be able to give further information.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of the Bishop of Saskatchewan for the establishment of an improved day school on Thunderchild's Reserve I beg to say that the question of providing a day school for the Indians of this reserve has been before the Department since May, 1911, and the reasons given for not granting a school there are that the Indians are so scattered that the children would have to be conveyed to school and that, out of a population of 119, 50 Indians are returned as belonging to the Church of England, 59 as Roman Catholics and 10 as pagans. The applications have always been made on behalf of the Church of England, as the Roman Catholics have a boarding school on the reserve.\n\nThe number of children of school age by the last census is given as 19, while the Bishop claims that there are 28 children of who should attend school and that nearly all of them belong to the Church of England. Mr. Agent Rowland in 1913 reported that there were 23 children of school.\nschool age and that an ideal site, centrally located, on which to erect a building, could be had.\n\nIt would be necessary to put a school-house and teacher's residence, as there is no building available in which a school could be conducted.\n\nOn referring to the correspondence I find that the Bishop was informed in August, 1913, that if any building were available and there was a possibility of a fair attendance the Department would be prepared to assume at once the responsibility for the salary of a teacher and also to erect a school-house in due course and His Lordship was asked to call on his missionary to supply further information. This is the last letter on file.\n\nMr. Agent Rowland gives it as his opinion that a good day school on this reserve would be very useful and it seems to me that there are a sufficient number of children of school age to justify a school being maintained there. There is no provision in the estimates for a building or teacher's salary.\nEXTRACT FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF AGENT J.A. ROWLAND ON THE EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE BATTLEFORD AGENCY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH, 31st, 1915.\n\nThere has been a move made to secure a day school for the Thunderchild Reserve. There are quite a number of children here growing up without an education and it is time they were given an opportunity to get it. Probably an improvement will be shown in the living of the members of this band if they secure the right party to act as teachers.\n\n(signed) J.A. Rowland,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have written the Department today recommending the starting of a school on the Thunderchild Reserve. Should the Department see fit to adopt my recommendation and have a school started on this reserve, it will be necessary to erect buildings for same. Before doing so I would like to draw your attention to the class of school buildings erected on the Red Pheasant and Littlepine Reserves in the summer of 1913. The school and teachers residence in these two cases are separate buildings and require two furnaces to heat them. This throws a lot of work on the teacher who has the fires to attend to. If you think it would be advisable I would like you to consult the Government architect to see if these two buildings could be placed under the one roof and heated from the one furnace. There would be quite a saving in the cost of the erection of the buildings, and in the winter a big saving in the cost of the fuel required to run them. In drawing the plans I would like the building to be so arranged that it can be enlarged when required. At the present time the dining room at the Red Pheasant School is filled up with the children and if the attendance increases it will necessitate enlarging the room.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq\nIndian Agent\nSupt General Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nMarch 12th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, in reference to the establishment of a day school on the Thunderchild's Reserve. The Department has in the past given consideration to this matter, but the request always came from the Church of England. From the Census returns it is doubtful whether there is a sufficient number of children of school age belonging to that denomination to justify the expenditure.\n\nBefore going further into the matter I would ask you to take a special Census of the children of school age, and give the Department a tabulated report showing the names of the families and the number of children in each, with their ages. I should also like to know whether you have in view a suitable site, and if so, you might show in this tabular statement the approximate distance the children reside from the school.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nTo establish a day school will involve quite a large expenditure, and before doing so the Department must feel satisfied that it would be justified in making it. Kindly give this matter your early attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nthe school, the Department to pay the salary. This has been already done by the Department at Poundmaker's and at Moosomin's.\n\n3. I would ask the Department to supply, authorise us to purchase, some webs of material for the Day School. This has also been done elsewhere. Many of the children are so poorly clad that they could not attend school during the winter. All these things are asked for by the Indians, I only voice their desires, and I would urge them on the Department as strongly as possible. For some reason or other, Thunderchild's Reserve has received scant assistance ever since they moved to their present location. I should be glad, if you could have this matter dealt with by the Department promptly and generously.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nThe Diocese of Saskatchewan\n\nREV. JAMES TAYLOR\nSECRETARY-TREASURER\n\nSYNOD OFFICE,\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.,\nFeb. 11th 1915.\n\nThe Dup. Sup. Gen.,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI do not think that I brought the following matter under your notice. If this is a repetition, pardon me, I am anxious to have the matter considered.\n\nI make the following requests on behalf of the Indians on Thunderchild's Reserve.\n\n1. The erecting and equipping of an Improved Day School on Thunderchild's Reserve, Battleford Agency. I brought this matter under your notice a year or more ago. In reply, particulars were asked for and were duly sent; but nothing further has been done in the matter. You can find these particulars among the correspondence on your file. There are now 28 children of school age on that reserve; nearly all belong to us. It is now about five years since these Indians were moved to their present Reserve. All that time they have been without school. They very much need and desire a school. The houses are so situated that a central point can be chosen within easy reach of all.\n\n2. I desire to have a Field Matron on that Reserve in connection with\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of the Bishop of Saskatchewan for the establishment of an improved day school on Thunderchild's Reserve I beg to say that the question of providing a day school for the Indians of this reserve has been before the Department since May, 1911, and the reasons given for not granting a school there are that the Indians are so scattered that the children would have to be conveyed to school and that, out of a population of 119, 50 Indians are returned as belonging to the Church of England, 59 as Roman Catholics and 10 as pagans. The applications have always been made on behalf of the Church of England, as the Roman Catholics have a boarding school on the reserve.\n\nThe number of children of school age by the last census is given as 19, while the Bishop claims that there are 28 children of who should attend school and that nearly all of them belong to the Church of England. Mr. Agent Rowland in 1913 reported that there were 23 children of school.\nschool age and that an ideal site, centrally located, on which to erect a building, could be had.\n\nIt would be necessary to put up a school-house and teacher's residence, as there is no building available in which a school could be conducted.\n\nOn referring to the correspondence I find that the Bishop was informed in August, 1913, that if any building were available and there was a possibility of a fair attendance the Department would be prepared to assume at once the responsibility for the salary of a teacher and also to erect a school-house in due course and His Lordship was asked to call on his missionary to supply further information. This is the last letter on file.\n\nMr. Agent Rowland gives it as his opinion that a good day school on this reserve would be very useful and it seems to me that there are a sufficient number of children of school age to justify a school being maintained there. There is no provision in the estimates for a building or teacher's salary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 12th, 1915.\n\nMy dear Bishop Newnham -\n\nI regret very much that your letter of the 11th ultimo, in reference to a day school on the new Thunderchild's Reserve was overlooked. I find on looking into the matter that there is a wide discrepancy between the figures as furnished by you and the official agency figures. Our last Census return shows a total population of 119, of whom 50 are returned as Anglicans, 59 as Roman Catholics and 10 as Pagans. The number of children of school age, that is six to fifteen, is given as nineteen. Our figures do not show the religious affiliation of the children, but if they are anyway nearly equally divided Your Lordship would see that there is a comparatively small number to attend a Protestant school.\n\nI am anxious to do anything reasonable, and\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nand I am asking the Agent to take a special census of all the children on the Reserve and for other information, and when his report is received, I shall again communicate with Your Lordship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBattleford, Sask.\nDec. 17, 1914.\n\nMr. J. A. Rowland\nIndian Agent\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn behalf of the work of the Anglican Church in this Agency, I beg respectfully to apply for the following:\n\n1. The erecting and equipping of an \"Improved Day School\" on the Thunderbird Reserve in the Battleford Agency.\n\nI find that there are about twenty-eight children of school age on that reserve, two thirds or more of them belong to us; the people wish us to open a school there; it is now about five years since those people moved from their old to their present reserve, and during that time they have been without a school. Prior to that time we had a Day School of the old type taught there on the old reserve. For a time the locations of the people on the new reserve were uncertain, but now they have their houses built, and are so placed that a central point for the new school could be selected, which would be within comparatively easy reach of all.\nI would ask for authority to place a \"Field Matron\" on the Humdrumchild Reserve \u2014 the Department of Indian Affairs to pay the salary \u2014 as I understand, has been done in the case of some of the other reserves in this Agency.\n\n3. I would ask the Department to supply some webs of material to the \"Improved Day Schools\" in connection with (a) the Red Pheasant & Stony Reserves, and (b) the Little Pine Reserve in this Agency. In quite a number of instances the children are so poorly clad that they are unable to attend the schools during the winter weather. I have been approached on this subject frequently, and it should have immediate attention.\n\nTrusting that all these matters will receive prompt and favourable consideration.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nE. Killatterson\nMarch 5th 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith an application made by Canon Matheson who is in charge of the Church of England missionaries in this agency, to have an Improved Day School inaugurated on the Thunderchild Reserve. I have delayed sending this requisition in order that I might thoroughly look into the matter. I took a census of the children of school age and I found that there were 17 boys and 11 girls. Of these there are 7 of the Catholic Church and 21 of the Church of England. I think that the Department should lose no time in giving this reserve a school, when they have this number of children of school age growing up in ignorance. The older Indians of this reserve are all eager to have a school started for the benefit of their children.\n\nRe. Field Matron,- I think that this reserve is more in need of a Field Matron than any other reserve in this agency. I would consider it money well spent if a good matron were appointed. It would be a great assistance to the Doctor, as the medicines prescribed would be properly administered instead of being cast aside, for the dope administered by the Indian Doctors, of whom there are quite a number on this reserve.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 623-1, part 1)\nThe third requisition made by Canon Matheson has already been attended to. The children of Littlepine schools have been clothed from material supplied from our warehouse.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D.

The winter will soon pass and the usefulness of sleighs be done. It will be impossible to transport our saw mill etc during the summer on account of the bad muskego\u2014it can only be done in winter.\n\nMr. George Way when Indian Agent informed me that there was a section of land coming to us and that we could take this amount adjoining our reserve. We have not done so yet. Could you give me a proper understanding concerning this land.\n\nWe were promised, in the solemn treaty made with us by Her Majesty the late Queen Victoria, as follows: \"We shall maintain a school.\" It is about six years since we left the reserve we surrendered. Our children have not yet had the advantage of a school; this is seriously against their future welfare. I have from time to time...\nasked the Inspector and Agent to ask the Department to give us a school, but apparently nothing has been done. My people want a school and have asked me to apply for the same. I would therefore humbly beg that you give us a school as soon as possible! Our children should have an opportunity to have an education why should our children be denied the inestimable privilege given the children of white settlers around us. We are true and loyal subjects of His Majesty King George. We want a school like those on Red Pheasants and Little Pines reserves in this Agency.\n\nHoping you will give all these matters your consideration and attention. I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChief Thunderchild\n\nPer [signature]\nOttawa, February 22nd, 1916.\n\nDear Chief -\n\nI have your communication of the 15th instant, in which you ask for information regarding timber limits for the Thunderchild Band and also the establishment of a school. As I stated in my letter to you of January 12th, last, we are not yet able to tell you definitely the limits of the lands that are to be obtained for you, but we will make a special effort to have the Department of the Interior, before whom the matter has been for some time, come to an early decision, when your Agent will at once be informed.\n\nAs to the school, the Department has had this under consideration, but it is doubtful if the limited appropriation at our command for the coming summer will enable us to proceed with the work. We are, however, at present obtaining information to enable us to prepare a plan for a suitable building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He stated that he and the late Inspector, Mr. Chisholm, were to look into the matter and report; this apparently has not been done.\n\nI should be glad if you would take the matter up with Mr. Rowland and have him refer to his correspondence; at the same time the Department cannot make any definite statement that it intends to proceed with the erection of a building this year, as such action may be prevented owing to our limited appropriation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

This shows that there are 26 children of school age and they all live within a radius of two miles of the site selected by Mr. Crombie. He states that the band is enthusiastic about having a school and that there is no doubt the attendance will be good. There would be no need to provide transport at this school and Mr. Crombie recommends that it should be distinctly understood by the band that no allowance would be made by the Department for this purpose.\n\nIt.\nIt is for the Department to say whether it will put up a building on this reserve or not.\n\nMartin Bessette\nDecember 4th, 1916.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Dr. Roche -\n\nIn the year 1905 the Thunderchild and Mocomin Indians surrendered for sale their reserves near Battleford, and in the year 1909 moved to new reserves which had been allotted to them some 50 miles or so farther north. The majority of the Thunderchild band is Protestant, there being 75 Anglicans, 35 Roman Catholics and 4 Indians of other beliefs, and the majority of the Mocomin Band Roman Catholics.\n\nSince the removal of these two bands the Department in 1912 engaged a teacher for the Mocomin band as well as a field matron, the school being conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in a building owned by the mission for which the Department pays a rental. No provision, however, was made for the Thunderchild band, but up to the 31st May, 1914, the Battleford Industrial School was available.\nfor Anglican children and the Thunderchild Roman Catholic boarding school, near the old reserve, is still available for the Roman Catholic children of the band.\n\nThe Indians have been pressing for a day school and in view of the closing of the Battleford school it may be said reasonably so.\n\nWe have delayed taking action, however, as their locations on the reserve were very much scattered and the success of a day school was problematical. We have reports, now, which would show that the Indians are so situated that the children could reasonably be expected to attend regularly. They are anxious for a day school; this would entail an expenditure for a suitable building, etc., of about $6,000.00, which would have to be provided for by Parliament, as payments from their land sales have been coming in very slowly.\n\nIf we find that our funds will permit I would recommend that an improved day school be established on this reserve, the buildings to be erected next summer. We have plans which would be appropriate.\nAs soon as possible we should provide a building on the Neomin Reserve, as the rental we are paying is good interest on the capital expenditure necessary to erect a building which would be much more suitable than the one at present in use.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIn the year 1908 the Thunderchild and Moosomin Indians surrendered for sale their reserves near Battleford, and in the year 1909 moved to new reserves which had been allotted to them some 50 miles or so farther north.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nSir:\n\nI was appointed to the position of field station on this reserve last October, since coming here the Indians have asked me so often to teach their children, I put off doing so hoping the Department would see their way clear to giving a good day school for this reserve, but on learning from our Indian agent that no school would be granted at present, I decided to teach them in the meantime.\n\nBefore doing so however I spoke to Inspector Crombie about the matter. He approved of the step, & said, that perhaps something might be done about getting us a teacher, tutor etc., for which I would be very thankful.\n\nI began school on the 19th of Nov. I teach from as early as 6.15 A.M. to 12 O'Clock, giving them \"Physical Exercise,\" & a little lunch in the middle of the morning, also dressing any sore cuts etc. They may have during this recess.\n\nIn making our March report to the Department I mentioned that I was teaching in the mornings & visiting during the afternoons.\n\nNeglecting to add, that when necessary for me to see the sick in the morning, I left my companion Miss Beatty to teach school.\n\nIn answer to my report I have been requested by the Department not to devote anymore time to teaching, but to attend to my duties as field station.\n\nNow I trust you will pardon me for taking the liberty of writing you to explain that I do not let the teaching in the slightest degree affect my work as field station, adversely, and to ask to be allowed to continue teaching until the...\nDepartment can take it up, which I hope and pray will not be long.\n\nI am interested in the Indians, and when sick I go to them night or day and do my best to help them. Last month I made over 100 visits to their homes, besides various other duties, that I am expected to do such as knitting classes, cutting garments, which I teach at my own home.\n\nThis Thunderchild band had a day school on their old reserve and most of the middle aged men talk a little English & I feel so sorry to see their children growing up in ignorance, so do the parents, hence their reason for urging me to begin a school, adding that you would take it up soon because you had promised.\n\nI have worked in the Indian schools and as missionary in Saskatchewan for over 22 years. Have often heard the late Rev. J.B. Matheson speak of you & feel sure you will decide & arrange this matter for the good of the Indians.\n\nPending your answer Miss Beatty my companion and housekeeper is doing the teaching as she has done in the past whenever required.\n\nThanking you in anticipation.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSincerely & Faithfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.E. Brown\nOttawa, May 16, 1917.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mrs. Brown, field matron on the Thunderchild Reserve, for the recognition of a day school there I beg to say that, previous to the surrender by the Thunderchild and Moosomin Indians of their reserves near Battleford for sale, a day school was carried on on the Thunderchild Reserve, which was closed for want of attendance. This was in 1909. Since the Thunderchild Band removed to the new reserve they have had no day school, although one has been established for the Moosomin Band.\n\nThe census return for the year ending March 31, 1917, shows there are 123 Indians in the Thunderchild Band, 75 of whom are Anglicans, 45 Roman Catholics and 3 pagans, with 29 children of school age, the majority of whom are presumably Anglicans.\n\nThe question of establishing an improved day school on this reserve has been before the Department since 1911 and the last action taken was when Mr. Inspector Crombie...\nCrombie was asked to select a site which he considered would be best suited for a school. He made a selection and the question of the establishment of a school there was submitted to the Hon. Dr. Roche on December 4th, 1916, who stated that he considered it better not to engage in any further building of schools until after the war.\n\nI might mention that Mr. Crombie, in his report, stated that the band were enthusiastic about having a school and that no doubt the attendance would be good and that there would be no need to provide transport.\n\nMr. Rowland, who is Agent for this band, reports on Mrs. Brown's work as follows:\n\n\"I also note that she has opened a day school on the reserve. This is the first intimation that I have had that she had taken up this work. I consider that the whole of her time should be spent on field matron work. If this school is allowed to continue, it will be followed by a requisition for rations for a noon meal, an increase in salary and an application for a new building as the present one is not suitable. I consider that she should be asked to discontinue this. It is on her own initiative that she started the school, as I asked Canon Matheson, who is in charge of the Anglican missions here, if he was aware of it and he informed me that he was not. There is sufficient...\"\nsufficient work to occupy the whole of Mrs. Brown's time without her taking up her time with a school.\"\n\nMrs. Brown was informed as follows: \"The Department observes that you state you opened a day school on the 19th March, in doing so you acted without authority and undertook what was not delegated to you. It is considered that there is ample scope for your energies in caring for the sick and in training the women and girls in their homes, and it is desired that you will continue your duties along these lines instead of devoting any further time to teaching school. If the Department requires your services at any time in that capacity, you will be informed to that effect.\"\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that both the Roman Catholic and Anglican bishops have applied for a school on this reserve to be conducted under their auspices.

Bishop Newnham, setting forth the educational requirements of the Indians in his diocese. Original on 17090/1.\n\nPrevious applications have been made for the establishment of a day school on the new Thunderchild's Reserve, which have, however, not been entertained, first, on account of the expense and lack of funds, and secondly for the reason that the band is divided as to religious belief, there being about seventy-five Anglicans, forty-five Roman Catholics and a few pagans. There are about twenty-five children of school age. The Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops have both applied for a school there to be conducted under their auspices and, as there would not be enough children to justify the Department in establishing two schools, it is a question whether either church would consent to an undenominational school. The solution of the difficulty would apparently be to have the children placed in a residential school under the auspices of the church to which they belong.\nSaskatchewan Conference\nof Seventh Day Adventists\n\nRoom 41-48\nWilloughby Block\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan\n\nMay 21, 1918\n\nMr. Macdonald\nAgent for the Indians\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince our interview I have thought best to act on your advice at once and not wait till after your council with the Indians, as I am to be away for some time and the matter would be delayed.\n\nAs I suggested to you we would like permission to conduct a day-school for the Indians on the Thunderchild Reservation and ask you to put the matter through the department for us.

There is no doubt that a school is most urgently needed there and the Indians would take almost any means to get one. This Reserve is about half each Roman Catholic and Anglican and I am afraid that complications would be the result and they would want to observe both Saturday and Sunday as days of rest which would still further retard their work.\n\nIf there is any possibility of a school being established there I would recommend that it be done soon and the only hope of success would be an undinominational School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDept of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. J.G.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have many things to say to you. I wish I could come to Ottawa for talk, but I can not afford the time. The condition & education of the Indians has been much in my thoughts lately. I have been visiting some of the Reserves, & receiving letters from others. Pardon me if I do not put each matter on a separate sheet, but they are closely connected, & I first want to lay the whole matter before you. I know also that the I.D. prefers to have such matters taken up by the whole Church when possible; but these are more or less local, & I want to discuss them with you, & then if necessary I could lay them before the Archbishop (for approval by the Anglican Church).\n\nI feel that now that the war is over, some of these things should be taken up at once, though I know that there will be for some time great calls upon the Dominion Revenue. Still some of these matters have been before the I.D. for a long time, & there have been hopes held out of relief at an early period.\n\n1. The I.D. really ought to provide day-schools for Thunder Child's & the New Reserve (Sturgeon Lake), & allow Mrs LeClair the $200 stipend, that she may open school on Snake Plain (Mistawasis) Reserve. As for Thunder Child's, I need not repeat the pleas & arguments for this. They have been repeatedly sent to the I.D. for at least 2 or 3 years past. The children, though few perhaps, are growing up in complete ignorance. I have just been to the New Reserve. They are a good class of Indians, & part of the Montreal Lake Band. They are clamouring for a school. There are some 9 families, & about 16 children of school age, I am told. Mr. Bear who lives & farms there, & is a Councillor, is a splendid example of what Boarding Schools can do when conditions are right. He is fairly prosperous, & a good pattern to the rest, takes a keen interest in their welfare, & notes & criticises the attitude of the I.D. They are quite too far away to attend the Sturgeon Lake\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nday-school & Lac la Ronge Boarding School is already overfull. Nothing has been done for them in the way of education. They would need a school-house, equipment & a proper salary for a teacher, who should be at least fairly trained & efficient.\n\nsettled by now, but when I was there a fortnight ago, Mrs LeClair was waiting for an answer to her request for $600, & there was still no school. I respectfully think that $200 is the least you should offer. Mrs LeClair is a trained & experienced teacher, & can get $100 to $120 a month at an ordinary public school, but wishes to continue in Indian work. The Snake Plain Indians have for years had an improved Day-School, with good buildings, & have now been without any for 2 years. They ought to have a good day-school at least till they are provided with a Boarding School, of which I now write.\n\nAnother Boarding School is greatly needed in that part of the country, either on Snake Plain Reserve, or perhaps preferably on some School lands near Shellbrook. As to this, the Snake Plain Indians asked me to press for it on their Reserve. The I.D. has some nice buildings there, but not enough for a Boarding School. It is a lovely spot, & a pretty good site for a farm. This Boarding School is needed for Snake Plain, Sandy Lake & Big River Reserves, John Smith's, La Corne, Sturgeon Lake, & New Reserve & for the Battleford Reserves unless Onion Lake School is enlarged. I think it would easily obtain from 30 to 50 boarders, besides day-pupils. But many think that it is better that a Boarding School be not on a Reserve, & that near Shellbrook would be more central for this district. There should be a Boarding School somewhere for the Carlton Agency.\n\nWhile on this subject I would plead for one Industrial School for Northern Saskatchewan, where suitable elder pupils might go. The Indian boys will not all make farmers; occasionally we find them fit for College, & a profession or business, & more often for carpentry, blacksmithing, or other mechanics or tradesmen. In such cases nothing comes of their Boarding School. They drift & are useless for hunting even.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nIn an Industrial School they might be prepared for some trade or business, Normal School, or College, & the best might be helped to do really well in life, & the girls likewise for something beyond Indian housekeeping. The Indians value education more now & are asking for industrial training. Under the present method, most of the money spent by the I.D. on education is thrown away, while spending a little more would save the whole. See how well Commissioner Graham's boys are doing. Wm. Bear, the young Indian of whom I spoke above, (of New Reserve), who has been through all this failed to get Industrial training, or College, who is successful as a farmer, is very full of thought about these matters, & strongly urges me one such school for the picked pupils of both sexes.\n\nPlease think of it.\n\nThe I.D. will, to offer better salaries if it wishes better teachers. All prices & wages have risen. It is not just to continue the low rate for Indian Schools. I can not get teachers to come for that. Teachers for Germans & Austrians get $100 to $120 per month, & are ready to take that work & with all its unpleasantness. I might possibly find suitable teachers among returned soldiers if I could offer a proper salary. They must also have suitable lodging & school equipment.\n\nI have before asked, & do so now again that the I.D. provide at least a Field Matron, & possibly also a teacher, or else one who could fill both positions, for Sweet Grass Reserve. The Sweet Grass Indians are far from the nearest Reserve & get nothing done for them.\n\nNow I think I have exhausted the most pressing needs, & perhaps your patience. I could write much more, for I think the present I.D. policy is very ineffectual, not only in education, just for want of spending a little more money & going a little further. There is still room for complaint or protest as to the general style of men appointed Farm Instructors, & even Indian Agents. The Instructors are often no farmers, nor business-men, & the Agents have little care for, or sympathy with the Indians. They are just men who want to earn easy money.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nto have been appointed in his place. Schools are never inspected. I wish I could bring two or three thoughtful & experienced men with me for an evening with you, but as I can not this letter must suffice. Please do not pigeon hole it.\n\nDo not drop the matters. Use all your influence to get the Indians a fair chance to succeed in life. They have fought well for us, & have earned better treatment & the franchise. What about the promised increase in per capita Grant? What is the per Capita Grant now for Onion Lake, Lac laRonge & the Pas?\n\nI have every reason to think that each of these three schools are doing very good work, with very narrow means.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nyours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Macdonald\nBishop\nJuly 14, 1919.\n\nMy dear Bishop Newnham -\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 14th ultimo. I have read it carefully and will deal with the matters referred to separately.\n\nSome time ago I gave careful consideration to the establishment of a day school on the new Thunderchild Reserve. We have before us now applications from your own church, the Roman Catholic and the Seventh Day Adventists for the establishment of a school. I propose, however, to take the matter up again with the Indians to get the latest data regarding conditions on this reserve. At one time it was found that the Indians were so much scattered that the success of a day school was almost impossible. I wish to assure Your Lordship that I will give this matter sympathetic consideration.\n\nThe Mistawasis Day School is to be reopened on September 2nd in accordance with arrangements that have been completed and Mrs. Leclair will be paid the salary that she has asked, namely, $600.00.\n\nWe are increasing the salaries of our teachers in many instances. The need of better salaries to induce more efficient teachers to take up Indian work has been apparent, but where we pay a fair salary we insist upon the appointment of only qualified teachers. We will be prepared to consider each case on its merits.\n\nWith regard to the field matron on the Sweet Grass Reserve, I would state for Your Lordship's information that the whole question of field matrons is at present being given careful consideration by our Commissioner, Mr. Graham. Much of our field matrons' work has been very disappointing. However, I shall write to him regarding the Sweet Grass Reserve.\n\nIt has been decided for this fiscal year to increase the per capita grant to all schools by $10.00. The grant to the Onion Lake, Lac La Ronge and the Pas Boarding Schools will, therefore, be $120.00, to take from April 1st, last.\n\nI note your remarks with regard to the lack of inspection of the schools. I may say for Your Lordship's information that this is a matter to which I have given personal consideration, and I have at the present time ready for submission to the Minister a scheme for giving more efficient supervision to the work of our Indian schools in the western provinces. I am not able, however, to say anything further pending consideration by the Minister.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nI regret that it is not possible to consider the extension of our boarding or industrial school system in northern Saskatchewan at the present time, as the funds at our disposal are very limited and very little can be done in the way of building. There are several existing schools where rebuilding or extensive repairs must be undertaken before any new work can be given consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 23, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in regard to the establishment of a day school on the new Thunderchild Reserve I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, in which he asks that the Department provide a day school for this reserve. He states that they are a good class of Indians on this reserve, that they are clamouring for a school and that there are some nine families and about fifteen children of school age.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to furnish the Department with a full report in regard to the establishment of a school on this reserve. Kindly state the number of families living on the reserve, the religion of the different families, the number of children of school age in each family, whether the Indians live close together and also any other information that you think might be of assistance to the Department in dealing with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nIn reply to your letter 386,590/1 regarding the establishment of a Day School on Thunderchild Reserve, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThere are 21 families on this reserve, of which 13 are Protestant and 8 Roman Catholic, comprising 20 and 12 children respectively of school age.\n\nIt is quite true that the Indians of this reserve are anxious to have a school established there, and I think it advisable that their wishes in the matter should be met.\n\nIt is possible to place a school in a location that will be easily reached by every family, and not one of them will be more than a mile-and-a-half distant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 4th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nIn the year 1908 the Thunderchild and Moosomin Indians surrendered for sale their reserves near Battleford, and in the following year were moved to their new reserves fifty miles or so north. Since the removal of these two bands the Department in 1912 engaged a teacher and field matron for the Moosomin band, the school being conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in a building owned by the mission for which the rental is paid by the Department. No provision, however, was made for the Thunderchild bands. At the time of their removal the Battleford Industrial School was available for Protestant children.\n\nFrom time to time the Indians have been pressing for a day school and just recently Mr. McDonald brought the matter up again reporting that they were very anxious for the establishment of a school, and that it would be possible to locate a building that would be within easy reach of every family. I may add that there are 21 families on the reserve; 13 Protestant and 8 Roman Catholic, with 20 Protestant children of school age and 12 Roman Catholic.\n\nThe proposal was to erect a school which would be conducted under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nI feel myself that we are in duty bound to provide educational facilities especially for the Protestant children who have no boarding school available.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner, Regina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nThe few Roman Catholic children might be looked after in the Thunderchild Boarding School. Provision will of course have to be made in our estimates for this building and I would like to have your views in the matter after you have had an opportunity of making enquiry before I submit the question to the Minister.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant in regard to the matter of school arrangements for the Protestant children of Thunderchild Reserve, and note that you have recently received a communication from Mr. Macdonald reporting that the Indians are pressing for the establishment of a day school. Day schools for Indians are not a success, and I can call to your mind off-hand four Reserves where such schools have been closed and good buildings left idle, viz:- at Big River and Snake Plains in the Carlton Agency, and at James Smith and John Smith in the Duck Lake Agency. On one of these at least, Snake Plains, the need is more pressing than on Thunderchild.\n\nI agree that educational facilities ought to be arranged for, but it seems to me that this can be satisfactorily provided only by the establishment of a boarding school which would serve the requirements of the Agencies in the Northern part of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\nOctober 14, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 19th ultimo, in further reference to the school accommodation on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nI agree with you that the boarding school is the better system, but in the meantime we must consider our obligations to these Indians. I find that all the Protestant boarding schools are filled at present to their capacity. Consequently there is no possibility of admitting these children to any of them; furthermore it is impossible for me to anticipate when we will get funds to enable us to carry out your suggestion of a boarding school for the Protestant Indians of northern Saskatchewan. Having these facts in view I am anxious as to what could be done in the meantime. Might it not be advisable to erect a cheap building that would serve the purpose temporarily. I do not know whether timber is available; if it is we might put up a log building with accommodation for a teacher. I shall be very glad if you will consider the matter further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter No. 386590-1 of the 14th instant with reference to school accommodation on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nI am glad you agree with me that the boarding school system is the better, but note you consider we must meet our obligations to these Indians with some substitute in the meantime. I hesitate to recommend the building even of a temporary day school and teacher's quarters, as I am quite satisfied that we will not get results. I am firmly of the belief that a fairly good sized boarding school, situated in South Battleford would be a success, if put under proper management, and not only would this school accommodate Thunderchilds, but the Protestant children from the different reserves in the Battleford Agency and also any stragglers that we might want to send from other Agencies adjoining. In fact the school should be more or less on the lines of an Industrial School, as to my mind this is the only system. It is now late in the year and nothing much could be done even if we had the material on the ground. The matter therefore will have to stand over until Spring.\n\nI hope to have an opportunity of seeing you before very long and we will then discuss these matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.C.

I shall repeat some points discussed and dropped as impossible at present, because I want to have them on your file, as a reminder of what is desired and what I fully believe is due to your Indian work.\n\nPlease let the I.D. remember that I have been for 3 or 4 years begging for a Day School for Thunderchild's Reserve, and a school or a field-matron for Sweet Grass. These ought to be supplied or the children otherwise provided for.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A.

All my companions are gone. I am now old, my hair is grey and I have not long to live. I may ask you for advice etc. on minor matters yet, but I want to make one request of you, which you may find not easy to comply with, but one which I hope you will consider well as it well as a matter upon which I meditate on night and day. I see my grandchildren about me, unable to speak a word of English and I will leave this world with sorrow in my heart if I am unable to leave them something which will do so much towards arming them for the struggle in an ever increasing white environment.\n\nI am referring to the granting of an improved school on the Reserve. I have just held a council meeting and all my people look to me powerless and old and say all is lost. They tell me to do something to get a school for them.\n\nIn the treaty I was promised a school within my Reserve, and although I realize the difficulties involved in having our homes up at the lake, some twenty miles away in the first part of the winter, yet the difficulty is not insurmountable. We give you are willing to go far towards meeting you in overcoming any difficulty. We desire a school greatly.\n\nI ask you not to dismiss the matter after the Indian Agent has pointed out the obstacle, for it is his duty to do so. I understand that, but discuss ways and means with us and we will do whatever we can to so arrange things that a school would be not a useless expense.\n\nWe now understand what education means, but too late and we see the Boarding Schools are unable to provide, only for a small fraction of the total number of children in these Reserves.\n\nAgain Chief Thunderchild thanking you again sincerely for a reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChief Thunderchild\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\nJune 20th, 1923.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, relative to the establishment of a day school for the Indian children on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nIt is the Department's experience that day schools are but partly successful, and we are making real efforts to provide residential school facilities for the youth of our wards whenever possible. I have not urged Parliament to provide funds for a day school on your Reserve because I was hopeful that the Roman Catholic children would be recruited for the Thunderchild Boarding School, and that accommodation would be found in a new residential school under Church of England auspices in central Saskatchewan. I can assure you that, if we are not successful in securing funds next year for this proposed residential school, I will not overlook the advisability of erecting and conducting a day school on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nChief Thunderchild,\nThunderchild Reserve,\nMervin P.O., Sask.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nRegarding your favor in reply to my letter dealing with a Day School in my Reserve I and my Indians desire to express our appreciation at the kindly way you replied.\n\nI am not in any way trying to show disrespect to our agent, Mr McDonald, or not asking him to write for me. I wrote directly to you because I know that, from because of his knowledge of the day school of the past, he would not be able, in justice to himself, to recommend a school of this character.\n\nYour letter led me to understand that you would do what you can to give us a school to be situated inside the Reserve if, by next summer (1924) funds were not forthcoming to build a Boarding School somewhere in central Saskatchewan.\n\nI am very loth to try to disturb the line of your general policy regarding the education of our young in Western Canada but exceptions are sometimes in order, when conditions justify.\n\nI asked you in my last letter to make such an exception for me, partly because I am the last of the old chiefs who took part in the first treaty. To me then personally was promised a school on my Reserve if I and my people desired it. So we therefore an exception made would be more justifiable than to other chiefs who belong to a later period and who are therefore not so closely connected with the original agreement. To give to my grand children at least one heritage which will be of real and lasting value to them is my one remaining and all-consuming ambition. If I can do this, then I can leave the world in peace. Otherwise I will feel as if my life had been a failure.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo a man, any can and R.C., my people find it very hard to part with their children to have them go to school. It is not that they do not desire to have them educated but they are not favorable to Boarding Schools and I must give you their reasons for this so that you may not think that it is due to some idle fancy. I am not going to touch on the side of sentiment, that part of it you will readily understand knowing the Indian as you do.\n\nA spruce tree taken while young from a low lying moist soil when transplanted to light soil dies in most cases. If it lives, it will be but short and stunted whereas it would have been tall and straight had it been left in its natural soil. It will be like this despite the greatest of care. It is not because it has no capacity for growth, it is because it is taken out of its natural environment where it would have done well. I have no education but my hands are grey. I have seen and observed life, I have learnt the ways of nature and I see that the Boarding Schools and their effect on our young can be explained by this parable. The system is not natural, it seems artificial and the fruit of it so far as I see it on my Reserve and elsewhere has been very poor. Many a pupil has come home to die being in the last stages of consumption. The strict discipline, the change of environment, the close confinement, the different food, has lessened the vitality of our young and made them susceptible to the germs of tuberculosis which the buildings are always in times saturated with which the Boarding School that was in Battleford I learnt this from the Boarding School that was in Battleford when it was taken over by the Seventh Day Adventists they were obliged to pull down almost the whole building because in order to insure against infection from the germs that had played havoc among the Indian children. From the Indians' point of view that school although in very capable and kind worthy hands, was a long history of sorrow because of the disease and death. Then we found that the continual supervision on Sunday work meant the killing of all initiative in the pupils. They came back with good records, knowing English well and other things taught them but they were neither white men nor Indians. They do not seem to know how to make the start. They had lost the ordinary Indian mode of livelihood and were unable to do so the white man did. They were victims of their educational opportunity.\nThe sense of ownership and the desire to increase what is owned is a thing that should be developed in childhood stage; all this is lost to the child in the Boarding School while there he works at cows' houses, cleans rooms, flows, and helps in housework but he gets nothing in return. I myself know he actually is working for himself, but he does not see it that way. He has no chance therefore to couple work with its reward. This teaches him to look upon work as a drudgery and in many cases this idea persists through life.\n\nThere are other reasons I cannot give out these are enough to show that we take the stand we do not unadvisedly but intelligently enough.\n\nAs regards day schools - they give us a chance to have the children in our care which is natural.\n\nSecondly, with the improvement in the kind of teachers you give, they will all learn to read, write and figure. Besides they will be taught neatness, cleanliness, and such things - object lessons not only to themselves but also to their parents. With this teaching, they will be as well equipped, all things considered, as the ordinary son of an ordinary homesteader. Besides learning these they will be absorbing from their parents the way of making around for a living which is better than nothing even in the most unfavorable case. This will enable the child to begin life at a plane one or two stages higher than their fathers did.\n\nSecondly, the boy will own a cow or a horse while in childhood. He will learn to till an interest in it and will work for it. This will develop a sense of ownership in him and that means a great deal.\n\nThirdly, he will be growing up and developing in his own natural element, the process being modified by what influence is exerted on him by the school.\n\nFourthly - we do not expect the Boarding Schools to half cover the ground. Only a percentage of the children will be accommodated.\n\nI have made inquiries of the school at Little Pines under Archdeacon MacKay. Up to now that school is a wonderful success. In the first time the Improved Day School has been given a fair chance. Such kind of Indians as we are - off a few years ago they were so aptitude about the school that it had to...\nNow they are working hard in hand with the teacher because they see results and because they have been made to feel that the school is theirs and that they can close it automatically themselves by not keeping up the attendance. Such a school I desire for most earnestly and so does every member of my band.\n\nWe are in a new Reserve after selling our old one. It has meant starting over again and the start has not been too good. I see, as one of the assets needed, a school, so that something may be done to help the next generation.\n\nI called a meeting tonight, most of the band were here. A few unable to attend had told me their feelings on the matter discussed before leaving. We have all learned a lesson after losing our school. We see its value now. We know there are difficulties in the way, in the attendance we have our winter quarters at Little Lake when we want our cattle. I pointed out all the difficulties to them\u2014told them not to promise what they cannot perform. We all desired for a school at all costs. We counted the children of school age and there are 36. We thought 25 would be a fair average to aim at. We are willing almost to a man to go back to what we used to do when we had more cattle to make hay and then instead of all migrating to winter quarters send the young men with one or two older men to oversee them, to the lake to attend to the cattle. We are willing to meet half-way any arrangement that may be made by you and your officials.\n\nOne man suggested a room or two to accommodate a child whose parents have to go away and have no place to leave him. That is a detail. What we want is the school. Judge us not in this from the past fate of our school at the old Reserve or from other schools but believe when I say that a new spirit has been born in most Indians with regard to education.\n\nThis is no new to a prayer, as anything can be said from man to man. I ask in all good faith.\n\nWith my respects,\n\nYours respectfully,\nChief Thunderchild\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your splendid appeal on behalf of the children of the band has convinced me that the parents on the reserve are seized with the importance of education, and I should be pleased if you would bring this matter to my attention again, in the early summer of next year, when a definite decision will be timely.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The Star of Saskatchewan has been filled for a month past with advertisements for teachers and not a single advertisement offering. We shall be able to get them after these present Normals are closed.\n\nWith regard to Thunderchild's I had a Teacher promised for that but after I told her there were some rations if living with the Matron, it was found there were none as the Indian agent said the Department only found them for Improved Day schools.\n\nThis matter of fish for one and fowl for another makes it very difficult to deal with teachers.\n\nThe Matron at Thunderchild's is quite willing to take the teacher to board with her, especially if some ration is allowed for both Matron and Teacher.\n\nCannot that be done, so that we can get a Teacher to go to this place. We shall have the building ready before very long now.\n\nWith kind regards\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeorge Exton Lloyd,\nBp.\nOttawa, Feb. 22, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the employment of a teacher for the Thunderchild Indian Day School. I have noted with regret that you have had difficulty securing teachers for Indian schools.\n\nThe Department supplies rations for pupils at Indian day schools when a hot lunch at noon is necessary and I regret that it will not be possible to authorize rations for a teacher at Thunderchild. Perhaps some other arrangements can be made if the teacher is to live with the field matron. You might inform me what salary you had proposed to recommend. Further, if the teacher you had in mind is still available, you might mention her qualifications.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I have noted that the Church and the Indian Band are erecting a building for school purposes. I have to inform you in reply that the Department promised His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan classroom equipment and teacher's salary, if he could arrange with the Band for a suitable building. Your letter was the first intimation that the Department has had concerning the effort of the Indians themselves.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $250 is being directed to you, under separate cover, and you should use it for the purpose of securing materials for the new building. Competitive prices should be secured and, when you are submitting the vouchers in favour of the firms given the business, please support them with an Abstract of Tender form showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Band, by resolution, voted the sum of $250 from their Interest Funds to assist in the purchase of lumber and material required to finish the building. The Indians themselves took out the logs and performed the labour. The building has recently been completed and Mr. Agent Macdonald has been authorized to arrange for the purchase of the desks and other equipment required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

MACDONALD'S LETTER,\nDATED MAY 21st, 1924.\n\nThe new Thunderchild Day School was opened on the 15th, and the same day the teacher Miss Amy D. Wrigley wrote me a description of the opening and I am enclosing her letter for the Department's information. Since the date of her letter considerable more school equipment has been supplied and the desks should be along in a few days, so that she will be able to carry on the school in the regular manner.\n\nI was at Thunderchild on the 13th and instructed her to open the school even without equipment, if only for a half day each time till the supplies were received. This was to get the children used to the idea and routine as none of them had ever been to school before.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that the teachers who were appointed have taken up duties at both the Red Pheasant and Thunderchild Indian Day Schools, and enclosing a communication from Miss Wrigley regarding the opening of the latter school. In reply I beg to say it is noted that the teachers are interested and that you consider they will make a success of their work.\n\nRegarding the equipment for the Thunderchild Day School, it is hoped that you will be able to place the order for the desks as instructed in our letters of the 5th and 10th instant, and also purchase the stove and other material required. It is also hoped that the blackboards which have been ordered through the Government Stationery Office will arrive in the very near future, and that Miss Wrigley will be able to carry on without undue inconvenience until such time as all the classroom equipment is installed. Her letter describing the opening of the school was read with interest, and we are pleased with the good attendance and interest taken by the parents.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be a steady attendance of all the Indian children of school age who are eligible to attend at both these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nTHUNDERCHILD'S DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school was just opened this year. It is a log building size 28'x15' and has a chancel 14'x18' attached. It is used for church purposes on Sundays. The building is situated in a central position on the Thunderchild reserve.\n\nMiss Amy D. Wrigley, who holds a Second Class Professional Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, has been in charge as teacher since the school was opened. There are 36 pupils enrolled and the average attendance for the Quarter ending Sept. 30th was 26.67. This I consider a very good attendance in view of the fact that quite a number of the Indians of the Thunderchild Band earn their living by hunting and trapping and working out for white settlers, which occupations naturally take them away from their reserve a great deal. They have 30 single desks in the school and if the total enrollment were to attend they would not have sufficient desks to accommodate them. The teacher asked that she might be provided with at least six more. I noted that they had three wash basins and that the pupils were all provided with toothbrushes. The teacher informed me that they were made to clean their teeth regularly each day. They have a Hyloplate blackboard 3'x12'. This does not give as much blackboard space as is desirable and I think that if another board the same size was installed it would be sufficient for the requirements.\n\nWith reference to the building; as I have said before it is built of logs and has a shingled roof. It is plastered with mud and should be whitewashed before the winter sets in as I noted the plaster had shrunk and in places there was daylight showing through the walls. It should also be ceiled with lumber, as I am afraid that during the winter months unless this is done it will be hard to heat.// There is no midday meal served at this school, the children being given the regulation issue of hardtack biscuits. I found the teacher very bright and enthusiastic. She is greatly interested in her work and appears to have gained the confidence of the Indians who appear to be very interested in their school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe teacher informed me that she was receiving $950.00 per annum and she stated that when she applied for the position she was given to understand that although the salary was less than that earned by Second or First Class Certificated teachers, yet it was really more than the actual salary quoted on account of certain staples being allowed the teacher, but in her case this is not so as no staples are allowed her and she feels that she is receiving less salary than that received by Second Class Certificated teachers in the rural districts. This is a matter which I did not discuss with her but I feel I should bring it to your attention in view of the fact that she brought the point up. There is no doubt in my mind that this teacher could easily obtain a position in a public school as far as qualifications are concerned.\n\n(Signed) W. Morrison\nInspector of Ind. Affairs\nOct 17/24\ntwo miles away, part of which entails going up and down a great hill. In winter the road is often badly drifted over, and although a strong girl, the hard work she does at school and the long walk after taxed her strength greatly.\n\nWill your Lordship take the matter up with the Department and see what they will do with reference to building this summer? The objection to Miss Wrigley and assistant living alone in an Indian Reserve is ill-founded. She is 28 years old and there is no safer place in Canada for white ladies to live in than in Thunderhills, or any other Reserve, for that matter. Any lady teacher, in any Reserve in the Diocese of Saskatchewan will, I am sure, for the truth of this statement.\n\nThe progress the children have made in the one year has been wonderful, same as at Little Pines School. They deserve encouragement.\n\nI am enclosing a snap taken the other day. These children are the ones who were rolling all over the floor and having little fights the first day the school was opened.\n\nHoping that your lordship will think it right to take this matter up with the Indian Department,\n\nI am\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\nEdward Ahenakew\nThe Rt. Rev. Bishop Lloyd D.D.\nas at Bishopsthorpe\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nMy Lord:\n\nIt is now one year since the Thunderchild's Reserve Day School was opened, with Miss Wrigley as teacher. The Indian Department, at the time promised the teacher's salary and school equipment, providing we found a school building. The Indians of the Reserve who, up to then were always on the move from place to place, began to work in the depth of winter and before the snow was gone had the present large school-church finished, so keen were they to have their children educated. They have up to now, never slackened once in their wholehearted support of the School.\n\nThe average attendance since the School was opened on May 15th, 1924 is as follows:\n\n| Month       | Year | Average Attendance |\n|-------------|------|--------------------|\n| June        | 1924 | 32.65              |\n| September   | 1924 | 26.92              |\n| December    | 1924 | 29.29              |\n| March       | 1925 | 29.71              |\n| June        | 1925 | 30.52              |\n\nNow since there are never more than 33 children of school age in the Reserve and only 32 at present, this is a wonderful record for an Indian Reserve. I am sure they have proved that they are really anxious for the education of their young. They are as enthusiastic today as they were when the School was first opened and I know that they will continue to be so. Such a showing certainly deserves encouragement and support.\n\nThis summer we had hoped the School would be classed as an Improved Day School and that we would have had a Dining Room and Kitchen, School Matron to prepare a midday Meal, a house for the Teacher and assistant etc.\n\nThis is not an unjustifiable request; we are asking for this because the nature of the work that is done justifies our asking. Far better work is being done than the accommodation at our disposal warrants. We ask for this better equipment in the way of buildings, because the activities here deserve better equipment, so as to go on improving. The Department always act liberally where they see real work being done.\n\nMiss Wrigley is a hard-working and painstaking teacher. She has room and board at Mrs. Brown's\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose you a letter which has been waiting my return from England.\n\nIt is really remarkable work that has been already accomplished on that Reserve. The photographs I cannot send you as Canon McKim is turning it into a lantern slide, but thirty children that on the first day were crawling round the floor, spitting and fighting like cats and dogs, are now clothed and in their right mind.

The combination of a certificated teacher with a wife who is able and willing to do the matron's work, and to go out there while the thermometer is ranging, as ours has been for some time, 20, 30 and 40 below zero, is not an easy thing to be done.\n\nI have a very good man, single, and un-certificated, that I may be able to send out there to carry on the school until he is ready to go into the Normal School and get his certificate in September. But at the present moment I do not see where a married teacher, and a suitable wife, is coming from. I can find them later on in the year, but not at the present time. In addition Thunderchild's Reserve has Mrs. Brown who is continuing her work for the time being until a married teacher can be appointed.\n\nIf you are satisfied to have a single man or a single woman for the time being, I can get them.\n\nWith kind regards\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJ.D.

Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to obtaining the services of a teacher for the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted the difficulty in obtaining a qualified teacher with a wife who would be able to perform the matron's work. In order that this school may not remain closed longer than necessary, it will be satisfactory, for the balance of the present school year, if you obtain the services of the man referred to in your letter, or it might be possible to obtain a qualified teacher, male or female. Please inform the Department of the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whose services you obtain. The Department would allow salary to a qualified teacher at the rate of $100 per teaching month, but if the teacher secured has no professional qualifications, we would have to make a reduction in the remuneration allowed. It will not be necessary to take any action in obtaining the services of a matron for the balance of the present school year.\n\nThe Department has noted your reference to Mrs. Brown whom you state is conducting her work for the time being until a married teacher can be appointed. We do not appear to have any record of a Mrs. Brown carrying on any work on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Deputy & Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter (105-9-1) of the 16th inst. re Thunderchild Indian Day School. We are finding it very hard to find a married teacher whose wife is sufficiently free from home duties to carry on the work up field station. I was in Saskatoon this week looking for a suitable couple, but failed to find any male teacher. Recently he advertised for a work in their Daily papers, received numerous replies from female teachers, but not one from a male teacher. We have also placed three further advertisements today. The Bishop will gladly make a nomination as soon as a suitable couple can be found.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nOttawa, February 27, 1929.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the securing of the services of a married teacher for the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were informed in official letter of the 5th instant, it will not be necessary to obtain the services of a field matron for the balance of the present school year. The services of a single teacher would be satisfactory to complete the present school year, and, as Mrs. Read (nee Wrigley), who was appointed temporarily, wishes to retire, it is hoped that you will be able to nominate a teacher who would be satisfactory to carry on the work until the school closes for the summer holidays, at the end of June, next. The question of obtaining the services of a married teacher, whose wife could carry on the work of field matron, could receive consideration and the nomination made in time for them to begin duties at the beginning of September, next, when the school reopens after the summer holidays. It is hoped that a single teacher, who will teach until the end of June, next, can be obtained at an early date to take over the work which is now carried on by Mrs. Read.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As he was a schoolmaster in England for some time, there would be no doubt as to the thoroughness of the training for the work of teaching which he received. He has been doing supply work for some time and apparently gives good satisfaction in that capacity. From what I know of him I should judge that he would be very thorough in his work and that he would be helpful in the community where he found himself. This is borne out by the time and interest given for the preparation of School (Christmas) Concerts where he has been. I do not think he would have any difficulty with discipline.\n\nBoth Mother and I are favourably impressed by Mrs. Sharmen. She is very interested in Church work, and has a kindly disposition. As Field Matron I think she would render excellent service.\n\nWith best wishes,\nI remain,\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W.

I found 13 boys and 9 girls present out of an enrolment of 26. The pupils were clean and healthy looking. I held a brief examination and they answered questions clearly and distinctly, and have a bright appearance.\n\nI found the school room bright and clean. They have very little blackboard space and an addition in this connection would be beneficial.\n\nA mid-day meal of vegetable soup and biscuits is provided. I found the dining room bright and clean.\n\nSince my last visit a new teacher has been appointed, Mr. William Sharman. His wife prepares the mid-day meal for the children. Mr. Sharman appears to me to be a well qualified teacher. He has a nice manner with the children who appear to be quite at their ease with him.

I note that he feels that the physical condition of the teacher is not conducive to the best work of the School and I notice that you ask me to consider some change in the teacher of this School at the end of the present school year, June 30th next.\n\nI visited the Reserve last month and find that the Inspector's remarks regarding the teacher's physical condition seem to be accurate. I shall be writing you further in the matter at a later date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBp/HF\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI have just been informed, that at a recent visit of the Ven Archdeacon Paul to Thunderchild reserve, that he advised the Teacher Mr W. Sharman to resign as he was too old, he was too old and also partially crippled, when the Church Authorities recommended him for the position and I have reported to the Department to this effect on two different occasions, but what I don't like is Church interference in the schools and back of this is Mrs Brown, local Missionary and late Field Matron, who wants to get a friend in there, Mrs Reid, (N\u00e9e Miss Wright) who was the best teacher we ever had there, but at the same time she is now married to a man in business and if the position was opened, someone with dependants should get it and there are many capable teachers in want at present.\n\nIt has always been the policy of the Department to give the various Churches the recommending of teachers who with few exceptions are selected for their ability as Missionaries and pay more attention to Church requirements than they do to Departmental and practically ignore the Agent and a Catholic at an Anglican day school gets small consideration and vice versa, and in many cases Denominational grievances rife on the reserves from this source.\n\nAfter all the Department are trying to educate these people and if all day schools were made non-denominational, Teachers employed for their merits and outside interference stepped, the results at most schools would be vastly different, Teachers would take their instructions, be employed or discharged from Departmental sources and would have to confine their activities to teaching school and let the Missionaries do the Missionary work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that Mr. Wm.

The Department is again communicating with His Lordship, and informing him that we would not be prepared to accept the services of a married teacher whose husband is in business and able to support her. While Mrs. Reid (nee Miss Wrigley) gave satisfactory service, the Department could not, in view of her present circumstances, approve of her reappointment.

For the information of your Department may I say that the original Diocese of Saskatchewan is now divided into two parts, the southern part of which is called the Diocese of Saskatoon and the northern part the Diocese of Saskatchewan. To the northern Diocese will pass the nominations of all the schools, with the exception of Little Pines Reserve Day School and Red Pheasant Reserve Day School. These two schools are the only schools in the Diocese of Saskatoon and regarding which your Department will communicate with the Bishop of Saskatoon which for the time being is myself.

Sharman is retiring at the end of the present term, and the Bishop of Saskatchewan has asked me to send you as his nominee for this school the name of Rev. J.L. Ball. Mr. Ball is a B.A. of Saskatchewan University and a graduate of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon. He taught the Indian Day School at Cedar Lake, Man., under your Department in 1929. Mr. Ball wishes to continue his studies and to take up educational work, and will give his full time to school work, except that he will help in the Sunday Services.

It is noted that, while he is a university graduate, he has no professional teaching qualifications. The salary the Department can allow him will be at the rate of $85 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. It is noted that he will be able to devote full time to school work. I shall be pleased if you will inform him of the approval granted for his appointment as teacher of the Thunderchild Day School and arrange that he begin duties on or about September first, next, when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nThe local Indian Agent, Mr. S.

Macdonald, dated May 1st, 1938, I hereby request the Department to retain the services of myself and Mrs. Sherman for another year\u2014hoping that by the end of that time the wave of depression will have passed away\u2014for the reasons stated below:\n\n1. My age. I am sixty seven.\n2. My health is as good as when I came here nearly four years ago. I have taught in Saskatchewan over twenty years and have not been through sickness.\n3. Archdeacon Paul informed me last January that a change of teachers was desired by the Department on account of my age and failing health and for no other reason.\n4. Both my wife and I have done our duty to the Department and to the Church faithfully, to the utmost without one cent of remuneration.\n5. Through coming here my right to benefit from the Teachers' Superannuation Act has been forfeited. See No. 6.\n6. The garden has been ploughed, harrowed and planted and improvements done to the house, school and grounds at my expense.\n7. If any complaints have been made they have originated from Mr. Brown, the Church Warden etc., who for the last two years has been trying to reinstate the former teacher, Mr. Real so that she (Mrs. Brown) can gain control of the school again. I can prove this if required to do so.\n8. At the suggestion of Archdeacon Paul I wrote Thomas Anderson and the following is an extract from his reply dated 5th May, 1938:\n   \"It has been decided that at the present time teachers in Indian schools cannot be included within the terms of the Superannuation Act but rather should be taken care of either by the Federal Department of Indian Affairs or by the Church under whose jurisdiction they may come.\"\n9. During the last twelve months Mrs. Sherman has worked very hard especially in the fall and since Christmas when the flu was prevalent here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWilliam Sherman\nOttawa, May 20, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the termination of your services as teacher of the Thunderchild C. of E. Indian Day School at the end of June, next.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Public School Inspector, who visited the school in September, last, stated that little action was taken by you in connection with his suggestions, also that your impaired hearing hindered you in the work, particularly in the matter of discipline. The Church authorities, before whom the matter was placed, have nominated the services of a teacher to succeed you as from the 1st of September, next, and his appointment has been approved. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to continue your services for the coming school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nWm.

Ogden, of Hudson Bay Junction, has applied for the position of teacher at the Thunderchild School near Turtleford, Sask., and has been informed that the selection of the teacher rests with Bishop Bird, Bishop of Saskatchewan, but has to be approved by the Department.\n\nIs this an appointment by the Church authorities? Is it a Residential or Day School, and is there a vacancy? If the appointment comes under the Department and a vacancy exists, kindly furnish full particulars.\n\nF. Clapp,\nfor Private Secretary.\nAugust 26, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 24th instant, regarding the application of Mrs. Bertha I. Ogden, Hudson Bay Junction, for the position as teacher at the Thunderchild Indian Day School, near Turtleford, Sask., I have to say that this school is conducted under the auspices of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan. The teacher retired at the end of June, last, and the church authorities nominated Rev. J. L. Ball, B. A., a graduate of Saskatchewan University, who will devote his full time to teaching duties. There is therefore no vacancy at this school to which Mrs. Ogden could be appointed. This is an Indian day school and the nomination of a teacher is in the hands of the church authorities.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nOwing to the adverse railway service to this part of the province I find that I cannot go away for the Christmas holidays unless I have an extension of time which I would repay by teaching either on Saturdays or at Easter holiday time.\n\nTo do this I would be glad to receive permission to make suitable Christmas holiday arrangements by taking any necessary extra days and adjusting them by teaching on Saturdays or at Easter.\n\nFurther there is a possibility I would be bringing back a wife & to do this I would need my October - December cheque by Dec 15th or $8 at the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI would be glad if you could assist me by taking necessary steps to assure the receipt of the cheque in due time. Should this not be possible I would esteem it a favour to be notified by return of post if convenient (or should you be phoning, let me know.)\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your kindly & courteous attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.F. Ball\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have your letters re Xmas vacation and at the present or rather it has always been a regulation that no extension of Holidays was allowed. I have locked up train days and you can get a morning train on Dec 23rd through to Saskatoon and you could get back on a train Saskatoon to St Walburg on Jan 3rd, this would be two days late but that could be overlooked and made up, though the Department do not approve of School on Saturdays or holidays.\n\nWith regard to advance pay, they will only advance for time worked, so if I write in at the end of Nov- you could get a cheque for October & November only and I will do that.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev J.L.Ball.\nTeacher.\nThunderchild.\n\nIndian agent.\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nI note your intention to get me my cheque for October & November & thank you for the extension of time for Christmas. You mention from Dec 23rd to Jan 3rd as giving me two days extra & this is not the case. I am granted this time by the Dept. according to the register not.\n\nI am going to Eastern Canada & am expected to preach on Sunday 24th & take a service Christmas day. The train by which you suggest I should leave (Dec 28th) does not get into Toronto until the morning AFTER Christmas day (26th). Further the train by which you suggest I should return on, leaves Toronto New years eve \u2014 the night before New Year's day.\n\nSince I am expected in the east for duties, & have every arrangement made, I would be glad if you would reconsider your letter of 22nd inst. & grant a more favourable leave; otherwise I have to write, cancel all arrangements & spend my Christmas in this hole, which as you know is not a pleasing place at its best.\n\nThe school will in no way suffer and you may rest assured every extra day you grant will be repaid.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYour faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have an application from Rev J.L.Ball, Teacher at the Thunderchild Day School, for an advance of wages for October and November and would recommend that he be given the advance.\n\nHe also asks for extension of leave for the Xmas Holidays and for the Departments information, I am attaching correspondence in this connection and might add, that if he took the position to teach, he should confine his activities to teaching and not preaching and was apparently recommended to act as a Missionary with the teaching as a means of revenue and does not speak in very complimentary terms of his location.\n\nHis work as teacher has apparently been satisfactory so far, but application for extended vacations before he has been on duty three months does not look good and there is always a tendency by Ordained Teachers to want liberties.\n\nI will await the Departments reply before in this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 240-104 of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the request of the teacher of the Thunderchild Day School for an extension of his Christmas holidays.\n\nWhen the Rev. Mr. Ball was appointed teacher of this school, the Department was informed that he would devote all his time to the teaching duties. As you have informed him, the Department does not approve of keeping the school open on Saturdays in order to make up for extra holidays allowed the teacher. Besides, if the school is kept closed for other than very urgent reasons, it is reasonable to suppose that the Indian children will be likely to lose interest.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, the Department is not prepared to allow Mr. Ball the extra leave which he requests. We would, however, have no objection to him taking an extra day or two.\n\nThe advance on his December quarter salary will go forward under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nRegina, Sask.\n\nOctober 2, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 27th enclosing a long letter purporting to be an application for superannuation allowance under The Teachers' Superannuation Act.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise you that section 3, which reads as follows:\n\n\"3. This Act shall apply to teachers actually employed in teaching or in the supervision of teaching on or after the coming into force of the Act in those schools receiving grants from the Province of Saskatchewan.\"\n\nwill advise you that your application cannot be considered. There was certain correspondence between Bishop Burd and the Honourable J. T. M. Anderson and the reply set out in detail that teachers in Indian Schools, being temporary federal civil servants, cannot be taken care of under The Teachers' Superannuation Act of Saskatchewan. Furthermore, their salaries being paid either by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa or by the church under whose jurisdiction the Indian School is controlled, they must look to either of these in the matter of allowances in their old age. Section 19 of The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Act definitely states that four per cent. of all salaries received must be deducted by the secretary of the school district and, in turn, shall be withheld by the Minister from the grant payable to boards of trustees of school districts. You have made no contributions to this fund. Furthermore, section 14 states that any teacher who is absent from the classroom of schools receiving grants from the Province of Saskatchewan for a period in excess of twelve consecutive months voids all claim to service rendered previously for superannuation purposes.\n\nI am, therefore, sorry to advise you that no consideration can be given in the matter of your application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nTeachers' Superannuation Commission\n\n(Signed) P.

Before the end of June, you should forward to the Department a full report regarding the work that Miss Beanland has done and state if the attendance has improved.

Mr. Macdonald, Indian Agent is not expected back till July 1st, and as the Department requested a report on this matter before the end of June, I beg to submit the following.\n\nI find the average attendance of this school for the quarter ending December 1933 is 11.92, March 1934 is 10.98, and the average from April 1st. to May 11th, is 7.16.\n\nI visited the school on June 14th, and found 5 children in attendance, being the lowest since Miss Beanland took charge on May 12th, last. Since that date 4 new pupils have been taken on, one of which is slightly under age. One pupil has returned, but is very irregular in attendance. This increases the enrollment by 5 making a total of 17 pupils, which have shown an average attendance of 10.34 from May 12th, to June 13th.\n\nI think this average might be increased a little under the present teacher who is experienced in this class of work. Prospects of increasing the total attendance in the near future is not very promising, as the residential schools seem to have the greater attraction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nS.H.

C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward herewith Provincial School Inspector D. L. Hicks' report of an inspection which he made of the Thunderchild Indian Day School on September 23rd. I received this report on October 16th last and held it as I had planned to visit the Battleford Agency before forwarding it, but to date I have not been able to arrange a visit there.\n\nThis report indicates a very unsatisfactory condition in so far as the attendance is concerned. When the school was first opened some years ago with Miss Wrigley as teacher, in my opinion, it was one of the most satisfactory day schools from a point of progress and attendance in the Province and it remained as such while Miss Wrigley was in charge as teacher. However since she left the service the school appears to have gone back and I have no doubt that this retrogression can to a large extent be attributed to the personality of the teacher. The Inspector states that the difficulty in this school is apparently lack of interest and co-operation in the homes. I plan to go to the Battleford Agency in the near future and will make a special point of taking up this question with the teacher, the Indian Agent, and the Indian parents, with a view to making an effort to improve conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR D. L. HICKS,\nDATED SEPTEMBER 23, 1935, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nTHUNDERCHILD INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on No. 105-9-6.\n\nThe pupils present made a fair showing, but as less than 50% were in attendance, it is difficult to state just how definite progress has been.\n\nThe difficulty in this school is apparently lack of interest and cooperation in the home, resulting in indifferent attendance with the consequent results in progress. I would suggest that the noon lunch be reinstated by the Department of Indian Affairs, as I believe this stimulates attendance as well as improves the health of the children who are I fear in many cases undernourished.\n\nBoth last year and this year attendance was so poor on the date of my visit that I do not feel that I am in a position to commit myself definitely with regard to the progress in the work of the school. There were no failures in the tests given to the pupils present, who numbered five. Written tests were given in language, home economics and spelling, and classes were observed as taken by the teacher in reading. The percentages taken in the tests ran from 55 to 88, and although these marks cannot be graded as high I feel that in view of the fact that the children are only attending part time the teaching must have been fairly effective.\n\nOn looking up the register I found that the attendance on this day was no exception. I do feel that this teacher could do quite good work if the pupils attended regularly, and unless something is done to stimulate regular attendance at school, I can only say that the school is not serving the purpose for which it exists.\n\nOn looking up my last year's report I find that noon lunch was being served, and that attendance was poor at that time, which points to the fact that its revival might not have the desired result. I still have the feeling, along with the teacher, that it would help to some extent, and certainly it would be very beneficial to those who are in attendance. I cannot urge too strongly on the Department the importance of furnishing some incentive which will stimulate attendance. If this cannot be done I cannot conscientiously report that the school is justifying its existence.\nOttawa, November 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 302-11 of the 12th instant, with reference to Inspector Hicks' report on his inspection of the Thunderchild Indian Day School on September 23rd. It is noted that you intend to visit this school in the near future, and, following this visit, you should report fully on the work. You should also make a definite recommendation regarding the teacher, stating whether or not you consider her services should be retained after June 30th, next.\n\nWhile the Department supplies 600 pounds of biscuits for this school, we are prepared to allow an amount of approximately $5 a month extra for midday meal purposes, if you consider such action advisable. This special allowance of $5 a month would be discontinued after March 31, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 105-9-1, dated the 18th ultimo, with reference to Inspector Hicks' report on his inspection of the Thunderchild Indian Day School, Battleford Agency, on September 23rd, I beg to report that I visited this school on the 28th ultimo and made a careful enquiry into conditions.\n\nWhile there are 12 pupils enrolled at the present time, 7 boys and 5 girls, there are only 8 children of school age on the Reserve who are physically fit to attend. The average attendance for 20 days in November was 5. On the date of my visit there were 6 in attendance, 4 girls and 2 boys. Five of the pupils appear to attend very regularly. Of the others enrolled, I found that the fault does not lie with the teacher, but rather with the parents who do not reside regularly on the Reserve and take their children with them on their trips. This is a condition for which the teacher cannot be held responsible.\n\nI was quite favorably impressed with Miss Beanland as a teacher. I believe that if she were given a chance she is capable of doing very good work. She has with her as companion a Miss Turner who is also a qualified teacher. After visiting the school and having an opportunity of talking with Miss Beanland and watching her conduct her classes, I am of the opinion that in considering this question it is not a question of dispensing with the services of the teacher but one as to whether the attendance and the prospects for attendance will justify keeping the school in operation.\n\nThere are about 39 children of school age belonging to this Band. Of these, 27 are attending residential schools, - leaving 12 -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nleaving 12 available for attendance at the Day School. Of these 12 only about 8 are physically fit to attend regularly. If the 8 who are physically fit attended regularly, that is the total attendance we could expect; and the question is whether the Department would be justified in incurring the expense of the upkeep of this school for this number of children.\n\nIn discussing the matter with the Indian Agent he appeared to agree with me that it might be in the best interest of the Indians to close this school and send the children of school age to the residential schools. I understand that the Indians for the most part are not averse to sending their children to residential schools.\n\nYou ask that I make a definite recommendation regarding the teacher. If the school is to be continued, I have no hesitation in recommending that Miss Beanland's services be continued as teacher. I found the school room and the teacher's cottage clean and tidy. The children also presented a clean appearance and they are well clothed. They are receiving a mid-day meal during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

A. Fraser, our Missionary from Sandy Lake Reserve, spent last week-end at Thunderchild, and a meeting was held on Monday Dec. 9th.\n\nAt this meeting the Chief and other Indians said they were sorry that the attendance at school was so low, and that this school year there were only ten children to attend; but that there were many younger children on the Reserve, and next year there should be fifteen children attending. He felt that the Day School had a centralising influence on the people, which kept them more at home, and without it they would spend a wandering life and accomplish nothing.\n\nI enclose herewith a petition signed at the meeting by 31 persons, and I earnestly hope that the Department will see its way to keep the school open, in the hope that next year the attendance will once more be large enough to make a good school.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nOttawa, December 18, 1935.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nNo immediate action will be taken towards the closing of this school. It is hoped that the meeting you held with the Indians will result in all children of school age attending the school regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J.

At the Thunderchild Day School, attendance has been very poor and the number of pupils attending hardly justify the expense of keeping this school open. It is now really in use for only a few children that cannot qualify for boarding school. I am inclined to think that if the attendance during the next quarter is not a great deal better, that it would be advisable to draft the few children that could qualify for boarding schools and send them there and then close the school for two or three years until some of the smaller children on the reserve become of school age, when it might again be profitable to reopen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSLM/JE\nENG.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, April 11th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, please watch the attendance at the Thunderchild Indian Day School and you might communicate with the Department again at the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

General.\n\nThe Thunderchild Day School, I regret to say, was about the worst in its history. In fact it will be noted that I put in the school returns going forward at this date, a notation to the effect that I do not think the expense of keeping this school open is further justified. The children are not available and keeping a school open for from four to seven children does not justify the expense required.\n\nS. L. Macdonald\n(Signed)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of December 12th, 1935, and official reply of December 15th, with reference to the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has just received the June quarter return. While the names of fourteen children are shown on the return, five of them were not present at any time during the quarter. The remaining nine attended for part of the term, but the average attendance for the quarter was only 5.77. With such a small attendance, the Department is hardly justified in keeping the school open. It was hoped, from the information contained in your letter of December 12th, 1935, that the average attendance during the past six months would be much higher than it has been.\n\nBefore taking definite action to close the school, it was decided to communicate with you, with a view to ascertaining if you have any further objections to offer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul, B.A., LL.B.,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\nJuly 23, 1936.\n\nBISHOP THORPE\nPRINCE ALBERT,\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nRe Thunderchild Indian Day School. 105-9-1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to your letter of July 15 unless means are taken to increase attendance at the Thunderchild Day School I must agree that the Department is not justified in keeping the school open for the small attendance. It would be much more profitable to transfer the teaching grant to the school at Chitek Lake described in the recent letter of Archdeacon Paul.\n\nThe proposed closing of this school brings into the foreground the comparison between the efficiency of Day Schools and Boarding Schools. I presume that if the school is closed the Department will assume the responsibility of educating the children in a Boarding School and as our schools are already full this will be an added reason for building a new school. As you know, the school which burned down at The Pas has not yet been replaced and there are many children who should be attending a Boarding School unless a more definite policy is pursued in regard to the Day Schools.\n\nAs you are aware, there are a number of Indian Departmental Day Schools in this Diocese where ample provision is made for the teaching of the children on the reserves, but owing to the fact that children who could attend these Day Schools have been allowed to attend Residential Schools, the attendance has fallen to a point where the closing of the school is considered, and the Department is not only burdened with the cost of maintaining the Day School but is also paying the per capita grant for children who could be and should be taught by the Day School teacher.\n\nTaking as an example the John Smith Reserve near Prince Albert. Here is a compact reserve with efficient school equipment and a first class teacher, the Rev. G. J. Waite. Yet I understand that this year nine of the children are attending the File Hills School and the per capita grant is paid for them in addition to the salary of the Day School teacher.\n\n(Over)\nI would suggest that a definite ruling be made by the Department, that where adequate Day School provision is made on any reserve, the children must attend that Day School and will not be sent to Residential Schools except in the case of orphans and other very exceptional circumstances. I do not think that even destitution justifies the taking of children from the reserve but that a grant in aid to the parents would be well spent. In case children from a reserve are sent to a Residential School there should be a strict rule that these must be sent to the school of the religious denomination of the parents. Otherwise we will inevitably have mixed denominations on the reserves and an impairment of the spiritual work amongst the Indians. This is already evident on the John Smith Reserve where some of the children returning from the File Hills School show no interest in the church of their parents and are falling away from religious influence.\n\nI believe that the Day Schools can be made a most efficient means of educating the Indians in reserves where the Indians are residential and if the Department will make plain to the Indians through the agents that they must use existing educational facilities, then I am sure this question of closing Indian Day Schools will cease and we will be able to make those schools more and more efficient.\n\nPerhaps there is already some such ruling which only needs to be brought to the attention of the Indians through the agents. I would be glad to have the considered opinion of your Department on this question.\n\nAssuring you of my cooperation, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 12, 1936.\n\nRight Rev.

Please co-operate with the teacher in an endeavour to secure as large an attendance as possible. Every effort should be made to have the children physically fit attend school regularly.\n\nThe parents residing on this reserve who are able to support their children should be required to send their children to the day school rather than to the residential school. This, of course, does not apply to children whose admission to a residential school has already been approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. L.

The attendance is very good as usual at the Little Pine Day School, and is holding up well at the Red Pheasant Day School, and will improve there as soon as the hay camps are broken up, and the Indians come back to their regular homes. I can also report an improvement in the attendance at the Thunderchild Day School, and it is hoped there will still be a few more when the Indians settle down for the winter.\n\nAll the schools in the agency were visited during the month with the exception of Beauval, and it is my intention to visit that school shortly, and will report conditions there in my next report.\n\nS. L. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to advise the Department, That the Teacher at the Thunderchild Day School, Miss K.E Beanland, Was taken sick during the Xmas Vacation and did not open her school till Monday January 18th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nThis is to certify that Miss K.

Anderson\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith, Medical Certificate, sent in by Miss K.E. Beanland, from Dr A.L.

L. Macdonald.\nIndian Agent.\nThe schools all reopened again at the first of the month, with good attendances that are well over last year's attendance and they have all been visited and everything in this respect is going in good order.\n\nThe same teachers are at Little Pine and Thunderchild Day schools, but a new teacher, Mr. Morgan has taken over the Red Pheasant school and already a big improvement is noticeable in every respect, it is his first experience at an Indian school and I believe this will be to the benefit of both the school and the Indians.\n\nS.L.

The teachers here are cooperating very closely with the farm instructor. Last week, I visited the school at Thunderchild's Reserve and found an attendance of 18, with a very happy atmosphere in the school.\nDear Sir;-\n\nThe attached photo was sent me by the teacher at Thunderchild.

For 1937-38 18.2.\n\nMiss Beaulon is a good teacher, but her usefulness stops there. The children are not even taught to prepare their meals. She claims she has tried to organize the young women of the reserve, but without success.\n\nThere is a Miss Brown, a missionary, living adjoining this reserve. This woman has worked on this reserve and it is claimed she resents anything being done on the reserve without her approval. I have tried to get Miss Beaulon to take a more active interest in the women of the reserve, but with very little success.\n\nIt is the opinion of Mr. McDonald that Miss Beaulon is afraid of Miss Brown, and he claims until Miss Brown is transferred or a more aggressive teacher placed in this school, no progress will be made along this line.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nEX'D.\n\nJune 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your report on the Battleford Agency and have noted your remarks regarding Miss Beanland, teacher of the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Beanland was nominated by Reverend Walter Burd, Bishop of Saskatchewan, Prince Albert, Sask., and on the occasion of your next visit to Prince Albert I would suggest that you call on the Bishop and discuss with him the situation existing on the Thunderchild Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Miss Cunningham at Little Pine has her school right up to standard as usual, but the day school at Thunderchild is lagging; the teacher has every qualification, but is not up to the mark and a change should be made there at the end of this year and a married couple taken on so that some welfare work can be started.\n\nS.

The Inspector reports favourably on the work that the teacher is doing but draws attention to the fact that she is handicapped due to the poor attendance.\n\nWhen forwarding the report Inspector Robertson stated that on the occasion of a recent visit to the Battleford Agency he requested you to investigate school conditions on the Thunderchild Reserve and report fully. Please let me hear from you in this regard at the earliest possible date and at the same time you should state what steps you are taking to make certain that all the children of school age on the Thunderchild Reserve attend school regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have Department letter No.105-9-1, Dec 13th, re attendance etc at the Thunderchild Day School.\n\nDuring Fall and Spring at this reserve, many of the Indians are away making a living and take their families with them as they have no means of support at their reserve, and this along with the seasonal sickness hits the attendance during the winter it is always better as can be seen by the report just sent in. All of school age on the reserve attend and we are at them all the time to see that they do go.\n\nThe Day school requirements now are not a one woman proposition, even with # one woman who is ambitious, a man teacher with a wife is necessary. The present teacher Miss Beanland, has every qualification, but is too easily dominated by Missionaries, is not in any sense a hustler and will never make a success of an Indian Day school. I have discussed this with School Inspector Mr Brennan and he knows this as well as I do. This school, is about 50-50 R.C. and Anglican and too much missionary domination just nullifies its usefulness, we have a narrow minded Female Missionary working that reserve all the time and as long as she can dominate the teacher and keep whispering Campaigns going and the R.C. Indians upset, the school cannot succeed.\n\nWe have made every effort to overcome this situation and as far as I can see, the only way is to make a change at the end of next June and get a Married couple in there, to do social work as well as the teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt from you of the Public School Inspector's report regarding his visit to the Thunderchild Indian day school on October 20 I wrote to Indian Agent Macdonald in connection with the Inspector's remarks regarding the poor attendance at this school.\n\nToday I am in receipt of his reply in which he expresses the opinion that the teacher should be changed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nPlease consult the Church authorities and request them to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nMr. Macdonald suggests the appointment of a man and his wife to take charge of this school. Our experience shows that it is extremely difficult to obtain a properly qualified married couple without family obligations, besides our present appropriation will only permit our paying the salary of one person at the Thunderchild day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 105-9-1 of January 5,\nThunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nIn 1937 I visited the Thunderchild Day School and discussed school matters with the teacher. At that time I was not satisfied with conditions and expressed my opinion to the Agent and Dr. Lewis that we should have a change in teachers there. Dr. Lewis informed me that the teacher, who is a trained nurse, had served under him in the Hospital at Saskatoon and was a very competent person. Dr. Lewis suggested that no action be taken at that time as he believed that through his influence he could get conditions rectified there, and being a trained nurse she would be of considerable assistance to him.\n\nSome time ago I again discussed this matter with both the Agent and Dr. Lewis, and the Doctor stated that he had done everything possible and it was now his opinion that a change should be made.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 10th, I went to Prince Albert and discussed school matters with Bishop Burd. Mr. Davis, our Agent at Carlton, and Mr. Simpson, our Agent at Duck Lake, were in Prince Albert on that date to discuss matters regarding conditions. I took them with me. We had a very pleasant and friendly discussion. I may say that Bishop Burd is prepared to give us 100% co-operation and he has agreed to carefully select a married couple to replace our present teacher at Thunderchild for the beginning of the next term.\n\nBishop Burd has asked that the salary at Thunderchild School be increased to $950.00 in order that he can get the teacher we want. I would recommend this be done if possible.\n\nI am also writing the school authorities at Lloydminster and Saskatoon who both strongly endorse the policy we are following to be on the lookout........\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\non the lookout for a teacher of the type we want and ask them to apply to Bishop Burd for the position.\n\nWhen discussing matters with the Bishop our Agents' meeting was mentioned. The Bishop asked if there would be any objection to his attending. I informed him that instead of objecting we would welcome his attendance. The Bishop has agreed to attend if his health will at all permit.\n\nBishop Burd is very interested in the advancement of the Indian and is not taking a denominational view. I feel that if we could secure the attendance of the leaders of the different church denominations at our discussions they would secure a much better idea of what we are trying to do and the methods we are using to attain our ends.\n\nThey would go away with a full realization of the fact that the success of the church work depends on the success of the other departments and vice versa. It would, in my opinion, make for a much better feeling and a closer co-operation with consequent improvement in all branches. I would appreciate your comment and advice on this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa, January 17, 1939.\n\nRe - Thunderchild Indian Day School -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 12th instant, in which you discuss conditions at the above noted school.\n\nI was particularly pleased to learn that you had discussed these conditions with Bishop Burd and that the Bishop is prepared to cooperate with you in an attempt to improve conditions at a number of Indian day schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Department will be prepared to pay a salary of $950.00, as you suggest, if you succeed in securing the services of a capable teacher.\n\nIt is gratifying to learn that Bishop Burd is prepared to attend the conference of Indian agents. I think you should feel perfectly free to invite representatives of the churches or lecturers from the provincial extension services to your conferences from time to time. It would be in my judgment a splendid thing if representative men became more interested in the progress and welfare of our Indian population.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nWhat has been done to teach the children:\n\n(a) How to cook meals\n\nLast year the three older girls were given a week at a time, two hours a day at my house, to prepare and cook the children's mid-day meal, and also to learn other little things about a house\u2014cleaning, and ironing, making simple puddings and cookies. After about three months, two of these girls proved to be so dishonest that I had to discontinue it. (One actually stole a ring belonging to Miss Meredith. We recovered it later from quite another source, but it was traced back to this girl.)\n\nWhen we are able to give them fresh vegetables, the girls prepare them in the school at the noon hour, the day before.\n\nThe children always help with the serving out of the meal and lay the table, etc.\n\nWhen the next group of girls come to be 11-12 years of age I shall give them some cooking experience, etc.\n\n(b) How to sew, etc.\n\nThe beginners use sewing cards at first.\n\nBoys and girls have made samples of various simple stitches\u2014basting, running, hemming, backstitch, overswing, French seams, run and fell seams, sewing on buttons, patching.\n\nThe older ones also, button holes, gathering into a band, and sewing on bias binding.\n\nThe little ones have hemmed towels and handkerchiefs.\n\nGrade 1's and all above, made samples of diamond blocks for quilting, and unbleached cotton bags with simple embroidery design.\n\nLast November they began aprons of unbleached cotton for themselves, some I hope will have a little embroidery later on.\n\n(hh) Knitting\n\nThe beginners do spool knitting.\n\nBoys and girls learn plain knitting and purling, first with two needles, and then with four.\n\nTwo girls and one boy have made children's sweaters.\n\nFive girls and two boys have made mitts.\n\nAlso some of the simpler fancy patterns have been used in making squares suitable for joining together for a bed-throw.\n\nOur present project is to dress a 19 inch doll. Two children have begun a garment each, and others will join as they complete the piece of work they have in hand;\n\nPeriods given each week, (approx. 1 hour period)\n\n|        | up to December 1938 | from January 1939 |\n|--------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Sewing | 1                   | 2                 |\n| Knitting | 2                | 3                 |\n| Art    | 1                   | 1                 |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 2)\n(c) How to look after a garden\n\nVery little has been done by me. When I enquired about arrangements being made to look after a garden during the summer holidays, Mr. Macdonald did not think it advisable to try one at all.\n\n1. The ground is not very good around the school.\n2. Our farm instructor, Mr. Cockburn, has done splendid work with regard to the gardens at the homes; most of the people have had good gardens the last two years, those who have taken most interest have been best repaid naturally.\n\nWe planted a Caragana hedge at Coronation time and the children kept it weeded last year, but I am afraid it has not done very well so far.\n\nThere are two little flower beds between the house and the school, and for two years we tried to grow lettuce and radish, (something that we could use before the end of June). Each child having their own row was the idea, but the birds ate most of it as it came up, and the ground is very poor, so we have planted a few perennials in one plot and caragana bushes in the other.\n\nFor Regina Exhibition 1936, we made collections of pressed wild flowers and weeds and leaves and named them all. With the two latter we obtained 3rd prize for each at Prince Albert.\n\nWe also made a scrap book on the study of wool and articles made from it, and obtained 1st prize at Regina.\n\n(d) Health Education\n\nA. Practical routines\n\nOpening of school at 9 o'clock.\n1. All go to the toilet, clean their teeth, and have a drink of water.\n2. Dust desks, etc.\n3. Wash hands if necessary (more in summer-time)\n\nRecess a.m. \u2014 Toilet and drink.\n\nNoon \u2014 before dinner\n1. Toilet and drink.\n2. All wash hands.\n\nAfternoon opening \u2014 Toilet and drink.\n\nRecess p.m. \u2014 Toilet and drink.\n\nB. Periodically I inspect necks and ears and mark on a Hygiene Chart all the dirty ones. Also I question re\u2014baths and washing of heads, clean underwear, etc.\n\nC. Individual drinking cups (numbered)\n   \u2014 towels (initialled)\n   \u2014 Handkerchiefs (initialled) kept in their desks.\n\nTowels and handkerchiefs are washed at school Friday afternoon. Girls' aprons (provided by Mrs. Brown) numbered and kept as school property are taken home every Friday to be washed and if necessary mended.\n\nD. Washing dinner dishes at school, some of the points stressed:\n1. Pile them neatly before beginning.\n2. Use suitable soap in the water.\n3. Wash thoroughly, pudding dishes (when they are used).\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 2)\n4. Leave everything tidy at the end.\n\n5. Sweeping school (without moving desks) every noon; smaller girls\n   after school Friday p.m. (all desks moved)\n   bigger children.\n\n6. Check up for wet shoes and stockings etc., when there are snowy\n   trails or wet days with the removal and drying of the same at once.\n\n7. Physical exercise every morning 15 minutes.\n\nHave you had any complaints made to you by:\n\n(a) The School Inspector \u2014 Mr. W. D. Brennan.\n\nOct. 1937, Quote: \"Advise drill in Grade 1 with flash cards\non word recognition so as to associate the word with the\npicture. Then you can use both sides of the card for drill.\nAfter they begin to grasp idea of rhonics I wouldn't help\nthem too much with new words but rather have them try to sound\nit for themselves. You should drill frequently on words and\nin number work combinations.\n\nI should try to make them speak English only in the\nclassroom as much as possible and not allow them too much\nfreedom of speech. I should also make them go out orderly\non dismissals, at recess. The disciplinary training would\ndo them much good. These children will be quick to take\nadvantage of your good nature in discipline.\"\n\nMr. Brennan's report for 1936 to the Department (copy\nenclosed) seems to cover my efforts. And at the end of his\nlast visit he, with reference to the above, said with a\nsmile, \"You take advice very kindly, and the school is\nmuch quieter.\" He seemed to be very pleased with everything.\n\nOct. 1938, Quote:\n\n\"Promote Grade 1 Jr. to Grade 2.\nPromote Frank 2 to 3 when complete Bk. 2, looks bright\nand should make rapid progress.\nGrade 4 should be ready for promotion when finished\nBk. 4 \u2014 look good. This Grade needs drill in subtr.\ninvolving O's.\n\nAdvise starting beginners at printing and keep printing\ntill quite good \u2014 e.g.,\nabcde\n\nWhen they begin writing use the same idea to get\nuniformity.\n\nKeep me posted on all promotions made for school files.\"\n\nMy action to this advice has been as follows:\n\n1. Grade 4 have had considerable practice in subtr. involving\nO's. Last week they completed Grade 4 Reader so were promoted\nto Grade 5 January 16th, and I have notified the Inspector.\n\n2. Grade 2 has not yet completed Reader 2.\n\n3. The beginners were already printing from their Reading\nbooks, but they now do it full space size as requested.\n\nIncidentally Mrs. Brennan was with him in the car so after\nschool was dismissed, he asked to see all the project work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 623-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand had me arrange it on the desk while he finished his writing and then he called his wife to see it, and remarked, \"This represents a splendid work Miss Beanland is doing with these children.\"\n\n***************\n\n(c) The Indian Agent \u2014 Mr. S. B. Macdonald.\n\nI cannot recall any complaint that Mr. Macdonald has ever made to me, nor any special request of that nature. It has generally been that I have asked him to get after certain families because of irregular attendance at school. He has always appeared very agreeable.\n\nOn February 23, 1938, Mr. Macdonald and Dr. Lewis visited me at 4 p.m., As they were leaving Mr. Macdonald called me back into the living room and asked me if there was any trouble in the school, and went on to say that Inspector Robertson's report of Oct. 1937 had been discussed while he was in Battleford, and they felt there might be someone interfering with the school. Was Mrs. Brown causing any trouble? Not having seen the 1937 report, I was at a loss to know what they were referring to, but I discussed with him Mr. Brennan's remarks to me re \u2014 order and discipline, and told him the reason why I had previously allowed more freedom was because I wanted to make the children like to come to school, etc., but that I had tightened up considerably at the School Inspector's request. And as for Mrs. Brown she certainly did not interfere with the running of the school. He was still of the opinion that Mrs. Brown had given trouble once and might be at it again.\n\nCandidly, when I first came here as \"substitute teacher\" in May 1934, I expected suggestions and information from Mrs. Brown, and took all she offered. But when I was appointed in Sept. 1934, and came into residence, for quite a long time Mrs. Brown would frequently come into the school at any time of day and tell me to do this or that, or that the children should not be allowed to do this or that \u2014 until finally I had to tell her that I was responsible for the school, etc. As far as the Church went I would help her all I could, but that was her responsibility, and I felt the school was mine. Since then we have never had any trouble. So that in 1937 it was certainly not Mrs. Brown who was to blame.\n\nAs I said before, I did not see the School Inspector's report sent in Oct. 1937, so I still do not know what they could have had in mind. I only saw the advice quoted to you already.\n\n***************\n\n(d) The Indian Inspector \u2014 Dr. T. Robertson.\n\n1. May 1938. Complained about the Anglican Prayer and hymn book being used in the school. This you took up. At present I am using it the same as I ever did. We sing a hymn every morning, and very occasionally if there are no R.C. present I take a little drill in finding places for Church Service, but otherwise use only the Bible stories.\n\n2. On the same visit Dr. Robertson told me to take the children out of school for half a day and tidy up the yard. We had been spending our noon hours for several weeks tidying it up, but it is a very rough piece of ground and does not show much improvement for the work put on it. However we took time off and did the best we could.\n\n3. In Oct. 1937, on his first visit Dr. Robertson was inspecting the children's knitting and sewing, and enquired what was being done for the women along that line. I told him that I did not do anything but that Mrs. Brown had her W.A. and the women did sewing then.\nBut he seemed to think there should be a definite class when they were given instruction, etc., and the class-room could be closed for half a day and all supplies obtained from the Department.\n\nThe following spring when the weather improved I tried to organize something and got together the younger English speaking women. I found I had a little wool that I could spare from the school supply to make a start on and see how we progressed. For the first meeting I closed School one hour earlier, but since then the members come and work in the dining-room, (they enjoy the social time) and when school is dismissed they have the instruction part and take notes in the class-room.\n\nOn March 31st 1926, I wrote the following to Mr. Macdonald:\n\nQuote: \"Last Fall when you brought Dr. Robertson to visit the school, he was very anxious that some kind of instruction class should be held for the older girls and young women. With the coming of the lighter days I endeavoured to organize a class along that line, and, using what wool I could spare from the class-room, they have been learning to knit gloves and mitts. I have also tried to give them a little instruction in home nursing and the care and use of the medicines supplied. We have had six classes with an enrollment of nine, and average attendance of six. Do you consider this is the type of class Dr. Robertson had in mind? If so, what means is there whereby I can procure some materials for future use?\n\n(I regret that I have omitted to file Mr. Macdonald's reply, I took to Saskatoon with me for reference, and cannot find it just now.) But in it he implied that the class was all right, but it was more on the line of Homemakers Club that Dr. Robertson was thinking.\n\nThat Easter when in Saskatoon, I interviewed Miss Rowles of the Extension Dept., Saskatchewan University, and she thought we were making a good start and could be affiliated to the Homemakers Clubs if we wanted. There was such a broad field, and every group had to adapt it and take what was suitable. She gave me some literature from which I have used some suggestions.\n\nThe following is an outline summary of our meetings:\n\n1. Learning to make mitts or gloves, in some cases introducing a fancy stitch.\n2. Hints on Home Nursing:\n   1. Care of T.B. patient in the house (M.S.C.G. card)\n   2. List of the medicines in common use (to get the spelling)\n   3. Care of medicines and proper use.\n   4. Bandaging and compresses, demonstrated and their use.\n   5. Treatment of sprains, and figure of eight bandage on foot.\n   6. Treatment of severe nose bleed.\n   7. Treatment of a dirty wound.\n3. We have begun the correct method and use of the sewing stitches with a view to sewing articles.\n\nWe spend the last 15 minutes in a game or community singing (alternate). Closing with the National Anthem, followed by a cup of tea.\n\nI must admit there are not as many young women attending as I should like, but those who do come are keenly interested. At present two are kept at home with tiny babies, but they are looking forward to the time when they will be able to bring their babies and come along again.\n\nSix of them have already completed their gloves and were delighted to purchase them at cost-price. So with that money we can buy other material to make up.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils are ready for Grade II. In Grade II the pupils were advanced in reading and arithmetic, the pupil in Grade IV was advanced in reading and arithmetic, and in Grade IV the pupils were up to standard. This latter grade should be rung up immediately. The teacher took a drill in reading with the beginners and the pupils appeared to be making favorable progress. The notebooks were kept in good order and well checked. On the whole the writing throughout the school was above the average, some fine project work has been done and the results are quite nicely. It was noted that the pupils were well trained, and there was a marked improvement. Some suggestions were left with the teacher which she appeared to give good consideration to. She has to devote so much time to the large class of beginners, that she cannot give as much attention as is demanded in the higher grades. The teacher said that the reason of who were provided with some more primary books might be kept fairly occupied. She was advised to make her lessons as practical as possible. Some more blackboard space would be an advantage.\n\nAs the case last year I must again draw to your attention the fact that the attendance has been very low, thus putting the teacher under further handicap.

(RG 10, Volume 6204, file 623-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Bishop Bard:\n\nI was indeed surprised to read the copy of Mr. Hoey's letter to Dr. Robertson.\n\nI have tried to answer all your questions and regret that it has turned out to be such a lengthy report \u2014 also sorry I am not an expert typist!\n\nIt was sometime the beginning of December that I received a copy of the School Inspector's Report with a note attached\u2014 \"for your perusal, please return to Battleford Agency\". I thought Mr. Macdonald had sent it to me, because I had told him Feb. 1936 that during all the years I had been teaching I had never yet seen any of my Inspector's reports. I made some copies and intended showing it to the Archdeacon on his next visit. I am enclosing a copy now.\n\nYou will see from the average month by month attendance for the past three years, it is true that the % in 1936 for 5 months is lower than in 1937. At the same time the average is lower in only 3 months because of the varied enrollment.\n\nI am enclosing a detailed chart of each child's month by month attendance for 1936, and you will see the cause. When at home on the Reserve most of them attend pretty well (a few exceptions) but the parents have not yet, on the whole, come to value their children's education, and are too ready to move around the country, supposedly in search of work, and take the whole family with them.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Kate E. Beanland.\nJanuary 30, 1939.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nDr. Robertson has forwarded me a copy of your letter to him of January 5, in which you state that the teacher at Thunderchild Indian Day School should be changed at the end of the current academic year and you ask him to consult me regarding the nomination of a new teacher. As you have been assured by me, I am at all times willing to co-operate in any action which is for the welfare of the Indian schools in this Diocese, but you will remember that in the conference I had with you in your office, it was agreed that before any dismissal was made, I should be informed of the complaint and be given an opportunity of correcting the fault. Should this not have any effect, I would then be quite willing that the teacher whom I had nominated should be dismissed. A memorandum covering this was sent to all teachers, and a copy was sent to you which you acknowledged. In this present case I wish to point out that the first official notice was your letter to Dr. Robertson. The reason given in your letter was the poor attendance at the school, but I am informed by Dr. Robertson that this is only one of the reasons, and that the chief one is non-co-operation in social service work.\n\nIn fairness to Miss Beanland I have asked her to submit to me:\n\n1. A copy of the school Inspector's report.\n2. A statement of the average attendance for the past three years.\n3. Practical work done by the boys and girls.\n4. Complaints which have been made, and what has been done regarding them.\n\nI now enclose copy of her letter of January 21, giving all the information asked for. I ask you to note carefully:\n\n1. Inspector's Report \u2014 dated October 20, 1938. On this visit there were 23 children present out of a possible 27. In the general comment, which is favorable, it is stated: \"It appears that Miss Beanland continues to give good conscientious service.\" I cannot find any item in this report which would justify the dismissal of the teacher.\n2. Average Attendance\n\nThe average attendance for the last four months of 1938 is an average of over 75%, and for the first thirteen days of 1939 86%. In an itemized statement for each pupil for 1938, which I have not copied as it involves excessive typing, the percentage of absentees is mostly accounted for by the children being off the reserve with their parents. This is not the fault of the teacher.\n\n3. Practical Work\n\nYou will note what has been done here regarding meals, sewing, knitting, gardening, and health education. I think you will agree that a considerable amount has been undertaken in addition to the academic work.\n\n4. Complaints which have been made.\n\n(a) School Inspector:\n\nYou will note that there were not so much complaints as suggestions, and that in each case the suggestion was adopted.\n\n(b) Indian Agent:\n\nYou will see from this that it is the Indian Agent's impression that Mrs. Brown, the missionary, is interfering with the school. An agreement on this point was apparently reached and Miss Beanland states \"since then we have never had any trouble.\"\n\n(c) Indian Inspector:\n\nIt will be seen that Dr. Robertson's suggestions have been carried out as far as possible with the exception of instruction in cooking, which Miss Beanland says was discontinued owing to the pilfering of the children, but they have been taught how to prepare many other things connected with meals, and the teacher proposes to give the next class cooking experience.\n\nYou will see from the whole of this report that there is not sufficient justification for the dismissal of the teacher, and I feel that your advisers have not received the information which I now present to you. I trust therefore that your decision to dismiss this teacher will be rescinded. You will readily understand that if teachers are to be dismissed without any apparent reason, it will undermine the confidence that teachers have in the Department, and it is essential for the welfare of the work that there should be the fullest confidence and co-operation between all agents engaged in Indian work.\n\nIt also should be noted that while Miss Beanland is a single teacher, there is a full time farm instructor and his wife on this reserve who should share the responsibility of the manual training.\nof the children.\n\nI am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter and information to Dr. Robertson.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, esq.,\nSecretary, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 2, 1938.\n\nMy dear Bishop Burd:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you express regret at the action taken by the Department with respect to the removal of the teacher now in charge of the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nI must express regret that a misunderstanding seems to have arisen with respect to conditions at this particular school.\n\nDr. Robertson, in a report to the Department dated May 25, 1938, expressed the opinion that Miss Beanland, while a good teacher, was scarcely the person to make a success of the Thunderchild School. The Department, in a reply to Dr. Robertson dated June 2, 1938, stated:\n\n\"We have noted your remarks regarding Miss Beanland, teacher of the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\n\"Miss Beanland was nominated by the Right Reverend Walter Burd, Bishop of Saskatchewan, Prince Albert, Sask., and on the occasion of your next visit to Prince Albert, I would suggest that you call on the Bishop and discuss with him the situation existing on the Thunderchild reserve.\"\n\nDr. Robertson, in one of his regular reports to the Department dated November 14, 1938, stated in part:\n\n\"The teacher at the Thunderchild school has every qualification but is not up to the mark and a change should be made there at the end of this year and a married couple taken on, so that some welfare work can be started\".\n\nIt was my thought that in the interval Dr. Robertson had discussed conditions at the Thunderchild Day School with you and that you were willing that a change should take place. Therefore my letter to Dr. Robertson dated January 5, 1938, was based on this assumption and was written following a report from the Indian Agent, in which Mr. Macdonald stated in part:\n\n\"The day school requirements at Thunderchild now are not a one-woman proposition. We have made -\n\nRight Reverend Walter Burd, D.C.M., D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\nhave made every effort to overcome this situation and, as far as I can see, the only way out is to make a change at the end of next June and get a married couple there, to do social work as well as the regular teaching\".\n\nDr. Robertson, in reply to my letter of January 5, stated:\n\n\"On Tuesday January 10th I went to Prince Albert and discussed school matters with Bishop Burd. Mr. Davis, our agent at Carlton, and Mr. Simpson, our agent at Duck Lake, were in Prince Albert on that date to discuss matters regarding conditions. I took them with me. We had a very pleasant and friendly discussion. I may say that Bishop Burd is prepared to give us 100% cooperation and has agreed to carefully select a married couple to replace our present teacher at Thunderchild for the beginning of the next term.\"\n\nYou can readily imagine how surprised I was to receive your letter of the 30th ultimo. It was not my thought that I had departed in any sense from the agreement reached with you when you visited my office about a year ago - an agreement which was later confirmed by letter. In view of the fact that Miss Beanland appears to be reasonably successful in her classroom work, would it not be possible to have her transferred to another school? I have already intimated, in discussing school matters with Dr. Robertson, that these teachers were not originally employed to undertake instruction in farming or general welfare work on the reserve. Consequently, it has never seemed altogether fair to me to dismiss them for their failure to accomplish work other than the work ordinarily undertaken and accomplished by a teacher.\n\nI am sending forward to Dr. Robertson a copy of this letter and also a copy of the circular sent out by you to your teachers and referred to in the communication. I feel confident that this matter can be easily adjusted by Your Lordship and Dr. Robertson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hays,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 2, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent by the Department to Right Reverend Walter Burd, Bishop of Saskatchewan, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nI am also sending forward copy of a circular dated September 20, 1937, sent out by Bishop Burd to the Indian day school teachers of his diocese. May I direct your attention particularly to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this circular, both of which relate to the employment and dismissal of teachers and both of which were agreed to by the Department here at the time of Bishop Burd's visit.\n\nIn view of the splendid cooperation that has existed between you and Bishop Burd with respect to the employment of teachers, I am very sorry indeed that a misunderstanding has arisen regarding the teacher at the Thunderchild School. Such misunderstandings are inevitable however in any system of long-range administration.\n\nIt is just possible that the transfer of this teacher to another school would be satisfactory to the Bishop and accomplish what you have in mind. In any event I am convinced that the matter can be adjusted.\n\nIn the case of teachers nominated for Indian day schools in Saskatchewan in the future, I am of the opinion that an outline of their duties should be given to them for their guidance. Saskatchewan, I may state, is the only province in the Dominion where teachers are called upon to undertake tasks other than the regular tasks associated with the work of the school. I am not\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nEncl.\nat the moment objecting to these additional duties where the teacher is capable of undertaking them and accomplishing them. What I do mean is that misunderstandings are apt to arise unless these extra duties are clearly defined. Just today, I understand, the Department is in receipt of a letter complaining bitterly that the teacher in charge of the Kinistino School has not been paid any salary for the two vacation months, July and August. I mention this as an indication of considerable trouble ahead unless a certain amount of care is exercised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your #105-9-1 of February 2nd,\nBishop Burd re Thunderchild Teacher.\n\nI must say that Bishop Burd's letter came as a surprise. At our last interview, I fully explained that while Macdonald's recommendation was made in reply to one from you re attendance, it was on the grounds of lack of progress and failure to carry out suggestions, not lack of attendance, that it was made.\n\nI have kept the Bishop advised of the progress made on the Reserves where the proposed work has been carried on, and at the meeting above referred to, again pointed out to him its effect and consequent necessity. We left the meeting with the understanding that he was satisfied and that a change would be made. In fact, Davis, Simpson and I, after leaving, spoke of the good co-operation the Bishop was giving. It was also on his suggestion that I recommended an increase in salary in order that he could secure the best teacher available.\n\nWith regard to the Bishop's intimation that I would not have recommended dismissal had I known conditions, I can only say that I know them too well. If he realized, as I do, that the Church and Department are responsible for those conditions, he would think less of security of tenure and more of the necessity of rectification. He would not leave 150 Indians to suffer in order that a teacher should retain her position.\n\nWith regard to his suggestion that the Farming Instructor and his wife should be responsible for this work instead of the Teacher, I would point out that the Teacher has authority to close his school for the purpose of this meeting, consequently he is being paid for that time. Visiting the homes would have to be done after hours, but any man or woman who does not take enough interest in the welfare of the Indian to do this should not be in the service of our Department. In addition, he or she is trained for teaching.\n\nThe Farming Instructor is going from six a.m. until dark, if he is doing his own work properly. His wife, however, should assist.\n\nI must admit that I was somewhat irritated when I first read the Bishop's letter, as I have been on several occasions with our Agents for lack of effort to secure the assistance of the Teachers in rectifying conditions, also with a number of the Teachers for the uninterested way in which they received suggestions. This, however, subsided after reading the Bishop's circular, approved by the Department, and I now believe I owe the Bishop and the Teachers an apology for attempting in.......\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nattempting in any way to direct their efforts.\n\nThis circular clearly informs the Teachers that their position is secure so long as they carry out his instructions. It does not definitely state, but the inference is there, that they may disregard the Agent, the Inspector or even the Department's instructions with safety. True, it provides that if the Department is not satisfied, they may so inform the Bishop, who will then advise the Teacher. Then, if the Teacher does not rectify conditions, dismissal may follow. The Bishop, however, makes it perfectly clear in his letter that the School Inspector only shall be the judge of their efficiency.\n\nI can now understand the attitude of the Teachers, and our Agents, and when I remember conditions on Montreal Lake, the protest that was made about that change, the fact that the Teacher who was at that time dismissed for inefficiency was within two months sent to Battleford with a recommendation from the Bishop for the position of Teacher on the Red Pheasant Reserve, I can but sympathize with the Indians under present arrangements.\n\nI am fully in accord with the idea that an employee's duties should be outlined to him when he comes on, and I am now informing all applicants for positions of Farming Instructor, that in addition to their own duties, their wives will be expected to organize and carry on Home Makers' Clubs or similar organizations.\n\nI would, however, point out that at present about the only work that is being carried on on our Reserves is a little grain growing and cattle raising. These activities must be extended to cover hogs, chickens, turkeys, raising horses, growing fruits, or anything we can find that will give the Indian food or revenue. It would therefore be ridiculous to say a Farming Instructor could not be dismissed if he refused to instruct and assist the Indians in hog raising or any other line, on the ground that that was not one of his duties when he took the position.\n\nWhat we need on our Reserves today is not time servers, or people who object to carrying on work not outlined to them when they were engaged, but men and women constantly seeking for new ways and means to advance the Indian, ready to co-operate and assist in every way possible. There is no difficulty in securing such men and women. Then why should our work and the Indian suffer to keep a white man or woman in a position when they refuse to co-operate?\n\nYou suggest that I should see the Bishop again on this matter. With regard to this, I would point out that I have gone fully into the work we are carrying on and the progress that has been made. He has had ample time to consider the matter and to verify the truth of my statements. I have invited him to go along with me as my guest, visit the reserves, and see for himself the improvements made. I have asked for his co-operation and assistance. I explained to him fully our reasons for asking a change of Teachers at Thunderchild, and was informed that the change would be made.\n\nI pointed out to him the poor report on the Teacher in the Church of England School at Onion Lake, and suggested Miss Beanland be transferred there, as I did not believe the present Teacher would be retained with such a report.\n\nA few days...........\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6294, file 623-1, part 2)\nA few days after this, the Bishop writes you, objecting to Miss Beanland's dismissal on the grounds that her services were satisfactory, basing his statement on the School Inspector's Report, and at the same time stating that the work we were asking Miss Beanland to carry on was the Farming Instructor's duties.\n\nOnly one conclusion can be drawn from the above. The Bishop has now decided that his Teachers shall only carry on class work, that the School Inspector shall be the judge as to their efficiency, and that the Agent or Inspector have no jurisdiction or right to require the Teacher to do anything.\n\nUnder the above conditions, I feel that it would not only be useless for me to again discuss this matter with him, but also that he would resent my doing so.\n\nIt is therefore my intention to discontinue all efforts to enlist the Teachers in this work. It is a work that I consider vitally necessary, so I shall endeavour to persuade our Farming Instructor's wives to organize and carry it on.\n\nI would, however, point out that most of these women have children to care for in addition to their housework. It will therefore be very difficult for some of them unless we can make them an allowance in order that they may keep a maid.\n\nI would therefore recommend that serious consideration be given by the Department to the question of reducing our Teachers' salaries to $550.00 per year.\n\nIn support of this, I would point out that many of our Teachers in Saskatchewan are now only receiving $350.00 to $450.00 per year. We could secure all the teachers we want for $500.00, consequently there should be no just complaint on the part of the public if we reduced ours to $550.00. In fact, if the public knew conditions and that this service could not otherwise be given, I think we would be severely censured if we did not.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nTR/FMc\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSince writing my last letter, yours of February 4th regarding Pelican Lake Reserve Day School has been received. You will see from my previous letter that I agree with the recommendation of the agent, but a new school building should be erected before the Department assumes complete charge.\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 2nd regarding Miss Beanland, the situation is made quite clear by you so far as your action is concerned. Dr. Robertson, however, did not see me until January 10, and I agreed tentatively, thinking that there was something really adverse in the report from the Inspector.\n\nI cannot see how moving Miss Beanland to another school would solve the problem, as she would still be unmarried and could hardly be more efficient than she is at present. I think that the presence of a Farm Instructor and his wife on the Thunderchild Reserve, with a resident teacher and resident missionary, should be an adequate staff for the training of a comparatively small band of Indians.\n\nI do not, however, wish to make this a matter of controversy with Dr. Robertson, and hope that the matter can be settled by conference as you suggest.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWalter Burd\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBattleford, Sask.\nFeb. 27th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter No. 302011A, Feb. 20th, re Bishop Bird's application for a school at Thunderchild reserve, we have a school there and it was built for a school and not a Church, I knew the circumstances well but we dug up old documents to verify my statement and am attaching the Resolution etc. for your information.\n\nThe Bishops statement struck me as odd, when we have letters from his office within the month, re getting a surrender for two acres for a church.\n\nThe Indians of this band are about 50-50 Anglican and R.C. and latter half did not vote their money for an Anglican church but for a school but had no objection to it being used for a church, so the Anglican Church built a little addition on the end for a chancel and put folding doors which can be opened when it is used for church, there was never any surrender but it was built on reserve lands for a school for Band purposes and an apparent attempt to now claim it as an Anglican church is all wrong.\n\nThis school will do for school purposes for some years to come yet, it has a good lean to dining room and is not by any means overcrowded. The cottage residence is small and in the event of a family taking this as teachers it might require an addition.\n\nI trust that this information, with the attached resolution, etc., will clear the situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

I can verify from personal knowledge that the school is in fair shape. In fact it is in much better condition than many other schools in this province, and as Macdonald says, is good for several years yet.\n\nReports on other schools will follow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

But the school as a whole ranks among the best in the quality of work and in the efficiency of teaching.\n\nI regret to note that Mr. Palmer is leaving.

HAWRYLUK.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nI was requested by Mr. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, to nominate a teacher in place of Miss K. E. Beanland, who has resigned the position. I have today interviewed Mr. A. C. M. Palmer, Wolfe, Saskatchewan, and I believe that he and Mrs. Palmer would make very efficient workers at the above school. Mr. Palmer holds a second-class certificate but has taken the work during this present summer for a first-class certificate and expects to receive it soon. Mr. Palmer has fifteen years teaching experience and is forty years of age. For two years he taught a mixed Indian and white school at Sturgeon Landing, Manitoba. I believe that this school was under your jurisdiction. Mrs. Palmer holds a first-class certificate and has had seven years' experience. She is Vice-President of the Home Makers' Club at Wolfe and a leader of a Girls' Club. Mrs. Palmer is willing to help in every way both in the school work and in the women's and girls' work. I had an interview with Dr. Robertson Inspector of Indian Agencies, two days ago and I showed him Mr. Palmer's application and recommendations and he thought that he and Mrs. Palmer would make suitable workers for Thunderchild Reserve. Mr. Palmer is keen on gardening and would work a school garden and teach gardening to the children. I enclose copies of some Inspectors' reports.\n\nThe new Bishop of Saskatchewan will not be at Prince Albert till nearly the end of the month and he asked me to make arrangements to fill the vacancies in the Indian Day Schools. I therefore beg to submit to you the names of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer as our nomination for this teachership.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArchdeacon.\n\nR. A.

Inspecting the school, as he did, shortly after the term had commenced, while Mr. Palmer was putting forth most of his efforts towards understanding the Indian children and gaining the confidence of their parents, temporarily letting strictly academic work take second place, derogatory comment in this respect is pointless.\n\n\"So far as we are concerned, Mr. Palmer is certainly taking an interest in everything pertaining to the welfare of the Indian children and their parents, and Mrs. Palmer is taking the same course, and whether every child passes the final examinations, as prescribed by the Saskatchewan curriculum, is not very important.

I leave for Turtleford tomorrow on one week's leave to clear up anything necessary. I regret not having advised you of my intentions before but had not done so as I was very doubtful of my being accepted.\n\nMrs. Palmer is carrying on the work of the school on the Reserve and, if acceptable to the Department, I believe is willing to continue to do so as long as desired. I might say that Mrs. Palmer has a First Class Professional Certificate in good standing and I feel safe in saying is a better teacher than myself, and well capable of carrying on. If this is agreeable it will in no way effect the efficiency or continued service to the Department.\n\nTrusting this is satisfactory and thanking you for the co-operation given us by your office in the past.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. A.C.M. Palmer.\n\nP.S. I had hoped to visit the Regina office this week but my leave of absence will not permit this 'til a later time.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter received from Mr. A.G.M. Palmer, teacher at the Thunderchild Indian Day School, Battleford Agency, for your attention.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Palmer recommends that Mrs. Palmer continue in his stead and that she holds a First Class Professional Certificate and is a capable teacher. With reference to this I might say that from reports from Mr. Ostrender and my own inspection, Mrs. Palmer is really doing good work on the Reserve. She has been a staunch support to Mr. Palmer and I am confident that she will be able to carry on the work without any slackening effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Thunderchild Indian Day School\nNo. 623\n\nThe teacher of this school, Mr. A.C.M. Palmer, has decided to enlist. Consequently, his duties at the school will terminate on April 15, 1942. No further payment of salary should be made to him after that date. I will advise you later regarding his successor.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has been advised by Mr. Christianson that Mr. A.C.M. Palmer, teacher of the Thunderchild Indian Day School, is giving up duties on the 15th instant as he has enlisted with the R.C.A.F. Mr. Christianson approves Mr. Palmer's suggestion that Mrs. Palmer be allowed to continue in charge of the school. She is stated to hold a first-class professional certificate. Please let me know at once if the employment of Mrs. Palmer meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. H.D. Martin,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nApril 14, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in which you advise that Mr. A.C.M. Palmer, teacher of the Thunderchild Indian Day School, will give up duties on April 15. It is presumed, from your letter, that he is joining one of the branches of the armed services.\n\nUnder these circumstances the Department accepts his resignation effective on the date mentioned. As you are aware, the teachers for this school are nominated by the Bishop of Saskatchewan and consequently Mr. Palmer should take up the matter of re-employment after the war with Bishop Martin. The Department is quite willing to endeavour to find employment after the war for teachers now in our employ and who enlist, but necessarily we cannot guarantee that they would be employed at the same school at which they are now engaged.\n\nI am communicating with Bishop Martin regarding the employment of Mrs. Palmer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just heard from our missionary on Thunderchild's Reserve that Mr. A. Palmer, our teacher on that Reserve, has enlisted, and left the Reserve yesterday. Mr. Palmer has not written to me himself but I understand he has notified Mr. Ostrander in Battleford and he has also written to Regina.\n\nIn the letter our missionary makes the suggestion that Mrs. Palmer be allowed to carry on the teaching in the school until the end of the term. I understand Mrs. Palmer is willing to accept this responsibility. I also understand she is a teacher holding a first class certificate of Saskatchewan. Therefore, in view of the difficulty of obtaining teachers at the present time, I nominate Mrs. Palmer for this vacancy and ask that she be allowed to continue teaching until the end of the term. This will give us time to look around in the hope of securing a teacher and also prevent any breaking of continuity in the teaching of the school.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp/A\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nApril 21, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Thunderchild Indian Day School, No. 635.\n\nIn my memorandum of the 14th instant I advised you of the resignation of the teacher, Mr. A.C.M. Palmer.\n\nTo succeed him it has been decided to appoint Mrs. A.C.M. Palmer at a salary of $90.00 a teaching month. The necessary forms have been forwarded to her and as soon as these are completed they will be sent to you. I enclose copy of letter of appointment. I am not yet certain regarding the exact date on which she will begin duties. Her appointment will be effective for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy sent to Mr. Christianson\n\nOttawa,\nApril 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to appoint Mrs. A.C.M. Palmer as teacher of the Thunderchild Indian Day School for the balance of the current academic year. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have her complete and return to me as soon as possible. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

At the end of June the question of the teaching services might be reviewed in order that we can then decide who should be in charge of the school for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Thank you for all your trouble in this matter. I have just received a letter from Mrs. Palmer in which she states her willingness to accept this position. At the end of June we will go into the question of an appointment for this school for the academic year 1942-43.

Palmer would be in charge of the above mentioned school to July 1, 1942. She has now given up duties and no further payment of salary should be made to her.\n\nTo succeed her the Department has decided to appoint Mrs. R. D. Ross. Mrs. Ross taught at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School (No. 618) to July 1, 1942. Her salary will be at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nI will advise you later regarding the name of the teacher who will be in charge of the Red Pheasant School for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 15, 1942.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Christianson, it has been decided to transfer Mrs. R. D. Ross from the Red Pheasant to the Thunderchild Indian Day School, to succeed Mrs. A.C.M. Palmer who gave up duties at the end of June. Our officials feel that Mrs. Ross will carry on the good work that Mrs. Palmer has been doing at Thunderchild. Besides, I am advised that the farming instructor and his wife who live on the Thunderchild Reserve will work well with Mrs. Ross.\n\nAs this move appears to be in the interest of all parties concerned, I feel certain that you will approve.\n\nThis will leave a vacancy at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. I would appreciate your nominating a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend H.

It would take a Carpenter a couple of Days on the Repairs and the Indians would do the White wash and Plaster Repairs.\n\nThe Well has gone dry, it is only 18 feet deep and never was much good, but cannot be deepened on account big rocks, so it could be necessary to sink another well. I would estimate that one could be drilled for $75.00 including the cribbing, as some of the crib from the old well might be fit to use.\n\nThe well is very necessary, as the only other water supply is not same being a creek, that runs by several Indian dwellings and stables.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department of the repairs that are required at the Thunderchild Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange, during the coming summer holidays, to have the repairs required to the desks, toilets, plaster on logs and whitewashing of the interior of the building carried out. As much of the labour as possible should be performed by the Indians, you to purchase any materials required. After the repairs have been completed, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of carrying out the above repairs.\n\nRegarding the condition of the well, it is noted you recommend that a new well be drilled. The Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $75 in the drilling and cribbing of a new well. It is hoped that an ample supply of water can be obtained without drilling to any considerable depth. The Department will leave the matter in your hands, to see that a satisfactory job is completed. After the work is finished, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. L.

August 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Battleford Estimates, 1938-39,\nThunderchild Day School.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Macdonald, Agent, asking for authority to expend the sum of $60.00 on repairs to the above School and Residence.\n\nThis is a log building and requires re-plastering each year, also interior whitewashed, Pipes and stoves overhauled and toilets redug and moved.\n\nThe Residence also needs a screen door, some repairs to shed floor and the interior kalsomined and floors painted. This last can be done by the Teacher, so only the material would be required.\n\nIt might be necessary to have a regular Carpenter for one day to fit screen doors and do some repairs to desks, but other than this all the labour would be done by the Indians. The material would cost approximately $25.00 and the labour $35.00.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given to have this work done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

I have noted that the Church and the Indian Band are erecting a building for school purposes. I have to inform you in reply that the Department promised His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan classroom equipment and teacher's salary, if he could arrange with the Band for a suitable building. Your letter was the first intimation that the Department has had concerning the effort of the Indians themselves.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $250 is being directed to you, under separate cover, and you should use it for the purpose of securing materials for the new building.

The boys will do the work. $3.00 will cover this.\n\nThe eaves troughing is for one side of the school building, to be used to collect rain water for the school washing of dishes, floors etc. If the amount of $5.00 is allowed to purchase the troughing the teacher says he will perform the work.\n\nThe toilets at this school are in bad condition and need to be moved, also the doors and seats need repairing. $10.00 will be needed for this as there will be some considerable amount of digging to be done.\n\nRegarding the items for whitewashing and cleaning and repairing the fence, amounting to about $35.00 in all, while not absolutely necessary, these jobs should be done for the appearance of the school and grounds.\n\nA cupboard is badly needed for the dishes, pots and pans used for the mid-day meal. $3.00 will cover the cost of the material for this and the boys of the school will do the work as part of their training.\n\nThe last item of one dozen hand basins for the children for washing, is in order that the washing at meal times can be done in much shorter time. There are only four basins and 20 or more have to use them for washing, making the washing process very slow.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.B.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, August 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith requisition for certain school supplies for the Thunderchild Indian Day School. This requisition, you will note, is signed by yourself and by the teacher.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase the supplies, other than those marked in red, which have been purchased here and will be sent forward in due course.\n\nMay I point out, however, that requisitions from this school in recent years have always contained requests for one wash tub and 4 brooms. While it is the policy of the Department to do everything humanly possible to encourage cleanliness on the part of our Indian day school teachers and pupils, we find it difficult to persuade ourselves that it should be necessary to use up 4 brooms and one wash tub annually. I have learned from experience that the average civil servant in Ottawa can keep his own home reasonably clean with one broom a year and one wash tub every 5 or 6 years. As a matter of fact, we have reached a stage in our development when the public funds at our disposal will not enable us to make such purchases without the closest possible scrutiny, and Indian day school teachers should be informed of this fact.\n\nYou might return this requisition in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J.P.B.
