This specification refers to the works of construction and materials required in making and building the railway as comprehended by the contract, comprising clearing, close cutting, grubbing, cross-logging, temporary and permanent fencing, excavation, draining, ditching, foundation works, waterways, public road crossings, farm road crossings, road and stream diversions, embankments, bridge, culvert and retaining wall masonry, concrete, paving, rip-rap, crib work, crib-wharfing, pile, trestle, truss and swing bridges and viaducts, log culverts, tunnels, sleepers, track bolts and spikes, taking delivery of the rails and fish-plates at ship's rail, ballasting, track-laying, points, crossings, switches, signals, turn-outs, sidings, wharf at Port Moody, station buildings, water tanks and water services, with the requisite machinery and fittings and all other works of every description, whether temporary or permanent, which may be necessary for the entire completion according to the following specification, profiles and drawings hereto attached, of that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway above named and referred to, and more particularly shown on the plan of the same (drawings Nos. 1 and 2,) being a distance of about 55\u00bd miles of single track with the requisite turn-outs and station sidings, and also the maintenance of all the works during their construction and until the final estimate is issued and the works formally accepted as complete by the Minister of Railways and Canals.\n\n2. The contractor is to enclose all the open or cultivated ground as delivered to him by the Minister of Railways and Canals for the purposes of this contract with a good fence, which, if he prefers, may in the first instance be temporary, and shall keep the same enclosed during the progress of the works until the termination of the contract, including the period for maintenance of the works so as effectually to preserve the adjoining land from trespass and prevent any injury whatever to any parties by reason of the want of sufficient fences to separate their lands from the works; and the contractor shall be wholly responsible for all damages to crops and all the consequences of insufficient fencing.\n3. Before the termination of the contract the Contractor shall construct a permanent fence throughout such parts of the line as indicated on the plans and profiles.\n\nCLEARING, ETC.\n\nClearing.\n\n4. Where the railway passes through wooded sections, the land must be cleared to the width of sixty-six feet on each side of the centre line, or such further width as may be required for slopes of cuttings and fences; also for a width of 300 feet on each side of the centre line at stations, for a length of 2,000 feet.\n\n5. The clearing is to be done so that all the brush, logs, and other loose material within its limits shall be burned or removed. In no case shall any of the brush or logs be cast back upon the adjacent timber lands; they must invariably be made into piles near the centre of the space to be cleared, and if not removed for fuel or otherwise used, they must be entirely consumed. All brush or trees accidentally or otherwise thrown into the adjacent woods, must be dragged out and burned or removed. The land must be left in a clean condition.\n\nClose cutting\n\n6. Where embankments are to be formed less than four feet or more than two feet in height, all the standing timber and stumps must be chopped close to the ground within the limits of the embankment, and burned.\n\nGrubbing.\n\n7. Where excavations will not exceed three feet in depth, or embankments two feet in height, all stumps must be grubbed out, and if possible burnt; those that will not burn, must be carried beyond the limits of the cuttings and embankments, where directed, and there piled. Directions will be given at the proper time, as to the extent of ground required to be cleared, close cut, and grubbed. The side ditching and off-take drains must also be grubbed.\n\nFENCING.\n\nFencing.\n\n8. The railway grounds where they adjoin occupied or pasture lands will be enclosed with a strong snake fence, made with round or split rails of Douglas fir or cedar 12 to 15 feet in length, and having a cross section of not less than 12 square inches. The lower rails will be laid on blocks so as to raise them 6 inches above the general level of the ground. They will be secured at the angles by two slanting posts set not less than one foot in the ground, and crossing each other above the top rail. These posts may be round or split, and shall have a cross section not less in dimensions than that of the rails, and they shall be of cedar or Douglas fir; they will be held in place at the top by a heavy rail or rider laid in the angle above the posts. The fence when completed shall be not less than 5 feet high above the general level of the ground as per drawing No. 11. Over ground subject to overflow a strong post and barb wire fence will be substituted and placed where the Engineer may direct.\n\nGRADING.\n\n9. Under this term is included all excavations and embankments and surface forming, whatever may be the materials, and whether the same be required for the line of Railway, or for the diversion or forming of water-courses, roads, approaches to\nbridges or level crossings, draining and off-take ditches, station grounds and all other works, contingent upon, or relating to excavations and embankments, as required by the nature of the contract or described in this specification.\n\n10. In woodland the grading will be commenced after the clearing, close cutting and grubbing required is completed to the satisfaction of the Engineer, and in cultivated sections, the Contractor will be held responsible for damages to crops.\n\n11. The red line on the profile exhibited, according to drawings No. 3 and 4, indicates the formation level, that is, the surface of the tops of embankments and the bottoms of cuttings previous to the laying and ballasting of the permanent way. The black undulating line represents the present surface of the ground, and the blue line the level of the top of rail which is 16 inches above formation level.\n\n12. The cuttings shall be formed to the cross section exhibited according to drawings Nos. 6 and 7. The width at formation level will be 22 feet, and the inclination of the slopes in earth will be one and a half horizontal to one perpendicular. In rock cuttings the slopes will be, as a rule, one horizontal to four perpendicular. In cuttings partly earth and partly rock, a berm of 6 feet shall be left on the surface of the rock. But these proportions may be varied by the Engineer to suit the nature of the materials to be excavated and insure the stability of the slopes.\n\n13. The whole of the grading shall be carefully formed to the levels given, and the roadway in cuttings shall invariably be rounded, and left at not less than six inches lower at the sides than in the centre. There shall be a side ditch at the foot of each slope throughout the whole length of the cuttings, the bottom of which shall be kept 12 inches below the roadway on the centre line, and lower if necessary, with a fall towards the ends of the cuttings so as thoroughly to drain the same. The cuttings shall be widened a little at the ends, and these ditches carried into the ditches at the sides of the embankments, so as not to injure the latter.\n\n14. In very wet cuttings, arising from springs or soakage, drains shall be formed at the foot of the slopes averaging about four feet deep, formed with a bed of three poles, two to three inches in diameter, laid breaking joint in the bottom of the trench and then filled up with coarse gravel or broken stone not larger than ordinary road metal. In level cuttings the trenches must be dug to a greater depth than four feet at the ends, so as to give sufficient flow for the water.\n\n15. Ditches shall be formed at one or both sides of the cuttings, as the inclination of the ground may require, so as to exclude from them any water draining off or flowing from the adjoining lands. They shall not be nearer than twenty feet from the top of the slopes, and shall be graded to such depths as to carry the water clear of the cutting and into the ditches at the sides of the embankments, or to the nearest water course.\n\n16. The cuttings shall, in all cases, during the progress of the work as well as afterwards, be kept perfectly dry; and whenever the slopes are wet and the\nmaterial seriously affected by springs, soaks, heavy rains or thaws, they shall be thoroughly drained by forming oblique drains up the slopes, not less than 3 feet deep, and at such intervals as the Engineer may direct; such drains to be filled with broken stone or coarse gravel as already described.\n\n17. When slips occur in the cuttings after they are properly formed, the material must be immediately removed by the Contractor, the slopes re-formed, and such precautions adopted as the Engineer may deem necessary.\n\n18. The embankments shall be formed according to drawing No.8. The materials taken from the cuttings or borrow pits to be used in forming the embankments and road approaches must be approved by the Engineer; ice or snow must be excluded. When the quantity of the cutting is more than sufficient to make the embankment of the specified width, the surplus material may be wasted; but in every case where either borrowing or wasting is resorted to, the materials must be taken and deposited as the Engineer may approve.\n\n19. In places where the natural surface of the ground upon which the embankment is to rest, is covered with vegetable matter which cannot be burned off in clearing, and which would, in the opinion of the Engineer, impair the work, the same must be removed to his entire satisfaction. In the event of the line crossing muskogs or morasses, it may be deemed by the Engineer expedient that a platform of logs shall be formed under the embankment, of such width as will extend through and to not less than 6 feet beyond the side slopes, and 16 inches deep. The logs to range from 6 inches to 15 inches in diameter, and must be laid close together laterally and also longitudinally, as may be directed.\n\n20. Where the embankment is to be formed on side hill ground covered with pasture, the ground shall be deeply ploughed before the work is commenced; and where the slope is so steep as to endanger the slipping of the embankment, benches shall be cut in such manner as the Engineer may direct. If the ground is wet or spongy through springs or soaks, it shall first be thoroughly underdrained as the Engineer may see expedient. These drains will be constructed in a similar way to that in which ordinary land drains are sometimes made. A trench will first be dug to a minimum depth of four feet, and in the bottom of this trench, four or five cedar or spruce poles about three inches in diameter will first be laid by hand, breaking joint; over the poles will then be placed not less than three feet of small broken stone, not larger than ordinary road metal or good gravel ballast, over which will be deposited such material convenient to the place as the Engineer may approve of. The Contractor must find all the material required in these drains, and do all the work described. These drains must always be made with a sufficient longitudinal fall for the easy flow of the water.\n\n21. The embankments shall be 17 feet wide at formation level, and the slopes will generally have an inclination of one and a half horizontal to one perpendicular, but in their formation, whether for the railway or approaches to bridges or level crossings,\nample allowance must in the first instance be made by the Contractor, for all subsequent settlement or shrinkage, and particularly in the top width; and for this purpose the top, besides being kept higher than the levels given, shall be formed in the first instance wider than the specified dimensions, to such extent as may be deemed necessary, according to the height of the embankment and the nature of the materials of which it is formed, so that when it is thoroughly consolidated it will stand at least the full width required.\n\n22. The embankments will be made up with the materials from the line cuttings Borrow pits. and from side ditches, except where otherwise directed, when these are insufficient, the line cuttings will be widened, or materials procured from borrowing pits. All materials placed in the embankments must be approved by the Engineer; no stumps, logs or other perishable or unsuitable material shall be used, and no material shall be supplied without his concurrence until the cuttings are completed.\n\n23. The ditches at the sides of the embankments shall be cut with slopes not steeper than one and a half feet base to one foot perpendicular height. The top of the slopes nearest the Railway shall not be less than six feet from the foot of the embankments. These ditches shall be graded so as to carry off the water to the next natural water course, and where there is so much water as to form a strong current, the ditch shall be formed as far from the embankment as the Engineer may deem necessary for the safety of the latter. Special attention is called to those long stretches of the line on low lands subject to overflow to the depth of several feet from high floods in the rivers, as shown on the profile; no side ditches will be allowed in such places, and the embankments will have to be made from the most convenient borrow pits that can be found at either end. This can only be done by train, and a temporary track will be required. In some cases where the overflow is shallow, as on part of Maria Island, borrow pits may be dug at intervals, but not nearer the embankment than 50 feet. No continuous ditch will be allowed as it would form a leading channel for the overflow and certainly prove destructive to the embankment within a very short period.\n\n24. In flat sections a berm shall be left between the roadway and ditch of such width as may be deemed expedient, but it shall in no case be less than six feet. Where drainage cannot be conveniently carried off by the side ditches, it will be necessary to excavate off-take ditches to a considerable distance beyond the limits of the Railway grounds. These off-take ditches shall be of such widths and depths as may be required and directed by the Engineer. They shall be sloped not steeper than one and a half horizontal to one perpendicular, and the materials shall be cast out so as to leave a berm of 6 feet between the deposit and the top of the slopes of the ditches. The Contractor shall also construct all other drains and ditches which the Engineer may deem necessary for the perfect drainage of the railway and works; he shall also make all necessary diversions of roads and streams as directed by the Engineer.\nTunnelling.\n\n25. The tunnelling will consist of \"Line Tunnels\" and \"Stream Tunnels\"; the former shall be formed to an exact minimum section according to drawing No. 9 and the latter to drawing No. 10. For the purpose of tendering the sectional area of \"Line Tunnels\" shall be calculated at 405 superficial feet, equal to 15 cubic yards to the lineal foot of Tunnel. The \"Stream Tunnels,\" where formed, shall be driven through the solid rock which, in some places, forms the sides of ravines, they must be formed in the manner to be pointed out in each case. Open cuttings at the ends will be excavated, to give an easy flow to the water; these open cuttings may be slightly curved, but the Tunnels proper must be perfectly straight from end to end, with the sides as smooth as practicable. The up-stream end in each Tunnel must generally be one foot lower than the bed of the stream opposite, and they must be driven with a proper inclination. Care must be taken to leave a solid pillar of rock between the Tunnel and the side of the ravine, equal (except in special cases) to not less than about double the diameter of the Tunnel. The thickness of solid rock over the Tunnel shall be similarly proportioned.\n\nCrib wharfing\n\n26. Crib wharfing will have to be resorted to at some points as noted on profile according to general drawing No. 42.\n\nRip-rap.\n\n27. Whenever the slopes of the embankments are liable to be washed by the overflow of streams, they will require to be protected by a rip-rap wall of stones carefully laid by hand to such thickness and height as may be directed by the Engineer, generally about 18 in. above high water level.\n\nRock facing.\n\n28. Special attention is called to those long stretches of embankment to be made on low lands subject to over-flow to a considerable depth. The slopes of these will require to be protected with rock facing, the stones for which will have to be quarried and brought by train or by water from a considerable distance.\n\nEmbankment at Port Moody.\n\n29. The slope of the embankment at Port Moody extends below water at high tide and will have to be protected with rip-rap of large well formed stone laid by hand.\n\nPublic roads\n\n30. At all public roadways, cattle-guards will be established and will be constructed according to drawing No. 13. The roadway between cattle-guards will be planked and the public road properly graded and gravelled as far as the limits of the Railway right-of-way. Under this heading the bridging of side ditches, fences from cattle-guards to the line fences of the Railway, also post and sign board, and everything necessary to complete the crossing, will be embraced. The fences connecting cattle-guards with right-of-way fences, will be post and board, or post and wire as per drawings.\n\nFarm crossings.\n\n31. Farm crossings will be established wherever required and directed. They will be constructed of cast iron rails, and will be provided with bridges, fences, and gates as required in the drawings.\nwill be graded, so as to form easy and convenient passages for farm traffic across the rails, and planked to the full extent of the Railway ties. The ditches will be properly bridged and gates of an approved design and with proper fastenings will be placed in the fences according to drawing No. 12.\n\n32. Roads constructed to and from any point on the line of Railway for the convenience of the Contractor, for the conveyance of material or otherwise, must be at his own risk, cost and charges.\n\n33. Wherever the line is intersected by public or private roads, the Contractor must keep open at his own cost convenient passing places, and he shall be held responsible for keeping all crossings during the progress of the works in such condition as will enable the public to use them with perfect safety, and such as will give rise to no just ground for complaint. Contractors will be held liable for any damages resulting from negligence on their part or that of their men.\n\nTruss Bridges.\n\n34. The Railway will in most cases be carried over the larger streams by wooden superstructures supported on abutments and piers, of timber framing, on pile foundations. The pile foundation will, wherever practicable, be made suitable for permanent structures.\n\n35. In some cases crib abutments and piers filled with stone may be allowed. The cribs must be constructed in the most substantial manner of tamarack or other suitable timber; outside timbers to be not less than 12 inches square, halved together at the angles, and properly secured with drift bolts of iron; the ties may be of flatted timber, dove-tailed into face timbers and bolted. The sloping faces of the cut waters to piers must be of square timber laid with one side in the line of the rake of the cut water, and be halved at angles; the faces of the cut waters will be covered with hardwood timber 8 inches thick, well fastened to the cribwork with spikes or rag-bolts. The whole of the abutments and piers to be finished in accordance with plans, and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.\n\n36. The superstructures will be of the most approved Howe or Pony Truss pattern, the former built of Douglass fir of approved quality, with cast-iron or white oak keys, cast iron prisms and wrought iron rods with up-set ends, the whole to be first-class material and workmanship. The parts that are inaccessible after the structures are erected, are to receive one good coat of paint of approved quality as soon as framed, and a second coat when the work is put together. Drawings Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 are prepared to suit each span or bridge, and to which the Contractor must work. These bridges must be executed in a thoroughly substantial and workmanlike manner, and shall be completed in every respect, including painting.\n\nPile Bridges.\n\n37. Wherever the circumstances of the case require the adoption of bridges,\non piles, they will be erected according to the following, drawing No. 19, or special drawing. Each bent will be composed of piles, as shown in the drawings. The piles shall be of tamarac, Douglas fir or other approved timber and of sufficient size at the butt or larger end to square not less than 12 inches, and for long piles 14 inches. They must be perfectly sound and straight, sawed or hewed to these dimensions, and be of such lengths as circumstances may require. The piles must be driven by a hammer weighing 1,500 lbs. or upwards, until they reach perfectly firm ground. They will generally be tested by the hammer falling 24 feet at the last blow under which they should not yield more than two inches. Care must be taken to have them driven truly, so that the caps and braces may be properly framed and bolted to them. The spur piles must be curve-pointed, so that as they are driven they will gradually come to the proper inclination. Before being driven the piles must be sawed or chopped off square at the butt, and tapered to a blunt point at the smaller end. Should there appear to be any danger of splitting, the heads must be bound with iron hoops, and if necessary the points be properly shod. The stringers, which will be of Douglas fir or other approved timber, must be bolted together and to the corbels and caps. The stringers must be of sufficient length to reach over two spans, and break joints alternately inside and out. The bank stringers will be 12 inches by 12 inches. The whole to be covered by special ties 9 inches by 8 inches.\n\n**Trestle Bridges.**\n\n38. The structures for the passage of small streams, or for crossing dry ravines, will generally be trestle work built in accordance with the general drawings Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. The timber used in these bents may be Douglas fir, pine, tamarac, or other suitable timber, in proportions approved by the Engineer, and of the dimensions shown on the drawings. They will be set on mud sills placed in trenches of sufficient depth to insure a foundation that will not be affected by frost or the wash of the streams, and when properly levelled as to the grade height, &c., earth and stones shall be firmly packed round them. The bents will be spanned by stringers as described above for pile bridges. In marshy or springy ground, a single or double row of piles shall be driven for each bent. The piles will average not less than 12 inches diameter, of suitable timber approved by the Engineer and driven home so as to afford a secure foundation.\n\n39. In some cases log culverts will be adopted according to the general drawings, No. 25.\n\n**Masonry.**\n\n40. The masonry shall not be started at any point before the foundation has been properly prepared, nor until it has been examined and approved by the Engineer, nor until the Contractor has provided a sufficient quantity of proper materials and plant to enable the work to be proceeded with regularly and systematically.\n\n41. The stone used in all masonry on the line of Railway must be of a durable\ncharacter, large, well proportioned, and well adapted for the construction of substantial and permanent structures; parties tendering must satisfy themselves as to where fitting material for the masonry can be most conveniently procured.\n\n42. Bridge and nearly vertical retaining wall masonry, shall generally be in regular courses of large, well-shaped stones, laid on their natural beds; the beds and vertical joints will be dressed, so as to form quarter inch joints. The vertical joints will be dressed back square 9 inches, the beds will be dressed perfectly parallel throughout. The work will be left with the \"quarry face,\" except the outside arrises, strings and coping, which will be chisel-dressed.\n\n43. The courses will not be less than 12 inches; and they will be arranged in preparing the plans to suit the nature of the quarries, courses may range up to 24 inches, and the thinnest courses invariably be placed towards the top of the work.\n\n44. Headers will be built in every course not farther apart than 6 feet; they will have a length in line of wall of not less than 24 inches, and they must run back at least three times their height, unless when the wall will not allow this proportion, in which case they will pass through from front to back. Stretchers will have a minimum length in line of wall of 30 inches, and their breadth of bed will at least be 1\u00bd times their height. The vertical joints in each course must be arranged so as to overlap those in the course below 10 inches at least. The above dimensions are for minimum courses of 12 inches, the proportions will be the same for thicker courses.\n\n45. The quoins of abutments, piers, &c., shall be of the best and largest stones, and have chisel drafts properly tooled on the upright arris, from two to three inches wide, according to the size and character of the structure.\n\n46. Coping stones, string courses and cut-waters shall be neatly dressed in accordance with plans and directions to be furnished during the progress of the work.\n\n47. The bed stones for girders shall be the best description of sound stone, free from drys or flaws of any kind, they must be not less than 12 inches in depth for the smaller bridges, and eight feet superficial area on the bed. The larger bridges will require bed stones of proportionately greater weight; these stones shall be solidly and carefully placed in position, so that the bridge will sit fair on the middle of the stones.\n\n48. The backing will consist of flat-bedded stone, well shaped, having an area of bed equal to four superficial feet or more. Except in high piers or abutments, two thicknesses of backing stone, but not more, will be allowed in each course, and their joints must not exceed that of the face work. In special cases, where deemed necessary by the Engineer to insure stability, the backing shall be in one thickness; the beds must, if necessary, be scabbled off, so as to give a solid bearing. No pinning will be admitted. Between the backing and face stones there must be a good square joint, not exceeding one inch in width, and the face stones must be scabbled off to allow\nthis. In walls over three feet in thickness, headers will be built in front and back alternately, and great care must be taken in the arrangement of the joints so as to give perfect bond.\n\n49. Culvert Masonry shall be built of good, sound, large flat-bedded stones, laid in horizontal beds. It may be known as Random, or broken coursed work. The stones employed in this class of masonry will generally be not less in area of bed than three superficial feet, nor less in thickness than eight inches, and they must be dressed so as to give good beds with half-inch joints. In smaller structures, and in cases where stones of good size and thickness cannot be had, they may, if in other respects suitable, be admitted as thin as five inches. All stones must be laid on their natural beds.\n\n50. Headers shall be built in the wall, from front and back alternately, at least one in every five feet in line of wall, and frequently in the rise of wall. In the smallest structures headers shall not be less than twenty-four inches in length, and the minimum bed allowed for stretchers shall be twelve inches. In the larger structures all stones must be heavier in proportion. Every attention must be paid to produce a perfect bond, and to give the whole a strong, neat, workmanlike finish.\n\n51. Wing walls will generally be finished with steps, formed of sound durable stone, and not less than from 10 to 12 inches thick, and 6 feet superficial area; other walls will be covered with coping of a similar thickness, and of seven feet or upwards, superficial area. These coverings will be neatly dressed when required, and as may be directed. The walls of the box culverts will be finished with stones the full thickness of wall, and the covers will be from 10 to 15 inches thick, according to the span; they must have a bearing of at least 12 inches on each wall, and they must be fitted sufficiently close together to prevent the earth from falling through.\n\n52. The bottoms of culverts will be paved with stones set on edge, to a moderately even face, packed solid, the interstices being also well packed. The paving will be from 9 to 12 inches deep.\n\n53. Mortar shall be of hydraulic lime or cement, and common lime.\n\n54. Hydraulic lime mortar will be used unless otherwise directed in building all masonry, from the foundations up to a line two feet above the ordinary level of the stream. It will be used also in laying girder beds, coping, covering of walls generally, in lipping and in pointing. The hydraulic lime or cement must be fresh ground, of the best brand, and it must be delivered on the ground, and kept till used in good order. Before being used, satisfactory proof must be afforded the Engineer its hydraulic properties, as no inferior cement will be allowed.\n\n55. Common lime mortar must be made of the best common lime and will be employed in all masonry (except dry) where cement is not directed to be used.\n\n56. Both cement and lime must be thoroughly incorporated with approved propor-\ntions of clean large-grained sharp sand. The general proportions may be one part of lime to two parts of sand, but this may be varied according to the quality of the lime or cement. Mortar will be only made as required, and it must be prepared and used under the immediate direction and to the satisfaction of an Inspector, by the Contractor's men, failing which the Inspector may employ other men to prepare the mortar, and any expense incurred thereby shall be borne by the Contractor. Grout shall be formed by adding a sufficient quantity of water to well tempered and well proportioned mortar.\n\n57. When mortar is used, every stone must be set in a full bed and beaten solid; Grouting. the vertical joints must be flushed up solid, and every course must be perfectly level and thoroughly grouted.\n\n58. In all walls built in common lime, the exposed faces will have a four-inch lip- Lipping. ping of cement.\n\n59.

The Contractor shall be responsible for all damages claimable by any person or corporation whatsoever, in respect of any injury to persons or to lands, buildings, ships or other property, or in respect of any infringement of any right whatsoever, occasioned by the performance of the said works, or by any neglect or misfeasance or non-misfeasance on part, and shall and will at own expense, make such temporary provisions as may be necessary for the protection of persons, or of lands, buildings, ships or other property, or for the uninterrupted enjoyment of all rights of persons or corporations, in and during the performance of the said works.\n\n20. If the Contractor fail at any time in paying the salaries or wages of any person employed by upon or in respect of the said works, or any of them, and any part of such salary be one month in arrear, or if there be due to any such person one month's wages or salary, the Engineer may notify the Contractor to pay such salary or wages, and if two days elapse and the same be not paid in full up to the date of payment or to such other date as may be in accordance with the terms of employment of such person, then Her Majesty may pay to such person salary or wages from any date to any date, and to any amount which may be payable, and may charge the same to the Contractor, and the Contractor covenant with Her Majesty to repay at once any and every sum so paid.\n\n21. The Contractor will protect and will not remove or destroy or permit to be removed or destroyed, the stakes, buoys and other marks placed on or about the said works by the Engineers of the works, and shall furnish the necessary assistance to correct or replace any stake or mark which through any cause may have been removed or destroyed.\n\n22. Any notice or other communication mentioned in this Contract to be notified or given to the Contractor shall be deemed to be well and sufficiently notified or given, if the same be left at the Contractor office, or mailed in any Post Office to the Contractor or foreman, addressed to the address mentioned in this Contract, or to the Contractor last known place of business.\n\n23. And Her Majesty, in consideration of the premises, hereby covenants with the Contractor, that subject to the terms of this contract, will be paid for and in respect of the works, and in the manner set out in the next clause hereof, the sum of\nsubject to the increase or decrease thereof according to the terms of the sixth clause hereof.\n\nExcept as provided in the sixth clause hereof, the Contractor shall have no claim for additional price or remuneration in respect of any materials or workmanship alleged to be of a quality or cost superior or greater than those required by the specifications.\n\nPayments.\n\n24. Cash payments equal to about ninety per cent. of the value of the work done approximately made up from returns of progress measurements and computed at the prices set out on the schedule hereto annexed, or fixed by the Engineer for work not specified in said schedule, will be made to the Contractor monthly on the written certificate of the Engineer that the work for or on account of which the certificate is granted, has been duly executed to his satisfaction, and stating the value of such work computed as above mentioned\u2014and upon approval of such certificate by the Minister, and the said certificate, and such approval thereof shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to be paid the same ninety per cent. or any part thereof. The remaining ten per cent. shall be retained until the final completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer and acceptance thereof by the Minister, and within two months after such completion and acceptance the remaining ten per cent. will be paid. And it is hereby declared that the written certificate of the Engineer certifying to the final completion of said works to his satisfaction shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or be paid the said remaining ten per cent., or any part thereof.\n\nMonthly estimates.\n\n25. It is intended that every allowance to which the Contractor fairly entitled, will be embraced in the Engineer's monthly certificates; but should the Contractor at any time have claims of any description which consider are not included in the progress certificates, it will be necessary for to make and repeat such claims in writing to the Engineer, within fourteen days after the date of each and every certificate in which allege such claims to have been omitted.\n\nClaims.\n\n26. The Contractor in presenting claims of the kind referred to in the last clause must accompany them with satisfactory evidence of their accuracy, and the reason why think they should be allowed. Unless such claims are thus made during the progress of the work, within fourteen days, as in the preceding clause, and repeated, in writing, every month, until finally adjusted or rejected, it must be clearly understood that they shall be forever shut out, and the Contractor shall have no claim on Her Majesty in respect thereof.\n27. The progress measurements and progress certificates are not to be taken as binding upon the Engineer or as final measurements, or as fixing final amounts, they are to be subject to the revision of the Engineer when making up his final certificate, and they shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or a release of the Contractor from responsibility in respect thereof.\n\n28. Her Majesty shall have the right to suspend operations from time to time at any particular point or points or upon the whole of the works, and in the event of such right being exercised so as to cause any delay to the Contractor, then an extension of time equal to such delay or detention, to be fixed by the Minister as above provided for, shall be allowed to complete the Contract, but no such delay shall vitiate or void this Contract or any part thereof or the obligation hereby imposed or any concurrent or other bond or security for the performance of this Contract, nor shall the Contractor be entitled to any claim for damages by reason of any such suspension of operations. And at any time after operations have been suspended either in whole or part\u2014such operations may be again resumed and again suspended and resumed as Her Majesty may think proper. And upon the Contractor receiving written notice on behalf of Her Majesty that the suspended operations are to be resumed, the Contractor shall at once resume the operations and diligently carry on the same.\n\nIf after a consideration of all the circumstances connected with the suspension and resumption of operations as above provided for, the Governor General in Council thinks proper to allow the Contractors a sum of money on account of any extra expenses to which they may have been put by reason thereof, the same shall be paid over to the Contractors only upon a receipt and release in full being given for all damages and claims in respect of such suspension and resumption of operations.\n\n29. Should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment for the work hereby contracted for, be at any time expended previous to the completion of the works, the Minister, for the time being, may give the Contractor written notice to that effect. And upon receiving such notice, the Contractor may, if he think fit, stop the work\u2014but in any case shall not be entitled to any payment for work done, beyond the amount voted and applicable as aforesaid\u2014unless and until the necessary funds shall have been voted by Parliament in that behalf. And in no event shall the Contractor have or make any claim upon Her Majesty for any damages or compensation by reason of the said suspension of payments, or by reason of any delay or loss caused by the stoppage of work.\n\n30. The Contractor shall not permit, allow or encourage the sale of any spirituous liquors on or near the works.\n\n31. No work whatever shall at any time or place be carried on during Sunday, and the Contractor shall take all necessary steps for preventing any foreman, or agent, or men from working or employing others on that day.\n32. It is hereby agreed that all matters of difference arising between the parties hereto, upon any matter connected with or arising out of this contract, the decision whereof is not hereby especially given to the Engineer, shall be referred to the award and arbitration of the Engineer, and the award of such Engineer shall be final and conclusive; and it is hereby declared that such award shall be a condition precedent to the right of the Contractor to receive or be paid any sum or sums on account, or by reason of such matters in difference.\n\n33. It is distinctly declared that no implied contract of any kind whatsoever, by or on behalf of Her Majesty, shall arise or be implied from anything in this contract contained, or from any position or situation of the parties at any time, it being clearly understood and agreed that the express contracts, covenants and agreements herein contained and made by Her Majesty, are and shall be the only contracts, covenants and agreements upon which any rights against Her are to be founded.\n\n34. This contract is hereby, pursuant to the provisions of the 8th section of the Statute, 41st Victoria (1878), chapter 5, made subject to the express condition that no Member of the House of Commons of Canada shall be admitted to any share or part of such contract, or to any benefit to arise therefrom.\n\n35. In the event of it becoming advisable in the interests of the public to suspend the work hereby contracted for, or any portion thereof, at any time before its completion, and to put an end to this contract, the Minister shall have full power to stop the work and to cancel this contract, on giving due notice to that effect to the Contractor. The Contractor, however, will be entitled to receive payment for all sums then due for work already done, materials used or delivered, or ready to be used, or in course of preparation, together with such reasonable compensation as will cover all bona fide damages, if any, resulting therefrom, and as may then be agreed upon; or, in case of disagreement, as may be determined by the Official Arbitrators of the Dominion of Canada; it being understood, however, that no compensation will be allowed to or claimed by the Contractor for materials procured for the works, after the date of the service of the notice above referred to, or for any loss of anticipated profits, either in respect of the works so suspended as aforesaid, or of the materials then procured for said works.\n\n36. It is distinctly declared and agreed that none of Her Majesty's Ministers, officers, engineers, agents or servants, have or shall have power or authority in any way whatever to waive on the part of Her Majesty any of the clauses or conditions of this contract, it being clearly understood that any change in the terms of this contract to be binding upon Her Majesty must be sanctioned by order of the Governor General in Council.\n\nIn Witness whereof, the Contractor has hereto set hand and seal and these presents have been signed and sealed by the said Minister, and countersigned by the Secretary of the Department of Railways and Canals, on behalf of the Contractor.\nbehalf of Her Majesty.\n\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered by\nthe Contractor in presence of\n\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered by\nthe Minister, and countersigned\nby the Secretary of Railways\nand Canals in the presence of\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/cihm_13610.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 34, "total-input-tokens": 56670, "total-output-tokens": 18159, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 1579, 3], [1579, 2685, 4], [2685, 5075, 5], [5075, 8108, 6], [8108, 11299, 7], [11299, 14473, 8], [14473, 17690, 9], [17690, 20679, 10], [20679, 23554, 11], [23554, 26597, 12], [26597, 29723, 13], [29723, 32724, 14], [32724, 35382, 15], [35382, 38249, 16], [38249, 40954, 17], [40954, 43985, 18], [43985, 46745, 19], [46745, 47575, 20], [47575, 48893, 21], [48893, 49505, 22], [49505, 51679, 23], [51679, 54499, 24], [54499, 57945, 25], [57945, 61226, 26], [61226, 64521, 27], [64521, 67598, 28], [67598, 70660, 29], [70660, 73363, 30], [73363, 76432, 31], [76432, 79580, 32], [79580, 79790, 33], [79790, 79790, 34]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "en", "None"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [true, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true]}}]
