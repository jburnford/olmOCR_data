Further to my letter of August 2nd 1937, re requirements for the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.K., the following are the most outstanding needs, namely a new lighting plant and a new bake oven, both of which are absolutely necessary, and which I would request should be given serious consideration, even although it would be necessary for the Department to curtail expenditure in some other direction.\n\n2. I paid a visit to the School on January 24th and 25th 1938, and the Principal brought to my attention the fact that with the old lighting plant now in use the electric light was costing an average of $87.06 per month, throughout the whole year.\n\n3. He also showed me a letter he had received from the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, the following being an abstract:\n\n\"The figures you give seem to me to indicate that the cost of operating the lighting plant at present is very much too high, and we may find it necessary to revert to the use of oil or gasoline lamps.\"\n\n4. A Lister Diesel Lighting Plant, Direct Current, 4 K.W.Unit, V belt driven at a cost of $355.00 F.O.B. Carcross is required. In addition the estimated cost of having this plant installed would not be much in excess of $100.00, and according to Hoffer's Ltd., Vancouver, who are agents for this type of plant, the cost of operating would be only about one sixth of that of the present Delco plant. For your information I would state that electric current is used at this School for lighting purposes only, the use of electrical appliances are forbidden.\n\n5. The Bake Oven now in use is practically useless resulting in many batches of poor bread being baked and all being more or less smoked.\n\n6. I would refer you to my previous report from which it will be seen that a suitable bake oven can be obtained from the Brantford Oven and Rack Co Ltd., Brantford Ont for the sum of $548.59.\n\n7. As these articles are absolutely necessary I would request that serious consideration be given to supplying them to this School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nG. Binning A/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\nMarch 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th ultimo you may purchase the following in order to refill the fire extinguishers:\n\n4 Gals. Sulphuric Acid\n50 Lbs. Bicarbonate of Soda\n\nPayment of the cost of the above, plus the freight, will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDawson, Y.

The money, however, will not be available until after April 1 and as soon after that date as regulations will permit an order will be placed for the lighting plant and bake oven.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDawson, Y. T.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant present regulations require our securing an Order-in-Council when making special payments to Church owned Residential Schools. I expect to secure in the near future the necessary Order-in-Council in connection with the equipment purchased for the Aklavik School. As soon as this is received payment of the grant promised will be made.\n\nI understand that all Provinces in Canada allow a rebate of the gasoline tax when the gasoline is used for other purposes than the operation of automobiles or trucks. I believe each of your Principals can secure this rebate by making application to the Government of the Province in which the Indian Residential School is located. However, it is not possible for us to secure any rebate for gasoline used in automobiles or trucks operated by Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. A.

C. M. Grant, Principal of our School at Carcross, Y. T., in\nwhich he writes as follows:\n\n\"During the course of a year this school uses approximately\n2,000 gallons of gasoline none of which is used in a car or truck.\nThis gasoline is purchased from Mr. Matthew Watson of Carcross\nwho imports it from Skagway, Alaska. I have made inquiries and\nbeg to report that the Yukon Territorial Government does not levy\nany tax on gasoline but that a Federal Tax is assessed as follows:\n\nDuty - 1\u00a2 per gallon.\nSales Tax - 5% of duty paid value\nExcise Tax 3\u00a2\n\nThe question of a rebate on the foregoing would no doubt have\nto be taken up with the Department at Ottawa so I will not take\nany action in the matter until I hear from you again.\"\n\nI beg therefore to enclose accounts for 2,000 gallons\ngasoline purchased during the year 1937, at a price of .55\u00a2 per\ngallon - $1,100.00, and to request that the Commission may be\nrefunded the sum of $132.00 as follows:\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant requesting rebate of duty, sales tax and excise tax on gasoline used by the Carcross Indian Residential School. As this Department is required to pay sales tax and excise tax on any goods that we purchase you will readily understand that it would not be possible to secure a refund of these taxes for a purchase made by the Principal of the Carcross School. From inquiries made I understand that it would not be possible to secure refund of the 1\u00a2 a gallon duty on gasoline. It appears from your letter that the gasoline used at Carcross is purchased at Skagway and brought into Canada.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\nThe Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nChootla Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon, Canada.\nMarch 1st, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue, East,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was a great pleasure to note from your letter of February 10th 1938 that the Department has authorized the purchase of a new lighting unit for our school and bear the expense of having all electric wiring placed in conduit pipe. The information concerning the undertakings which you request and which was forwarded by the Department through the Indian Agent some time ago is as follows:\n\nK.W. Lister full diesel cold starting V-belt driven lighting unit, 110 volt, direct current, battery charging generator. Engine and generator mounted on a substantial base and the unit complete with switchboard. In this plant would be required one cooling tank.\n\nThe above information was supplied to me by Hoffer's Ltd., 1790 Georgia Street, West, Vancouver, B.C. The cost of this unit is given as follows:\n\nK.W. Unit, f.o.b. our warehouse Vancouver.............$875.00\nFreight to Carcross, Y.T..........................$60.00\nTotal..............................................$935.00\n\nHoffer's Ltd., in their letter, dated January 26th, 1937, state as follows: \"Delivery approximately 3 weeks from receipt of order\". In view of this I would\nlike to place an order for this unit right away but feel that it would be advisable to wait until authority was received from Captain G. Binning, R.C.M.P., Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon, Dawson, Y.T. During the past few years in matters of this nature Captain Binning writes authorizing and instructing me to order any item of equipment the purchase of which has been approved by the Department he represents. It is likely that I will hear from him about this matter in the course of a few weeks.\n\n2. In connection with the placing of all wiring in this school in conduit pipe I may say that last summer I requested the Yukon Electrical Company Limited, Whitehorse, Yukon, to send their electrician over to the school so that they could let me have an estimate in regard to this matter. On July 26th they wrote me as follows:\n\n\"We beg to submit the following estimate for wiring the Chootla School:-\n\n78 Outlets complete, fitted with cord drops and snap wall switches. Wires to be run in Conduit Pipe and outlet boxes. Fuse Blocks to be in boxes located one on each floor, in accordance with plan submitted. Work to be done in compliance with Canadian Underwriters Code.\n\nPrice $974.00\n\nThis price applies only between April 1st and September 30th, during other months of the year owing to early darkness, there would be an additional charge of 15% on the above price.\"\n\nIn my letter to Captain G. Binning, R.C.M.P. dated November 2nd, 1937 I told him that I thought that the cost of having an electrician supervise the installation of a new lighting unit would be approximately $100.00 and that a considerable amount of the work of installation could be done by the male members of the staff. Such being the case then the total cost of all electrical work etc. during the next fiscal year can be summarized as follows:-\nOne 4 K.W. Lister Diesel Lighting Unit........................................... $875.00\nFreight charges on above......................................................... 80.00\nEstimated cost of Wiring the School.............................................. 974.00\nEstimated cost of Installation of Lighting Unit............................... 100.00\n\nTotal Estimated Cost................................................................. $2029.00\n\nTrusting that the particulars as given in this letter are what you require,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn keeping with the understanding reached at the time of my interview with you in Ottawa at the beginning of last month, about a lighting plant for our Carcross School, I wrote to the Principal of that institution for the information you desired, and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of his reply. It is my understanding that authority to purchase this item of equipment, and to have all the wiring placed in conduits, would be granted immediately after April 1st next, and I will be obliged if you will advise me if the order for the plant recommended by the Rev. Principal Grant will be placed by your Department, or if it is your desire that it be placed by our Commission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

Carcross, of $1,292.00, this being the lower, and more complete tender received.\n\nDr. McGill states in his memorandum of March 18th that new electric wiring throughout the building is required, and that the Principal of the School has obtained a quotation on same from the Yukon Electrical Co., Whitehorse, of $974.00. This wiring should be completed before the lighting plant equipment is installed. As specifications with requisition to arrange for this contract were not supplied this office, I would suggest that Indian Affairs Branch be authorized to take the necessary action to have this wiring completed locally at the earliest possible date, and when it is completed to submit vouchers to this office, to enable us to encumber same by Purchase Order.\n\nW.M.

This letter read in part as follows:\n\n\"In connection with the placing of all wiring in this school in conduit pipe I may say that last summer I requested the Yukon Electrical Company Limited, Whitehorse, Yukon, to send their electrician over to the school so that they could let me have an estimate in regard to this matter. On July 26th they wrote me as follows:\n\n\"We beg to submit the following estimate for wiring the Chooutla School:\n\n78 outlets complete, fitted with cord drops and snap wall switches.

Your letter of February 1 outlined the outstanding needs at the Carcross School and the information contained in your letter corresponded to requests that we had received from the officers of the M.S.C.C. under whose auspices this school is operated.\n\nNo mention was made of repairs that might be required at the Principal's residence. Consequently, when preparing our appropriation for the present fiscal year no amount was specifically provided for this purpose.\n\nAs you were informed in our telegram of the 14th instant the total amount provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Carcross School during the current fiscal year was $2500.00. Of this amount we have already authorized an expenditure of $2266.00 to cover the cost of the new lighting plant and wiring the school.\n\nThe present set up of our appropriation makes it practically impossible to authorize any expenditure for which funds have not been specifically provided. Therefore, we can only allow for repairs to the Principal's residence the unexpended balance of the appropriation or $234.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

In view of the fact that the\nbuilding is hardly safe for occupancy I requested Mr.\nJ.E. French, Builder and Contractor, of Whitehorse,\nYukon to look into conditions and advise what should be\ndone and what would be the cost of repairs. After a\ncareful examination he reported as follows:-\n\n1. That the foundation of the house is completely\nrotted away.\n\n2. The floor joists under the kitchen and possibly\nin other places would have to be renewed.\n\n3. In one and possibly two rooms new floors would\nhave to be laid.\n\n4. The cellar under the kitchen, the walls of which\nhave rotted away and caved in, requires concrete walls\nand floor.\n\nOwing to the fact that this building\nis built right on the ground Mr. French found it extremely\ndifficult to examine the foundations as fully as he\nwould have liked. It is possible that when repair work is started other matters besides those enumerated above will have to be attended to. The estimated cost of necessary repairs as submitted by Mr. J.E. French is $1,200.00. This would cover the cost of all materials and labour.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you would recommend to the Department that they authorize this work to be done as soon as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nThis letter is forwarded for your information and is further to my telegram of June 13th 1938, confirmation copy attached.\n\nWould state that I personally examined the Principal residence and it is in a deplorable condition, owing to the foundations having rotted away the floors are all sagging and owing to the walls of the cellar having caved in the floor of the kitchen is in a very dangerous condition.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your radiogram dated June 14th in which you state that the unexpended balance of the appropriation is only $34 dollars, and I have informed the Principal of this.

This house is in a deplorable condition and something should be done as soon as possible to make it more comfortable.\n\nAddition to present school building, as mentioned in my report last year, this school is too small for the number of pupils, there are quite a number of children who have to be refused admission owing to there being no accommodation for them. The question of an addition to the school has already been drawn to your attention and I understand that the Department have plans for this work at an estimated cost of $8,000.00. If it is not possible to go ahead with these plans perhaps consideration might be given to building a separate class room for the school and then the present class room could be turned into a dormitory.\n\nOne of the most pressing needs is a Diesel Caterpillar Tractor to be used for the hauling of cord wood. Since 1929 approximately 2,000 cords of wood have been cut in the vicinity of the school, this means that every year they have to go further afield to obtain the 250 cords required each year. Last year the team had to haul the wood 6 miles over mountainous trails and the most that could be hauled at a time was 11 cords, so that if a tractor was in use it would be possible to haul on the lake from a distance of 10 or 12 miles from the school and get it done in a comparatively short time, as it would be possible to haul 10 cords at a time. I am not able to give the price of a Tractor but doubtless you could obtain that easily.\n\nOne 2 Ton Ford Truck V8 Chassis with Cab, Dual wheel drive, 157 inch Wheel base 10 ply dual rear tires at a cost of $1,480.00 F.O.B. Carcross. The above price is quoted by the Northern Commercial Co. Whitehorse Y.T.\n\nIn the spring when the horses are being used for the preparing of the land for crop or are away from the school hauling hay, there is no means of hauling freight or getting back and forward to town and a Ford Truck would be extremely useful at the school.\n6. There are not sufficient beds in the school. In some cases two children have to sleep in the same bed. In view of this and the fact that some of the beds now in use are in poor state of repair, six new three-quarter size beds, springs and mattresses are urgently needed. The cost of six beds etc would be in the neighbourhood of $100.00 F.O.B. Carcross.\n\n7. One Windsor Bungalow Hot Water Supply Boiler No. 15G. This can be supplied by McLennan McFeely and Prior Ltd of Vancouver B.C. the cost would be $142.75 F.O.B. Carcross. The present hot water supply boiler is not large enough for the amount of hot water required.\n\n8. A building for storing Ice is required as during the last few years the raising of pigs has been undertaken at the School and found to be both profitable and successful. These efforts would be augmented if a suitable place for the curing of bacon was provided. At present the building used for storing ice is not suitable and the suggestion is made that this ice house be used for the curing of bacon and a new ice building erected. It is estimated that a suitable building could be erected for $600.00.\n\n9. A suitable floor covering is needed for the main hall of the school. This is fir flooring and if something is not done to preserve it a new floor will be required in the near future. To cover the main hall with Battleship Linoleum would be most suitable and give years of wear and the following is the data in this respect:\n   Brown Battleship Linoleum 60 squares yards, 6ft wide at $4.00 per square yard.\n   Heavy wall felt to place under linoleum, 2 rolls at $2.00 each\n   Freight charges from Vancouver to Carcross\n\nTotal $76.40\n\n10. One Ice Refrigerator for use in kitchen. This is a very urgent need for the staff find great difficulty in keeping milk, butter and meat during the hot summer months. The cost of this item would be approximately $50.00 F.O.B. Carcross.\n\n11. In order to keep the building in good repair the following paint is required:\n   2 gals. White Enamel at $4.25\n   4 Gals Dark Oak Varnish Stain at $4.00\n   Estimated Freight Charges\n\nTotal $28.35\n\n12. Painting the outside of the Main School building, wood work only. Two years ago the Department allowed a grant for the staining of the shingles on the outside of the buildings, and now it is necessary that the siding, window frames etc should be painted in the near future. The cost of having this done would be around $450.00 and would include all paint and oil required to give two coats of paint.\n\n13.

These invoices were forwarded to you through the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon at Dawson, Y.T.\n\nShortly after these certified invoices were mailed a certain matter was brought to my attention about which I feel you should be advised. According to your purchasing order No. 4598 - File No. 20418 - 15 - 16 - dated May 21st 1938 the Canadian General Electric Company Limited agreed to supply among other things a 5 H.P. Petters Diesel Engine. As you will see from their invoice a Lister Diesel Engine was supplied. I am not objecting to this substitution of a Lister in place of a Petters Engine but feel that you should be advised that whereas, according to their invoice, a copy of which you will find enclosed, they have charged your Department with a 5 H.P. Lister Diesel Engine and a 7 H.P. Engine has been installed.\n\nI am sending this letter to you direct instead of through your representative at Dawson so that this matter will be brought to your attention before payment is made to the Canadian General Electric Company.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M.

I am now in receipt of the enclosed account covering this installation and at that time this Branch received a letter from the Principal of the Carcross School a copy of which is enclosed. In view of the report of our Principal do you consider it would be in order to pay the account?\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe. Bake-oven Carcross Indian Residential School C. of E.\n\nThe Principal of our Society's School at Carcross in the Yukon has directed the attention of our Commission to the urgent need of a new bake-oven. In a letter written on August 30th last he refers to the information he had received from the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Yukon in March last to the effect that provision had been made in your estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 to supply this School with a new lighting plant and a new bake-oven. The lighting plant has already been supplied, but the Principal is much concerned over the condition of the bake oven now in use. He states that the kind required is as follows:-\n\n\"The Brantford No. 3 Homestead Oven - floor space 4' 10\" x 3' 10\" - $390.00 less 10% plus a Sales Tax of 5% $379.08 Freight Charges - Brantford, Ont. to Carcross, Yukon, including Terminal Charges and Cartage $169.51 Total cost F.O.B. Carcross, Y.T. $548.59\"\n\nAs the oven may be secured from the Brantford Oven and Rack Company Limited, Brantford, Ontario, it will be appreciated if an order can be\nplaced for this very necessary item of equipment in the immediate future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTRRW/KH\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the request of the Principal of the Carcross Residential School for a bake oven. For your information I enclose a copy of official letter of June 16 addressed to the Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon. This letter shows that we have already expended the full amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Carcross School.\n\nI note from your letter that the bake oven is very necessary and after careful investigation I find that there is a small balance remaining in our Vote which has not yet been assigned and I am, therefore, requesting the Purchasing Agent to secure the bake oven.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Grey:\n\nRe Lighting Plant,\nCarcross Indian Residential School\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, relative to the above, with copy of letter from the Principal and invoices attached, I have gone quite fully into the matter and find as follows:\n\nOriginal requisition specified a Lister engine. Canadian General Electric Company Limited quoted on a Petters engine, and order issued accordingly. The Company supplied a Lister engine, giving as the reason that after consultation with their engineers it was decided it would be better to supply the type of engine originally requisitioned for, a type more favourably known and more extensively used by Government Departments than the Petters.\n\nWith reference to the Principal's remark that a 7 H.P. engine had been installed, the Company points out that the engine supplied develops 7 H.P. at 1000 r.p.m., and 8 H.P. at 1200 r.p.m. This unit was worked out so that the engine would operate at 1200 r.p.m., and the governor was set accordingly.\n\nIt is understood that there is no difference in the cost of the unit supplied and Petters unit quoted on.\n\nIn view of the information and explanation furnished by the Company, I am of the opinion that the unit supplied will give satisfactory service and that the accounts, therefore, might be approved for payment.\n\nThe invoices are returned herewith.\n\nW.

Ltd.,\nGordon Belyea\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior,\nMarshall Wells Ltd.,\n\nNo quotations were received from the first four of the above-mentioned firms. McLennan, McFeely and Prior, stated that in order to quote they would need to know the loaf capacity, the baking area required, and the type of fuel used. Marshall Wells Ltd., quoted as follows:\n\n#2 Economy Bake Oven, manufactured in Canada\nCapacity approx. 16\u00bd sq. ft. baking surface, recommended 30 loaves 16 oz. bread.\n\nSize Outside height 50\", width 41\" depth 24\"\nShipping Weight about 300 lbs.\nPasses through an opening 27\" wide\nIllustration enclosed - - - - - $181.50\n\nWhile the above appears small in size and capacity, it is possible to secure \"Economy\" ovens in larger sizes.\n\nI also wrote the Brantford oven and Rock Company, Brantford, Ontario, requesting their price list and catalogue describing #3 Brantford Homestead Bake Oven. They gave the following data regarding same:\n\n3 deck oven\nBaking surface - 32 sq. ft.\nCapacity about 84 - 1 lb. loaves or 12 - 15 x 21 bun pans\nWeight - 3500 lbs.\nPrice f.o.b. cars Brantford, Ont.\nSales Tax not included - - - - - $410.00\nWould it not be as well to consider supplying a smaller and less expensive model of stove than the Brantford #3. I understand there are about 44 pupils enrolled at the Carcross Residential School.\n\nI would suggest that a copy of this memorandum with outs of the Economy and Brantford Bake Ovens be forwarded to Major D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C., instructing him to select a suitable Bake Oven from Marshall Wells Ltd., McLennan, McFeely and Prior Ltd., or any other approved firm, to arrange for shipment of same to:\n\nRev.

Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., advised the Department recently that the bake oven at the Carcross Indian Residential School, Carcross, Y.T., was practically useless and requested that a new bake oven be supplied. He stated that the kind required was as follows:\n\n\"The Brantford No. 3 Homestead Oven - floor space 4' 10\" x 3' 10\" - $390.00 less 10%\nplus a Sales Tax of 8% ...................... $379.08\nFreight charges - Brantford, Ont. to Carcross, Yukon, including terminal charges and cartage ....................... 169.51\nTotal cost f.o.b. Carcross, Y.T. .......... $548.59\n\nThe Purchasing Agent was requested to secure this and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his memorandum dated the 25th ultimo.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would carry out the instructions contained in the last part of this memorandum.\n\nWhile the No. 3 Brantford Homestead bake oven may be rather large at the same time I am inclined to feel that the No. 2 Economy bake oven would be a little small and I believe it would be advisable to secure, if possible, a bake oven of a size between the two mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

Addition to the present school building. This school is by no means large enough to accommodate the number of children who need our care and attention. At the present time I know of eight children in the Carcross district whose parents want them placed in this school. All these applications for admission and several others have had to be turned down on account of lack of accommodation. The question of an addition to the school has, I believe, been already drawn to the attention of the Department and no doubt they have the plans and specifications on file. These were submitted some years ago by two local builders and contractors. The estimated cost of the proposed addition has been given as $8,000.00.\n\nIf the building of this addition cannot be carried out in the near future it would be greatly appreciated if you would recommend that the Department pay us a per capita grant for 50 children instead of 40. During the winter 1937-38 we had 47 children in residence which meant that seven children have been without a per capita grant and consequently the question of financing has been very difficult. Our financial difficulties would be considerably lessened if we had 50 grant earning pupils for certain overhead expenses remain the same whether there are 50 or 40 pupils in residence. The problem of accommodating 50 pupils could be met by the erection of a detached classroom at an estimated cost of $2,500.00. The present classroom could be used as a dormitory.\n\n2. Without a doubt one of the most pressing needs is a Diesel Caterpillar to be used for hauling wood. The Northern Commercial Company of Whitehorse, Y.T. have submitted the following quotation etc. on this requested item of equipment:\n\nD2 Diesel Caterpillar Tractor, 50 inch gauge Model.\nTop seat.\n13\" Heat Treated Semi-Skeleton Shoes.\nSnow Sprockets\nFront Pull Hook\nFront Bumper\nHood Doors\nElectric Lighting System. F.O.B. Carcross $2,485.20\n\nThe Northern Commercial Company have assured the writer that the foregoing caterpillar has been built suitable for Northern Climates.\n\nSince my appointment to this school in 1930 approximately 2,000 cords of wood have been cut in the vicinity of the school. This means that each year we have to go further afield in order to obtain the 250 cords of wood required each year. The trouble with which we are faced now is not getting the wood cut but getting it hauled. Last winter our teams had to haul wood a distance of 6 miles over bad mountainous trails and the most that could be hauled in one load was a cord and a half. As the years go by the length of haul becomes greater and the time has arrived when it is practically impossible for the wood hauling to be done by a team of horses. In the past we have more or less avoided cutting wood along the shores of the lake in front of the school for two reasons. In the first place, hauling wood here with a team of horses any distance over a lake in winter is a hard and cold undertaking not only for the horses but also for the teamster and his helpers. We tried it one year with the result that the horses played out and it was all the teamsters contd:-\ncould do to face the cold and biting winds.\n\nIn the second place, we have avoided having wood cut along the lake shores because of the short time in which the ice is really safe. Some years there are only three months in the winter in which hauling on the ice can be safely undertaken. Making allowance for the number of days when the inclemency of the weather makes it impossible to send teams out on the lake, it is easily seen that a team hauling a cord and a half per trip per half day cannot get all the wood hauled before the break-up.\n\nThe wood situation here now may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) All areas within six or seven miles of the school from which wood can be hauled along sheltered roads from the wind, have been cut out. Wood might be obtained by going further inland but this would mean too long a haul for horses and the use of a caterpillar tractor on the mountainous trails in the woods should not be attempted.\n\n(b) There is practically an unlimited supply along the lake shores which for reasons given cannot be hauled by a team.\n\n(c) With a caterpillar tractor it would be possible to haul on the lake, wood from a distance of ten or twelve miles from the school and get it in in a comparatively short time. This method of hauling wood has been put to the test. On one occasion we were allowed the use of a caterpillar, the property of the Northern Airways Ltd., In one half day ten cords were hauled on the lake ice in one trip from a place about four miles from the school. Would you please inform the Department that this is a pressing need and recommend that authority be given to make this purchase as soon as possible.\n\n3. One 2 Ton Ford V8 Truck with cab. Dual wheel drive, 157 inch wheel base, 10 ply dual rear tires at a cost of $1,480.00 F.O.B. Carcross. This price was quoted last year by the Northern Commercial Company of Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nIn the spring of every year when the horses are needed to put in the crops and when the horses are away from the school putting up hay we have no means of conveyance by which freight can be brought over the road from Carcross station to the school. Several times already this year we have had to request the Northern Airways Ltd. of Carcross to put their conveyance at our disposal. Sometimes they are in the position to render us the necessary help at the time it is needed; other times they are forced to give their own work prior consideration. Such a state of affairs is most unsatisfactory and a 2 Ton Ford Truck would solve all our Transportation problems. Another aspect of the matter must be mentioned. This item of equipment was requested last year. In my letter to you of June 25th, 1937 I stated as follows:\n\n\"This spring difficulty was experienced in getting an injured child (broken bone in the chest) into Carcross. The roughness of a wagon trip and the length of time such a trip would take in addition to the fact that we only had a limited time in which to get the injured child to the station made the use of a wagon decidedly inadvisable.\"\n\nThe school possesses a launch but this can only be used for a very limited time each year, 3 months at the most.\n3 (Contd) Nearly every year, owing to low water, the school launch cannot be put into service much before the middle of July. If this launch can be operated by the middle or end of June we consider ourselves lucky. This is a great difficulty that has to be faced nearly every year and until the water reaches a navigable height we have to depend upon the road between the school and the town of Carcross. We trust that a realization of our need will prompt you to recommend that a truck be supplied at the earliest opportunity.\n\n4. One New Bake Oven. The present one has been in use for a good many years and besides blackening the bread with smoke and soot is liable at any time to become a fire menace. In this connection the following data concerning a new bake oven is respectfully submitted:\n\nThe Brantford No.3 New Homestead Oven - floor space required 4' 10\" x 3' 10\" - $390.00 less 10% plus a Sales Tax of 8%.................$379.08 Freight charges - Brantford, Ont. to Carcross including Terminal Charges...........169.51\n\nIt is sincerely hoped that the Department will supply this much needed item of equipment in the very near future.\n\n5. We have not by any means sufficient beds in the school. In many cases two children have to sleep in the same bed. In view of this and the fact that some of the beds now in use are in a poor state of repair six new - three-quarter size beds, springs and mattresses are urgently needed. The cost of six new beds etc. would be in the neighbourhood of $100.00 F.O.B. Carcross.\n\n6. One Windsor Bungalow and Hot Water Supply Boiler No.18 G. This can be supplied by McLennan, McFeely and Prior Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C. The cost of this item of equipment, according to a quotation received several months ago, was $142.70 F.O.B. Carcross. The present Hot Water Supply Boiler is by no means large enough to give us the amount of hot water required. In addition it is very difficult to use wood as fuel in a jacket heater designed for coal. The one now in use at the school was designed for coal as a fuel and consequently has a very small fire box. The Hot Water Supply Boiler No.18G requested has a fire box of much larger dimensions than the one now in use and consequently the use of wood as fuel will present no difficulties.\n\n7. Building for Storing Ice. During the last few years we have undertaken the raising of pigs and found it a very profitable and successful enterprise. Our efforts in this respect would be greatly augmented by having a suitable building for curing bacon. The present building used for storing ice is by no means suitable so the suggestion is made that this building be used for curing bacon and a new ice house be erected. It is felt that a suitable building could be erected at an estimated cost of $600.00. The storage of ice here is a great necessity for not only is it needed by the School Nurse in cases of accidents and sickness but to preserve milk, butter and meat during the hot summer months. The building that has been used for this purpose now does not give the ice the protection it requires.\n8. One New Waggon with steel wheels (wide tires) at an estimated cost of $85.07 F.O.B. Carcross. This item of equipment was requested last year but not supplied. Our need for a new waggon is as great as it was a year ago.\n\n9. A suitable floor covering is needed for the main hall of the school. This floor space receives more wear than any other part of the building and it is likely, owing to the present state of the fir flooring, that if some covering is not provided in the near future, a new wooden floor will have to be laid. The cost of lumber in the Yukon would make this a rather expensive undertaking. To cover the Main Hall with Brown Battleship Linoleum would be most suitable and give many years of wear. Data in respect to the foregoing is as follows:\n\nBrown Battleship Linoleum, 60 square yards. (6' wide)\n@ 94\u00a2 sq.yd...........$ 56.40\n\nHeavy Wall Felt to place under Linoleum - 2 rolls @ $5.00...........10.00\n\nEstimated freight Charges from Vancouver.......12.00\n\nTotal..............$78.40\n\n10. In order to keep the building in good repair and in order to give what beds we have two coats of White Enamel it would be appreciated if the Department would supply the following:\n\n2 gallons - White Enamel @ $4.25..................$ 8.50\n\n4 gallons - Dark Oak Varnish Stain @ $4.00........16.00\n\nEstimated freight charges........................3.85\n\nTotal..............$28.35\n\n11. One Ice Refrigerator for use in the Kitchen. This is a very urgent need for great difficulty is experienced by the Kitchen Staff in keeping milk, butter and meat during the hot summer months. The cost of this item of equipment would be approximately $50.00 F.O.B. Carcross.\n\n12. Painting the outside of the Main School Building (Wood Work only). Two or three years ago your Department allowed a grant to cover the cost of staining the shingles on the outside of the buildings and it is felt that the siding, window frames, etc. should be painted in the near future. The cost of having this done would be in the neighbourhood of $450.00 and would include the cost of paint and oil necessary and the painting of the outbuildings as well, all, with two coats of paint.\n\n13. Repairs to the Principal's Residence, the amount of $234.00 allowed by the Department out of the last appropriation has been expended for lumber, and this lumber is now at the school. All that is now needed is a further grant of $966.00 to cover the cost of cement, labour and any other material that might be required. It became necessary last fall to put a few joists under the kitchen floor to prevent it from dropping into the cellar. As it was hoped that these temporary repairs would last for a year or two this need for repairs to the Principal's residence was not included in the list of repairs etc., the Department have already been asked to make provision for during the fiscal year commencing April 1st, 1939. I regret to state that even though the temporary repairs are holding up the kitchen floor, not only is the foundation going in other parts of the building but the kitchen floor itself is rotting away. Tin patches have had to be put over the holes in different places and the building is in a dangerous condition.\n\n(Cont'd)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 6)\n13. (Contd) In view of this would you please ask the Department to make a further grant of $966.00 so that this work can be commenced as soon as possible. The rapidity with which the foundations and floors are rotting away points to the possibility that this building, if repair work is not done, may be unfit for habitation in a few months time.\nDawson, Y.T.

I was in the building. According to the Fire Drill, I had to see all the boys outside. This I did. I then went up into the attic and took the fire extinguisher from Perfitt and tried to extinguish the fire. Mr. Grant arrived a few minutes later and he saw it was impossible to cope with the fire. I then assisted saving the effects and preventing the spread of the fire.\n\n(SGD) Guy Titley.\nCarcross, Y.T.,\n19th April, 1939.\n\nArthur Perfitt,\nNight Watchman at the Carcross Indian Residential School,\nstates:-\n\n1. At about 12.00 noon on 17th instant I was in the staff dining room when one of the boys pointed out a small blaze a few feet from the building in the kindling pile. I went outside and then saw smoke pouring from the roof of the building and sparks flying. I immediately rang the fire alarm, called to the staff, got a fire extinguisher and ran up to the attic. This was full of smoke. I could not see where the fire was but turned the extinguisher in its general direction. Then Mr. Oke and Titley arrived and I got the hose from Mr. Oke and turned it on. There was a good head of water. Then I was overcome with smoke and Mr. Oke took the hose and Mr. Titley the fire extinguisher. Then I went downstairs to see all the children outside. One of the bigger boys, Charlie Edwards, took an axe and I took an extinguisher and we went up the permanent ladder to the roof. I tore off the tin capping in several places and tried the extinguisher but after a few minutes the roof was too hot and we had to come down. I then assisted saving the effects and extinguishing the fire in the wood pile.\n\n(Signed) Arthur Perfitt.\nCarcross, Y.T.,\n19th April, 1939.\n\nCharles Arthur Oke,\nEngineer & Electrician,\nCarcross Indian Residential School,\nstates:\n\n1. At about 10.15 a.m. on 17th instant I was in the kitchen when I noticed the stove pipes were red hot in places. I went outside and the main chimney was smoking badly. I opened the flue box in the bottom of the chimney and saw red hot ashes dropping down. I notified Mr. Grant and cleaned out the ashes, the pipes were cooling. We watched them until about 10.30. I went up into the attic and inspected the stove's main chimney which was cool. The smoke from the big chimney had stopped.\n\n2. At about twelve noon I heard the fire alarm and went up to the attic and found it full of smoke. Mr. Perfltt came up with a fire extinguisher and asked me to get the hose. I got it for him and I went to see if the pump was still running and came back to the attic and took the hose. Mr. Grant came up and shortly afterwards we saw the fire was gaining. We took the hose into the dormitory. Then we started to save the bedding.\n\n3. I think the fire started in the main chimney but how I do not know.\n\n(SGD) Charles A. Oke.\n4. (cont'd) been a faulty chimney in the attic and the flames came through them and ignited the roof.\n\n5. The chimneys are inspected monthly but the main chimney is enclosed in brick. This is where the fire started, I think.\n\n6. No person was injured, nor any stock.\n\n7. Fire Drill is held every week, and the Staff and children all obeyed the rules perfectly. To this I attribute that there was no loss of life. These Rules were typed out and hung in several places in the building.\n\n(SGD) H.M.C. Grant.\nHugh Charles Munroe Grant,\nPrincipal Carcross Indian Residential School,\nstates:\n\n1. At about 10 a.m. on the 17th instant the engineer, Mr. C.A. Oke reported to me that the stove pipes and chimney in the school kitchen were on fire. The stove pipes were extinguished and Oke went up into the attic, on my instructions, and reported that the chimney was cool and no sign of fire.\n\n2. At about 12.30 noon the same day the teacher, Miss Hall, phoned me at my home that the school was on fire. I went across about 200 yards, and saw smoke coming out of the roof. All the children were outside, and I immediately checked the number to see that all were safe. I then entered the building, and found Mr. Oke up on the top floor endeavouring to extinguish the fire with a hose. There was a good head of water. Mr. Perfitt, the night watchman was on the roof with a fire extinguisher. I phoned Carcross Village asking for assistance and in a few minutes all the inhabitants arrived to assist. Shortly afterwards it was apparent that the school building could not be saved. A heavy wind assisted the fire. I gave orders to have all the effects possible saved. I ordered the children to stay back except a few of the older boys. The ice house and the workshop, which were adjacent, caught fire, and efforts to save them were fruitless. The chicken house and 500 cords of wood were within 50 yards of the school and commenced to smoulder but we were able to extinguish these fires and save them.\n\n3. All the bedding and the food supplies were saved. The Lister Light Engine was unbolted and an effort made to drag it from the building, but without success.\n\n4. I am of the opinion that there must have\n4. (cont'd) been a faulty chimney in the attic and the flames came through them and ignited the roof.\n\n5. The chimneys are inspected monthly but the main chimney is enclosed in brick. This is where the fire started, I think.\n\n6. No person was injured, nor any stock.\n\n7. Fire Drill is held every week, and the Staff and children all obeyed the rules perfectly. To this I attribute that there was no loss of life.

Grant.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Fire - Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to make the following report.\n\n1. On the evening of 17th instant I received a wire from Mr. Grant, Principal of the above school, that it and a workshop had been completely destroyed by fire that day.\n\n2. On 18th instant I went to Carcross and made a thorough investigation, taking statements (attached) from those immediately concerned.\n\n3. I am of the opinion that the fire started in the main chimney; creosote had evidently collected and became ignited when there was a small fire in the kitchen stove pipes. This smouldered for awhile and then penetrated into the attic and started burning in the roof.\n\n4. I attach no blame to anyone and consider that Mr. Grant and the Staff behaved very well. There was no loss of life or injury and a great deal of bedding, food supplies, etc., were saved.\n\n5. There was a heavy wind at the time and only the assistance from the inhabitants of Carcross saved the other buildings and the wood supply, which became ignited from sparks.\n\n6. Separate report is being submitted regarding present accommodation of Staff and children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T.V.Sandys-Wunsch], Supt.,\nComdg.

At the time the school was destroyed by fire, there were 44 children in residence. These were temporarily accommodated in the White Pass Section House and the English Church Rectory.\n\n2. As the White Pass Company need this Section House on the 1st of May, I arranged with Mr. Mathew Watson, Carcross, to rent three buildings for a total of $75.00 a month.\n\n3. Ten of the children reside in Carcross. These were sent back to their homes where they will sleep, but they will attend school and eat with the other children.\n\n4. The present situation, therefore, is that the Staff and 34 children are living in three rented houses and the Rectory. I am of the opinion that these quarters are quite suitable for a lengthy period but would ask that the articles enumerated on attached schedule be purchased by the Department and forwarded as soon as possible. I gave the Principal authority to buy locally any necessary kitchen utensils, dishes, etc.\n\n5. I made arrangements for an estimate to be submitted to repair a root house where the vegetables grown this year can be stored. This estimate will be wired you on receipt.\n\n6. May my actions regarding the rental of these buildings, etc. be approved.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T.V.Sandys-Wunsch], Supt.,\nComdg.

In Mr. Rogers' opinion Carcross is the most suitable location for an Indian residential school. He stated that the site of the school is as good as can be secured anywhere in the Yukon Territory.\n\n2. Carcross is located approximately 67 miles from Skagway and approximately 500 miles from Dawson.\n\n3. Mr. Rogers stated that there were no buildings of fireproof construction in the Yukon Territory.\n\n4. He also stated that all lumber used by the railway is brought from Vancouver.\n\n5. He suggested that it might be worth while considering the construction of a log building as he considered this type of building most suitable for the Yukon. He further advised that in his opinion the logs could be secured at a reasonable distance from the site of the Carcross school.\n\n6. He further stated that Mr. L. Higgins, who has been one of the Government officials in the Yukon for several years, would be a responsible party to consult regarding the re-erection of the school.\n\n7. He mentioned that two reputable builders in the Yukon are Mr. Dan Gillis of Whitehorse and Mr. J.E. French of Carcross.\n8. Mr. Rogers stated that the Whitehorse and Yukon railway would be willing to co-operate with the Department in any way either in the erection of a new building or in assisting in the housing of the children until a new building is constructed. As a matter of fact the Company has a large section house at Carcross (this is mentioned in letter of April 21 from Superintendent T.V. Sandys-Wunsch). The Company uses this building almost continuously from the latter part of May to the first of September. If necessary they might be prepared to place it at our disposal during the winter.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWhy is Feb 2nd invalid where Sandys resides?\nDear Mrs. Black:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 24, in which you ask me to keep you informed with respect to the provision made by the Government from time to time for the accommodation of the 44 pupils enrolled at the Carcross Residential School prior to the destruction of the building by fire.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from T.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:-\n\nWith further reference to my telegrams of April 18th and 21st, re the burning of the Carcross School, and your reply to the former on April 21st, No. 166-1-5, I beg to state that I have just received the following further information in this connexion in a letter from the Principal, dated Carcross, April 24th:-\n\n\"While it is my intention to put in later a full report on the fire (there is no time to prepare such a report now for the mail closes shortly) certain points in connection with articles saved from the burning buildings will no doubt be of the greatest interest to you. These are as follows:-\n\n1. All mattresses and bedding from the Girl's Dormitory and nearly all from the Boy's Dormitory was saved. In the latter Dormitory fire drove us out before all mattresses and bedding could be saved. No complaint of any shortage of bedding has been made to me so I presume none exists.\n\n2. All the girls' leather boots which had just been received were saved. The boys were burnt.\n\n3. Practically all sewing room supplies were saved.\"\n4. Quite a few drugs were taken out of the building.\n\n5. I am practically sure that the school has enough food supplies to last until the end of this quarter. Later I will send you a complete list of food supplies saved. To give you some idea of the amount saved I may say that an inventory taken the day after the fire revealed the fact that we had on hand 52 - 100 lb. sacks of flour.\n\n6. Practically all the desks were taken from the classroom to a place of safety and are now in use.\n\n7. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon authorized me to order through Matthew Watson any dishes, etc., that might be needed. At the present time we are using crockery loaned by the White Pass and Yukon Railway. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs is attending to the matter of bunks, washing machines, etc.\n\nIn closing may I say that even though the main school building is burnt and the Workshop, the school still goes on. The staff are to be commended upon the way in which they met a difficult situation. As I stated in my wire the classroom was in session 24 hours after the fire started, the children losing only \u00bd day schooling. The children are comfortably housed in different buildings in Carcross which have been rented from Mr. Matthew Watson by the Department of Indian Affairs. They are being well fed, and there is no immediate shortage of clothing. With the exception of a few children whose homes are in Carcross there has been no need to send any children home and it is planned to provide board and lodging for the few that are at home so that in a few days all children will be under our care. Right after the fire ten or twelve of the Carcross children were sent home. It was only a matter of a day or so before we had to take back eight because their parents could not provide for them. This certainly shows the need of a school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) H.C.M. Grant.\n\nPrincipal.\nAs the Rev. L.A. Dixon, M.A., O.B.E., Field Secretary of our Society, will discuss with you all matters relating to the building of a new school, I need not refer further to this important matter here.\n\nIn my telegram on April 21st, I stated that I expected to be in Ottawa on the 6th inst. I now regret to say that I have been obliged to alter my plans and consequently will not be there at that time.\n\nWhen I receive the full report on the fire which Mr. Grant has promised to send, I will furnish you with a copy. In the meantime I think it would be a comfort to you, as it certainly is to me and to our Commission, to know that our respective representatives in that remote part of Canada acted so promptly in making some arrangements for the maintenance of the school work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nOttawa,\nMay 9, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing additional information received from the Principal of the Carcross residential school regarding the fire.\n\nA letter received here from the Superintendent of the R.C.M.P. for the Yukon stated that the following equipment was required to replace that lost in the fire:\n\n- 2 H and P washing machines\n- 4 Steel bath tubs\n- 6 Wash tubs\n- 2 Wash boilers\n- 22 Double deck steel bunks\n- 6 Washboards\n- 6 Coleman gasoline lamps\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay, Vancouver, B.

Oke, who has held the position of Engineer here since August 1926, came to my residence and reported that the stove pipes in the school kitchen and the chimney were on fire. This news was not regarded as being of serious import for on an average of once a year during the last eight years the same thing had happened with no damage by fire to the building. However, to be on the safe side, I went up to the School immediately and found that whilst the stove pipes in the kitchen had burnt out a deposit of creosote in the chimney was on fire. It was felt that as in the past the chimney would give all the protection necessary. The chimney itself was constructed of brick and in the centre was a heavy steel casing through which the smoke passed. This steel casing was put in some years ago after a fire broke out in the attic the cause believed to be due to a faulty chimney. Between the outside of the steel casing and the bricks there was an air space. It is hard to understand why a flue lining was not put into this chimney when the school was built. Such a lining would have been a safeguard to the building in the event of the chimney settling. It seems almost certain that in the course of years the chimney settled with the exception of that part which protrudes above the roof. This part would be held up by the flashings and so there would naturally be a crack or opening in the bricks where the chimney came into contact with the roof. The writer had examined the chimney on several occasions but it is just possible that a crack could be hidden by woodwork. It was felt that even if there was a crack the steel casing would provide all the safety necessary. I am positive that if proper flue lining, the usual non-metallic kind used in chimneys, had been installed when the school was built, the fire of fifteen years ago and the recent ones would never have occurred. The steel casing was the next best thing but through the several joints, six in number, creosote could quite easily leak into the space between the outside of the steel casing and the bricks. At the joints in the steel casing the various lengths were merely butted together and there was no overlapping as it is felt there should have been. I am inclined to think that the matter of a flue lining should be taken up with the Department for it is hard to understand how such an important item could have been left out of the specifications.\n\nAs a precautionary measure I asked Mr. Oke if he had been up to the attic to see if everything was alright. He said, \"No\". Instructions were then given for him to do so and after awhile he came back and reported that there was no sign of fire and that, on feeling right round the chimney where it came into contact with the roof, it was found to be just warm. By this time it was about 10:30 a.m. At eleven o'clock Mr. Oke and I inspected the chimney again and to all appearances the fire seemed to have burnt itself out.\n\nAs there seemed to be no need for me to stay around the school any longer I gave Mr. Oke a small job to do and went back to my residence. Mr. Oke accompanied me in order to get some tools and electrical fitting he needed and which I had in my own work shop. As Mr. Oke was leaving to go back to the school at about 11:30 a.m. I said to him, \"Whatever you do watch that chimney. To be on the safe side it is advisable for you to keep an eye on it all day.\"\n\nAt about 12:30 p.m. Miss A.E. Hall telephoned me to say that the school was on fire. On my way up to the school I noticed three things:- (1) That the children were lined up outside the building. (2) That the water pump was in operation. (3) That smoke was coming from almost every portion of the roof. Judging from the smoke it was felt then that the building was doomed. After ascertaining that all the children were in a place of safety I went into the school and up to the top floor. It was found impossible to get up\ninto the attic on account of the dense smoke. Mr. Perfitt, Mr. Oke and Mr. Titley had, prior to my arrival, succeeded in getting into the attic but could not see anything in the way of fire nor stay there for more than a minute or two because of the smoke. To fight the fire in the attic was a physical impossibility especially when I arrived. The only place it could be fought was by directing a stream of water from the floor below up through the trap-door which led into the attic. This was the way a similar fire was extinguished some fifteen years ago. It was right here though that all our efforts were doomed to failure.\n\nFor some reason or other after the fire of approximately 15 years ago, someone built in the attic of the school a room with walls and ceiling. In this room was the water tank which supplied the school. The only opening into the main attic was through this room. As one stood on the floor below and looked up through the trap-door all that could be seen was the ceiling of this room. This was the barrier which prevented us from seeing the chimney rafters of the roof and from directing any stream of water or chemicals where it was needed. In discussing this fire with Mr. Matthew Watson who helped extinguish the one of about fifteen years ago he said that this room was not there when they fought the previous fire and that it was undoubtedly the presence of this room which prevented anyone from putting out the fire which ultimately destroyed the school. Why this room was built no one seems to know, naturally thought that it was part of the original building but apparently not. I feel sure that since its erection no principal or male member of the staff ever thought it would be a menace. Three things we have learned from this fire: (1) that brick chimneys such as the one put up in the school are not safe; (2) that the brick work should be inspected periodically by someone competent to do so. It seems strange that most chimneys should be encased from almost the top to the bottom with a combination of woodwork, lath and plaster, the woodwork coming into close contact with the bricks. Such an arrangement makes periodic inspection of the bricks and the chimney an impossibility without tearing down part of the building; (3) that wherever a brick chimney goes into an attic there should be two trap doors at least in the ceiling through which, when open, one can have an unrestricted view of both sides of the chimney where it goes through the roof. This I consider is of the greatest importance.\n\nNow as to the cause of the fire. It could not have been electrical for the school building was rewired last summer, all the wires being placed in conduit. There were absolutely no exposed wires in the attic and each circuit in the building was guarded by fuses of the correct amperage. It was not likely caused by a spark from the chimney because the roof was of corrugated galvanized iron and any sparks or burning embers coming from the chimney in the morning would have been carried clear of the building by the fairly strong wind that was blowing. There is no question but that the fire started in the attic.\n\nAfter the building was burnt to the ground the chimney, which was still standing, was examined as closely as possible. There were several openings in the brick and these it was found were places where ventilators entered the chimney. Apparently this chimney was used as a ventilating shaft as well as for a chimney. One theory advanced as to the cause of the fire was that creosote, having seeped through the butt joints in the steel casing, ran into the ventilators and caught on fire. As these shafts were not insulated from the woodwork a fire could easily be caused in this way.\n\nAfter the Superintendent of the Indian Affairs for the Yukon had made his inspection he gave us orders to have the chimney brought down. This we did with the use of dynamite. On examining the steel casing it was noticed that on the outside were marks of burnt creosote. Evidently creosote had seeped through the joints of this casing and had ignited when the chimney caught on fire.\nAs there was an air space between the round steel casing and the bricks of the chimney quite a fire could burn in there without our knowledge. The fire either broke into the building through the ventilating shafts or through a crack in the bricks where the chimney went through the roof. I am inclined to the latter theory because when the fire of fifteen years ago started there was no steel casing. This pointed to the fact that the brickwork of the chimney was faulty. As far as I can remember only one ventilating shaft went into the chimney in the attic and that did not come into contact with wood until it reached the ceiling of the floor below. I am fairly certain that the fire started where the chimney went through the roof.\n\nWhen it was found that the fire could not be fought through the trap door Mr. A. Perfitt and one of the senior boys went up on the roof with fire extinguishers. Mr. Perfitt, who had only just been relieved of the duties of Night Watchman, tore part of the galvanized roofing off and did his best to extinguish the blaze. He stayed on the roof until the metal sheeting was too hot to stand on. By that time the fire had such a hold that only thing to do was to save as much of the contents of the building as possible. To give you some idea of the rapidity with which the fire spread I may say that shortly after my arrival at the scene I telephoned to Carcross Village for assistance. Some of the employees of the Northern Airways Ltd. came over in a car at once but by the time they reached the school, situated only 1\u00bd miles from town, the fire was out of control.\n\nA great and magnificent work was done by the residents of Carcross. Nearly every able bodied man who could leave his post came to our assistance. You can form some conception of their work from the attached lists of food supplies and articles saved. The work of removing the contents of the school building and the workshop went on until it was not safe to be in either building. I would like to make special mention of the work of Mr. A. Perfitt. He certainly deserves great credit not only for the efforts he made to put out the fire but for the way in which he worked afterwards. The energy he displayed and the cool-headed way in which he acted was an inspiration to us all. It was not a question of someone working for a salary for two days previous to the fire he ceased to be Night Watchman and was staying on for three days more or less as a guest of the school. The staff who were saved or had saved most of their belongings but apparently Mr. Perfitt gave his not a thought. He was more concerned with saving the goods of others. His greatest loss was an Arctic Sleeping Robe or Bed worth approximately $60.00. I wish something could be done to reimburse him for his loss. He certainly deserves it.\n\nIn about two hours the school and workshop were nothing more than a mass of ruins. The question then arose as to what should be done to provide accommodation for the children and staff. Mr. Matthew Watson offered the use of any empty houses he had in the village and the White Pass and Yukon Railway placed at our disposal the Section House in Carcross. It was finally decided to use the Section House as a cook house and dining hall, the Rectory for a Girl's Residence with Miss Hall and Miss Shepherd in charge and the largest of Mr. Watson's Houses as a Boys' Dormitory with Mrs. Butler and Miss Moulton in charge.\n\nAs soon as this plan was decided on all the bedding (it was practically all saved) food supplies, children and staff were loaded on three sleighs and towed over to Carcross on the ice in one trip by a caterpillar belonging to the Northern Airways Ltd. The sleds were deposited at the section house and the children taken to their place of abode. As soon as they were more or less settled Miss Moulton was instructed to proceed over to the Section House and get supper. Great was her surprise to find that the Section Foreman, Mr. J. McMurphy and his crew had not only set the tables but had supper all ready for the children and staff. Mrs. McMurphy\nsent over to our new dining hall enough milk made out of Klim to supply all needs that evening and I believe the next morning. I cannot speak too highly of the assistance rendered by Mr. and Mrs. J. McMurphy of Carcross. It is really wonderful to think that in spite of what had happened the children and staff never missed a meal.\n\nAfter supper, Mr. George Simmone, President of the Northern Airways Ltd., placed at our disposal his caterpillar and its driver to help get under cover food supplies and other articles which had been saved and which might spoil if left outside during the night. Besides the caterpillar driver many willing hands helped us until darkness intervened. When forced to stop nothing remained outside which should have been under cover.\n\nAs you can imagine there was no sleep for some of us that night. Besides the crumbling ruins to watch there were many things to think of. In the hours of darkness it occurred to me that the only way to meet this catastrophe was to make an effort to carry on as if nothing had happened. As far as the children were concerned they had to be kept occupied and as far as the future was concerned it was felt that our chances of having the school rebuilt were strengthened greatly if we could show the Department's representative and others that even though the school may be burnt Chootla Indian Residential School still goes on.\n\nIt was with these two ends in view that at daybreak Messrs. Oke, Tittley and myself loaded on to the wagon (Mr. Perfitt also gave valuable assistance) the school desks, scribblers etc., which were saved from the conflagration. These were taken over to Carcross and placed in a house which Mr. Matthew Watson had kindly placed at our disposal and which we decided to use as a classroom. It took most of the morning to get things arranged but here again we were fortunate in having the services of the White Pass Section Crew which the Station Agent, Mr. J. Bowie, placed at our disposal. By noon the classroom reopened, twenty four hours after the fire started. Great credit is due Miss Hall for carrying on in the classroom so soon after a nerve wracking experience and with so little equipment.\n\nIf any question arises as to the need of a residential school in this part of Canada I think that this incident should convince the most skeptical. In order to cut down the amount of sleeping accommodation required all those children who had homes in Carcross were allowed to go to their parents. About 10 or 12 pupils were dealt with in this way. It was only a matter of about two days before it was necessary to take 6 back. This I was requested to do by those responsible for them. The plan was that they had not the wherewithal to provide for these children.\n\nThe day after the fire Bishop Geddes and Indian Agent Major Sandys-Wunsch, R.C.M.P., arrived in Carcross. In dealing with the situation Major Sandys-Wunsch acted as follows:\n\n1. Tried to rent for an indefinite period the White Pass and Yukon Railway Section House. This he was unable to do.\n\n2. Made arrangements with Mr. Matthew Watson for the rental, by the Department of certain houses in Carcross some of which we were then occupying. I may say here that Mr. Matthew Watson offered to let the school have the use of these buildings rent free but to this arrangement the Indian Agent would not agree.\n\n3. Stated that he would get Mr. J.E. French, Builder and Contractor at Whitehorse to come to Carcross and do any carpentry work necessary. One of the jobs he is to do is to cover over the basement of the Workshop so that it can be used as a place to store vegetables during next winter. Mr. French at present is making table tops, trestles, benches, etc. In connection with these I may say that in a few days...\ntime we will have to move out of the W.P. and Y.R. Section House. The Railway company will need the use of this building for their employees about May 6th. Our Kitchen and Dining Hall will then be located in one of Mr. Matthew Watson's largest houses. Into this place has already been put a good size range loaned to us by the White Pass and Yukon Railway, the table tops, trestles and benches which Mr. French has made. This building will make an admirable Kitchen and Dining Room.\n\n4. Major Sandys-Wunsch authorized me to purchase such items as kitchen utensils, dishes, etc., from the local store. These are being charged to the Department of Indian Affairs. The order for these things was placed and the goods have arrived with the exception of dishes for the children. These are expected to arrive in a day or so. In the meantime the White Pass and Yukon Railway have loaned us what is needed.\n\n5. Statements were taken by the Indian Agent from all the men agents on the staff and also from Mr. A. Perfit. These were taken down in writing by Major Sandys-Wunsch and signed by the person concerned. These statements were mainly in connection with the cause of the fire and steps taken to extinguish same. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon (Mr. Bennett) kindly allowed Bishop Geddes and myself to read the several statements and there was no disagreement nor was anyone incriminated. Before leaving Carcross Major Sandys-Wunsch also let me read a telegram he was sending to the Commissioner, R.C.M.P., asking him to inform the minister that a full investigation had been conducted and that the cause of the fire was accidental.\n\n6. The Indian Agent before leaving, asked me to wire him as soon as possible regarding certain needs which were discussed during his visit. My telegram to him reads as follows:\n\n\"Kindly request Department to supply soon two H and P washing machines four steel bath tubs six only wash tubs two only wash boilers twenty two double deck bunks six wash boards and six Coleman gasoline lamps at total estimated cost of seven hundred dollars stop kindly ask Department of Public Printing and Stationery to supply soon following school supplies five only Friend's Primer five only Primer's School book nine only Grade two Readers seven only Grade three Readers one large box letter tickets one large box number tickets twelve Composition work books for Grade four eight senior nature and language work books and twelve only boxes ink powder.\"\n\nApparently the Indian Agent is writing by Air Mail from Dawson to Ottawa regarding these matters. In this telegram is mentioned Double Deck Bunks. These will be admirable when one considers the limited amount of floor space in the buildings now occupied. I may say that at the present time we have the use of a limited number of double deck bunks and springs loaned to the school by the White Pass and Yukon Railway.\n\n7. The Indian Agent spoke of a possible change of site for the school should the Department decide to rebuild. Ten Mile was mentioned as being most suitable. There would be many advantages in connection with such a move the chief ones being the nearness to an abundant supply of hay and the ease with which wood could be procured. It is said that the soil, from an agriculture point of view, is far better at Ten Mile than it is here. There are of course certain disadvantages so that matters would have to be gone into very carefully before any definite decision to move is made. Two disadvantages might be mentioned here:- (1) The difficulty in getting a doctor when one was needed. In the Spring and Fall of the year, communication between Carcross and Ten Mile is very difficult. (2) It would not be so costly to rebuild on the old site as it would be at Ten Mile. Here we have most of the outbuildings, the sewerage system and the excavation. It is possible that a building could be erected on the\nold foundation. Whether the Department decides to build on the old site or move to another what is needed is a modern fireproof structure, or several smaller buildings (see next paragraph) with accommodation for at least 80 pupils.\n\nIn approaching the question of rebuilding I feel that careful consideration should be given to what might be called the \"Cottage System\". Instead of putting up one large building have several small buildings. These could be as follows:\n\n1. Boy's Residence. In this building provide accommodation for at least two or more workers.\n\n2. Girl's Residence. with staff accommodation as above.\n\n3. Laundry\n\n4. Class Room and Chapel\n\n5. Cook House and Dining Room combined.\n\n6. Principal's Residence.\n\nTwo very great advantages would be derived from such a system:\n\n1. If one building was destroyed by fire the loss would not be so great. The buildings could be so arranged in relation to one another that a destruction by fire of one would not menace another. In a one building school the destruction of that building by fire means practically the loss of everything.\n\n2. The life of the children in such surroundings would be more nearly that which they will have to accustom themselves to when they go home. I would recommend that these buildings be heated by stoves, lighted by lamps and have no running water or sewerage systems. One of the significant things that arose out of the recent fire was that the children, when moved to their new quarters (which is practically the \"Cottage System\") for a few days were quite at a loss how to act.\n\nI am convinced that the best way to fit the Indian children for the life they will have to live when they leave school is to have their life in school as similar as possible to the life they will have to live at home.\n\nIn closing this report I would like to give the following information concerning the staff:\n\n1. Each member of the staff has a room of their own and a comfortable bed to sleep on. No doubling up has been necessary.\n\n2. Staff members saved practically all of their personal effects.\n\n3. The staff have even their own dining room, which is situated in the same building in which the children eat.\n\n4. Both the Girl's and Boy's Supervisor have the use of washing machines operated by a gasoline engine. The Girls Supervisor uses one loaned by Mrs. Matthew Watson and the Boy's Supervisor has the use of one at the Principal's residence.\n\n5. Miss P.E. Shepherd, R.N., and Miss A.E. Hall have separate accommodation in the Girl's Residence.\n\n6. Miss W. Moulton has her own room in the building used for a Dining Hall and Kitchen. Mr. C.A. Oke has quarters in this building also.\n7. Mr. G. Titley, the Farm Instructor is staying with us at the Principal's Residence. At one time Mrs. Grant and myself thought of moving over to Carcross Village. Two things, however, made it necessary and advisable for us to remain where we are. In the first place no suitable house is available in Carcross. In the second place I will have to be here during the haying season. During that time all men agents are needed to put up hay and someone has to be on the school premises to look after the cows, chickens, gardens, etc. It is not possible living here to keep in touch with the work in Carcross Village. The distance is only about 1\u00bd miles and telephonic communication can be entered into at any time. At night time Mr. O.A. Oke is in Carcross and can be easily called if needed.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing report proves to be satisfactory. The same is respectfully submitted by\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn the 15th inst., I received from the Principal of our Carcross School the enclosed report on the destruction by fire of that institution and the affiliated workshop on the 17th ultimo. I may state, for your information, that another copy is being sent to Mr. Hoey, the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nAs all matters pertaining to the erection of other buildings to take the place of the ones destroyed, will be discussed with you in the near future by the Rev. L.A. Dixon, Field Secretary, of our Society, further comment on my part in this connexion, appears to me to be unnecessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nREPORT ON THE FIRE WHICH DESTROYED THE CHOOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL BUILDING AND WORKSHOP ON APRIL 17th, 1939.\n\nAt about 10.15 a.m. on April 17th 1939, Mr. G.A. Oke, who has held the position of Engineer here since August 1936, came to my residence and reported that the stove pipes in the school kitchen and the chimney were on fire.

On my way up to the school I noticed three things\u2014(1) That the children were lined up outside the building. (2) That the water pump was in operation. (3) That smoke was coming from almost every portion of the roof. Judging from the smoke it was felt then that the building was doomed. After ascertaining that all the children were in a place of safety I went into the school and up to the top floor. It was found impossible to get up\ninto the attic on account of the dense smoke. Mr. Perfitt, Mr. Oke and Mr. Titley had, prior to my arrival, succeeded in getting into the attic but could not see anything in the way of fire nor stay there for more than a minute or two because of the smoke. To fight the fire in the attic was a physical impossibility especially when I arrived. The only place it could be fought was by directing a stream of water from the floor below up through the trap-door which led into the attic. This was the way a similar fire was extinguished some fifteen years ago. It was right here though that all our efforts were doomed to failure.\n\nFor some reason or other after the fire of approximately 15 years ago, someone built in the attic of the school a room with walls and ceiling. In this room was the water tank which supplied the school. The only opening into the main attic was through this room. As one stood on the floor below and looked up through the trap-door all that could be seen was the ceiling of this room. This was the barrier which prevented us from seeing the chimney, rafters of the roof and from directing any stream of water or chemicals where it was needed. In discussing this fire with Mr. Matthews Watson who helped extinguish the one of about fifteen years ago he said that this room was not there when they fought the previous fire and that it was undoubtedly the presence of this room which prevented anyone from putting out the fire which ultimately destroyed the school. Why this room was built no one seems to know. I naturally thought that it was part of the original building but apparently not. I feel sure that since its erection no Principal or male member of the staff ever thought it would be a menace. Three things we have learned from this fire: (1) that brick chimneys, such as the one put up in the school, are not safe. (2) that the brick work should be inspected periodically by someone competent to do so. It seems strange that most chimneys should be enclosed from almost the top to the bottom with a combination of woodwork, lath and plaster, the woodwork coming into close contact with the bricks. Such an arrangement makes terrific inspection of the bricks in the chimney impossible without tearing down part of the building. (3) that wherever a brick chimney goes into an attic there should be two fire doors at least in the ceiling through which, when open, one can have an unrestricted view of both sides of the chimney where it goes through the roof. This I consider is of the greatest importance.\n\nNow as to the cause of the fire. It could not have been electrical for the school building was rewired last summer, all the wires being placed in conduit. There were absolutely no exposed wires in the attic and each circuit in the building was guarded by fuses of the correct amperage. It was not likely caused by a spark from the chimney because the roof was of corrugated galvanized iron and any sparks or burning creosote coming from the chimney in the morning would have been carried clear of the building by the fairly strong wind that was blowing. There is no question but that the fire started in the attic.\n\nAfter the building was burnt to the ground the chimney, which was still standing, was examined as closely as possible. There were several openings in the brick and these it was found were places where ventilators entered the chimney. Apparently this chimney was used as a ventilating shaft as well as for a chimney. One theory advanced as to the cause of the fire was that creosote, having seeped through the butt joints in the steel casing, ran into the ventilators and caught on fire. As these shafts were not insulated from the woodwork a fire could easily be caused in this way.\n\nAfter the Superintendent of the Indian Affairs for the Yukon had made his inspection he gave us orders to have the chimney brought down. This we did with the use of dynamite. On examining the steel casing it was noticed that on the outside were marks of burnt creosote. Evidently creosote had seeped through the joints of this casing and had ignited when the chimney caught on fire.\nAs there was an air space between the round steel casing and the bricks of the chimney quite a fire could burn in there without our knowledge. The fire either broke into the building through the ventilating shafts or through a crack in the bricks where the chimney went through them. I am inclined to the latter theory because when the fire of fifteen years ago started there was no steel casing. This pointed to the fact that the brickwork of the chimney was faulty. As far as I can remember only one ventilating shaft went into the chimney in the attic and that did not come into contact with wood until it reached the ceiling of the floor below. I am fairly certain that the fire started where the chimney went through the roof.\n\nWhen it was found that the fire could not be fought through the trap door Mr. A. Perfitt and one of the senior boys went up on the roof with fire extinguishers. Mr. Perfitt, who had only just been relieved of the duties of Night Watchman, tore part of the galvanized roofing off and did his best to extinguish the blaze. He stayed on the roof until the metal sheathing was too hot to stand on. By that time the fire had such a hold the only thing to do was to save as much of the contents of the building as possible. To give you some idea of the rapidity with which the fire spread I may say that shortly after Mr. and Mrs. at the school I telephoned to Carcross Village for assistance. Some of the employees of the Northern Airways Ltd., came over in a car at once but by the time they reached the school, situated only 1\u00bd miles from town, the fire was out of control.\n\nA great and magnificent work was done by the residents of Carcross. Nearly every able bodied man who could leave his post came to our assistance. You can form some conception of their work from the attached lists of food supplies and articles saved. The work of removing the contents of the school building and the workshop went on until it was not safe to be in either building. I would like to make special mention of the work of Mr. A. Perfitt. He certainly deserves great credit not only for the efforts he made to put out the fire but for the way in which he worked afterwards. The energy he displayed and the cool-headed way in which he acted was an inspiration to us all. It was not a question of someone working for a salary for two days previous to the fire he ceased to be Night Watchman and was staying on for a few days more or less as a guest of the school. The staff members saved or had saved most of their belongings but apparently Mr. Perfitt gave his not a thought. He was more concerned with saving the goods of others. His greatest loss was an Arctic Sleeping Robe or Bed worth approximately $60.00. I wish something could be done to reimburse him for his loss. He certainly deserves it.\n\nIn about two hours the school and workshop were nothing more than a mass of ruins. The question then arose as to what should be done to provide accommodation for the children and staff. Mr. Matthew Watson offered the use of the empty houses he had in the village and the White Pass and Yukon Railway placed at our disposal the section house in Carcross. It was finally decided to use the Section House as a cook house and dining hall, the Rectory for a Girl's Residence with Miss Hall and Miss Shepherd in charge and the largest of Mr. Watson's Houses as a Boys' Dormitory with Mrs. Butler and Miss Moulton in charge.\n\nAs soon as this plan was decided on all the bedding (it was practically all saved) food supplies, children and staff were loaded on three sleighs and toed over to Carcross on the ice in one trip by a caterpillar tractor belonging to the Northern Airways Ltd. The food was deposited at the section house and the children taken to their place of abode. As soon as they were more or less settled Miss Moulton was instructed to proceed over to the Section House and get supper. Great was her surprise to find that the Section Foreman, Mr. J. McMurphy and his crew had not only set the tables but had supper all ready for the children and staff. Mrs. McMurphy\nsent over to our new dining hall enough milk made out of Klim to supply all needs that evening and I believe the next morning. I cannot speak too highly of the assistance rendered by Mr. and Mrs. J. McMurphy of Carcross. It is really wonderful to think that in spite of what had happened the children and staff never missed a meal.\n\nAfter supper, Mr. George Simmons, President of the Northern Airways Ltd., placed at our disposal his caterpillar and its driver to help get under cover food supplies and other articles which had been saved and which might spoil if left outside during the night. Besides the caterpillar driver many willing hands helped us until darkness intervened. When forced to stop nothing remained outside which should have been under cover.\n\nAs you can imagine there was no sleep for some of us that night. Besides the smouldering ruins to watch there were many things to think of. In the hours of darkness it occurred to me that the only way to meet this catastrophe was to make an effort to carry on as if nothing had happened. As far as the children were concerned they had to be kept occupied and as far as the future was concerned it was felt that our chances of having the school rebuilt were strengthened greatly if we could show the Department's representative and others that even though the school may be burnt Chootla Indian Residential School still goes on.\n\nIt was with these two ends in view that at daybreak Messrs. Oke, Titley and myself loaded on to the wagon (Mr. Perfitt also gave valuable assistance) the school desks, scribblers, etc., which were saved from the conflagration. These were taken over to Carcross and placed in a house which Mr. Matthew Watson had kindly placed at our disposal and which we decided to use as a classroom. It took most of the morning to get things arranged but here again we were fortunate in having the services of the White Pass Section Crew which the Station Agent, Mr. J. Bowie, placed at our disposal. By noon the classroom reopened twenty four hours after the fire started. Great credit is due Miss Hall for carrying on in the classroom so soon after a nerve wracking experience and with so little equipment.\n\nIf any question arises as to the need of a residential school in this part of Canada I think that this incident should convince the most skeptical. In order to cut down the amount of sleeping accommodation required all those children who had homes in Carcross were allowed to go to their parents. About 10 or 12 pupils were dealt with in this way. It was only a matter of about two days before it was necessary to take 8 back. This I was requested to do by those responsible for them. The plea was that they had not the wherewithal to provide for these children.\n\nThe day after the fire Bishop Geddes and Indian Agent Major Sandys-Wunsch, R.C.M.P., arrived in Carcross. In dealing with the situation Major Sandys-Wunsch acted as follows:\n\n1. Tried to rent for an indefinite period the White Pass and Yukon Railway Section House. This he was unable to do.\n\n2. Made arrangements with Mr. Matthew Watson for the rental, by the Department of certain houses in Carcross some of which we were then occupying. I may say here that Mr. Matthew Watson offered to let the school have the use of these buildings rent free but to this arrangement the Indian Agent would not agree.\n\n3. Stated that he would get Mr. J.E. French, Builder and Contractor at Whitehorse to come to Carcross and do any carpentry work necessary. One of the jobs he is to do is to cover over the basement of the Workshop so that it can be used as a place to store vegetables during next winter. Mr. French at present is making table tops, trestles, benches, etc. In connection with these I may say that in a few days...\ntime we will have to move out of the W.P. and Y.R. Section House. The Railway company will need the use of this building for their employees about May 6th. Our Kitchen and Dining Hall will then be located in one of Mr. Matthew Watson's largest houses. Into this place has already been put a good size range loaned to us by the White Pass and Yukon Railway, the table tops, trestles and benches which Mr. French has made. This building will make an admirable Kitchen and Dining Room.\n\n4. Major Sandys-Wunsch authorized me to purchase such items as kitchen utensils, dishes, etc., from the local store. These are being charged to the Department of Indian Affairs. The order for these things was placed and the goods have arrived with the exception of dishes for the children. These are expected to arrive in a day or so. In the meantime the White Pass and Yukon Railway have loaned us what is needed.\n\n5. Statements were taken by the Indian Agent from all the men agents on the staff and also from Mr. A. Perfitt. These were taken down in writing by Major Sandys-Wunsch and signed by the person concerned. These statements were mainly in connection with the cause of the fire and steps taken to extinguish same. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon (Indian Agent) kindly allowed Bishop Goddes and myself to read the several statements and there was no disagreement nor was anyone incriminated. Before leaving Carcross Major Sandys-Wunsch also let me read a telegram he was sending to the Commissioner, R.C.M.P., asking him to inform the minister that a full investigation had been conducted and that the cause of the fire was accidental.\n\n6. The Indian Agent before leaving, asked me to wire him as soon as possible regarding certain needs which were discussed during his visit. My telegram to him reads as follows:\n\n\"Kindly request Department to supply soon two H and P washing machines four steel bath tubs six only wash tubs two only wash boilers twenty two double deck bunks six wash boards and six Coleman gasoline lamps at total estimated cost of seven hundred dollars stop Kindly ask Department of Public Printing and Stationery to supply soon following school supplies five only Friend's Primer five only Friend's Work book nine only Grade two Readers seven only Grade three Readers one large box letter tickets one large box number tickets twelve Composition work books for Grade four eight senior nature and language work books and twelve only boxes ink powder.\"\n\nApparently the Indian Agent is writing by Air Mail from Dawson to Ottawa regarding these matters. In this telegram is mentioned Double Deck Bunks. These will be admirable when one considers the limited amount of floor space in the buildings now occupied. I may say that at the present time we have the use of a limited number of double deck bunks and springs loaned to the school by the White Pass and Yukon Railway.\n\n7. The Indian Agent spoke of a possible change of site for the school should the Department decide to rebuild. Ten Mile was mentioned as being most suitable. There would be many advantages in connection with such a move; the chief ones being the nearness to an abundant supply of hay and the ease with which wood could be procured. It is said that the soil, from an agriculture point of view, is far better at Ten Mile than it is here. There are of course certain disadvantages so the matter would have to be gone into very carefully before any definite decision to move is made. Two disadvantages might be mentioned here:-(1) The difficulty in getting a doctor when one was needed. In the Spring and Fall of the year communication between Carcross and Ten Mile is very difficult. (2) It would not be so costly to rebuild on the old site as it would be at Ten Mile. Here we have most of the outbuildings, the sewerage system and the excavation. It is possible that a building could be erected on the\nold foundation. Whether the Department decides to build on the old site or move to another what is needed is a modern fireproof structure, or several smaller buildings (See next paragraph) with accommodation for at least 80 pupils.\n\nIn approaching the question of rebuilding I feel that careful consideration should be given to what might be called the \"Cottage System\". Instead of putting up one large building have several small buildings. These could be as follows:-\n\n1. Boy's Residence. In this building provide accommodation for at least two or more workers.\n\n2. Girl's Residence. with staff accommodation as above.\n\n3. Laundry\n\n4. Class Room and Chapel\n\n5. Cook House and Dining Room combined.\n\n6. Principal's Residence.\n\nTwo very great advantages would be derived from such a system:-\n\n1. If one building was destroyed by fire the loss would not be so great. The buildings could be so arranged in relation to one another that a destruction by fire of one would not menace another. In a one building school the destruction of that building by fire means practically the loss of everything.\n\n2. The life of the children in such surroundings would be more nearly that which they will have to accustom themselves to when they go home. I would recommend that these buildings be heated by stoves, lighted by lamps and have no running water or sewerage systems. One of the significant things that arose out of the recent fire was that the children, when moved to their new quarters (which is practically the \"Cottage System\") for a few days were quite at a loss how to act.\n\nI am convinced that the best way to fit the Indian children for the life they will have to live when they leave school is to have their life in school as similar as possible to the life they will have to live at home.\n\nIn closing this report I would like to give the following information concerning the staff:-\n\n1. Each member of the staff has a room of their own and a comfortable bed to sleep on. No doubling up has been necessary.\n\n2. Staff members saved practically all of their personal effects.\n\n3. The staff have even their own dining room, which is situated in the same building in which the children eat.\n\n4. Both the Girl's and Boy's Supervisor have the use of washing machines operated by a gasoline engine. The Girls Supervisor uses one loaned by Mrs. Matthew Watson and the Boy's Supervisor has the use of one at the Principal's residence.\n\n5. Miss P.E. Shepherd, R.N., and Miss A.E. Hall have separate accommodation in the Girl's Residence.\n\n6. Miss W. Moulton has her own room in the building used for a Dining Hall and Kitchen. Mr. C.A. Oke has quarters in this building also.\n7. Mr. G. Titley, the Farm Instructor is staying with us at the Principal's Residence. At one time Mrs. Grant and myself thought of moving over to Carcross Village. Two things, however, made it necessary and advisable for us to remain where we are. In the first place no suitable house is available in Carcross. In the second place I will have to be here during the haying season. During that time all men agents are needed to put up hay and someone has to be on the school premises to look after the cows, chickens, garden, etc. It is not hard, living here, to keep in touch with the work in Carcross Village. The distance is only about 1\u00bd miles and telephonic communication can be entered into at any time. At night time Mr. C.A. Oke is in Carcross and can be easily called if needed.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing report proves to be satisfactory. The same is respectfully submitted by\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to the closing paragraph of my letter to you on the 3rd inst. and your reply to the same on the 9th inst., No. 156-1-5, I beg to state that I received on the 15th inst. the enclosed report from the Rev. Principal Grant of our Carcross School, on the destruction by fire of that institution on April 17th. I may state, for your information, that I am also sending a copy of the report to the Secretary of your Branch of Government.\n\nAs it is my understanding that all matters pertaining to the erection of a new school to take the place of the one destroyed, will be discussed with you by the Rev. L.A. Dixon, Field Secretary of our Society, no comment by me appears to be necessary, except to express my admiration for all the men and women, whether staff agents or from the surrounding settlement, who handled a critical situation so well as to prevent any loss of life and to save so much of the supplies and equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW/KH\nEncl.\nOttawa, May 27, 1939.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRe: Carcross Residential School\n\nYesterday the following representatives of the Church of England visited the Department:\n\nArchbishop Roper, Ottawa,\nArchdeacon Snowden, Ottawa,\nReverend L. A. Dixon, Field Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nDr. McGill and I discussed with them the situation that has arisen due to the destruction by fire of the Carcross Residential School.\n\nReverend Mr. Dixon stated that it was the opinion of the M. S. C. C. that when the Carcross school is rebuilt it should provide accommodation for at least 50 pupils. At the time of the destruction of the school by fire, per capita allowance was only being paid for 40 pupils.\n\nAll those mentioned above urged the immediate rebuilding of the school, but it was pointed out to them that this could not be done during the current fiscal year. They were promised, however, that the Department would give every possible assistance in keeping the school in operation in the temporary buildings that have been rented for that purpose. Reverend Mr. Dixon expressed some doubt as to whether the rented buildings would be suitable for winter occupancy, and he was promised that the Principal of the school would be written for further information regarding this phase of the situation. It was suggested to them that possibly we could secure for the winter the section house owned by the White Horse and Yukon Railway.\n\nRev. Mr. Dixon promised to obtain further information regarding the reserves from which pupils are recruited for the Carcross School and to submit detailed information regarding this and also other information that might be necessary in connection with the erection of a new school. He was requested to let us have his report by August 1, in order that the matter could be studied before preparing the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nNOTE: - See memorandum dated May 4, 1939, on this file outlining interview with Mr. Rogers, Vice-President of the Whitehorse and Yukon Railway.\nCOPY SENT TO DR. WESTGATE.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, May 27, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a letter from Reverend T. B. R. Westgate, Secretary of the M. S. C. C., enclosing copy of your report on the destruction by fire of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nYesterday, Reverend L. A. Dixon, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., visited the Department. He appeared to be under the impression that the buildings at present rented would not be suitable for next winter's occupancy. You did not mention this matter in your report, and I would appreciate having detailed information from you as soon as possible.\n\nIf the buildings that you have recently rented would not be suitable, could any other building be secured? The Department recently had an interview with Mr. Rogers, an official of the Whitehorse and Yukon Railway. While he did not state definitely that the large section house owned by this company could be used during the winter months, it is possible that such an arrangement could be made with the company. If you consider that this building would be an improvement on the ones that you have rented, you might take up the matter with the officials of the Whitehorse and Yukon Railway and, if possible, obtain some definite decision from them, which you should forward for our consideration.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend H. C. M. Grant,\nPrincipal,\nCarcross Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon.\nOttawa, May 27, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing copy of Reverend Mr. Grant's report in connection with the fire at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that the staff at this school has handled the situation in an able manner.\n\nReverend L. A. Dixon, Field Secretary of the M. S. C.

McGill,\nDirector, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nFollowing our interview with you yesterday regarding the replacement of the residential school at Carcross, I am asking that the two statements for which you have asked be prepared and sent to you as soon as practicable, namely -\n\n1. A full statement of the requirements for the building to replace the one that was burned, as regards size, capacity, site, equipment, etc.\n\n2. A statement of what is immediately needed to enable the school to carry on its work in the present emergency quarters.\n\nRegarding the first of these statements, it is our understanding that its purpose is to enable you to include provision for the replacement of the school building in next year's estimates.\n\nAnd regarding the second statement it is our understanding that its purpose is to enable the Department to know what assistance will be needed by way of rent, repairs and additional accommodation in continuing the school until the new building is available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nField Secretary.\nCOYLE BATTERIES LTD.\nManufacturers\nOffice and Plant: 1481 Venables Street\nVancouver, Canada\n\nMay 26, 1939.\n\nPurchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn November 22, 1938, we supplied a quotation to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, covering a battery required for the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nWe understand that the contract was to be let directly by your department, and since we have heard nothing from you, we are wondering if you have placed the order, or if we may still hope to receive it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCOYLE BATTERIES LIMITED.\n\nManager.\nR A HOEY, INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nSUPT OF WELFARE & TRAINING DEPT MINES-RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT\nIN REPLY TO YOUR AIR MAIL LETTER OF MAY TWENTY SEVENTH BEG TO ADVISE\nTHAT BUILDINGS AT PRESENT RENTED ARE SUITABLE FOR WINTER OCCUPATION\nSTOP THESE BUILDINGS MOST SUITABLE IN VICINITY AND PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED\nBY WHITE RESIDENTS\n\nPRINCIPAL CARCROSS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n558AM\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith regard to the situation at Carcross I am today in receipt of the following telegram from the Principal:\n\nIN REPLY TO YOUR AIR MAIL LETTER OF MAY TWENTY SEVENTH BEG TO ADVISE THAT BUILDINGS AT PRESENT RENTED ARE SUITABLE FOR WINTER OCCUPATION STOP THESE BUILDINGS MOST SUITABLE IN VICINITY AND PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY WHITE RESIDENTS\n\nYou will remember that when you visited the Department one of the matters discussed was whether the rented buildings would be suitable for winter habitation.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nFile No. 166-1-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th Inst., in which you state a set of batteries for the Carcross School, Yukon Territory, has been supplied by MacKinnon Sales & Service, Ltd., Vancouver.\n\nOf course, this is a Globelite product, manufactured in Winnipeg at an advertised price of $630.00, f.o.b. Winnipeg. Our quotation on this battery was $530.00, f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nSeveral COYLE battery sets are in use in Indian schools throughout this province, from which excellent results have been obtained; our product has been on the market for more than 16 years, and enjoys a first-class reputation. In view of this we feel that when the Dominion government has battery requirements in the west and north-west, preference should be given to the manufacturer in the field; particularly when the price is equal, or better, as in this case.\n\nA very interesting solution of the economic problem came to our notice the other day. The suggestion was brought forward that legislation should be enacted whereby the banks would loan money for industrial purposes entirely without interest, and that the eight per cent. sales tax now going to the government should be handed instead to the banks, as their return for money invested. It was predicted that industrial expansion under these circumstances would take place so rapidly as to actually repay the government in income tax within a few years for the loss of the sales tax.\n\nA suggestion such as this is worthy of grave consideration. It is certain that we in the west, at least, receive very little assistance or encouragement from the Federal government in the development of our industrial activities, in return for the millions of dollars that go to Ottawa annually in duties and taxes; to say nothing of the splendid co-operation extended by the west in any plans to benefit the Dominion as a whole.\n\nWhile we have no animosity whatever toward the Globelite Company, we shall appreciate an opportunity to quote on future government requirements in British Columbia, and the courtesy of a serious consideration of our tender when submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCOYLE BATTERIES LIMITED.\n\nManager.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUEST FOR QUOTATION\n\nSimmons Ltd., P.O.

W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nThe Rev. L. A. Dixon, Field Secretary of our Society has informed me that when he and Archbishop Roper and Archdeacon Snowdon had an interview with you on May 26th last, regarding the building of a new School at Carcross for our Society, you requested:\n\n(a) A statement of what is immediately needed to enable the School to carry on its work in the present emergency quarters.\n\n(b) A full statement of the requirements for the new building.\n\nWith regard to (a), the immediate needs -- it is my understanding that most, if not all, of these have already been supplied by your Department at a cost, according to a statement received from the Principal (Rev. H. C. M. Grant), of $653.31. Should there be other requirements I do not think that they would be very costly.\n\nWith regard to (b), the requirements for the new School building, I beg to state that the Field Secretary of our Society and I had a conference with Bishop Geddes, Bishop of the Yukon, on the 13th inst., when we carefully considered this question, and agreed to submit certain specific recommendations to our Commission. Our Commission met yesterday and adopted the recommendations which were as follows:\n\n(1) The site of the new building -- To be erected on or adjacent to the site occupied by the building destroyed by fire.\n\nVery careful consideration was given to the question of having the site at either Whitehorse, approximately 40 miles\naway, or at a place called Ten Mile, which is about that distance from Carcross, and from which the School now secures its hay supply. After carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages of all three sites, we were agreed that the site on which the former School stood was the best.\n\n(2) Style of Building -- As the Rev. Principal Grant had recommended, careful consideration of the adoption of what he called the \"Cottage System\", his suggestion was not overlooked.\n\nHowever, our unanimous opinion was that the adoption of the \"Cottage System\" might be tried in a warmer climate, but would be quite unsuitable for one in that northern latitude. As the adoption of the \"Cottage System\" would require one separate building for the bigger boys, one for the smaller boys, one for the bigger girls, and one for the smaller girls, a kitchen and refectory combined, a classroom, two separate recreation rooms, a residence for the Principal, a Chapel, a laundry and bakery combined, a workshop and tool shop combined, toilets, etc., it was not thought that the provision of such would cost less than that of one large building. It was therefore definitely agreed to recommend that one large building be provided.\n\nWith regard to the building material and the making of the building as nearly fireproof as possible, it was thought that stone, of which there is an abundance in that part, might be used for the walls and partitions, with a galvanized iron roof, stone or brick chimneys, and fireproof lining for insulation on the inside of the walls and under the roof.\n\n(3) With regard to the capacity of the new School building, it was decided to recommend that this should not be less than eighty (80).\n\nThe Indian population of the Yukon according to the latest census is 1,359, and of these, 1,282 are classed as Anglicans. While our Church operates seven Indian Day Schools in the Yukon, we learned from our Bishop that most of these are located in the Interior or the northern part of the territory, and that recruits for the Carcross School come mostly from the southern part. It was also felt that, as no School has been provided, though frequently requested, to take the place of the School once operated by our Church at Metlakahtla, that a number of children, especially those who are orphans or destitute, might be recruited for this School from northern British Columbia. As the Principal has never had any difficulty in securing the present official capacity of 40, and has sometimes been unable to take others who desired admission, it was felt that it would be a mistake when building a new school, not to provide sufficient capacity for a larger enrollment, and the number suggested was eighty (80).\n(4) With regard to equipment, I am not in a position at present to furnish you with a detailed list, or to give you an estimate of the cost of the same, but if you will kindly let me know the size of the building you decide to build, I will endeavour to secure this or any further information you may desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW:BGS\n\nP. S. --It is assumed that (a) a semi-detached residence for the Principal will be provided in the new School building, and (b) that a workshop with a full-sized basement for storing vegetables and roots will also be provided to take the place of the one destroyed. T. B. R. W.\nWhitehorse June 28 1939\n\nSecretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast September the principal of the Choulta Indian School at Carcross ordered lumber from the White Pass & Yukon Route, Whitehorse to the extent of $233.98. The lumber I understand being for repairs to the school.\n\nMr Grant, the principal, advises me that the bill properly certified was forwarded to the Sup't Indian Affairs at Dawson who reports that it was sent on to Ottawa for payment. As our records show the bill still outstanding will you kindly look into it and if in order pass it for voucher. A copy is enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWhite Pass & Yukon Rte\n\nPer [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 13, 1939.\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, addressed to the Director of this Branch.\n\nI appreciate very fully the suggestions contained in your communication, all of which have been very carefully discussed and considered by the officials of the Training Division. It is my intention to recommend to the Minister that we erect at Carcross two distinct and separate educational units - one unit to consist of two classrooms with accommodation for 30 pupils in each, with full basement accommodation equipped for vocational instruction; and a second unit to consist of dormitories for 60 pupils, with living quarters for the members of the staff. The Minister is vigorously opposed to the transportation of Indian pupils long distances to residential schools and would not, I feel confident, consider for a moment the transfer of Indian pupils from northern British Columbia to the school at Carcross.\n\nI agree with you that an attempt should be made to protect the new building in every way possible from fire hazards. I am personally inclined to favour log construction in the case of the dormitory building, if good logs can be secured at a reasonable price. There are certain advantages in having living quarters for the Principal provided in the main building. You might intimate what you prefer in this regard.\n\nWould it -\n\nReverend T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n3rd-43 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWould it be possible to secure from you figures indicating the approximate cost of the two units as outlined above? I am anxious to know, also, if the Bishop of the Yukon or the church authorities would be prepared to undertake the construction of the building. I make this suggestion in view of the success you had in the construction of buildings at Moose Factory and Aklavik. If you were prepared to proceed with the construction, I would recommend to the Minister that you be permitted to do so. I have no assurance, of course, at this date that my recommendation would be approved.\n\nThe estimates for the year 1940-41 will be under consideration in the course of a few weeks. I am anxious, therefore, to have from you all the information I possibly can with respect to the cost of the Carcross school, just as soon as you can conveniently send it forward.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your memorandum, No 166-1-5, dated March 3, 1939, please find attached the copy of the \"Battery Assurance Bond\" covering the batteries for the Carcross Indian residential school, as requested by you.\n\nIt should be noted that these batteries were destroyed in the fire at the above mentioned school on April 17, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSupt of Welfare & Training,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nJuly 17, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the enclosed account from the White Pass & Yukon Route which covers the cost of lumber supplied to the school last September.

H. C. M. Grant)\n\nOUR FIRST HOME\u2014\nThe Chooutla Indian Residential School was first established at Carcross in the spring of 1903. It then consisted of two shacks one of which was constructed of logs.\n\nFor some years previous a small school was conducted at Forty-mile under Bishop Bompass, who made it a matter of personal concern. Mrs. Bompass also took a deep interest in the work.\n\nFor several years it was carried on rather as a home for orphans and neglected children. After Bishop Bompass had visited Caribou Crossing (now called Carcross) and had resided here for some time, in 1901 and 1902, he realized that this place had many advantages as a location for the school and in the spring of 1903 he removed the inmates from Forty-mile to Carcross. Miss Ellis, who was in charge of the school at the time, accompanied the children up the river there being eight or ten children in the school.\n\nOUR SECOND HOME\u2014\nA small house in Carcross was procured from Mr. P. R. Peel and here the school was comfortably established. In 1903 the staff was composed of Bishop Bompass as teacher, and Miss Ellis Matson. Bishop and Mrs. Bompass lived in a log building, on the opposite side of the water, formerly erected as a road-house.\n\nIn order that the school children might be closer to the Mission, the Bishop in 1904 exchanged the school building for a log house occupied by the Police Detachment, and originally erected for a telegraph office. This remained the home of the school until the removal to a newly erected commodious building situated two miles away from the former location. Miss Ellis remained in charge until 1909 when Miss Collins became matron, and up to the end of 1911 the latter continued energetically to carry on the work so effectively inaugurated by Miss Ellis. The Rev. J. Hawskley and Archdeacon Canham have each in turn acted in the capacity of Principal during the time they were in charge of the Mission.\n\nAt different times Miss Dorothy Bindley and Miss Myrtle Purse assisted Miss Ellis. Afterwards, Miss Hutchison joined the staff as teacher. For a short time Miss Emily M. Dutton also assisted with the children, while Miss Edith Thompson (now Mrs. W. S. Watson) and Miss Maude Bell (now Mrs. Lauderdale) gave several years of faithful and diligent work to the school.\n\nIn 1911 Mr. E. D. Evans, who had considerable experience in Indian school work was appointed Principal.\n\nOUR THIRD HOME\u2014\nIn the spring of 1911 there was placed at the disposal of the Church of England in Canada a new building situated about 2 miles from the village of Carcross.\n\nIn spite of some discouragements in connection with Indian education, only those closely connected with an institution can fully understand the joy and satisfaction of knowing that in this home as well as in the first two...\nmany lives were uplifted, brightened and bettered.\n\nOn April 17th, 1939, the school building and workshop were completely destroyed by fire. This fire was believed to have been caused by an defective chimney. The material used has been good but we are indeed thankful to Almighty God that there were no casualties nor was anyone injured in any way.\n\nOUR FOURTH HOME\u2014\n\nThe difficulties in re-establishing ourselves after the fire were lessened to a considerable degree by the kindness and co-operation of many friends in Carcross. Our new quarters consist of a number of buildings in Carcross Village. The girls occupy one and the boys another. One house is used as a Kitchen and Dining Room and another as a Classroom. One of the greatest difficulties in connection with our new home is that there is no playground nearby for the children especially for the boys. This reason and other similar problems with which we are faced make it evident that our fourth home can only be regarded as one of a temporary nature. Here though we will likely have to remain until the Department of Indian Affairs provide us with new quarters.\n\nOUR FIFTH HOME\u2014\n\nIn this connection we often ask ourselves these questions: where will it be, and what form will it take?\n\nA change of site has been suggested. The question of building at Ten Mile instead of on the site occupied by the third home should not be dismissed without careful consideration. Ten Mile is a place about fifteen miles from Carcross where there are remarkably good hay lands, good soil, plenty of fine wood and an adequate supply of water. Isolation from the Indian village commends itself also to those who have had experience in residential school work. It would seem that the advantages derived from a change of site outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nIn approaching the question of re-building I feel that careful consideration should be given to what might be called the 'Cottage System'. Instead of putting up one large building have several smaller buildings. These could be as follows:\n\n1. Boys' Residence. In this building provide accommodation for at least two or more workers.\n2. Girls' Residence. With staff accommodation as above.\n3. Laundry.\n4. Class Room and Chapel.\n5. Cook House and Dining Room combined.\n6. Principal's Residence.\n7. Recreation Room & Gymnasium.\n\nTwo very great advantages would be derived from such a system:\n\n1. If one building was destroyed by fire the loss would not be so great. The buildings could be so arranged in relation to one another that a destruction of one would not menace another. In one-building schools the destruction of that building by fire means practically the loss of everything.\n\n2. The life of the children in such surroundings would be more nearly that which they will have to accustom themselves to when they go home. I would recommend that these buildings be heated by stoves, lighted by lamps and have no running water or sewerage systems. One of the significant things that arose out of the recent fire was that the children, when moved to their new quarters (which is practically the \"Cottage System\") for a few days, were quite at a loss how to act.\n\nI am convinced that the best way to fit the Indian children for the life they will have to live when they leave school is to have their life in school as similar as possible to the life they will have to live at home.\n\nThe writer, who first entered Indian School work about 20 years ago, feels that the \"Cottage System\" should be given a fair trial. The cost of operating a school on the \"Cottage System\" might be more and might be less than the cost of operating a one-building school. The writer feels that it would be less. After all the matter of cost should not be the deciding factor. The welfare of the Indian child and his ability to adapt himself or herself to home conditions after leaving school are the most important considerations.\n\nThe education of the Indian child must go on. The writer feels that the following points will convince even the most sceptical that a new school building or buildings should be provided as soon as possible for the Indian children in the Yukon:\n\n1. Every child whether White or Indian is entitled to an education.\n2. It would be a terrible thing in this day and age if anyone could point to a certain group of people living in Canada and say there is a group of people who have been deprived of an education. There is absolutely no foundation for the common belief that the Indians of Canada are a vanishing race. While their numbers have varied considerably during the last thirty years, declining from 110,000 in 1907 to 104,000 in 1924 latest returns issued by the Department of Mines and Resources show that there are now approximately 114,000 Indians resident in the Dominion.\n\n3. Hunting and trapping, the natural life of the Indian, will soon be a thing of the past. The Indians will then have to turn to some other means of livelihood. The education that is now being given them is partly for the purpose of enabling them to meet changing conditions. We must prepare the Indian in some way for the time when he can no longer depend upon hunting and trapping as a means of livelihood.\n\n4. In our school at the present time there are several orphans. What would become of them if there was no residential school?\n\n5. A few days ago the Medical Officer of our school requested the writer to take in as soon as possible two children who were practically starving. For cases such as these a residential school of some kind or other renders a signal service to those who are in need.\n\nWe look forward with hope and faith, not only to the time when the new school buildings will be provided by a kind and beneficial government but to the years of usefulness and promise, which under God's blessing, we are assured are in store for our \"Chootin Indian Residential School.\"\nApril 24th, 1939\nCarcross,Yukon\nCopy of an article sent to the Canadian Press by Mr. J. R. Bowie, Station Agent at Carcross and a Canadian Press Correspondent.\n\nCHILDREN OF CHOOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL HOMELESS\n\nIt was a sad day on April 17th for 44 Indian children when the Chooutla Indian Residential School burned to the ground. The tall brick chimney alone remained as a monument to the late Bishop Bompas, who first saw the great need for such a school.\n\nSome of the orphaned and neglected children shed tears as they saw their home burning; for some of these it has meant home for as long as six to twelve years.\n\nA few hours after the fire teams travelled into Carcross with loads of mattresses, bedding, school desks, supplies and an assortment of goods which had been hurriedly thrown through the windows of the burning school. The White Pass and Yukon Railway offered the Section House as a temporary shelter. Mr. Matthew Watson, General Merchant at Carcross, offered three of his houses to be used until the new building is constructed. The Carcross Rectory is being remodelled to be used as the Girls' Dormitory and living quarters for Miss Sheppard, R.N., Girls' Supervisor and Miss Hall, the Teacher. One of Mr. Watson's houses is to be used as a Boys' Dormitory and quarters for Mrs. Butler, Boys' Supervisor. Yet another house serves as kitchen and dining room.\n\nMuch credit is due the Reverend H. C. M. Grant, Principal, who within twenty-four hours after the fire had the children attending their regular classes in the former R.C.M.P. Barracks in Carcross. Mr. Grant has been tireless in his efforts to make the Chooutla School efficient in every way.\n\nContrary to the belief of most Canadians the Indian Race is not becoming extinct, for its population shows an increase of over four thousand over the previous year. If such is the case, the Canadian people must continue their efforts in educating the Indians to our own standards of living. Their former mode of life, viz. Hunting, Trapping and Fishing is fast becoming an inadequate means of livelihood for this increasing population. Nothing remains but to help them find a new way to live in their quickly changing conditions of life.\n\nIt is therefore sincerely hoped that the Department of Indian Affairs, along with the help of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, will see fit to rebuild the Chooutla School at Carcross.\n\n(Signed) J.

Both these branches have a large attendance and are very active.\n\nThe Senior W.A. raised Talent Money during Lent and realized the sum of over fifty dollars. This branch attended Corporate Communion Service on Mother's Day, at which service the Lord Bishop of the Diocese gave a very fine address.\n\nOn St. George's Day, a special service was held in the morning at which the collection was sent to the Seaman's Institute of Greenwich, England. This custom has been observed in St. Paul's for many years.\n\nThe Cathedral held holy services on Sunday, April 28th, with gifts toward the Relief of Western Clergy.\n\nFriends of St. Paul's will be pleased to learn that we have paid off all debt and have this year assumed more obligations than we have had for many years. We ask your prayers on behalf of the Church work and those who are responsible for administering the affairs of our Parish. There is a very worth while work to be done and we do hope you will remember us.\n\nWhenever possible services have been taken the first Sunday in each month at Bear Creek.\n\nMention might be made of the various organizations which have attended services recently, the Masonic Lodge, the Oddfellows' Lodge and the Eagles. We are also members of the Curling Club. These services were very well attended indeed, and we were happy to welcome them to our church.\n\nThe Easter services were splendid, and well attended, and the Church was beautifully decorated by the Chancel Guild. It was again possible for us to have fresh cut flowers to adorn the Communion table. The eleven o'clock Holy Communion service was fully choral.\n\nOn Palm Sunday the Rector presented four candidates to the Bishop for the rite of Confirmation.\n\nThrough the columns of this paper, the clergy and members of St. Paul's Church extend to the Principal and staff of Chooutla School their prayerful thought for them, in the loss of the school by fire, recently.\n\nWHITEHORSE \u2014 With this issue, the Rev. Alexander Anderson returns to the Diocese and takes over the dual responsibilities of the rectorship of Christ Church, and the editorship of this little paper. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson spent the winter in Ireland at the former's home, after their marriage in Vancouver last August. While there Mr. Anderson did six months' deputation work for the Colonial and Continental Church Society, telling something of the work not only on the Canadian prairie, but also of what our Church is doing in this northern land.\n\nThe new rector and his wife arrived in Whitehorse on May 6th. The\nMOOSEHIDE\u2014Easter services were attended splendidly, the church being filled for each service. As is usual the villagers had decorated the church in preparation for the festival. In the centre of the frontal was set an Easter banner worked in beads, the gift of one of the Indian women.\n\nOn Palm Sunday, April 2nd, the Bishop confirmed two children, and gave to the congregation an extremely helpful address.\n\nFORT SELKIRK\u2014St. Andrew's Mission\u2014The congregation of St. Andrew's Church expresses its sorrow at the destruction of the Choontha Residential School at Carcross. About three-score children from Selkirk have had the advantages which the school so ably afforded and at the time of the fire there were four families represented at the institution. It was most gratifying to learn from the Principal, Rev. H. C. M. Grant, that the children were able to escape from the building and that no casualty had been found for them in Carcross.\n\nSince the beginning of January the missionary has travelled all over his parish\u2014a feat never before accomplished in less than a whole year\u2014by air, land and sea. A trip by dog team was made to Carmacks and Mount Free Gold but the return journey was made by plane as a guest of the Hudson's Bay Company's Fur Commissioner, Mr. R. Parsons. Mayo, Stewart and Dawson were visited before the plane stopped at Selkirk. During Holy Week the missionary visited Whitehorse and held services on Good Friday and the two following Sundays.\n\nSickness has carried off several of the members of the Parish during the past five months. Unfortunately, the greater number have been children despite all the care and treatment which they were able to receive. The lack of meat for food was probably the deciding factor in each illness, particularly among the younger generation.\n\nAs members of the Diocese of Yukon we wish to welcome Rev. W. and Mrs. Valentine and Rev. A. and Mrs. Anderson back to the work in the Northland after their pleasant half days 'outside.'\n\nBRIEFS\n\nThe Bishop visited Carcross soon after the fire at the Indian Residential School in April, and was also there in May for a confirmation, while en route to Ottawa to confer with the Department of Indian Affairs on Carcross School and other matters. While 'outside' the Bishop will attend the Rupert'sland Provincial Synod.\n\nThe Rev. W. Valentine is to represent Yukon Diocese at this Provincial Synod in June. Then he and Mrs. Valentine are expected to return to the Diocese. They spent the winter in England doing deputation work for the British Columbia and Yukon Church Aid Society.\n\nTwo students of the Anglican Theological College, Vancouver, have returned for summer mission work in the diocese. Mr. Joe M. Gillis to Champagne for the second time, and Mr. Frank M. Gilbert to Teslin for the third time. Teslin is an old established Church of England centre of work.\nWe have been there for over thirty years. The Roman Catholics are building a church at the present time. They have had a varying number of priests in at different times, sometimes three, during the last winter and spring in a proselytising effort. We desperately need funds to provide an all the year round ministry at this Indian settlement.\n\nAt the Convocation of Emmanuel College, Saskatoon, on May 3rd, the degree of Bachelor of Divinity was conferred on the Rev. Alex. Anderson, B.A., L.Th. Mr Anderson took his work extramurally while in charge of the Mooshide Mission.\n\nNew names appear on the list of workers on page 2. We bid adieu to those who have left, and welcome to the new ones.\n\nARTICLES TO COME IN THE AUGUST ISSUE\n\nAn account of the present situation at TESLIN. (See above item No. 3.)\n\nMAYO.\u2014The Indian congregation have finished off the interior of their church, St. Mark's, and have painted the ceiling. The interior was lined with Donacinda board, and the ceiling painted white, which has brightened it up a great deal.\n\nThe Junior W.A. of St. Mary's have presented the Church with Dee's Prayer Book, in Great Primer type. The former book is now on the Communion Table.\n\nA Men's Discussion Group has been meeting once a week, at the Rectory, through the winter months. Topics of community, national and international interest have been discussed. Interest has been keen, partly at least, because the Group avoided idle debate, and concentrated on subjects that provided opportunities of accomplishing something.\n\nA PHASE OF WORK IN THE DIOCESE OF YUKON\n\nThose who read of the work of the Church in a far-off, lonely, cold place like the Yukon may often picture that the occasional ministrations of the Church are eagerly awaited by our more isolated brethren. This is not true in so many cases. Woodcutters and trappers off by themselves eight or nine months a year; lonely prospectors ever on the search for new finds; telegraph operators walking their lines to find a break; miners working a lone claim get away from the externals of religion. They only come into contact with the Church when they visit the regular settlements. Our Yukon clergy need the prayers of those more favourably situated as they try to break down this indifference, and send these people back to their lonely lives with religion's comforting and sustaining power.\n\nHIGH GRADE FOXES AND MINK Livestock and Pelts\n\nWATSON'S FUR FARM CARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\n\nWith the change of Editors some errors may have occurred in subscription dates or changes of address have not been noted.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of the 13th instant #166-1-5, requesting information regarding new buildings at Carcross, and you will note from the enclosed telegram to Mr. Grant, that I am soliciting his assistance in securing the information desired. As it is likely that he will make a trip to Whitehorse to consult Mr. French, an expert carpenter who has always been engaged to undertake necessary repairs to the school buildings, a week or so may pass before I receive his reply. As soon as I hear from him I will write to you again, and endeavour to provide the information requested.\n\nAs you ask me to let you have my opinion with regard to providing living quarters for the Principal in the new building, I may say that in the p.s. to my letter to the Director on June 28th last I stated as follows: \"It is assumed that (a) a semi-detached residence for the Principal will be provided in the new school building.\" This was the united opinion of Mr. Dixon, the Field Secretary of our Society, Bishop G\u00e9d\u00e9s of the Yukon, and myself when we met here on June 13th last to consider matters relating to the building of a new School, and I do not see any reason to alter that opinion. The residence at present occupied by the Principal, and built with Church funds, is in a very poor state of repair. But, apart from this consideration, I have always felt that the policy of having the Principal located in close connection with the main school building was a sound one.\nRegarding an estimate of the cost of the two buildings you suggest, I fear it will be difficult for us to calculate the same until we have plans and specifications of the buildings. While the Schools built by our Church at Port George, Aklavik, and Moose Factory were provided at a minimum of cost, the freighting charges on materials from outside were not so heavy as they are bound to be on the White Pass and Yukon Railway from Skagway to Carcross.\n\nWhile I do not think there would be any difficulty whatever on the part of our Society in undertaking the construction of the two buildings, I will write to you again in this matter after I have received a reply from Mr. Principal Grant to the enclosed telegram. Any delay in the despatch of my next letter to you in this connection will be entirely due to circumstances over which I have no control.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnc.\nE12VEMH 17 COLLECT NL VIA ASHCROFT\nCARCROSS YT JULY 18\n\nSEGY INDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\n38-43 BIBLE HOUSE 164 ALEXANDER AVE EAST WINNIPEG\n\nRETBL JULY SEVENTEENTH AM CONSULTING WHITEHORSE CONTRACTORS AND WILL\nWIRE INFORMATION REQUIRED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\n\nBRANT\n1245A\n\nNote: This telegram was received after this letter had been addressed to you.\n\nCALL MESSENGER\nTELEPHONE 97123\n\nRev.

Mr. T.V.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn April 11th last I wrote to the Secretary of your Department of Government informing him of the urgent need of a typewriter for the Principal of our Carcross School, as the one he had been using for about 12 years was worn out and could not be used at all. The Rev. Principal Grant, writing on the 10th inst., states that to date a typewriter has not been supplied, and that the need has been greatly intensified since the loss of the main school building. I would earnestly request, therefore, that this matter be given further consideration and, if at all possible, a suitable typewriter be forwarded with the least possible delay to Mr. Grant. His full address is the Rev. H.C.M. Grant, Principal, Chooutla Indian School, Carcross, Yukon, Can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nJuly 10th 1939.\n\nLIST OF THE INDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION PROPERTY DESTROYED BY FIRE AT THE GARCROSS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON APRIL 17th 1939.\n\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Clothes Wringer                                       | 1        | $20.00     | $20.00     |\n| Chairs @ $2.50                                        | 13       |            | $32.50     |\n| Buffet                                                | 1        | $25.00     | $25.00     |\n| Cupboard in Classroom                                 | 1        | $15.00     | $15.00     |\n| Wardrobes @ $34.50                                    | 5        |            | $172.50    |\n| Dressers @ $17.75                                     | 4        |            | $63.00     |\n| Washstands @ $12.25                                    | 3        |            | $36.75     |\n| Small Tables @ 2.75                                   | 6        |            | $16.50     |\n| Pipe Dies                                             | 2 sets   |            | $50.00     |\n| Belt Threading Dies                                    | 1 set    |            | $25.50     |\n| Speculum                                              | 1 only   |            | $8.25      |\n| Kitchen Tables @ $3.50                                | 2 only   |            | $7.00      |\n| Pipe Vise                                             | 1 only   |            | $7.50      |\n| Vises                                                 | 3 only   |            | $22.55     |\n| Wood Heater in Workshop                               | 1 only   |            | $27.50     |\n| Blacksmith's Forge Blower                             | 1 only   |            | $14.25     |\n| Wire Nails                                            | 5 kegs   |            | $37.40     |\n| Pest DFill                                            | 1 only   |            | $20.00     |\n| Assortment of Mechanics & Carpenters Tools            | 1 set    |            | $200.00    |\n| Staff Dishes                                          | 1 set    |            | $16.75     |\n| Children's Enamel Dishes & Cutlery                    | 1 set    |            | $22.00     |\n| Kitchen Utensils, etc.                                | 1 set of |            | $125.00    |\n| Telephone                                             | 1 only   |            | $25.00     |\n| Assortment of Children's Clothing                     | 1 only   |            | $100.00    |\n| Assortment of Garden Seeds                            | 1 only   |            | $9.31      |\n| Cash                                                  |          |            | $272.00    |\n| Boy's Boots                                           | 24 pairs |            | $50.24     |\n| Food Supplies                                         |          |            | $30.15     |\n| Garden Tools -

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of May 27th last, #166-1-5, and the interview which Mr. Dixon, Field Secretary of our society, had with Dr. McGill on the previous day, I beg to state that Mr. Dixon requested me to send to Dr. McGill as soon as practicable\n\n(1) A statement of what is immediately needed to enable the School to carry on its work in the present emergency quarters.\n\n(2) A full statement of the requirements for a new building.\n\nYou will note from your letter of the 13th instant and my reply to the same on the 16th instant, that the subject matter of Paragraph 1 is receiving our careful attention. With regard to Paragraph 2, I beg to state that I have just received the following information from the Rev. Principal Grant.\n\n\"In connection with (2) it is noted from your letter to Dr. H.W. McGill, dated June 28th that the question of a new school, its site, type and capacity has already been decided on by the church authorities. There is no question but that the logical place for the school is in the southern Yukon. In addition to the fact that on the present site there is a well developed farm, a barn, two chicken houses, septic tank, Principal's residence, etc., the presence of which would...\"\ncut down considerably the cost of rebuilding, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that out of the 44 children in residence during the past academic year, 31 were recruited from the southern Yukon and northern B.C., 7 from central Yukon and only 6 from the north. In addition I may say that practically all applications for admission in recent years have been from parents who live in the vicinity of Carcross and Whitehorse.\n\nIn connection with (1) though, in addition to the equipment already provided at a cost of $652.31, some provision will have to be made before September 15th for a place in which to store garden produce so that it will be well protected from frost during the winter.\n\nA few days ago Major Sandys Wunsch, R.C.M.P., Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon, passed through Carcross. As he did not stop off about all I could do was to draw his attention to this need. This consists of a building, erected on the foundation of the old Workshop. Before the fire the basement of this building was used for storing vegetables. Major Sandys Wunsch asked for plans, approximate cost, etc. Mr. J.E. French, Builder and Contractor, with whom I had previously discussed this need and who was travelling to Whitehorse on the same train as the Major was introduced and I asked him to give this official of the Department all particulars during this journey. Before the train pulled out Mr. French had the opportunity to inform me that the building needed would cost somewhere between $2,000.00 and $3,000.00. What the result of the conversation was on the train I do not know but Major Sandys Wunsch led me to believe, before he left, that he would try and rush the matter through. He was informed that we had to have some place by September 15th in which to store our vegetables.\n\nThe building needed will not only provide a storage place for garden produce but the upper part will give the Farm Instructor and General Assistant some place in which to keep tools, carry out repairs to farm equipment, etc. This is in itself a great need. At the present time repairs can be carried out in the open air but such a practice cannot be followed during the winter.\n\nBefore closing two other needs must be mentioned:-\n\n(1) A typewriter for office use. You have already been advised of this need.\n\n(2) A grant of $240.00 to help meet the cost of the services of a Night Watchman during the coming winter. A copy of a letter going forward today to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, regarding this matter, is enclosed.\n\nA copy of the letter mentioned in Paragraph 2 is enclosed herewith.\nWith regard to the three immediate needs listed in the above letter, namely, the place for storing the vegetables, a typewriter, and a Night Watchman, there can be no reasonable doubt whatever, and any help you may be able to give in providing the same will be greatly appreciated by our Commission and by our Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nN.L.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:-\n\nRe Carcross School:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 13th inst., No. 166-1-5, and my reply to the same on the 16th inst., I beg to state that I have just received the enclosed telegram from the Reverend Principal Grant in reply to one I sent to him on the 17th inst. I trust that the information embodied in this telegram along with that set forth in my letter to you on the 21st inst. may serve as a helpful guide to you in fixing the amount required to provide the two essential buildings mentioned in your letter of the 13th inst.\n\nYou will note that logs are available for both buildings and that the cost of log construction instead of lumber would effect a saving of $2,500.00.\n\nWith regard to Reverend Principal Grant's estimate of the cost of six separate log buildings without concrete basements, and the estimated saving of approximately $14,000.00, I would refer you to the paragraph on Page 2 of my letter to Dr. McGill on June 28th last, where I set forth the unanimous opinion of Bishop Geddes of the Yukon, Rev. L.A. Dixon, Field Secretary of our Society, and myself, that \"the adoption of the cottage system would require one separate building for the bigger girls and one for the smaller girls, one for the bigger boys and\none for the smaller boys, a kitchen and refectory combined, a classroom, two separate recreation rooms, a residence for the Principal, a chapel, a laundry and bakery combined, a workshop and tool-shop combined, toilets, etc.\" My opinion in this matter has not changed and I am convinced that if an attempt were made to get along with six buildings, most, if not all, of the others, would have to be provided at a later date, and that in the end no saving would be effected.\n\nShould you decide to build the dormitories of logs may I suggest that consideration be given to the possibility of building the classrooms in the same way, not merely because of the estimated saving of $500.00, but also to maintain some uniformity of design.\n\nI shall be glad to secure any further information you may require in connection with the buildings in question on receipt of your request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl. 1.\n\nTBRW/KH\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer you to my memoranda of April 18 and May 2 in connection with the destruction by fire of the Carcross Indian residential school.\n\nIn order to carry on the school until provision can be made for the erection of a new building three houses are rented and in addition the old rectory at Carcross is being used.\n\nThe latter building requires the following repairs:\n\n1. Building bunks, tables, benches etc. at a cost of $450.00.\n\n2. Chinking old rectory, making porch and supplying storm windows at a cost of $200.00.\n\n3. Roofing old cellar at scene of fire to furnish store room for vegetables at a cost of $350.00.\n\nThe quotations mentioned above have been obtained from J. E. French, Contractor, Whitehorse, Yukon. Mr. T.V. Sandys-Wunsch, Acting Superintendent, R.C.M.P., and also Acting Agent in the Yukon, considers that the quotations of Mr. French are very reasonable and requests authority to have him proceed with the necessary work immediately in order that the repairs may be completed during the fine weather.\nFunds for the purpose are available in our current year's appropriation and I should appreciate receiving the authority of the Honourable the Minister for the employment of Mr. French to do the work mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding the Carcross Indian residential school you may engage Mr. J.

On July 31st the Indian Agent wrote me from Dawson stating that the Department had sanctioned the roofing over of \"old cellar at scene of fire to furnish store room for vegetables at a cost of $350.00.\"\n\nWhen Mr. J.E. French arrived to undertake this work I asked him if he would place on this basement and put in good repair an old building that was on the school premises, instead of merely roofing the basement over, the whole undertaking not to exceed the $350.00 sanctioned. This he agreed to do and as a result in a week or so we will have a Workshop as well as a place for storing vegetables. The old building that is being repaired and moved was one that was used before the fire in which to store storm windows, etc. Since the fire it has not been of any particular use but will, when repaired and moved make a very good Workshop.\n\nTrusting that this arrangement will meet with your approval,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M.

As he and the experts he has consulted appear to favour a building of log construction, I have no doubt your Department will feel justified in using that material.\n\nThe reference in the closing paragraph of Mr. Grant's letter to a plan of the buildings is in answer to my request for a rough draft which I thought might be of service to your architect when preparing the plans and specifications to be followed. I will forward any plans I may receive from Mr. Grant as soon as they reach me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl. 1.\nTBRN/KH\nThe Secretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n164 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is an answer to your letter of July 28th, 1939.\n\n1. In your letter you state that you have been wondering where we expect to secure building logs in view of the fact that it has been increasingly difficult to secure wood fuel in the vicinity of the school. In the past we have confined our search for firewood within a radius of approximately six miles from the school. Hauling wood this distance with horses was found by experience to be no easy matter. It was hard on the horses, hard on the Farm Instructor and boys and in the short winter days not much could be accomplished. In view of this situation you will recall that a request was made to the Department for a caterpillar tractor. With this item of equipment larger loads of wood could be hauled in much less time and from greater distances. To haul wood with horses a greater distance than six miles from the school seems to be impractical. This spring I discovered an excellent stand of timber about 10 or 12 miles from the school. When the question of building the new school out of logs arose, I took two men out to see what had been discovered. One was Mr. J.E. French and the other Mr. Wm. Chanteler. Both these men are builders and contractors, the latter being a man who has had considerable experience in constructing log buildings. They were quite enthusiastic with what they saw. Mr. French remarked that in his opinion enough logs could be obtained from that site to build more than one school. Mr. Chanteler remarked that he thought at least 500,000 feet of lumber could be cut there. I understood from what was said that should the decision be made to build the school of logs and should Mr. French or Mr. Chanteler be awarded the contract and they worked together on the project, a small portable saw mill would be set up on this site. With this mill the logs would be squared on three sides and hauled to Carcross by means of a caterpillar tractor. There is quite a good road to this stand of timber. In your letter you refer to the possibility\nof rafting the building logs to the old site. This would not be possible as the logs are far removed from navigable water. The only way in which they could be transported to the old school site is by road.\n\nA week or so ago I was introduced to Mr. Rogers, the Vice President and General Manager of the White Pass and Yukon Route. As you know the officials of the W.P. & Y.R. have been wonderful in the help they gave us after the fire. As a matter of fact the range now used in the Kitchen is the property of the company. Apparently Mr. Rogers visited the officials of the Department in Ottawa in order to ascertain if there was anything else they could do to help us out. In the course of conversation the question of a fire-proof building arose and Mr. Rogers told the officials of the Department that there was no such thing. He pointed out, though, that in his opinion the best fire retarding building that could be erected was one made of logs. In a building of this nature, which is cheaper to build than one made out of brick, stone, or concrete, if a fire broke out, the fire fighters would not have to contend with fire inside the walls, which, as you know, is a very difficult thing to extinguish.\n\n2. In the closing paragraph of your letter you mention the use of stone for the walls and partitions of the new buildings. This matter was thoroughly discussed with Mr. French and I cannot do better than to quote what he said:\n\n\"There is no regular building stone in the country. Practically all the country stone is limestone which is entirely unsuitable for building purposes.\"\n\n3. The request for a plan of the two buildings which you state the Government has apparently decided to put up is being given my attention. This will be mailed to you as soon as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) H.C.M. Grant.\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nAugust 29, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant and also copy of a letter received by you from the Principal of the above-noted school attached thereto.\n\nI was particularly well pleased to learn from the Principal's communication that it will be practical and comparatively inexpensive to use logs in the construction of the new school.\n\nYou are probably aware that the Albany R.C. residential school was destroyed by fire a few days ago. This means that we have had two residential schools totally destroyed by fire and destructive fires at three others since our estimates for the present fiscal year were prepared. In view of this fact and in view of the disastrous fires that have occurred at residential schools in the Province of Quebec it is going to be exceedingly difficult to persuade the Minister or Parliament that public funds should be spent on the construction of schools other than those of complete fireproof construction. I have been wondering if it would be possible to have the school at Carcross constructed with interior asbestos or fireproof boards. Would it be at all practicable to have the dormitories downstairs and the heating equipment established outside in a separate building? I hesitate to trouble you in respect to this matter but I feel confident that the Minister will require a great deal more information than I have now in respect to fireproof construction before he approves of the project. You might, at your convenience, communicate with the Principal again in respect to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nRe:- The CHOULTA Indian Residential School-CARCROSS Y.T.\n\nWhilst in Carcross, Y.T., during my return from the inspection of the North End of this Agency, on the 30th of July the Rev. H.C.M. Grant, Principal of the above school was called upon and the Stikine Agency youngsters therein, were seen.\n\nThis is the first time a visit has been paid to that point since the old School Building was burnt down, but all the youngsters were about, receiving their schooling, and all in very good shape.\n\nMr Grant took up the matter of a new building being allowed them, which is sadly wanted as many more in number of children could be sent to that location if such is rebuilt in the future.\n\nHe mentioned the fact that it had been suggested that if the school is rebuilt it should be constructed in \"community\" style. That is to say that several buildings, for their various purposes should be constructed - and not one huge School Building as the old building was.\n\nMay I be allowed to add my voice to his for consideration of such a building scheme, without any doubt whatsoever it would be of great benefit to the Indian youngsters in after life. In the building of such school houses the youngsters could find employment and learn a lesson in construction, for their own future use. Also it is found that when these nomadic children leave these huge, and modern, school buildings; and resume normal conditions in the \"bush\" they are more or less like a fish out of water, and most of them break down, and do nothing for some years after. The extra cost of heating, if any, can be offset against the improvement in health that would come about by using several small buildings instead of one huge affair which in the winter time is filled with compressed foul hot Air.\n\nThe Department will no doubt know already the many advantages to be derived from community settlement buildings in the north country, and I can only state that such a scheme used in the construction of the new Chooulta School Buildings at Carcross in the Yukon Territory, would be a great movement towards having the children more fitted to leave school, when their time is up, and resume normal conditions in the bush, than would be, a real up-to-date - fully furnished modern school building, which represents too high a grade for these nomadic children to achieve during their lifetime.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:-\n\nI have received your letter of the 29th ultimo No. 166-1-E, re the fireproofing of the interior of the proposed new School for Carcross and have asked the Rev. Principal Grant to consult contractors in that part of the Yukon, and furnish me with a recommendation in this connexion. As soon as his reply comes to hand I will write to you again in this matter.\n\nIt was with deep regret that I learned, through press reports, of the destruction by fire of \"the school and hospital\" at Fort Albany, but I was very thankful to note that no lives were lost.\n\nRegarding the proposed school for Carcross I am of the opinion that if the heating equipment can be installed in a detached building, the dormitories could safely be located on the first floor. However, as Mr. Grant is a very practical man, and has some capable men about him from whom he can receive advice, I think it best to await his reply before submitting any specific recommendation in this connexion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Slated B.B.

The conditions under which the school work is being maintained has made it absolutely necessary to have the telephone system which operated between the school and the village of Carcross before the school was destroyed by fire, extended to \"the Principal's office near the station in Carcross\", and to one of the centrally located buildings now occupied by the staff and pupils in the village of Carcross. The telephone line already exists between the Principal's residence on the old school site and the village of Carcross, but one more telephone instrument is required. Principal Grant states that he has received permission from the Controller of the Yukon Territory to run a telephone line over the Government bridge, and a friend of the school will contribute one telephone instrument if we can secure the other.\n\nAny help you may be able to give us in this urgent matter will be duly appreciated by our Commission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, September 14, 1939.\n\nRe: Telephone set - Carcross Residential School\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, in which you submit, for departmental consideration a request received by you for a telephone set, from the Principal of the Carcross school.\n\nThis is a somewhat unusual request, but, in view of the existing conditions at Carcross, the danger of fire, etc., you are authorized to purchase the telephone set requested by the Principal. It is noted that the cost of this set will not exceed $25.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nChooutla Indian Residential School\nCarcross, Yukon, Canada.\nSeptember 11th 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue, East,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt was fortunate that Mr. J.B. French, an expert builder and contractor was in Carcross when your letter of the 1st instant was received. He and I discussed thoroughly the points about which information is required, etc., and beg to report as follows:\n\n1. The suggestion that the proposed new school be lined with asbestos or fire-proof board is an excellent one. Mr. French mentioned Gypsum Board which costs $125.00 per M. if purchased in the Yukon. If purchased in Vancouver in any great quantity it would likely be slightly cheaper than the price quoted. Mr. French pointed out that whilst Gypsum Board is fire-proof there may be other boards on the market equally as good. At the present time he is constructing a Government Radio Station in Whitehorse and Gypsum Board is the lining called for in the revised specifications.\n\n2. We can see no object in having the dormitories downstairs especially if the proposed building was built of logs with adequate fire escapes, lined with Gypsum Board and had the heating plant located in a separate building. As a matter of fact having the dormitories downstairs would make, as you state in your letter a very long building. This would be very difficult to heat in the cold weather.\n\n3. Having the heating plant in a separate building is an excellent suggestion but under no circumstances should it be located to the West of the main school building. At least 95% of the wind in Carcross is from the West, South-west or North-west. When the ground plans are being prepared this aspect of the matter should not be overlooked. In the fire of April 17th 1939 if the Workshop had been located West of the old main School building at the same distance or even closer to the school than it was it would not have been destroyed by fire. As a matter of fact a telephone pole\nlocated about two feet from the west end of the old school building still stands. One of the interesting points arising out of the fire shows how careful one should be in ascertaining the direction of prevailing winds before deciding where to place the outbuildings of importance. Having discussed very thoroughly the danger from fire Mr. French and myself would like to suggest that, as a further safeguard the Diesel lighting Plant, Storage Batteries and especially the engine used to operate the water pump be placed in the same building as the Heating Plant.\n\n4. If the heating and lighting plant etc. were installed in a separate building the only chimney that would be required in the Main School would be one for the Kitchen Range. Mr. French and I recommend that this be what is known as a Yukon Chimney. Mr. French stated that brick chimneys have proved to be the greatest fire hazard in the Yukon, adding that in the many years he has lived in Whitehorse practically all the fires have originated from this cause. There is no question but that the fire of April 17th last, which destroyed the old school was caused by a faulty brick chimney. It is Mr. French's opinion that the amount of creosote coming from the wood fuel eats holes in the mortar and I may add that this is also the opinion of others. As in most buildings the brick chimney is encased with woodwork it is practically impossible to inspect it from time to time or carry out any necessary repairs without tearing down a great part of the building. Another great drawback in this country to a brick chimney is the difficulty of getting a good foundation for same. The presence of frost in the ground all the year round causes buildings to heave and such heaving and settling causes chimneys to crack whether they are made of concrete or brick. In his experience Mr. French has known brick chimneys to settle so much that the part above the roof has become detached from the part below and toppled over. I am certain that the fire of April 17th last was caused by the brick chimney in the old school developing a crack where it went through the roof.\n\n5. In closing may I say that Mr. French asked me to mention that as building logs are not kept in stock like lumber they should be cut this fall or next spring, that is if the school is to be constructed and logs and the building program completed by next fall. These cannot be cut during the winter months owing to the depth of snow, short days, and sub-zero temperatures. He added that if the building is to be completed by next fall and nothing can be done this fall, men should be in the woods cutting the logs required not later than April 1st 1940.\n\nThe plans you refer to in your letter are in the course of preparation and will be forwarded as soon as possible. Mr. French and I have spent some hours on these and an effort is being made to submit something that will be feasible from a constructional point of view. They will only be of rough nature but will give yourself and the Department some idea of the location of the rooms in the building, etc.\nTrusting that the information given and the opinions expressed in the letter will prove to be of use to yourself and the Department,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) H.C.M. Grant.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ult., No. 166-1-5, and my reply to the same on the 5th inst., regarding the above School.\n\nI have just received the enclosed letter from the Rev. Principal Grant, and am of the opinion that it furnishes the information you desired. As the suggestions made by Mr. Grant all appear to me to be eminently sound, I have no hesitation in endorsing them.\n\nI would direct your special attention to paragraph 5 and suggest that, if at all possible, authority be given to have the logs for the new buildings cut this fall. It is my fear that if they are not cut until next spring, they will not have seasoned sufficiently to prevent shrinkage.\n\nAs soon as the rough draft of plans mentioned towards the end of the enclosed letter come to hand, they will be forwarded to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW:S\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, September 27, 1939.\n\nRe: Carcross School\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant and also copy of a communication received by you from the Principal of the Carcross Residential School, attached thereto.\n\nI agree with you that if it is the intention of the Department to proceed with the construction of the school next summer, steps should be immediately taken to secure the logs and have them seasoned by the time the work of construction is really to begin.\n\nI feel that it is only fair to you to state, however, that I have nothing in front of me to indicate what money, if any, will be placed at our disposal by the Government for the construction of schools next year. I have made a number of attempts to secure this information, but no one at the moment seems to be in a position to advise me with respect to the matter. In view of the war conditions confronting us, it might be advisable for you either to interview the Minister personally or to communicate with him by letter, asking him for a definite commitment in respect to a number of matters -\n\nRev.

T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nRe: New Carcross School\n\nYou may recall that when I spoke to you in Ottawa on the 4th inst. (in Mr. Hoey's office) about the prospects of having the new school built at Carcross next year, to take the place of the one destroyed by fire last April, you informed me that a definite decision in the matter might be reached not later than December next when a draft of the Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1940-41 would probably be completed. It is my recollection that I promised to write to you in the matter, and advise you of the possibility of reaching a decision at the earliest date possible in order that arrangements might be made for cutting the logs out of which the new school building and detached classroom are to be constructed.\n\nI have examined, and am forwarding to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training a rough draft of the plan suggested by the Principal of our Carcross School for the new building, and am writing now for the specific purpose of asking that authority be given to cut during the coming winter, and before the sap begins to ascend in the spring, all the logs required for construction purposes. From information received from the Principal an abundance of logs can be secured at a distance of about 10 miles from the school. Local contractors have examined the same, and have expressed their conviction that all the log material required can be secured from this one location. As the logs should be seasoned as well as possible before actual construction begins, it is important that they be cut in the early future, and it will be duly appreciated if you will give the matter the earliest attention possible, and issue the necessary authority for the cutting of the logs to be undertaken.\n\nI am sending you herewith a number of photos which show the buildings in which the work of the school is being carried on at present. After the main school building was burned the buildings in the pictures, some of which belong to our Church, some to the White Pass and Yukon Railway, and some to local residents of the village of Carcross, were placed at the disposal of the school management, and occupied only 24 hours after that tragic event. While the principal of the School and his staff did to be commended for the prompt and vigorous way in which they faced the critical situation, it is obvious that they should not be expected to carry on their work under existing conditions any longer than can possibly be helped. I would therefore most earnestly request that a very special effort be made to have the new school provided next year, and that authority be given at the earliest date.\npossible to undertake the cutting of the logs.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kindly consideration of this important matter,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) T. B. R. Westgate\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nP.S. In due course I would be glad to have the enclosed photos returned.

I am not at all sure that we have in the estimates of this year sufficient funds to meet this expense.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn keeping with the promise made to you during our conversation here yesterday, I am sending you under separate cover the plan for the proposed new school building at Carcross, as prepared by the Rev. Principal Grant.\n\nThe attached letter came with the plan and I am forwarding to Mr. Grant today a copy of the plan and with it the suggestions for improvements in the same on which we agreed yesterday.\n\nIt is my understanding that a two-room classroom will be erected as a separate building with a furnace and accommodation for vocational training in a full sized basement underneath, the basement to have an outside entrance.\n\nIt is also my understanding that the heating and lighting plant for the main school building will either be fully or semi-detached from that building.\n\nYou will note that the plan submitted by the Principal provides accommodation for himself and family at one end of the main school building on the main and second floors. I have always felt that the semi-detached plan for the Principal's accommodation was the best one and would recommend if at all possible that it be adopted in this case. On Mr. Grant's plan, no provision is made...\nfor a bathroom on the main floor and this could be installed if the Principal's quarters were semi-detached.\n\nThe lack of any indication of the location of the chimney is due to the fact that the heating plant is to be located in either a detached or semi-detached building. This will necessitate so far as I know, the installation of either a hot water or steam heating system.\n\nI trust that the plan, which the Principal has undoubtedly taken great pains to prepare, may be sufficiently complete to enable your architect to proceed with the design and specifications to be followed. Should he require any further information we will gladly endeavour to provide it with as little delay as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nTBRW/KH\nChootla Indian Residential School,\nCARCROSS, Yukon,\nCanada.\n\nSeptember 20th, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Avenue East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find the plans suggesting the number of rooms, etc., in the new school the Department are contemplating building next year. In connection with these I would like to make the following comments:\n\n1. In view of the fact that there is a possibility the heating plant and classrooms will be in separate buildings no room for these has been allowed.\n\n2. Quarters for the Principal and family have been provided for on the Main Floor and 2nd Floor at one end of the building.\n\n3. One of the things that was badly needed in the old school was a Boys' Playroom. It is felt that the space designated 'Boy's Gymnasium' would serve for this purpose.\n\n4. In connection with the dimensions given, Mr. French and myself worked on the assumption that this building would provide accommodation for approximately 60 pupils.\n\n5. The two dormitories have been located on the 2nd floor in the front of the building. It has just occurred to me that possibly it would be better if they were at the back. As they are shown on the enclosed plans it would mean that if fire escapes are provided for each dormitory, one set of escapes would have to be on the front of the building. Such an arrangement from an architectural point of view would not be very sightly.\n\n6. No space has been allowed for the Lighting Plant, Storage Batteries and water Pump. It is to be hoped that these will be installed in the separate building provided for the heating plant.\nTrusting that the foregoing comments and the enclosed plans will be of assistance to yourself and the Department,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) H.C.M. Grant.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, November 3, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 27 and also sketch plan of the Carcross residential school, sent forward to you by Principal Grant.\n\nIt is my understanding that the rebuilding of the residential school at Carcross will be discussed with the Minister and the officials of his office immediately following the return of the Minister from England. However, just what provision, if any, we can make for taking out the logs during the winter months, I am not in a position to state at the moment.

His reply reached me this morning and enclosed herewith you will find a copy of the same.\n\nAs the logs have to be conveyed overland a distance of approximately ten miles, the tractor, sleighs and wagon will certainly be required for this work. According to his estimate the cost of these items of equipment would total $3,345.20 and I greatly hope that your Department may be able to purchase and forward these direct, or authorize our Commission to do so.\n\nIn order that the necessary logs may be cut at once and employment given to needy Indians, I also earnestly hope that the Principal's request for $1,500.00 to meet the wages, etc., of the men who will be engaged for this work, be granted. You will note his suggestion that this amount be placed at his disposal in the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Whitehorse, Yukon. The name of the Principal is the Rev. H.C.M.

I also earnestly hope that the items of equipment mentioned (one tractor, four sleighs, one wagon) may also be provided so that the logs can be hauled to the school site during the winter.\n\nI suggested to the Principal that if the logs were dressed at the school, the slabs would furnish a good deal of the wood fuel required from year to year.\nAs the School management should not be expected to carry on their work under prevailing conditions beyond next summer, I trust it may be possible for action to be taken in the immediate future along the lines suggested in the Rev. Principal Grant's telegram.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEnclos.\n\nTBRW/KH\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPH\n\n1939 Nov. 12 P.M. 11 09\nDA156 191 COLLECT NL VIA RADIO SUBJECT COTN 1/61\n\nCARCROSS YT NOV 11\n\nTHE SECRETARY INDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS\nCOMMISSION 38-43 THE BIBLE HOUSE 134 ALEXANDER AVE EAST WPG\n\nIF DEPARTMENT WILL SUPPLY ONE ONLY MODEL TWO DIESEL CATERPILLAR\nTRACTOR FIFTY INCH GAUGE AT ESTIMATED COST OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR\nHUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS FOR CARCROSS PRICE\nQUOTED LAST YEAR BY NORTHERN COMMERCIAL COMPANY WHITEHORSE YUKON FOUR\nHEAVY DUTY SLEIGHS WITH TWO AND ONE HALF IN STEEL RUBBERS AT ESTIMATED\nCOST OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR CARCROSS AND ONE HEAVY DUTY WAGON AT\nESTIMATED COST OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR CARCROSS SCHOOL.\nMANAGEMENT WILL DELIVER ON SCHOOL SITE THIS WINTER SUFICIENT QUANTITY\nUNDRESSED LOGS TO ERECT NEW SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM STOP COST OF GETTING\nLOGS CUT DIESEL OIL FOR CATERPILLAR AND EXTRA HELPFULST HAULING APPROX-\nIMATELY FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS STOP THIS WOULD GIVE EMPLOYMENT MANY\nNEEDY INDIANS IN DISTRICT STOP SUGGEST THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BE\nPLACED AT MY DISPOSAL IN CANADIAN BANK OF COMMERCE WHITEHORSE STOP VERY\nIMPORTANT THIS WORK BE STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE STOP CANNOT GIVE PRIZE\nON SAWMILL STOP IF DEPARTMENT WILL SUPPLY WE CAN BRING LOGS EARLY NEXT\nSPRING ON SCHOOL SITE STOP REGARDING YOUR LETTER OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTH\nREQUEST THAT PRINCIPALS RESIDENCE BE SEMI DETACHED TYPE.

There is little that I can add to the information supplied in that memorandum. If it is the intention of the Government to proceed next year with a building program, both the Carcross and the Albany schools have in my judgment a greater claim for consideration than any of the others. In view of the fact that the schools at these points were totally destroyed by fire during the last year, steps should be immediately taken to provide either Indian day or residential schools at both points. In view of the nomadic habits of the Indians in these districts, I cannot persuade myself that the construction of Indian day schools would meet the needs of the Indian population. I intimated in my memorandum of November 21 that the estimated cost of both these buildings would be approximately $180,000.\n\nDirector.\nWhitehorse, Yukon\n\nSept 22nd 1939\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nIn Account With J.

He states:\n\n\"It has not been the practice of the Department in the past to purchase equipment for temporary use in the construction of Indian day or residential schools, and it may be somewhat difficult to purchase the equipment suggested by you for use at Carcross\".\n\nIn this connection I desire to make it quite clear that the equipment requested would be permanently used at the school. The most expensive item in the list submitted was a caterpillar tractor for hauling the logs. Even before the school was destroyed by fire, an application had been made to your Department for this item of equipment for hauling firewood, as the firewood has now to be cut so far away that the Principal finds it practically impossible to have the hauling done by a team of horses. I can assure you, therefore, that the caterpillar tractor will be of permanent usefulness, and I greatly hope that we may soon be authorized to secure it and the other items so that the work of getting out the logs for the new school may be taken in hand at once, and completed before the spring. The fact that the logs will have to be drawn in over a distance of ten miles seems to me to be sufficient proof of the need of the tractor.\n\nWhile writing I would like to assure you of the deep interest taken by me and my colleagues in your recent eventful visit to England and the \"Western Front\". Your safe return through all the perils of travel under prevailing conditions is welcomed by one and all of us and we heartily thank God for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SGD.) T. B. R. Westgate.\nSecretary of the Commission\nI attach a further letter addressed to the Minister by the Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D., Secretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Winnipeg, dated Jan. 5, in which he refers to the following statement in my letter of Nov. 18th, quote:\n\n\"It has not been the practice of the Department in the past to purchase equipment for temporary use in the construction of Indian day or residential schools, and it may be somewhat difficult to purchase the equipment suggested by you for use at Carcross\",\n\nand advises, quote, in part:\n\n\"In this connexion I desire to make it quite clear that the equipment requested would be permanently used at the School\".\n\nThe letter is submitted for consideration of the further representations therein, and to let the Minister have a draft reply.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\nEnclosure\n\nW.J.

In view of this fact, coupled with the dissolution of Parliament which has now taken place, you can readily appreciate how difficult it would be for me at this date to make any commitment with respect to the departmental building program for the coming year. I can only assure you that I shall be glad to have the officials here carefully review and investigate the desirability of purchasing a tractor, should ways and means be discovered for the construction of the Carcross school later in the year.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for the congratulations extended to me on my safe return from England, contained in the last paragraph of your communication.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend T.B.R.

Sandys\u2014unsch)\n\nFORM No. 506\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 7)\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nShortly after the fire which destroyed the Main School Building and Workshop on April 17th last you visited Carcross and gave authority to rent three buildings from Mr. Matthew Watson @ $25.00 per month. It was felt then that these three buildings and the Church of England Rectory would provide sufficient space for the staff, pupils, etc.\n\n1. The Rectory is used as a Girl's Residence and Playroom. Two bedrooms in this building provide accommodation for two lady staff members.\n\n2. One of Mr. Watson's houses is used as a Classroom.\n\n3. Another of Mr. Watson's buildings houses the boys. In this building there is only one bedroom and that is used by Miss J. Wright the Boy's Supervisor.\n\n4. The third building, owned by Mr. Matthew Watson, is used as a Kitchen, Children's Dining Room, Staff Dining Room and sleeping quarters for two male staff agents who have to share a room. The other bedroom is occupied by Miss E. Hewer, Kitchen Matron.\nAs you can understand it took some time to reorganize things after the fire and then it was found that more buildings were needed. The particulars of these needs are as follows:\n\n1. Store House for food supplies, etc. For a month after the fire these were stored in an old Chicken House and part of the barn on the old school site. Apart from the inconvenience in having our food supplies stored in two buildings approximately two miles from our Kitchen and Dining Room, the unsanitary conditions arising from using a Chicken House and Barn as a store place for food, made it necessary to find another building for a Store House. Consequently arrangements were made with Mr. W.L. Phelps, K.C. of Whitehorse to rent one of his buildings as from May 17th 1939 at a rental of $5.00 per month. It might be mentioned that we have only two shipments of food supplies come in in a year and as a result considerable storage space is needed.\n\n2. Staff Residence. At the time of the fire there were seven members on the staff. It was found necessary in the process of reorganization to increase the staff by one. In order to have accommodation for this extra worker, have some place where the staff could congregate when off duty (this place being known as the Staff Sitting Room) and provide some room where the School Nurse could attend to sick Indians and school children, it was found necessary to rent another building from Mr. Matthew Watson. This was taken possession of on August 1st 1939 at a rental of $25.00 per month. In this building there are three rooms (1) The Living Room is used as the Staff Sitting Room (2) the bedroom as quarters for the school nurse (3) the Kitchen in which the nurse carries out her professional duties.\n\n3. Principal's Residence and Office. From the time of the fire until September 1st 1939 the Principal tried to fulfill\nhis duties and still live in his residence on the old school site. He used an out-building near his residence as an office. It was found well nigh impossible to keep in touch with what was going on and maintain discipline with these quarters approximately two miles from the school. Moving over to town and occupying this present building, with only one bedroom, has made it very difficult for Mrs. Grant and myself. Two of the boys sleep in part of my office, two girls in the Kitchen and two children in our own bedroom. It was a question though, in renting a building for the Principal's Residence and Office, not of our own comfort but the welfare of the school.\n\n4. Laundry. Several months after the fire it was possible to dry the washing outside. When winter came it was an impossibility. The two Supervisors were, from the start of the winter up to December 14th 1939, trying to dry clothing for 45 children by hanging the various garments around the residences. Apart from this inconvenience, the nurse pointed out to me how risky it was from a health point of view for the children having wet clothing hanging on and around their bunks. The only solution to this problem was to rent from Mr. Ross Peebler of Atlin, B.C. a house he owned here for which he charges a rental of $15.00 per month.\n\nI must apologize for not reporting on these matters sooner but felt that it was better to find out for sure exactly what buildings were needed before writing about same. Even though we are still handicapped in not having a Playroom for the Indian boys and being crowded somewhat in the quarters used by the writer and his family I feel that we can carry on with what facilities we are now using until a new school etc. is constructed.\n\nFeeling sure that the Department you represent\nrealizes the difficulty under which we are trying to carry on the work here and will sanction the necessary expenditure to cover the rental cost of the extra buildings,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\n\nEncls.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a statement giving particulars regarding the buildings now in use by the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise whether it is the wish of the Department of Mines and Resources - Indian Affairs Branch - that the owners submit monthly accounts in triplicate covering rental of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M.

T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nRe: Construction Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult., dealing with the important matter indicated above, and to state that when I presented it to our Commission at a meeting held on the 7th inst., under the Chairmanship of the Archbishop of Rupert's Land (Rev. L.A. Dixon, General Secretary of our Society, was also present) the members instructed me to let you know that they were deeply conscious of the many difficulties which the circumstances of war and the dissolution of our Dominion Parliament have created for you and the various departments of government. They desired me to assure you that they would faithfully endeavour not to add to these difficulties, and I have much pleasure in conveying this assurance to you.\n\nIn view of the fact, mentioned in your letter, that no provision was made in the departmental estimates for 1939-40 for the building of the school in question, and in view of the urgent need of this building, I was instructed to say that our Commission would purchase immediately the caterpillar tractor, sleighs and wagon required for hauling out the logs, and pay the Indians for cutting the same, provided you could give an assurance that the total amount thus expended would be refunded to the Commission at an early date after the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 had been passed by Parliament.\nThe total sum required immediately, as stated in my letter to you on Nov. 13th last, is $4,845.20, and is made up as follows:\n\n- Tractor f.o.b. Carcross ....... $2,495.20\n- 4 sleighs ....................... 600.00\n- 1 wagon ......................... 250.00\n- Wages for cutting, etc........... 1,500.00\n\n$ 4,845.20\n\nYou will understand that if the logs are to be brought out this winter, action must be taken immediately. As I gathered from recent letters received from the Principal that the rental charges for the buildings now being used for school purposes will total approximately $1700.00 per year, it would seem to be a good policy to take the earliest steps possible to eliminate the necessity of meeting so heavy an annually recurring expenditure.\n\nI commend the Commission's offer to your careful and sympathetic consideration, and beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBR/KH\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nConstruction of Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nI am sending for consideration the attached letter, Feb. 9, from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Winnipeg, in further reference to the matter above. In view of the definite offer of the Commission therein, you will doubtless require to retain the original letter on the departmental file. We have therefore kept a copy on our own files.\n\nWill you please have a draft reply prepared for the Minister's signature.\n\nW.C. Bethune\nAsst. Private Secretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, February 15, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 3, in which you intimate that the members of your Commission would be prepared to purchase a caterpillar tractor, sleighs, wagon, etc., and pay the required number of Indians for cutting and hauling the logs necessary for the rebuilding of the Carcross Indian residential school, provided I could give an assurance that the total amount thus expended would be refunded to the Commission by the Government after the estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 had been passed by Parliament.\n\nWhile I appreciate the willingness of the members of your Commission to co-operate with the Government in the rebuilding of this school, I regret that I cannot at this date give an assurance that would be at all satisfactory. Such an assurance would not only mean the commitment of the incoming government to the expenditure of $6,245.27 - the estimate submitted by you - but would commit the incoming administration to the construction of this school, and would, in addition to this, commit a parliament that has not yet been elected to this expenditure before the expenditure has even been submitted to it for consideration.\n\nThe only opinion I can express at this time -\n\nReverend T.

Sandys-Wunsch, agent for Indian affairs in the Yukon Territory, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"On 2-5-39 you approved my action in renting temporary accommodation at Carcross as under -\n\n3 houses @ $25.00 each per month - $75.00\n\nand later approved repairs to another house and roofing of a store-room.\n\n\"On 18-1-40 I received the attached letter and accounts from the Reverend H.C.M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross school, from which it appears that he has raised in addition to the above, two houses at $25.00 each per month - $50.00\n\none store-house at $5.00 per month - 5.00\n\none laundry at $15.00 per month - 15.00\n\nTotal - $70.00\n\n\"The Principal had no authority from me for this action but I attach his letter of explanation. I cannot see how I can recommend the payment of accounts of this nature\".\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I was disturbed to learn of this additional commitment at Carcross. No provision was made in the 1939-40 estimates for the payment of rental charges at Carcross, nor has any provision been made for such rental charges in the 1940-41 estimates, prepared and sent forward to the Treasury a few weeks ago.\n\nIn view of the extraordinary conditions now confronting us, instructions have been issued that the estimates in this branch and in a number of departments of the Government cannot exceed the estimates of last year. This means the abandonment of some equally worthy service if the rent at Carcross is to be paid. We do not extend to our Indian agents or inspectors in any section of Canada the right to commit the Government to expenditure without first securing regular authorization from the head Office and you can readily appreciate how difficult it would be to administer our 80 residential schools if principals had the right even in exceptional circumstances to commit the Department to expenditures without first submitting the proposed expenditures to the officials here.\n\nI am not at all disputing the need for the expenditure -\n\nReverend H. C. M. Grant,\nCarcross Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon.\nexpenditure at Carcross. A full and complete explanation is contained in your letter to the Indian agent. However, I feel sure the Treasury officials will challenge our right to make these payments until the need for the payments is carefully reviewed and approved.\n\nThe annual rental at Carcross now amounts to approximately $1,700, or a sum almost equal to the interest charge on capital outlay of $80,000. This appears to be a rather high rental charge for the accommodation and instruction of 40 pupils. I am, however, wholly unfamiliar with local conditions and consequently somewhat helpless in any attempt I might make to render advice. If the buildings are sufficiently close to a reserve or if buildings close to a reserve could be secured, attendance of day pupils might be encouraged. If it is impossible to secure the funds necessary to construct a school at any time in the immediate future, would it be wise to proceed with the construction of the two classrooms, if money were available for such construction? You might make a careful survey of the conditions at Carcross and let me have any comments you may care to send forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe 166-1-5.\n\nOne of the things I would like to do in replying to your letter of March 19th 1940 is to apologize to yourself, as I did to the Indian Agent, for not obtaining authority from the Department before renting the three additional buildings mentioned in your letter. It was felt though, that in view of the exceptional circumstances which had arisen and the need of these buildings I was justified in acting as I did. I will, however, in future, be very careful to secure regular authorization before incurring any expenditure in the name of the Department.\n\nIn the closing paragraph of your letter you mention the 'high rental charge'. In an effort to have this reduced I spoke to Mr. Matthew Watson, the owner of five of the buildings which have been rented and he, realizing the value of the work being done here stated as follows:-\n\"If the Department will pay the rental on three of my houses the school can have the use of the other two without charge until a new school is erected or the Department are in the position to pay for rental of same.\"\n\nIn your letter you state as follows: \"If the buildings are sufficiently close to a reserve or if buildings close to a reserve could be secured, attendance of day pupils might be encouraged.\" In this connection I may say that the buildings we are using are situated quite close to the Carcross Indian Village but only 9 out of the 44 children in residence have their homes in this village. Having these 9 as day pupils would not help a great deal. The other 35 pupils come from many points a long distance from here. For example, I may say, that the parents of two of our girls are at present residing in Fort Macpherson, N.W.T.\n\nWith regard to the construction of two classrooms near our present quarters I do not think this would be a wise policy. When the new school is erected these would be of no use to us at all. It is understood that the old school site is to be the location for a new school. This site is approximately two miles from Carcross Village. Such a journey for the teacher and children to make, especially during the winter months and in the mosquito season would be very arduous. Then having the classrooms so far from our present quarters would destroy the attempt that has been made to centralize our work as much as possible.\n\nTrusting that the information given in this letter will prove to be of help to yourself and the Department you represent,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of February 8 regarding the buildings rented for school purposes at Carcross I wrote to the Principal for an explanation regarding the extra buildings that had been rented without receiving specific authority from the Department.\n\nA reply has recently reached this office and he states that although they are using 5 buildings owned by Mr. Matthew Watson he is willing to allow the continued use of these buildings but only require payment for 3 of them.\n\nConsequently until further notice the Department is prepared to pay the following rent at Carcross:\n\n1. 3 buildings from Mr. Matthew Watson at a monthly rental of $25.00 each from May 1, 1939.\n\n2. 1 building from Mr. W. L. Phelps at a monthly rental of $5.00 from May 17, 1939.\n\n3. 1 building from Mr. R.

A few months ago the Bishop for the Yukon discussed this matter with me, personally, and it is my understanding that he later visited the office of the Minister and discussed the project with the officials there.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that should conditions change at any time in the immediate future, the building of the Carcross School and one or two other schools recently destroyed by fire would have the first claim on the funds that might be available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Phelps, K.C., Whitehorse,\nMarch, 1941 5.00\n\nRoss R. Peebler, Atlin, B.C.,\nMarch, 1941 15.00\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A. Jockell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\nCHOOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\n\nRev. H.C.M. Grant\nPrincipal.\n\nG.A. Jeckell, Esq.,\nController and Indian Agent,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would ask the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, to supply our school, during the present fiscal year, with the following item of equipment:\n\n1 - Only, No. D8 Diesel Caterpillar Tractor - 50\" gauge Model.\nTop Seat;\n13\" Heat Treated Semi-Skeleton Shoes;\nSnow Sprickets;\nFront Pull Hook;\nFront Bumper;\nHood Doors;\nElectric Lighting System - F.O.B. Carcross $2,495.20\n\nThe Northern Commercial Company, Whitehorse, Yukon, which quoted the aforementioned price, has assured the writer that this caterpillar is particularly suitable for operation in northern climates.\n\nSince my appointment to this school in 1930 approximately 2,500 cords of wood have been cut in the vicinity of the school. This means that each year we have to go further afield in order to obtain the 250 cords of wood required each year. The trouble with which we are faced now is not getting the wood cut but getting it hauled. Last winter our teams had to haul wood a distance of 7 miles over bad mountainous trails and the most that could be hauled in one load was approximately one cord and a half. As the years go by the length of haul becomes greater and the time has arrived when it is practically impossible for the wood hauling to be done by horses.\n\nIn the past we have more or less avoided cutting wood along the shores of the lakes in the vicinity of Carcross. In the first place hauling wood here with a team of horses any distance over a lake in winter is a hard and cold undertaking not only for the horses but also for the teamster and his helpers. We tried it one year with the result that the horses played out and it was all the teamsters could do to face the cold and biting winds. In the second place we have avoided cutting wood out on the lake shores because of the short time in which the ice is really safe. Some years there are only three months in the winter in which hauling on the ice can be safely undertaken. Making allowance for the number of days when the inclemency of the weather makes it\nimpossible to send teams out on the lake, it is easily seen that a team hauling a cord and a half per trip per half day cannot get all the wood hauled before the break-up.\n\nThe wood situation here now may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) All areas with six or seven miles from the school from which wood can be hauled along roads sheltered from the wind, have been cut out. Wood can be obtained by going further inland but this would mean too long a haul for horses especially on short days during the winter months.\n\n(b) There is practically an unlimited supply along the lake shores which for reasons given cannot be hauled by a team.\n\n(c) With a Caterpillar tractor it would be possible to haul on the lake, wood from a distance of ten or twelve miles from the school and get it hauled in a comparatively short time. This method of hauling has been put to the test. On one occasion we were allowed the use of a caterpillar tractor, the property of the Northern Airways, Limited. In one half day ten cords were hauled on the lake ice in one trip from a place about four miles from the school.\n\nWould you please inform the Department that this is a pressing need and recommend that authority be given for this purchase to be made before the winter of 1941-1942 sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H.C.M. Grant\n\nPrincipal.\nOn the 11th instant, while in Carcross on matters pertaining to the Yukon Administration, I inspected the Indian Residential School and Barn, and was able in this way to become familiar with conditions that the Reverend Grant, Superintendent of the School, has to contend with in the management and supervision of this institution.\n\nThe Reverend Grant made representations respecting the usefulness that a small type caterpillar tractor would be, particularly in securing yearly supplies of wood for the school.\n\nA considerable quantity of wood is used yearly, and I find that this has to be secured now at a considerable distance from the school. A small type tractor would be a very useful item of equipment.\n\nI asked the Reverend Grant to write me a report respecting the type of caterpillar required, and to furnish an estimate re cost landed, and when making his report to explain the situation in detail for the information of the Department. I enclose a copy of his letter, and I would recommend that favourable consideration be given to his request to be supplied with this equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A. Jeckell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJuly 9, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the request of the Principal of the Carcross Residential School for the Department to purchase a tractor for use at the school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. Under these circumstances it is not possible to favourably consider the purchase of the tractor the cost of which, I note, is estimated at $2495.20.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.A.

Phelps is a small building and appears to be used for storage and supplies for miscellaneous purposes.\n\nOne Building is rented from Ross R. Peebler. This building appears to be in good condition and is satisfactory.\n\nThe former lease represented that three buildings were rented from Matthew Watson at a cost of $75.00 monthly. I find as a matter of fact that five buildings are being supplied by Matthew Watson. The rental of $75.00 per month is satisfactory for five buildings, provided two of these buildings be improved immediately at the close of the school term. The building used for class room purposes I find to be a log building; the interior unfinished. The teacher reported to me that the building was cold in the winter time, and it did not present a bright and attractive appearance for a class room for children.\n\nOne other building rented from Matthew Watson is used as a barn. It is said I find it also to be badly in need of repair, the walls being covered with old torn paper and in such condition that they could not be kept clean. I interviewed the owner of these two buildings, Matthew Watson, and insisted that both buildings be lined with insulating board, walls and ceiling, and this he has agreed to do.\n\nLeases have been prepared by Reverend Grant, and I enclose one copy for the Department of each lease completed by the Reverend Grant. I spoke to Reverend Grant respecting the Matthew Watson Lease, since it only mentioned three buildings, and five buildings were being supplied, and he stated the facts respecting this were known to the former Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am grateful to you, though, for your efforts to obtain for us this much needed item of equipment and trust that an appropriation will be made next year to cover cost of same.\n\nIn your letter it is noted that $500.00 has been set aside for repairs, improvements, etc. One matter that I omitted to mention during your inspection this year was the need for a new floor, mangers and stall partitions in our barn. This building is the property of the Department and has a total floor space of approximately 1,500 square feet. After ascertaining the amount of lumber and nails that would be required and the price of same the conclusion has been reached that $500.00 would meet the cost of all material but not sufficient to pay a carpenter to do the work. In view of this the male agents on the staff with the assistance of the elders boys could, if the material was supplied, do the carpentering work necessary. Would you therefore give me the necessary authority to purchase what lumber, etc., that would be required the cost of same not to exceed $500.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H.C.M.

Grant, Principal of the Choctaw Indian Residential School, has made application for the expenditure of $500.00 towards the purchase of lumber and nails to be used in renewing the floor, managers, and stall partitions in the barn at the said school. He states that the building in question is the property of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI enclose a copy of Reverend Grant's letter of the 21st instant containing this request, and as he has stated in the letter, the need for this improvement was not brought to my attention on the occasion of my inspection of the School in June last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A.

P. for North Renfrew,\nEganville, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Warren:\n\nThank you very much for all the trouble you went to in finding out from my parents about \"the natural state of the beast\", and also for your advice in the matter.\n\nIt seems that every time that I write to you, it is always to ask a favour. This time I am asking you a favour which, I suppose, will be like the last one, of no benefit to us. It is about the purchase of a caterpillar-tractor for this school by the Government; a machine, may I say, that is of a great necessity here in our Indian Residential School at Carcross.\n\nAt the present time, some of our pupils, who were out on holiday, have not returned, owing to the fact that during the summer vacation they have told their parents about our wood-haul. I know myself that it is very dangerous, much too dangerous a haul to ask any boy in this school to be responsible for handling a team of horses in such a place. You know yourself of my experience in the logging-camps of Ontario, and that I would not make such a statement to anyone if it were not so. In the past, we have tried to persuade the Government to supply this school with a tractor; but apparently they think it would be a luxury! If any of the Members think it a luxury to provide a tractor for this northern school, I would advise them to put on a pair of overalls and gloves and come up here for a year or two, then they might realize that such a machine is not a luxury but an absolute necessity. This is the reason why the parents do not want to send the pupils back to school, thinking it too dangerous a job.\n\nThe haul that I speak of is of around four miles. I should say that two miles and a half of this is done the side of a mountain. The equipment that we have here now is of little use to us in such a haul. We have to depend upon rough-logs or chains on the runners, not very substantial when you are coming down the side of a mountain lickety-split and happen to hit a stone. The result is that away goes Mr. Rough-log and sends you to the bottom a whole lot faster than you would otherwise expect. The road, as you could imagine, on the side of a mountain, is not very straight, and unless you are an expert horseman you don't make the first turn you come to. Instead, you hit for the best opening that Mother Nature has provided in the woods. Sometimes these openings are feet and feet between. The first thing you know, you are piled up in the bush, which I don't think is a very safe thing for any boy of thirteen or fourteen years of age. If he does happen to make the turn,\nthe next calamity I suppose would be the load upsetting. Our wood being cut in four-foot lengths and piled on the sleigh over four feet high is a very tottlesish thing rounding the curve at such a pace. The Government is trying to cut down expenses as much as possible and are wondering why some of our boys have to spend quite a period of time in the hospital at Whitehorse, forty-four miles away. This is the reason why I say that a tractor is much more a necessity than a luxury for a good many times if a boy is hurt in the winter a plane has to be chartered to take the boy to the hospital for the simple reason that trains are few and far between.\n\nAnother expense that I believe the Government has to deal with is the equipment. You know yourself that in a haul of this kind that horse-equipment is far too light, resulting in new equipment being bought every few years. With a caterpillar-tractor and proper tracked sleighs, the outlay would amount to a good deal I know on the stock basis as you can see for yourself from my description of the haul, it would be much cheaper in the end. With the freight rates being so high here, I would say, in a few years' time the equipment needed for horses would pay for a tractor.\n\nNot only would a tractor help in the wood-haul, but if this school is ever re-built and a log-building erected, there is suitable timber in this country not too far away, so that a person could get at it with a tractor. This, in my mind, would be much cheaper to do than to build a frame-building, the lumber for which in the Yukon would run to about ninety dollars per thousand. I am not looking out for comforts for myself or for the school, but trying to point out the savings that this machine would render in the years to come.\n\nWith mining opening up in Atlin, it means that a lot of heavy mining equipment is being brought in during the winter, which is of course the most suitable season for its transport over the ice. Therefore tractors are the only logical method for its transport. Here is where the school may be able to get the odd trip which would help to supply the money for the tractor's up-keep. I would say that about a three-ton Diesel tractor would be the proper size for our purpose.\n\nIf this is going to go through at all I would appreciate it very much if you would let me know as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting that this is not too much trouble and that it will meet with some approval, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRoss Kilbey.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 7th, 1941.\n\nThe Honourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nI am going to enclose a letter which I have received from Ross Kilby, formerly of Golden Lake, but now of Carcross, Yukon.\n\nI know this fellow very well, as he had been pestering me at the beginning of the war to help him get into the Navy or Air Force. Two years ago he signed a five-year contract to manage this farm in connection with an Indian Residential School. Recently I had a letter from him, again pleading for assistance to get into the Navy.\n\nI visited this boy's parents and found that there would be no chance whatever of his being accepted in either services, so advised him to stick on the job where he is, rather than pay his own way out, as there would be practically no chance at all of his qualifying physically. I might add that Kilby's two sisters are both in Indian Residential Schools, one at Sioux Lookout and the other one at some more distant point.\n\nHe is a fine young man and I do not think would ask for anything that would not be beneficial in the work he is doing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) R. M Warren, M P.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nCarcross Indian Residential School.\nNeed of TRACTOR for wood-haul.\n\nWill you please have special note taken of the attached correspondence received from Mr. R.M. Warren, M.P., his letter to the Minister Nov. 7th, forwarding one from Mr. Ross Kilbey, Chocutla School, Carcross, Yukon, Oct. 25, pointing out the great need of a tractor for their wood-haul.\n\nWhen the matter has been duly considered, will you please return the correspondence with a draft letter to Mr. Warren in reply, for the Minister's signature.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEncs.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, November 14, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Warren:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 7 and also communication received by you from Mr. Ross Kilby, of the Carcross Indian Residential School, enclosed therewith.\n\nThe Carcross Residential School is operated by the Anglican Church, in co-operation with this Department. The school building itself was destroyed by fire about two years ago, and I regret that the funds at our disposal have not enabled us to erect a new building. However, a residence, suitable for classroom work, and a limited amount of dormitory accommodation was secured immediately following the fire. The school has at this date an authorized enrolment of 40 pupils and a per capita grant of $50 per annum is allowed by this Department.\n\nIt has not been the policy of the Department at any time to provide tractors at Indian residential schools. A large majority of the schools use horses for their farm work and for the hauling of their fuel supply. The use of horses provides valuable training for the senior pupils. Few tractors are used by Indians on the reserves, and the purchase of a Caterpillar Diesel tractor, in a critical period such as this, could scarcely be justified for a school with an enrolment of 40 pupils.\n\nWhen money is available for the construction of a new school at Carcross, consideration will\u2014\n\nR. M. Warren, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nwill be given to the desirability of securing a site near to an adequate wood supply.\n\nI should add that Dr. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, visited the Department a few weeks ago, and at that time the needs of the Indian residential schools operated by the Anglican Church were very carefully reviewed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch. Dr. Westgate did not however request a tractor for the Carcross School. He was no doubt of the opinion at that time that there were other supplies more urgently needed at a number of the schools operated by his Commission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

The principal was interviewed and the buildings, seven in all, being used until a new school can be constructed, were inspected. The danger from fire in these old buildings is always present and very little fire-fighting equipment was in evidence. Water has to be carried by bucket from a river about 75 yards distant. However, the buildings could be quickly evacuated in case of fire as they are all one story and the windows are close to the ground. Some of the buildings were not particularly clean but considering the circumstances under which the school operates it is probably as clean as could be expected. The attendance was 33 and the children's health good. School work seems satisfactory.\n\nR.H.S.

School Commission,\n38 - 43 The Bible House,\n184 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEven though I should have dispensed with the services of our Night Watchman on March 31st 1942 it has been necessary to keep him on and one should be filling that position as long as there are United States' Troops stationed here.\n\nOn three occasions soldiers, coloured and white, have attempted to gain entry into the Girls' Residence. It was only the vigilance of our Night Watchman which prevented a possible serious crime from being committed. One episode took place a few nights ago. Mrs. Davis awoke from sleep about 1.30 a.m. and saw a negro attempting to get into her room through the window. He had removed the wire screen, raised the sash and lit a candle. It was the light which awakened Mrs. Davis. She immediately called out and the negro disappeared. It seems likely that this negro and possibly others who were in hiding near the Girls' Residence were watching the movements of the Night Watchman. He was having his lunch at the time but fortunately was within calling distance. If a man had not been up and around I hate to think what might have happened.\n\nTo give you some idea of the gravity of the situation here I may say that when the negro troops now stationed here were in Skagway one of them raped a woman over 50 years old during the absence of her husband. It is also reported that another case of rape, this time a girl of 9 years old, took place in Whitehorse. Even though we have 2 Mounted Policemen in Carcross and certain military police they have quite a time dealing with approximately 1,500 men. The woman on the staff of our school have stated on several occasions what a relief it is to have a Night Watchman who can give the alarm if anything happens.\nThe present Night Watchman (Mr. T. Brooks) told me that he can promise to remain on the job until the end of June. Likely after that date, if necessary, we can get someone else.\n\nSeeing that the Department pay for the services of a Night Watchman up to March 31st 1942 only it would be appreciated if you would advise what can be done about paying Mr. Brooks. At the end of this month he will have 2 months' salary coming.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) H. C. M. Grant.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYou may recall that during my recent visit to Ottawa I spoke to you about the urgent need of continuing the services of the Night Watchman at the Carcross School. This need is quite fully set forth in the enclosed letter from the Rev. Principal Grant, and it will be appreciated if your Department will authorize the continuance of the services of the present Night Watchman (Mr. T. Brooks) until the end of June at the rate allowed for him during the winter months, namely $40.00 per month.\n\nThe question of the need of the services of a Night Watchman after the end of June will depend on the decision of the Government regarding the transfer of the staff and pupils of this school to Dawson, and the continued presence in Carcross of the troops mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 3rd instant, addressed to Dr. McGill, has been referred to me.\n\nIn view of the special conditions existing in Carcross at the present time it has been decided to allow payment for the night watchman at the winter rate of $40.00 a month until June 30. You may, therefore, forward a voucher for the amount due for the months of April, May and June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

February 4, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe:- Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nIn Departmental letter dated July 13, 1939, the suggestion was made that the new Carcross School building might be constructed of logs, and while we realise that capital expenditure for this purpose may not be available in the immediate future, it would be helpful to our Commission and our Society in formulating our plans if your architect could furnish us, for consideration in advance, with a design of the main and subsidiary buildings which you consider would meet the requirements of a pupilage of not less than 80.\n\nThe opinion of our Commission, with regard to the type of building to be erected, to take the place of the one destroyed by fire was set forth in my letter to the Director of your Department on June 28th, 1939, and with my letter to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training on October 27th, 1939, I enclosed a sketch of the new building as drawn by the Rev. Principal Grant. Departmental replies to these letters were dated Ottawa, July 13, 1939, (#166-1-5) and Ottawa, November 3rd, 1939, (#166-1-6).\n\nAs our Society stands greatly in need of other Indian Residential Schools in the remoter parts of Canada, namely, one to take the place of the Mackay School destroyed by fire some years ago, and another to take the place of the Fort George School recently destroyed by fire, in addition to new school buildings at Whitefish Lake and Wabasca, the design adopted for the new Carcross School might serve for the others as well.\nThis information will help you to understand why I consider it important that careful attention be given at the earliest date possible to the adoption of an approved design for these various institutions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the M.S.C.C.\n\nThe officials of this Branch do not feel inclined to forward to Dr. Westgate the plans which he requests, as such action might be construed as an acknowledgment that it is our intention to construct the residential schools which he mentions.\n\nIf possible, I should appreciate an expression of your views regarding the possible action that may be taken in years to come in regard to replacing the schools to which Dr. Westgate refers.\n\nDirector.\nCarcross, Yukon.\nJanuary 5th 1943\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDr Mr. Matthew Watson, Carcross, Yukon.\n\nDecember 5th 1942 - To rental three buildings (used by the Carcross Indian Residential School) @ $25.00 per month each for the month of December 1942.\n\n$75.00\n\n* * *\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\n\nPrincipal,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhitehorse, Yukon.\nJanuary 5th 1948\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDr Mr. W.L.

Dr. Westgate.\n\nThe Minister agrees with your views, namely that it would not be wise at this time to give Doctor Westgate any encouragement that either in the near future or after the war we will be able to enter upon any large program of building new residential schools.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, February 22, 1943.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in which you review the places where you feel that new residential schools should be erected and requesting that a plan be prepared.\n\nDue to the fact that no funds are provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of new residential schools and the further fact that we have not received any assurance whatsoever that funds for this purpose will be provided in the immediate future, I thought it advisable to submit your request to the Minister's office. The opinion has been expressed that it is not advisable, at the present time, to give you any encouragement that either in the near future or after the war we will be able to enter upon any large programme of building new residential schools. Under these circumstances we feel that there is no necessity for preparing any plan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

The letter does not indicate that the respective landlords have been notified by the Department. In consequence I have today written Mr. W.L.

This is the first report that we have received regarding such intention on your part and I should appreciate your advising if it is your intention to proceed with the erection of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey\n\nRe: Carcross School\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just read your letter of November 3rd, #166-1-5, with great surprise, and regret that at the moment I can add nothing to the information given by your Indian Agent at Dawson. It is most disconcerting, however, to learn that the Department has not been aware of the desire of our Church to have this school rebuilt. The matter was presented to the Director by the Bishop of Yukon and myself on September 18th, and it has been my understanding that the Bishop returned for a full consultation a few days later.\n\nI may say that the closing of this school was reported to the Executive Committee of our Missionary Society on September 7th, and the feeling was then strongly expressed that everything possible should be done to have it reopened without delay. The Bishop of Yukon was called into consultation and after hearing from him, the Executive Committee passed a motion affirming the conviction that the work begun by Bishop Bompas must be continued at all costs, and appointed a Committee to deal with the matter. It was understood that this Committee would send a delegation to Ottawa, after obtaining the authority of General Synod to incur any necessary expenditure. The decision of the Department not to rebuild the school until after the war, was in mind, but it was hoped that some financial assistance might be available, either from the unexpended allocation or in lieu of rent being paid up to now for temporary quarters. It was the judgment of Bishop Geddes and Principal Grant that buildings could be erected on the old site of such a nature that the full quota of pupils could be cared for until the permanent school is built, and could later serve in a permanent way as manual training shops or residences. It was hoped that if\nthe Department did not feel able to erect such units of the complete school plant at this time, it might approve of the Church doing so, and give some assurance of reimbursement of the cost later on.\n\nThe Committee later secured the desired authority from General Synod, and Bishop Geddes and I were deputed to proceed to Ottawa and advise the Department of our desires. As the Sarcee question had also arisen, the House of Bishops asked the Bishop of Ottawa to accompany us in that connection. You will recall our conference in Dr. McGill's office on a Saturday morning and it must have been after you had withdrawn that the discussion passed on to Carcross. The Director was sympathetic but felt that the question of possible expenditure should be referred to the Minister. When it was found that Mr. Crerar was out of the City, an appointment was made for the following Tuesday and Bishop Geddes arranged to return to Ottawa after spending the weekend in Montreal. As the matter was thus deferred for a couple of days and its presentation left in Bishop Geddes' hands, I did not discuss it in my subsequent conversation with you.\n\nI am afraid that my knowledge ends at this point. Having arranged to visit Moose Factory, I was compelled to leave Ottawa before the Bishop's return and I have received no information as to what transpired. On reaching Winnipeg, I was disappointed to learn that he had returned to the Yukon by air and that no word had been received from him. I wrote for information but have as yet no reply, and have concluded that the Bishop is on one of his journeys in the north. It may be that he has been waiting to secure alternative plans and costs, and that we shall be hearing from him before the meeting of our Missionary Society's Executive in Toronto on November 23rd. A few days ago, I wrote to our General Secretary, Canon Dixon, in regard to the matter and asked him to endeavour to obtain some information by telegraph.\n\nI regret the length of this letter, but it seemed necessary to state the facts fully, seeing that by some inadvertence you have not been informed of what has transpired. I hope to be in a position to deal with this matter more intelligently when I see you on the 26th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A. Elderwood\n\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 9th, I have just received from our Head Office in Toronto a copy of telegram received from Bishop Geddes in the following terms:\n\n\"OTTAWA ASKED US TO SUBMIT DEFINITE PLANS OF PROPOSED BUILDING AND COST OF SAME. SINCE MY RETURN HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PLANS IN CONSULTATION WITH PRINCIPAL GRANT AND AM NOW AWAITING INFORMATION FROM VANCOUVER AS TO COSTS. WHEN THESE RECEIVED WILL FORWARD THEM TO YOU FOR SUBMISSION TO OTTAWA\"\n\nIn view of our message to the Bishop, I am sure he will do everything possible to obtain the necessary estimates so that we may be in a position to discuss the matter intelligently with you. Meanwhile, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHAA:WS\n\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10 Volume 6480)\n\nFile 940-5, part 6\nYukon Agency - Carcross Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts -\nGeneral Administration. 1938 - 1939\n\nFile 940-5, part 7\nYukon Agency - Carcross Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts-\nGeneral Administration. 1939 - 1940\n\nFile 940-5, part 8\nYukon Agency - Carcross Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts-\nBuilding Rental-General Administration.\n1940 - 1943\n\nFile 940-5, part 9\nYukon Agency - Carcross Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts-\nPrincipal's Residence. 1943 - 1949\n\nFile 940-5, part 10\nYukon Agency - Carcross Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1949\n| Reference | Remarks | Date |\n|-----------|---------|------|\n| E1 CH19   | W.76    | 9/2  |\n| E1 CH19   | Refers to Vos. on (signature) | 9/2  |\n| D1A       | Signature | 10/3 |\n| E1 CH19   | M16, M14, M10, M13, M15 | 1/3  |\n| E1        | 29325   |      |\n| E1        | 231     |      |\n| E4        | M15/M16/M15/M15/M17/M17/M17/M17 | 2/3  |\n| E1        | M10/19/17/186 | 2/3  |\n| E1        | 231     | 2/3  |\n| E1        | 4770    | 2/3  |\n| E4 CH19   | No. 2034-204 | 3/3  |\n| E1        | 150/123 | 1/4  |\n| E1        | 9470    | 6/3  |\n| E1 CH19   | M10/21/22/23 | 6/3  |\n| E1        | 27007   | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | 24211   | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | Letter Request | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | Lee Henry | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 26897   | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 26605   | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | Reg.    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 1348    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | 1703    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1        | 2783    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 5627    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 5626    | 7/4/49 |\n| E1 CH19   | 7004    | 7/4/49 |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, File 940-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Date       | P.A. | Initials | Remarks                  |\n|------------|------|----------|--------------------------|\n| 28/10/48   | PA   | 20/10    |                          |\n|            | PA   | 37/11    |                          |\n| 20/11      | PA   | 57/11    |                          |\n| 20/11/49   | PA   | 41/11    |                          |\n| 15/11/49   | PA   | 18/11    |                          |\n| 16/11/49   | PA   | 17/11    |                          |\n| 23/11/49   | PA   | 27/11    |                          |\n| 2/12/49    | PA   | 11/12    |                          |\n| 24/12/49   | PA   | 20/12    |                          |\n| 27/12/49   | PA   | 24/12    |                          |\n| 8/1/49     | PA   | 20/12    |                          |\n| 1/1/49     | PA   | 21/12    |                          |\n| 1/1/49     | PA   | 21/12    |                          |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | P.A.

It is noted that the Department of Indian Affairs would not pay rent after June 30th, 1943.\n\nIn the first place as I was informed by the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission that the Indian Department had approved the closing of this school on June 15th and re-opening it on August 15th I could not inform the owners of these buildings that no rent would be paid after June 30th, 1943. At the time this information was received the question as to whether or not the school work here was to be continued had not been decided on and the two months' closure period from June 15th to August 15th was regarded as the usual annual summer holidays.\n\nIn the second place, if the Department of Indian Affairs are not going to pay rent on any of the buildings would you kindly inform me where I am going to store such government equipment as double deck bunks, washing machines, school desks, etc., etc. When it was finally decided not to re-open the school this fall I had all this equipment stored in one building. This building belongs to Mr. R.R. Feebler of Atlin, B.C. and the rent for same has been $15.00 per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"H.C.M.

He also advises that he has, for many years, had control of the distribution of classroom supplies to various day schools throughout the Yukon Territory.\n\nUnder the circumstances the Department will, no doubt, want to retain these supplies for use at the local residential school, when same reopens. In any event I regret to inform you there is no storage space available at this post where supplies of this nature could be safely stored.\n\nCst.\n\n(D.Bolger) Reg.No. 12053,\nI/c. Carcross Detachment.\n\nFor your information reference to your letter of August 30th and further to my minute of 1-10-43. Our Carcross detachment consists of one four room cabin with accommodation for two members.\n\n(H.H. Cronkhite), Insp.\nComdg. Whitehorse Sub-Division.\nDawson, Y.T.,\nNovember 24th, 1943.\n\nRe: Carcross Residential School.\n\nFollowing a suggestion contained in correspondence from the Department, I enquired of the R.C.M. Police as to whether or not arrangement could be made with their Carcross Detachment for storage of Indian Day School supplies. I am now in receipt of reply, duplicate of which is enclosed herewith.\n\nYou will note that recent correspondence has disclosed that Principal Grant has stored school equipment in the Peebler building, accounts for the rent of which have recently gone forward with recommendation for payment.\n\nJ.E.

Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing letter from the R.C.M.P. in which they state that they are unable to provide any storage space for the supplies from the Carcross School.\n\nThe account which you submitted under cover of your letter of the 16th instant for $75.00 for rental of the building at Carcross for the months of July, August, September, October and November is being paid and, from the information given in both your letters, it is evident that we will have to continue renting this building for the purpose mentioned.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWhile no money has been provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of new buildings to replace the Carcross and Fort George Residential Schools, I understand from references in letters received recently that the Church of England is erecting buildings at both the points mentioned.\n\nIf the information I have received is correct, you can understand that we are very much interested and would be glad to know when you expect the new buildings to be ready for occupation. I should also appreciate any information you can let me have regarding the dimensions of each of them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C.

Bishop Geddes is giving personal supervision to this work in conjunction with Archdeacon Grant, who will be the Principal of the School when it is opened. I am advised that already twenty applications for admission to the School have been received without any attempt at recruiting and the Bishop is confident that a full enrolment will be secured.\n\nThe Bishop writes about several pieces of equipment which he feels the Department may be able to secure, possibly through some reciprocal arrangement with the American Government. I think it well to quote from his letter\u2014\"There are two items of equipment that we need that I think the Department at Ottawa should supply. One is a small Caterpillar Tractor and the other a lighting plant. The U.S. Army have many of both of these pieces of equipment in the country and already are beginning to ship them out. Do you think you could persuade Mr. Hoey to secure these for us? A tractor would be of far more value to us than the two teams of horses that we formerly had. A truck could also be used if it were obtainable, but the first two mentioned are the more essential. The U.S.E.D. began this week on a shipment of 6000 pieces of equipment from Whitehorse to Skagway and thence back to the U.S. It will probably take them two or three months to get this shipment out of the country and there will be other such shipments to follow. Most of the construction work of the U.S.E.D. will be completed by September, so unless we secure these this summer it may not be possible to do so another year. Then too there are some buildings at Carcross that could be turned into a warehouse for our School. I wonder if Mr. Hoey would try to get one of these for us.\"\n\nI trust that it may be possible for some of this equipment to be secured, seeing how difficult it is to obtain at the present time. We endeavoured to secure some of the buildings that have been in use but were informed that they could not be erected again after having been several times taken down and moved. Unfortunately this\nhas necessitated a heavier cost for building and we appear already to have incurred an expenditure of some eighteen thousand dollars.\n\nAwaiting with interest your kind reply, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:MVC.\nMay 17, 1944.\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReplying to your letter of May 5th (1946-1-5) I beg to advise you that the schools at Carcross and Fort George are now under construction and that there is every possibility that both will be in readiness for opening at the close of the summer.\n\nAt Fort George, building operations were commenced last summer and the main structure was closed in before the winter commenced, so that a good deal of interior work went on without interruption. The Bishop of the Arctic has personally planned and directed this project and intends to proceed to Fort George by the first boat this season and possibly to spend a month there. I am advised that the building is 101'6\" by 65' and is an excellent building in every way. There has been considerable difficulty in securing the necessary materials but matters are now well advanced and there should be no difficulty in completing the work this summer.\n\nAt Carcross, the situation also is most hopeful. We are holding in mind the intention of the Department to construct a permanent building in place of that which was destroyed by fire in 1939. In view, however, of the fact that the rented buildings in the village of Carcross were condemned by medical authority and that our children could not otherwise be provided for, our Missionary Society decided to go ahead with the construction of temporary buildings to serve until such time as the Government school can be rebuilt. Attempts were made to secure suitable used buildings in the territory but in the opinion of Bishop Geddes this was not possible. It was also found impossible to secure labour for log buildings or all the necessary lumber for a frame structure. We have, therefore, taken the only remaining alternative and have secured from Vancouver three prefabricated buildings, each 24' by 72' which will be constructed in the form of the letter H. These are good buildings and will be well finished within and painted on the exterior. They are built to stand the winter conditions of the Yukon and careful plans have been prepared so that the school may operate with maximum efficiency. My latest information was to the effect that all the material had arrived on the school site and that a local contractor with much experience in erecting such buildings was preparing to undertake the work. By this time it should be well in hand and there should\nbe no difficulty in reopening the school at the end of August, as much of the former equipment is in storage at Carcross. I understand that applications are already being received and we are hopeful that 50 pupils may be accommodated.\n\nTrusting this information will meet your requirements,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Carcross Residential School\n\nThe Carcross Residential School was destroyed by fire on April 17, 1939. Since that time the Department has been unable to provide funds for its re-erection. The Church of England authorities have proceeded to erect a school, using their own funds, and we have just been advised that construction of the building will be completed in less than a month. Construction of the building is under the supervision of Right Reverend W.A. Geddes, B.A., Bishop of Yukon, and, in a letter recently received, he writes in part as follows:\n\n\"There are two items of equipment that we need that I think the Department at Ottawa should supply. One is a small caterpillar tractor and the other a lighting plant. The U.S. Army have many of both of these pieces of equipment in the country and already are beginning to ship them out.

Most of the construction work of the U.S.E.D. will be completed by September, so, unless we secure these this summer, it may not be possible to do so another year.\"\nThere is no doubt that if the equipment mentioned could be secured the Church of England authorities would be able to make good use of it in the operation of the Carcross School. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would make inquiries with a view to ascertaining if it is possible to secure the equipment desired.\n\nRight Reverend W.A. Geddes resides in Dawson City, Yukon.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCarcross, Yukon.\nMay 8th, 1944.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nDAWSON, Yukon,\n\nSir:\n\nThe construction of a new Carcross Indian Residential School is now well under way and I am beginning to think of what will be required in the way of equipment, etc., when the school re-opens this fall.\n\nOne very important item which I trust the Department will supply is 50 Cot Mattresses for the children's beds. Prior to the closing of the school many of the children had no mattresses and those mattresses we had were in such poor condition they had to be destroyed.\n\nKnowing that you will do all in your power to obtain for us this very necessary item, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. C. M. Grant, Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Rev. H. C. M. Grant, which is self-explanatory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. E. Gibben,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJEG/B.\nOttawa,\nJune 2, 1944.\n\nMr. J.E. Gibben, Indian Agent, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, please let me know the exact size of the mattresses that the Principal of the Carcross School wishes to obtain.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDawson, V. T.,\nJune 26, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Carcross Residential School.\n\nAs you know, the Carcross Residential School is now in process of reconstruction, and there is an immediate need for supplies, so that the school can be ready for occupation before the fall term sets in.\n\nSome weeks ago, I had some correspondence with your Department with reference to the purchase of cots, and it was suggested that I should obtain information with regard to the School's requirements. Accordingly, I discussed the matter with Bishop Geddes just prior to his recent visit to Carcross. Bishop Geddes is in my office as this letter is dictated. He has advised me of an interview he had with Captain Eckner of the United States Quartermaster Stores Department. Captain Eckner has been in the southern part of the Territory since the United States forces first commenced to work on the war projects, having set up stores at Carcross in the early stages of development. He knows the Indian School and is more or less familiar with its requirements.\n\nBishop Geddes obtained from him a list of equipment which it is suggested would probably be available for purchase for the School. Bishop Geddes has checked the list carefully, and feels that the various items contained should be obtained for the use of the School at the present time as they can probably be had at a salvage price, involving a considerable saving. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the list submitted by Bishop Geddes.\n\nNegotiation for the purchase of this equipment should probably be conducted by Major-General Foster, with the appropriate United States Department in Edmonton. It\n\n......appears\nappears that supplies and equipment are being shipped out of Whitehorse daily, and if we are to obtain any of this material, we should act promptly. The Bishop is naturally anxious that the Government should bear as much of the expense involved in purchasing equipment as is possible. It might be advisable for General Foster to obtain a figure on the purchase of all the equipment noted. The Government could then indicate what proportion of this amount they would be prepared to pay. Bishop Geddes would then consider whether or not the Church could meet the balance.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would give this matter early attention and let me have your reaction as soon as possible, so that I may advise Bishop Geddes.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJEG/ACB.\nEnc.-1.\n\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nLIST OF EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR CARCROSS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n60 Mattresses 3' x 6'\n6 Iron Cots\n60 Pillows\n100 Blankets Woollen\n100 prs.

This line crossed two roads in Carcross and the Government Bridge. For a distance of approximately one mile it was attached to the poles running parallel to the White Pass and Yukon Railway. It then cut across country and at one point crossed the road that leads from Carcross to Tagish. The damage done to this line is as follows:-\n\n1. Trucks operated by the Betchel-Price-Callahan Company broke the line where it crossed the two roads in Carcross. These breaks were not repaired.\n\n2. When a Flying Fortress was salvaged recently from Lake Bennett it was necessary for the Government Bridge to be opened. This occasioned the telephone line being cut and it is still broken.\n\n3. Some years before the war the school obtained permission\nto affix this line to the poles along the White Pass and Yukon Railway for a distance of approximately one mile. A short time ago the Hatfield Electric Company installed new poles and lines along this railroad. The old poles and lines were removed but our line was not replaced on the new poles. I might add that when our line was removed the White Pass and Yukon Railway was, and still is, being operated by the United States Army.\n\n4. The 93rd Engineers in building the road between Carcross and Tagish broke the line where it crossed the road. This part of the line and quite a stretch on either side is missing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. C. M. Grant.\n\nH. C. M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 12, 194.\n\nMr. J. E.

Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just returned from a lengthy visit to All Saints' School, Aklavik, and our new buildings at Carcross, Yukon. I am hoping to send you some report with my impressions and suggestions, but meanwhile desire to bring to your attention one pressing matter. The question of securing necessary equipment from the American Military authorities has been raised on several previous occasions. When I last discussed it with you in Ottawa, you kindly referred me to Mr. Viaume, and he promised to do his best for us, although he declared there were considerable technicalities to be overcome. I understand that Bishop Geddes has discussed this matter fully with your Agent in the Yukon, Mr. Gibbon, and that he already sent in a list of the items desired. All of these are available in the disused American camp near Carcross, and have been inspected by the Bishop and Agent, and found satisfactory for use in the school. We understand that many of these items are now being sold locally, while on the other hand train-loads of equipment are continually moving towards the coast, and items which we cannot obtain are being shipped out of the country. The school building is well advanced towards completion and there is no doubt that it can be opened at the beginning of September, with a full enrollment of pupils, if the remaining items of equipment can be secured. Such items as the lighting plant, cooking range, heater and boiler, are, of course, essential, and all the equipment listed is really necessary for the efficient operation of the school. May I plead that this matter may be given special attention in view of the shortness of time and that every effort may be made for some common-sense arrangement whereby the material now on the spot may be secured for this school?\n\nThanking you, and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

At that time we took up the matter with our Purchasing Branch and, for your information, I may say that our Purchasing Branch has to deal with the War Assets Allocation Board which, in turn, confers with the American military authorities. This is the only procedure the Department can adopt and, although the matter has already gone forward through the regular channels, I feel from past experience that there is very little possibility of securing the equipment mentioned in your letter in time to assist you to re-open the Carcross School in September.\n\nThere is another side of the question; namely, that we know definitely that the American military authorities are endeavouring to secure the highest possible price for any equipment which they sell to any other government department. However, it is possible that your commission could secure a reasonable price from the American military authorities in the Yukon if you dealt with them direct. This, of course, would involve your commission paying for whatever they purchased.\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C.

The building obtained from the United States authorities through the Crown Assets Allocation Committee (reference your memorandum of October 3, 1944, file 20 I.A.-Y.T.) required the Tentest and mouldings to make it habitable for the winter. The Indian Agent at Dawson was authorized to allow the Principal to purchase the material mentioned in order that the necessary work could be done before the extremely cold weather started. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

The officer on duty at the time we went to Whitehorse to pick up these and other goods instructed those under him to deliver this quantity to us. Apparently an error has been made but I can assure you that with an expected 50 pupils in residence most of these cots will be put to good use.\n\nWith regard to flannelette blankets these were handed out in unbroken case lots and those making delivery no doubt thought that these cases contained what was requested. As far as the school is concerned single blankets are more serviceable than pairs.\n\nSearch was made through much equipment for a 180 gallon water tank. As none could be located the officer informed me that the best he could do was to substitute with 2 - 40 gallon tanks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 17, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of October 3, 1944 - File 20- I.A. - Y.T. - and previous correspondence, with regard to securing certain equipment available at Whitehorse from the U.S. Government. In this connection I might also refer you to Mr. Jackson's letter of September 21, 1944, addressed to Major General W.W. Foster, Ottawa, Ont. I now enclose the accounts covering the equipment secured from the U.S. Government for the Carcross Residential School. The items shown on the account are not exactly the same as those originally requested, and in this regard I attach a copy of a letter received from the Principal, explaining the differences. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nThese accounts are as follows:\n\n1.

In this connection I might also refer you to Mr. Jackson's letter of September 21, 1944, addressed to Major General W. W. Foster, Ottawa, Ont. I now enclose the accounts covering the equipment secured from the U.S. Government for the Carcross Residential School. The items shown on the account are not exactly the same as those originally requested, and in this regard I attach a copy of a letter received from the Principal, explaining the differences.

We were advised by the school in February last, that the invoice had been certified and forwarded to their head office for payment. We would appreciate if you would advise us whether you have particulars of this account and if payment is being withheld for any reason.\n\nWe are anxious to receive payment, and would appreciate any information you can give us in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE CO.

C. M. Grant, Principal, Carcross Indian Residential School, Carcross, Y.T., I would request that you make the usual grant of $40.00 per month for six months (October 1st 1945 to March 31st 1946) to help meet the cost of having a Night Watchman at this school during the coming winter.\n\n(A.

We are advised that the school has over fifty pupils this year and could have had more if the accommodation had been larger.\n\nOur building account to date shows a total expenditure of over $25,000 and Bishop Geddes has urged us to apply for assistance from the Government for certain items. He suggests that you might be able to help us in regard to the lighting plant which cost $1,395. It was hoped that this could have been purchased from the American Army but the item was not placed on their list and can not be obtained. He also mentions $777.41 for lumber required to erect the outbuildings; $330.03 for furniture; $155.98 for linoleum; and $85.67 for three electric motors.\n\nAs our missionary society only made provision for a total expenditure of $20,000 it is in a real difficulty in regard to the balance and any assistance you may be able to give will be very much appreciated.\n\nThanking you and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 30, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to expenditures incurred by your Society at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nI discussed your letter with the Director yesterday. No provision has been made in the current year's appropriation for the amount that would have to be allowed if we complied with your wishes. Besides, we have just arranged for an increase in the authorized pupilage. Under the circumstances, we regret that at the present time favourable consideration cannot be given.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A.

While it is true that the increased pupilage has now been authorized, you will also recall that I was not personally in favor of this, as we do not wish to be condemned by Medical Authority for over-crowding in our schools. An increased enrollment would, of course, bring more income, but I am afraid it will entail additional expenses to provide more accommodation in the building. It has been the heavy capital expenditures which our Missionary Society has had to undertake to replace schools destroyed by fire which is crippling us so badly at the present time.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

Higgins, Whitehorse, having reference to the above.\n\nI have now received a reply from Mr. Higgins, and I enclose a copy of same. You will note from this letter that Reverend H. C. M. Grant, Superintendent of the Carcross Indian School, was interviewed in June last by our Mr. Jackson and advised respecting the regulation re issue of free permits to any religious, educational or charitable institution, as mentioned in your letter dated February 28, 1945, Departmental File 1968 NWT & Y.\n\nYou will also note that the Reverend Grant has not made an application for a free timber permit; nor has he communicated with our Timber Office at Whitehorse in the matter.

Subsequently Mr. Gibson wrote to us on November 26, and I enclose a copy of this letter for your information.\n\nI have now received your letter of April 12 and we are again communicating with Mr. Gibson and requesting him to give the matter further attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.A.

A. Alderwood, D.D., Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, with reference to paying a tax on firewood required by the Carcross Indian Residential School, which is operated for us by the Church of England.\n\nSubsequently, you forwarded to me a copy of your letter of November 26, 1945, to Mr. G. A. Jeckell, Dawson, Yukon. I have not heard anything further from your Branch regarding the matter and I presumed it was settled. Today I received another letter from Dr. Alderwood, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Re Wood Tax - May I refer to our letter of October 27, last, and ask if it is possible for us to claim exemption from this tax by reason of the fact that the school is administered under the Federal Government.

Jeckell, Dawson, Yukon, and it would appear that the Principal of the Carcross School was interviewed last June and advised respecting the regulation regarding the issue of free permits to any religious, educational or charitable institution. Mr. Jeckell commented that the Reverend H.C.M. Grant had not made an application for a free timber permit nor had he communicated with the Timber Office at Whitehorse. I believe he informed Mr. Jackson that he would take the matter up with his Head Office. Mr. Jeckell further stated that neither he nor Mr. L. Higgins of Whitehorse had received any communication from the office of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nAs advised in Mr. Phelan's letter to you of April 16th, we have again communicated with Mr. Gibson, and I understand that Mr. Gibson's Branch is again writing to Mr. Jeckell, but I would suggest that you instruct the Principal of the Carcross School to make application to Mr. Jeckell for a free timber permit for the School's wood supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nReverend H.A.

C. M. Grant, Superintendent of the above school, was being called upon to pay timber dues for fuel wood, I now enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum from the Indian Affairs Branch dated the 16th instant from which it would appear that further endeavours have again been made to collect dues from this missionary school.\n\nKindly obtain a further report in due course and be good enough to have such explanations given to the Principal of the school as will prevent any further misunderstandings. It should be made clear to the Mission that an annual permit for fuel wood must be obtained in the name of the school for which no dues will be charged. It has been our practice to allow 100 cords of fuel wood per annum free of charge to Mission Schools, Churches and Hospitals.\n\nIf the Mission employs a private operator to cut the timber care must be taken that no part thereof is retained by the operator for his services. It should also be explained to the Mission that when the timber has been obtained the permit must be returned promptly to the Crown Timber Agent with the affidavit on the back of the permit form, properly completed.\n\nEnc.\n\nR.

M. Emery, Mining Recorder at Whitehorse, containing a complete report on the matter of the supply of wood for the Carcross Indian School. I enclose a copy of this communication, and also a copy of a letter received from H. C. M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore issuing instructions to the Mining Recorder at Whitehorse, respecting the issuing of a Free Timber Permit, please advise if a free permit to cut 225 cords annually may be issued, providing that only dry wood be cut.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Emery's letter that the School requires an average of 225 cords per annum for heating purposes. It would seem to me that 100 cords would be wholly inadequate, as there are several one story buildings of rather flimsy construction and I am quite sure that the heating of these buildings must be quite a problem.\n\n(Sgd.)

Jeckell, Esq., Controller, Dawson, Y.T.\n\nReference your letter of the 3rd instant Re: Fuel wood for Carcross Y.T. Indian Residential School, I wish to report as follows:\n\nIn June 1945 Mr. F. H. R. Jackson, Timber Inspector for the Whitehorse District found a Mr. Lowe cutting 250 cords of green wood on the south side of the Carcross-Tagish road between M 7 and M 8 out of Carcross. Mr. Jackson reports that this timber was being cut right on the road leaving slash which increased the fire hazard. Mr. Lowe, on being questioned, stated that he had no permit but was cutting for the Indian School at Carcross. He was warned regarding the cutting of timber so close to the road and later moved to another area on the North side of M. 12.\n\nMr. Jackson states that he interviewed Rev. H. C. M. Grant, Principal of Chootle Indian School at Carcross with regard to timber permit. Mr. Grant declared that he had not previously been required to obtain a permit but would write to his Head Office concerning the matter. Up to the date of your letter no permit had been requested by him at this office.\n\nMr. L. Higgins, former Timber Agent for the Whitehorse District covered Mr. Jackson's inspection trip to Carcross and his (Mr. Jackson's) interview with Mr. Grant, in this office letter to you dated December 13, 1945.\n\nOwing to forest fire hazard Mr. Jackson had been unable to provide transportation for myself to Carcross, prior to May 25th on which date I took this matter up with Bishop Geddes who arranged for Mr. Grant to call at this office May 28th.\n\nAt the interview with Mr. Grant and Bishop Geddes in this office the situation was made clear and Mr. Grant made application for a free permit to cut 100 cords. It was explained that the school required an average of 225 cords per annum for heating purposes and the request was made that the free permit be extended in this case to include that amount.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Indian School at Carcross be granted a free permit to cut 225 cords annually with the understanding that they use only dry wood which in turn will help reduce the forest fire hazard.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.)

The Indians of Canada are divided into two classes; Treaty Indians and non-Treaty Indians. Your Indians belong to the latter class and are not entitled by treaty terms to issues of Ammunition, Nets, Snare-wire, Triennial Clothing, etc.\n\nIn the three Prairie Provinces, the Northwest Territories and remote areas where Indians are located long distances from source of supplies, Agents estimate their relief requirements food, soap, etc., each year in advance. These supplies are purchased on contract from wholesalers and shipped in to departmental warehouses, from which they are distributed weekly, or monthly, to aged and indigent Indians who have no other source of maintenance.\n\nIn the other parts of the Dominion and your agency, assistance is supplied by direct purchase from the merchant. However, if your Indians can be taken off direct relief by the issue of nets, ammunition, snare-wire or seeds the Branch is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to any representations you may care to make. In fact, it will be in order to include items in your 1947-48 Estimates covering requirements in tent duck (Allotment 12-421) canoe canvas (09-632) ammunition, twine for nets and snare-wire (02-229).\n\nInsofar as Indian Education is concerned, it is not necessary to estimate for desks, supplies, rents and teachers' salaries. These are all included by the Branch in a bulk amount, based on part year's requirements and new commitments.\n\nHowever, it will be necessary to include estimates for:\n\n(1) Repairs required to government-owned buildings; and\n\n(2) New buildings required.\n\nIf you will please let us know your requirements for biscuits, we will put these amounts in our order which goes to the manufacturers on May 15. To assist you in estimating requirements, it is suggested that you allow for 6 lbs. per student in average attendance, e.g., if average attendance is 20 - then ask for 120lbs of biscuits for that particular school.\n\nBernard F.

In this connection, you will recollect that the Government-owned School buildings at Carcross were burned in 1939 and that, because your Estimates were so restricted on account of the War, the M.S.C.C. was obliged to incur the expense of providing buildings in order to keep the School in operation there. In these circumstances, we would be glad if you could see your way clear to making provision in your 1948-49 Estimates for a new residence for the Principal at Carcross.\n\nAs regards miscellaneous services, it will be appreciated if you can make provision for, say, $1000 for this School in your 1948-49 Estimates.\nI wrote you a few days back asking for confirmation of my understanding that you still have an uncompromised balance of $600 available for expenditure at Carcross from the 1947-48 Estimates. If this sum still is available, can it be applied towards the purchase of such items as the new refrigerator or new truck which the Principal reports are urgently needed?\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/3F\nOttawa, October 23, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant submitting estimates for repairs and equipment that are considered required at the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has not been our practice to supply trucks to residential schools and consequently we will not be able to consider your request for a new one ton truck.\n\nThe other items in your letter will receive careful consideration when we are preparing our estimates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nOn Saturday, November 8th, I proceeded to Carcross Residential School, accompanied by Dr. E.H.J. Smyth, Northern Mobile Medical Clinic, and Miss Parr P.H.N., both of Edmonton. An improved aspect was immediately noted throughout the whole school. The last time the school was inspected was in company with Major C.A.F. Clark, on May 29th, 1947. I do not imagine that the school made a good impression on our educational supervisor.\n\nBeing a Saturday, classes were not in progress. A more detailed examination of the various buildings was undertaken. There are at present two main buildings, both of wooden construction. The main section contains dormitories, laundry, kitchen, dining rooms, offices, etc. The other building is the class room, food storage, and scout hall. A number of outside buildings contained farm equipment, dwellings for staff, etc. These buildings were erected as a temporary measure after the disastrous fire which destroyed the original school on April 17th, 1939.\n\nWhile the main building may be satisfactory for several more years, I wish to point out that the schoolroom itself is not in good condition. This is not a reflection on the present staff who have worked hard and improved conditions noticeably, but the schoolroom was not a good building to begin with, and the exterior is becoming weatherbeaten.\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Dr. Smyth, which I quote:\n\n\"A very interesting and pleasant visit was paid to the Anglican school at Carcross, in company with Mr. Meek and Miss Hackett. There were 45 pupils in school and we were struck by their happy demeanour, and by the accomplishments they were being taught. After lunch a troupe of girl guides was called in and gave some good part-singing - a show which would have done credit to any white school-children of similar age. One was struck by the complete absence of shyness. We then turned to the medical side of things and got down to some physical examinations of the new admissions and of a number of children who were suspected of being sick for one reason.\"\nMiss Beanland, a trained nurse, is on the school staff and would, I understand, be willing to handle drugs for the Indians of Carcross village, as well as for the school-children, but that she feels herself at the present subject to the limitations described above.\n\nIn the dormitories, the former crowded conditions have been somewhat improved, though not very much. In this connection Dr. Smyth observes:\n\n\"The school buildings are certainly very unserviceable; they were put up as a makeshift only after the fire some time ago. Major Clark examined them and found the space per head just half the prescribed amount. The school-room building, said to be the property of the Department of Health and welfare, is extremely ramshackle with large holes in walls and floor. There is no separate storehouse so that in the event of fire everything would be lost at once. However this matter has no doubt already been drawn to the attention of those who should take the matter up.\"\n\nNo doubt the Branch is aware of conditions at Carcross School through the visit of Educational Supervisor Clark. Suffice to say, conditions have improved considerably, but the building of a proper school room should be given consideration.\n\n(R.J.

Ellis's furniture, I would request that action be taken to procure the following:\n\n(a) For Carcross Anglican Indian Residential School.\n\n40 only storm sash, 2'0\u00bd\" x 4'6\u00bd\" x 1-3/8\", 8 light, for greenhouse.\n\nNote: Enclosed are actual quotations, f.o.b. Vancouver, and crated for shipment to Carcross from:\nVancouver Sash and Door Co., Ltd........$220.00\nRobertson Sash and Door Co.............$190.00\n\nThe freight from Vancouver to Carcross would be approximately $40.00.\n\n(over)\n(b) For Bishop Morden Memorial School, Moose Factory.\n\nOne Model 1 A, motor driven Laundry Extractor with capacity of 30 lbs. dry weight.\n\nThe price quoted by J.H. Connor & Son, Limited, Ottawa, for this machine, complete with 1\u00bd H.P. Motor, is $675.00 f.o.b. Ottawa, sales tax extra.\n\nNote: If this machine is ordered it is important to specify that the motor must run on 110 volt DIRECT Current, as the power at our Moose Factory School is supplied from a D.C. Lighting Plant.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised, at your earliest convenience, as to what action you are taking on the above.\n\nShould it be decided to purchase the Storm Sash for Carcross and the attached quotations from Vancouver are of use to your Purchasing Branch, please retain them; if not, will you please return them to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nIn April of 1939 the Chootla School at Carcross, Yukon, (a government owned school) was lost by fire. As the government, due to war conditions, was unable to re-build the structure, the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada erected a temporary building at a cost of $24,000. The building was not sufficiently large for permanent use and it was thought that at the conclusion of hostilities the government would replace the temporary structure erected by the Church with a larger building suitable for permanent use.\n\nThe present situation at Carcross is most unsatisfactory. The school is authorized to carry sixty pupils but dormitory and other accommodation allows for no more than forty-five. Staff members are inadequately quartered and the principal is finding it necessary to live in a built-over chicken house. All, staff and children alike, suffer from the cold and drafty buildings during the winter time and there is the ever constant fear of fire from the use of many stoves.\n\nAt the moment, the Administration is in the unhappy position of losing the services of an excellent principal unless better accommodation can be arranged for his family before next winter.\n\nLess than one hundred miles from Carcross the Government is constructing a large modern school for the Roman Catholic Church. The Administration feels that our needs for more adequate facilities at Carcross ought to have had prior consideration.\n\nIn the light of the above, I would respectfully submit for your consideration the following:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(a) That a suitable dwelling for the principal and his family be constructed this summer at the Chootla School, Carcross.\n\n(b) That the Indian Department have its engineers visit the site of the Chootla school with a view to their making recommendations to enlarge the school to suitable proportions for adequate accommodation of at least sixty pupils and the necessary staff.\n\n(c) That a sufficient sum be included in the 1949-50 appropriations to allow for the renovations or re-building recommended by the engineers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nMr R J MEKK  \nIndian Agent  \nWhitehorse Yukon\n\nRE CARGROSS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL -stop- UNDERSTAND PRINCIPAL OFFERING RESIGNATION UNLESS NEW PRINCIPAL'S QUARTERS PROVIDED FOR HIM -stop- PROPOSAL THAT WE BUY PREFABRICATED RESIDENCE VANCOUVER AND SHIP IN THIS SUMMER -stop- IS THIS FEASIBLE OR WOULD YOU RECOMMEND CONVERSION OF ARMY BUILDINGS -stop- UNABLE HERE IF SUITABLE ARMY BUILDINGS AVAILABLE VIGINTY CARGROSS -stop-\n\nBernard F Neary  \nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nPhoned to: ..........  \nPhoned by: ..........  \nTime: ............\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nDEGREE OF PRIORITY\n\nTIME OF ORIGIN\n\nSIGNED:\n\nCOPY 3\nMr R J Meek\nIndian Agent\nWhitehorse Yukon\n\nRE CARGROSS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL -stop- UNDERSTAND PRINCIPAL OFFERING RESIGNATION UNLESS NEW PRINCIPAL'S QUARTERS PROVIDED FOR HIM -stop-\nPROPOSAL THAT WE BUY PREFABRICATED RESIDENCE VANCOUVER AND SHIP IN THIS SUMMER -stop- IS THIS FEASIBLE OR WOULD YOU RECOMMEND CONVERSION OF ARMY BUILDINGS -stop- UNABLE HERE IF SUITABLE ARMY BUILDINGS AVAILABLE VICINITY CARGROSS -stop-\n\nBernard F Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\nPhoned to: ...........\nPhoned by: ......... .\nTime: ............\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nCOPY. 4\nCOL B F NEARY\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nRETEL CARCROSS SCHOOL STOP YOUR FIRST SUGGESTION MOST FEASABLE AND\nSUGGEST PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS BE SENT FROM VANCOUVER STOP ALL\nSUITABLE ARMY BLDGS THIS VICINITY ALREADY DISMANTLED OR IN USE\n\nR J MEEK INDIAN AGENT\nWHITEHORSE 7 MAY 48\n\nCOL B F NEARY\n\nRE TEL CARCROSS SCHOOL STOP YOUR FIRST SUGGESTION MOST FEASIBLE AND SUGGEST PREFABRICATED BUILDINGS BE SENT FROM VANCOUVER STOP ALL SUITABLE ARMY BUILDINGS THIS VICINITY ALREADY DISMANTLED OR IN USE\n\nR J MEEK\n\nMT/EP\n\nCopied:\nJGM\nApril 22, 1948.\n\nThe Indian School Administration,\nBank Street Chambers,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAs requested in your letter of April 20th we are enclosing our quotation herewith on a suitable Lighting Plant for one of your Indian Schools at Carcross in the Yukon.

They will give service more of every service. Hart Batteries are based on a five day discharge rate\u2014no other warranty. If your batteries were fully charged it would handle your entire power load for a five day period before re-charging would be necessary.\n\nHere is a simple formula to help you select the proper size battery for your installation. Multiply the watt hour load each day by the number of hours it is used each day. Multiply this answer by five which is the number of days the discharge rate is. Add each of these figures to determine your total load in watt hours per week. The weekly watt hour load should be reasonably close to the watt hour capacity of the battery.\n\nListed below, is an example of how you arrive at the proper size battery:\n\n**Daily Watt Hour Load:**\n- Six 25-watt bulbs (150 watts burning four hours)\n- Television\u2014150 watts burning three hours\n- Radio\u201428-watt five hours daily\n- Pump\u2014130-watt on hourly basis\n\n**Watt Hour Load For Five Day Period:**\n- Light, radio, pump: 1325 watt hours used five days\n- Washing machine\u2014200 watts used 4 hours\n- Iron, one day 500-watt used 4 hours\n\n**TOTAL\u2014Five Day Period:** 3625 watt hours\n\n**MINIMUM SIZES OF BATTERY TO INSTALL**\n\n| 32-VOLT SYSTEM | Battery Sizes |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| 600-750 watt   | DH13          |\n| 800-900 watt   | DH15          |\n| 1000 watt      | HF13          |\n| 1250 watt      | HF15          |\n| 1500 watt      | HF17          |\n| 1750 watt      | HF19          |\n| 2000 watt      | HF20          |\n| 2250 watt and over | EBF type batteries |\n\n**COMMON SENSE TREATMENT OF BATTERIES INCREASES LIFE 3 to 4 YEARS**\n\nIt is extremely important that batteries receive proper care and are not subjected to an undue amount of abuse. They must not be exposed to extreme heat or cold. It is best to keep them in a protected place easily accessible so they can be added to when necessary. Batteries must be kept clean. It is best to operate motors and appliances drawing a large amount of current only when your engine is operating.\n\nA REGULAR 32-VOLT FARM LIGHT BATTERY SET IS COMPOSED OF 16 2-VOLT GLASS JAR CELLS.\n\n**POWER REQUIRED FOR VARIOUS ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT**\n\n| APPLIANCE       | Average Watt Hours/Time | Amperes Pulled At 32 Volts |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 1/10 H.P.

Enclosed is the information for which you asked and I trust that your Department will see fit to purchase and ship a new unit to the above mentioned school. As previously stated, the present plant is an obsolete outfit, very expensive to operate and in need of an expensive overhaul. Because of its age many parts have to be machined individually.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing literature on the Lister unit we feel necessary for the Carcross school and I would appreciate having this literature back at your convenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B.

Ellis of the Chootla School, Carcross, and he states that such a structure will be ideal as a principal's residence at his school. He mentions, however, that a three-bedroom building would be much more practicable and that three ply wood might make a better inner lining than a soft type of wallboard.\n\nIn the light of our conversation of a week or so ago regarding this matter, may I again stress the urgency of the need of such a residence for the Carcross school principal.

One of the most urgent requirements at this school is the erection of a proper principal's residence.\n\nDue to local conditions we have not been able to arrange for the construction of such a residence and we therefore airmailed a copy of your plan for a Multi-flex Bungalow (Model F) to the present Principal.\n\nHe has now advised that such a building will be ideal as a principal's residence for this school. He mentions, however, that a three bedroom building would be much more practicable and that a 3 plywood might make a better inner lining than a soft type of wallboard.\n\nCould you please advise me as to whether you have a three bedroom type of bungalow similar to your Model F. It would be appreciated also if we could be advised as to the cost of such a building and whether it will be possible to use plywood inner walls, as suggested.\n\nWould it be possible, if we ordered such a building, to have it shipped into the Yukon via Skagway and the Whitehorse Pass and Yukon Railway in time to have it erected before winter sets in.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P.

The Archbishop's statement substantiates the claim of Principal Ellis and other missionaries that the Chootla school is not sufficiently large to care for the educational needs of Church of England Indian children in the area mentioned.\n\nIn the light of the above, I would respectfully urge that the Indian Affairs Branch seriously consider my request of May 1st giving particular stress to (b) and (c) but changing the figure in (b) to read 'eighty' instead of 'sixty'. I understand that action is being taken as regards (a).\n\n(b) That the Indian Department have its engineers visit the site of the Chootla School with a view to their making recommendations to enlarge the school to suitable proportions for adequate accommodation of at least eighty pupils and the necessary staff.\n\n(c) That a sufficient sum be included in the 1949-50 appropriations to allow for the renovations or rebuilding recommended by the engineers.\n\nThis whole matter is vital to the educational work of our Church among the Indians of the Yukon and your assistance would be of great help.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B.

It had a per capita enrolment at that time of 40 pupils. As the Department, due to war conditions, was unable to replace the structure, the M.S.C.C., erected a temporary building at a cost of $24,000. The building was not sufficiently large for permanent use and it was thought that at the conclusion of hostilities the Government would replace the temporary structure, erected by the Church, with a larger building suitable for permanent use.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C., reading in part as follows:\n\n\"The present situation at Carcross is most unsatisfactory. The school is authorized to carry sixty pupils but dormitory and other accommodation allows for no more than forty-five. Staff members are inadequately quartered and the principal is finding it necessary to live in a built-over chicken house. All, staff and children alike, suffer from the cold and drafty buildings during the winter time and there is the ever constant fear of fire from the use of many stoves.\n\nAt the moment, the Administration is in the unhappy position of losing the services of an excellent principal unless better accommodation can be arranged for his family before next winter.\n\nLess than one hundred miles from Carcross the Government is constructing a large modern school for the Roman Catholic Church. The Administration feels that our\nneeds for more adequate facilities at Carcross ought to have had prior consideration.\n\nIn the light of the above, I would respectfully submit for your consideration the following:\n\n(a) That a suitable building for the Principal and his family be constructed this Summer at the Carcross Residential School.\n\n(b) That the Indian Department have its engineers visit the site of the Chooutla School with a view to their making recommendations to enlarge the school to suitable proportions for adequate accommodation of at least eighty pupils and the necessary staff.\n\n(c) That a sufficient sum be included in the 1949-50 appropriations to allow for the renovations or rebuilding recommended by the engineers.\"\n\nIt is recommended that approval be given to have one of the Officials of the Lands and Development Services Branch visit this school with a view to making recommendations concerning this enlargement.\n\nDirector\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCarcross Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 13-491 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Reverend J.

It had an authorized enrolment at that time of 40 pupils. As the Department, due to war conditions, was unable to replace the structure, the M.S.C.C. erected a temporary building at a cost of $24,000.00. The building was not sufficiently large for permanent use and it was thought that at the conclusion of hostilities the Government would replace the temporary structure, erected by the Church, with a larger building suitable for permanent use.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C., reading in part as follows:\n\n\"The present situation at Carcross is most unsatisfactory. The school is authorized to carry sixty pupils but dormitory and other accommodation allows for no more than forty-five. Staff members are inadequately quartered and the principal is finding it necessary to live in a built-over chicken house. All, staff and children alike, suffer from the cold and draughty buildings during the winter time and there is the ever constant fear of fire from the use of many stoves.\n\n\"At the moment, the Administration is in the unhappy position of losing the services of an excellent principal unless better accommodation can be arranged for his family before next winter.\n\n\"Less than one hundred miles from Carcross the Government is constructing a large modern school for the...\"\nRoman Catholic Church. The Administration feels that our needs for more adequate facilities at Carcross ought to have had prior consideration.\n\n\"In the light of the above, I would respectfully submit for your consideration the following:\n\n(a) That a suitable building for the Principal and his family be constructed this summer at the Carcross Residential School.\n\n(b) That the Indian Department have its engineers visit the site of the Chootla School with a view to their making recommendations to enlarge the school to suitable proportions for adequate accommodation of at least eighty pupils and the necessary staff.\n\n(c) That a sufficient sum be included in the 1949-50 appropriation to allow for the renovations or rebuilding recommended by the engineers.\"\n\nIn view of the representations made above by Canon Cook, it is recommended that the following action be taken:\n\n(a) That a Prefabricated Bungalow be ordered from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, of Vancouver, B.C., for shipping to Carcross by July 15.

A detailed description of the generator now in use including all available information regarding watts capacity, voltage, speed and type of winding. Nameplates are usually furnished on the generator giving this information.\n\n2. Describe in detail the control panel listing all equipment and describe exactly how the prime mover is controlled i.e. whether automatic relay electric start, manual push button electric start or by some other method.\n\n3. Have the controls given any trouble in the past and if so state fully and give dates. Are the controls now operating satisfactorily?\n\n4. Determine how many days the fully charged battery will supply the load demand before recharging is necessary.\n\n5. List the wattage of all lighting outlets, appliances and motors (indicating their service) in use in each building supplied by the lighting plant and state the time in hours each is used daily. Observations should be taken each day over a period of one week, the results tabulated and forwarded with the report.\n\n6. Prepare a sketch showing the relative locations of all buildings supplied with electricity and indicate the distance between same. Mark the location of power plant and power lines between buildings.\n\n7. Give any additional information in detail concerning the operation of the equipment at the school, that requires power in its operation, and which may have a bearing on the size of the diesel electric unit required.\nOttawa, June 11, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon.\n\nWe have a request for an electric plant at this school and I enclose for your information a copy of the questionnaire which was forwarded to the principal. I also attach information supplied by the management of the school, also quotations which were secured by the Missionary Society of the Church of England under whose auspices the school is operated.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would advise whether or not we should accept the offer of Hoffars Limited.\n\nDirector\nMr. Hoey: I trust this information will meet with your requirements.\n\nDirector, Mines and Resources Branch\n\nLands and Development Services Branch\n\nOttawa June 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon.\n\nIn reply to your marginal notation dated June 14th, appearing on Mr. Hoey's memorandum of the 11th instant, in connection with a lighting plant for the above, we make the following comments.\n\nIt is apparent from the correspondence and tenders forwarded with Mr. Hoey's memorandum that the Missionary Society of the Church of England has decided to change the electrical system from alternating current to storage battery direct current type of system.\n\nThis type of system is suitable to the electrical loads and will supply a source of power without operating a generating unit whenever power is required, and should, if care is exercised in operating the equipment, provide a more economical means of power supply. It is pointed out, however, that changes will be necessary to many appliances and possibly to radios used to make them suitable on direct current. The batteries should be housed in a location where they will not be subjected to extreme temperatures, and before ordering this equipment space requirements should be obtained from the supplier and provision made for them.\n\nThe information supplied by the Principal in his letter dated May 10th last is not complete in that the individual loads and the time of operation of each per day is not noted. We have taken the total wattage in each building and have estimated the probable daily watt hour demand. From this, we suggest that a 56 cell storage battery of 360 ampere hour capacity should be provided, which will allow approximately three (3) days between charging periods.\n\nTo charge this battery a shunt wound generator of approximately 4 K.W. capacity with voltage range of 115 to 145 volts D.C. should be provided. The control panel, in addition to an ammeter, voltmeter, field rheostat and fused line switch, should be provided with automatic over-charging protection for the battery. All wiring necessary between generating unit, switch board and batteries should be provided along with complete detailed instructions for the installation, maintenance and operation of the plant in conjunction with the batteries to insure maximum efficiency and life of the lighting plant.\n\nWe suggest that Hoffars Limited of Vancouver be contacted to determine if their generating unit offered, which is rated at 4\u00bd K.W., 110 volt D.C., can give the voltage range desired, which is important to enable the proper safe current charging rates for\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nthe battery and the proper volts per cell required for efficient operation of the lighting plant. The automatic over-charge protection is essential when the charging equipment is non-automatic.\n\nIt is realized that a plant as outlined above would be more costly than that offered, but it is considered that installation will prove more satisfactory from the standpoint of service and economy.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that a qualified electrician be engaged to install the plant and to check on the distribution system to make sure that the line losses are not excessive, and that the fuse protection at each building is satisfactory.\n\nWe are returning herewith tender forwarded with Mr. Hoey's memorandum for transmission to Indian Affairs.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\nJune 30, 1948.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWe have received your letter of May 27th enclosing information regarding the type of electrical power unit required for the Carcross School.\n\nWe submitted the tender of Hoffars Limited, Vancouver, B.C., dated April 28, 1948, to our Purchasing Branch and we were then requested to submit the proposition to our Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nWe enclose a copy of their reply for your information and we would appreciate it if you would submit this to the principal of the Carcross School in order that he may obtain further information from Hoffars Limited.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Would the M.S.C.C. be prepared to pay the difference between the amount available from our appropriation and the cost outlined above? If so, we will proceed at once with the purchase of the equipment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Consequently, they request that the building be enlarged to provide accommodation for eighty pupils.\n\nI am bringing the matter to your attention now in the hope that one of your engineers can visit the Carcross School, with a view to determining the probable expenditure that would be involved in providing increased accommodation.

Dawson, District Resident Architect, Public Works Department, Victoria, who made the following recommendations:\n\n(1) New Heating Plant. A new hot water heating system is recommended, with necessary pumps and tanks, a basement to be built. Present system is a fire hazard and very inefficient.\n\n(2) Answered in my letter of October 25th.\n\n(3) Resident Architect considers a new electric pump would be best. The new 8 HP generator diesel engine being sent to Carcross per Purchase Order 35420 may partially solve this problem. As Mr. Dawson strongly recommends a new school building, no doubt the above will be incorporated into his report to the Department. He particularly stressed the need for better washroom facilities, new kitchen sinks, drain boards, racks, etc.\n\n(4) A new cooking range is needed at the present time, whether a new building is to be constructed or not. Present one a fire hazard.\n\nP.M.\n\n(R.J.

Meek,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant regarding the Carcross School.\n\nWhen Mr. Dawson's report is received we will give careful consideration to it but funds are not available for extensive repairs to the buildings at the present time.\n\nIf you refer to my letter of November 15th regarding fire equipment for this school, it was pointed out that as it is a church-owned school, we are only allowed to expend the amount of money specifically provided in the appropriation.\n\nWe note from the last paragraph of your letter that a new cooking range is required at the present time. The only manner we can secure funds for this is to transfer them from some other church-owned residential school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nIn view of the apparent urgency of the range, we are prepared to apply for an Order in Council to secure the transfer of funds that would be required. But before doing so, we would like you to give us an idea of the type of stove required. (Give catalogue number if possible so that we may submit the cost of the stove and transfer the funds...\nespecially required for this purpose.)\n\nBernard F.

The MacLennan, MacFeely and Prior, Vancouver, catalogue, lists a two-oven, heavy duty stove, catalogue No. 05224. With fire box on left, and equipped with hot water coils (waterfront), and suitable for burning wood, it was considered to be the most suitable.\n\nThe list price of the stove at Vancouver is approximately $450.00, freight from Vancouver to Carcross is about .05\u00a2 per pound. Shipping weight is about 1200 lbs. All of the prices quoted above have no doubt altered somewhat, but it should be a guide to probable cost.\n\n(R.J.

Brault, Esq.,\nChief Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Carcross, Y.T.\n\nHaving reference to your letter of the 6th October last, File No. 12367-2, with regard to the Anglican Mission School at Carcross, Y.T., I beg to report that I visited Carcross in conjunction with work for this Department at Whitehorse, Carcross and Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Whitehorse, Y.T. drove me to Carcross and I made a complete survey of the present buildings owned by the Anglican Mission. The land, I understand, is Indian Reserve.\n\nI might say that the present set-up of operating a Mission and School in the present buildings is far from satisfactory.\n\nAll the buildings belonging to the Anglican Mission, with the exception of the new Log Garage and Root House, recently built, are in bad state of repair.\n\nAll the buildings used by the children, including the Army Hut used as a school and Club Room, are heated by oil drum wood stoves, piped with stovepipes into the regular Yukon safety chimneys. The method of heating these buildings is very unsatisfactory, as it is impossible to get the heat properly distributed and, during cold weather, these stoves have to be kept on at full blast, which I consider is dangerous and a grave fire menace.\n\nThe Main Building, of which I am enclosing a blueprint showing the layout, is heated with nine (9) stoves distributed about the building.\n\nI noticed one great loss of heat, which I pointed out to the Principal and he is having it rectified. The trap door in the ceiling in the hall is kept open and the heat rushes up into the hall like a cyclone. The reason it was kept open, I was informed, was to keep the water storage tank from freezing. All the pipes are on the underside of the ceiling. Therefore, I recommended that a false ceiling and walls be built over the tank and the trap door to allow the heat to circulate only around the tank and stop the rush of hot air going out through the roof, which is open the entire length of the building at the eaves.\n\nThe ceiling and walls of the Mission Building are insulated.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Main Building consists of three (3) lockstave prefabricated buildings, placed in an H position, as shown on the plan, with the center building joined on the Ground Floor at each end.\n\nThe roof of the Main Building is gabled and not connected, except by a board nailed at the eaves of the two wings, which makes a flat valley between the buildings with no way of getting rid of the snow, except by shovelling out from between the buildings.\n\nThe roofs are in bad condition and leak all over. The paper, which is a two-ply rolled roofing, is almost weathered clean of asphalt and is badly in need of re-roofing. The wind was fairly strong the day I was there and the roofing was lifting in places.\n\nI realize the building was built as an emergency and a temporary measure and has no doubt served its purpose during the last four years. However, if these Indian children and Staff are to continue as a unit, a new building should be provided at the earliest moment.\n\nThe exterior boarding is badly warped in places, knots have fallen out and generally is in a bad state of repair.\n\nThe whole of the exterior needs painting. Steps and landings require replacing.\n\nThere are forty-six (46) children living in this building and the Principal informed me that there were about sixty (60) more children outside, of whom they could take care if they had accommodation.\n\nThe interior is in just as bad a state of repair as the exterior. In fact, it has never been completely finished. In several places the base has been left off and many of the panel strips are missing. Some rooms are not painted but were left bare. The whole of the walls and ceilings are covered with tentest wallboard and in many places holes have been punched through both walls.\n\nAll the woodwork, walls and ceilings are in need of cleaning and two (2) coats of paint.\n\nThe floors are badly worn and, in some places, where the traffic is heavy, are worn down to the tongue, making them very dangerous and almost impossible to scrub, due to so many splinters. These floors should be covered immediately with tempered masonite, which I consider would be the cheapest and most satisfactory covering. It would be impossible to cover them with linoleum without replacing large sections of flooring.\n\nThe lavatory accommodation is inadequate - one washroom to each section of boys and girls. Each washroom has one bathtub, one toilet and one common sink to wash in, all in one room. This accommodation is not sufficient for forty-six (46) children, housed day and night.\nThe Staff has one bathroom with three fixtures.\n\nThere is no room for any child who happens to be sick and it is considered there should be a room with toilet facilities for any ailing child.\n\nThe lighting is by an old electric light plant, operated by a gasoline engine. The building is lighted by drop lights, which can only be turned on when the electric light plant is working. Generally, the building is very poorly lit.\n\nThere is a good supply of water pumped from an enclosed well to a tank in the ceiling and supplied by gravity to the fixtures.\n\nThe sink in the Kitchen requires replacing, as also do the drainboards and kitchen fixtures. The cook stove is badly worn and needs replacing, being worn through from the firebox to the oven, which has been patched up with brickwork.\n\nAn old Army Hut, not painted, is being used as a School Room, Play Room, Club Room, Workshop and dry storage space. The rooms are heated by drum stoves.\n\nThere is an old house which houses the Indian family. The man is the Night Watchman and his wife is the Cook. This building is old and in bad state of repairs.\n\nThe Log Building with concrete foundations and concrete floor with basement for vegetable storage and car storage above, is a new building and in good state of repair.\n\nThe present house, in which the Principal lives, is an old barn, converted into a dwelling and is in bad state of repair. A new house is being built at the present time for the Principal, which should be completed in about one month and a half.\n\nThe following buildings belong to the Anglican Mission:\n\nResidential Mission Building - estimated present value ........... $15,889.00\n\nPresent House occupied by Mr. & Mrs. Ellis .................. 500.00\n\nNew Log Garage & Roothouse .................. 1,200.00\n\nOld House, used by Indian Family, Cook & Watchman .................. 700.00\n\nOld Army Prefabricated Hut .................. 1,250.00\n\nTOTAL - Value of Buildings .... $19,539.00\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.F. Dawson\nDist.Res.Architect\nfor B.C. & Y.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPurchase of Carcross Residential School\n\nIncluded in our Main 1948-49 Estimates is the sum of $30,000.00 for the purchase of the Carcross Residential School from the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nArrangements were made with the Department of Public Works for the valuation of the buildings at this school. You will find attached a copy of the report submitted by the Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works after his district resident architect had visited the school and made an inspection and valuation.\n\nImmediately this report was received from the Chief Architect, we wrote to the M.E.C.C. requesting their assurance that the five building mentioned in the Department of Public Works reports were the buildings which they wished to sell to the Department and that they are their property.\n\nWe have just now received a reply from the M.E.C.C. advising that these are the buildings which they wish to sell to the Department and that all of them are the property of the M.E.C.C. The delay in replying to our letter was due to the necessity of referring our enquiry to both Carcross and Toronto.\nCould you please advise whether it will be in order to have a draft Order-in-Council prepared covering the purchase of these buildings as planned.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/AM\nAPPENDIX A.\n\nCARCROSS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was destroyed by fire in 1939 and replaced by temporary and prefabricated buildings by the M.S.C.C. As you are aware, we are purchasing these buildings and the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. has specifically requested that we erect new buildings to accommodate the children now in attendance and others for whom no educational facilities are provided.\n\nI would therefore recommend that an Educational Survey Committee be established to visit the various Indian reserves and schools presently operated for Anglican children in the Yukon and report on the following:\n\n(1) The educational facilities which should be provided for Indian children of the Anglican faith in the Yukon.\n\n(2) If the provision of day schools is recommended, where should these be situated and of what type?\n\n(3) If a residential school is recommended, where should it be located and what pupil accommodation should be provided?\n\n(4) Other specific facts and comments concerning the educational facilities presently provided and recommendations concerning co-operation with the Yukon Territorial Council schools.\n\nI would recommend that this committee be composed of the following members:\n\n(a) C.A.F. Clark, Educational Survey Officer, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(b) Ronald Hulland, Superintendent of Schools, Yukon Territorial Council.\n\n(c) An Anglican Missionary appointed by the M.S.C.C.\nInsofar as funds are not provided in our appropriation this year for the construction of a school or a unit of a school at Carcross, I feel that this educational survey could be carried out in September, 1949.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO The Indian School Administration\nM.S.C.C.\nADDRESS 102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDATE SERVICE AMOUNT\n\nRec 31 To allowance towards salary of night watchman at the Carcross Residential School for the month of December 60.00\n\n(Authority\u2014Departmental letter of October 20th, 1948)\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nDATE Jan 17/48\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 9)\nExtract from requisition dated January 31st,\nfrom the Principal of the Carcross Res., School.\nOriginal on file: 940-4\n\nThe Principal requests the following:\n\n10 School Desks, medium\n10 \" large\nWhitehorse, Y.T., Jan. 25\n\nMr. Jack Meeks,\n\nWhite Horse Y.T.\n\n\u2014 In Account With \u2014\n\nNELSON'S HARDWARE\n\nELECTRICAL SUPPLIES\n\nPLUMBING and HEATING \u2022 SPORTING GOODS\n\nInstalling Oil Water heater at Carcross.\n\nOil heater............. $60.00\nCopper pipe........... 5.25\nMaterial used for barrel hook up.............. 3.00\n6 only hrs. labor....... $13.50\n\nTotal................. $81.75\nThe undermentioned equipment has been purchased for this School since 23rd March, 1945.\n\nPurchase Order 1935 -

I feel that you ought to know how much Mr. Ellis and myself appreciate the action of Indian Affairs in constructing the residence so readily. The fact that Principal Ellis now has a comfortable home for his growing family has changed his whole outlook in regard to his staying on as Principal - both he and his wife are now happy - what is an impatient - they're contented.\n\nOne or two minor jobs still remain unfinished and will have to await more favorable weather in the spring. The house however is habitable and the family is moving in this afternoon.\n\nThe contractors are to be congratulated on a fine job of work - first class workmanship throughout. The design - lay-out of the house is ideal for local conditions - those who have seen it acclaim it to be the nicest house in Southern Yukon.\n\nAgain - many thanks for your interest and help in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. R.J.

While your estimate for the three smaller buildings is satisfactory, we feel that the estimate for the main building - $15,889.00-is low.

This matter was referred to the District Resident Architect, Victoria, who made the inspection and report of valuation on the Indian Residential School buildings at Carcross. I am now in receipt of his reply and I quote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"In making my valuation, I definitely took into consideration the condition of the building. As I pointed out in my report, this is a wartime erected prefabricated hut, and I do not consider the building is worth more than the valuation I placed on it. As far as replacements are concerned, this building could not be replaced even for the amount they specify, namely, $20,000.00.\n\nI consider the cost of replacing a building of this size, with a proper up-to-date frame building, with concrete foundation, would be approximately, $39,835.00.\n\nHowever, I was not making a report on replacements, but merely making a valuation of the present building and condition.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that the District Resident Architect in making his valuation of the buildings took into consideration the present condition of the structure.\n\nIt should be noted in the closing paragraph of the District Resident Architect's report that he states: \"A new building should be erected in this area as soon as possible, as the present building was only a temporary measure due to the original building burning down.\"\n\nTrusting this information is what you require,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

You were particularly concerned with the evaluation set on the main building, which was $15,889.00.\n\nThis matter has been referred to the Department of Public Works and we are now in receipt of their reply which quotes the architect who made the inspection, as follows:\n\n\"In making my valuation, I definitely took into consideration the condition of the building.\n\n\"As I pointed out in my report, this is a wartime erected prefabricated hut, and I do not consider the building is worth more than the valuation I placed on it.\"\n\nIn your letter you advised that a list of the Church-owned furniture and equipment at this school would be sent to us. To date, our files do not indicate that this information was received.\nAs you are aware, it has been our intention, when the purchase of this school was completed, to erect a new main building. By now, you will have had an opportunity of examining the new dormitory building erected by the Department at the Wabasca Residential School. I would appreciate receiving the views of your Society as to the suitability of a similar building for the Carcross Residential School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n5th August, 1949.\n\nYour file 940 - 5 (E).\n\nMajor D.

I have to be away until Wednesday morning and it would be appreciated if I could have a reply to the following queries, raised by Principal Ellis, by that time.\n\nIn a letter dated August 2nd Mr. Ellis brings up the following points:\n\n\"Principal's Residence: Has authority been granted by the Dept. of Indian Affairs to finish the house?\n\nNew Kitchen Range: A range suitable for this school can be purchased from McLennan McFeely and Prior, Vancouver. The number is #2-24, 2 Oven, Coast Commercial Range. Price $353.95 f.o.b. Vancouver warehouse. Hot Water Coils for the above are $15.00 per set.\n\nAccount: Last year whilst the Principal's residence was being erected, we boarded, for part of the time, the contractor and his crew. The board bill for November and December amounted to $358.00. The account was submitted to the Indian Agent for payment. In spite of repeated telegrams from the Agent to Ottawa and a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister, no settlement has been forthcoming. Not even replies to either telegrams or letter. Would you mind getting in touch with those responsible and try to get some action.\"\n\nRegarding the above. The exterior of the new cottage is without paint and the cellar floor is not run and a number of finishing-off jobs incompleted.\n\nWhen I visited the School in January the Principal understood\n\n(P.T.O)\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10 Volume 6480)\n\nFile 940-5, part 6\nYukon Agency -

Cook,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEmcl.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Chootla Residential School, Carcross.\n\nTried to reach you Saturday morning by telephone but no doubt you were out of the office. I have to be away until Wednesday morning and it would be appreciated if I could have a reply to the following queries, raised by Principal Ellis, by that time.\n\nIn a letter dated August 2nd Mr. Ellis brings up the following points:\n\n\"Principal's Residence: Has authority been granted by the Dept. of Indian Affairs to finish the house?\n\nNew Kitchen Range: A range suitable for this school can be purchased from Mcleanman McFeely and Prior, Vancouver. The number is #2-24, 2 Oven, Coast Commercial Range. Price $353.95 f.o.b. Vancouver warehouse. Hot Water Coils for the above are $15.00 per set.\n\nAccount: Last year whilst the Principal's residence was being erected, we boarded, for part of the time, the contractor and his crew. The board bill for November and December amounted to $258.00. The account was submitted to the Indian Agent for payment. In spite of repeated telegrams from the Agent to Ottawa and a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister, no settlement has been forthcoming. Not even replies to either telegrams or letter. Would you mind getting in touch with those responsible and try to get some action.\"\n\nRegarding the above. The exterior of the new cottage is without paint and the cellar floor is not run and a number of finishing-off jobs incomplete.\n\nWhen I visited the School in January the Principal understood\n\n(P.T.O)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6480, file 940-5, part 10)\nRe construction of Principal's Residence, Carcross Residential School....... $5,000.00\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference correspondence and telegrams concerning principal's residence at Carcross Indian Residential School, your file 166-1-6 (E). Robert Campbell has been to this office recently concerning the non-payment of his accounts totalling over four thousand dollars, and he is at a loss to understand it.\n\nMr. Campbell is a reputable contractor, he has done a lot of work for us in the past, and is at present making alterations and additions to Indian Health Services buildings at Whitehorse. He is absolutely tied up for working capital.\n\nMr. Campbell has very forcibly drawn to my attention that the house erected at Carcross is considerably cheaper than similar buildings at Whitehorse. He saved money for the Department by his crew working long hours and on Sundays at regular wages rather than the overtime rate to which they were entitled. He states he appreciates working for the Dominion Government and is anxious to maintain a friendly relationship.\n\nIt would be appreciated if his accounts could be paid at the earliest possible date. If this payment is delayed due to any unknown irregularity at this office I am extremely sorry and care will be taken in future to ensure that a lengthy submission will be made concerning building conditions with a rough estimate.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., visited Carcross Residential School with me recently and commented most favorably on the residence built for Rev. Ellis and gives as his opinion that the cost was not excessive.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.J. Meek\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference principal's residence at Carcross Indian School, your file 166-1-6 (E). Today the Rev. J.W. Ellis has advised me that the basement is flooded, he is pumping it out, and requests that residence be completed to prevent a recurrence of flooding conditions.\n\nDownpipes from roof gutters are required, also gravel fillings in basement and around exterior walls, cement floor to basement also needed. All these things have been submitted in the form of an estimate with my letter of March 1st, 1949. There are 103 sacks of cement in storage at Carcross awaiting authorization for proceeding with work. The estimate of $1119.30, I am informed by Mr. Robt. Campbell, was for the date of submission, and owing to a .15\u00a2 per hour wage increase since that time, the present estimate will be increased by 7 of 8 per cent.\n\nMay I please have your instructions.\n\n(R.J.

Meek,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to the erection of the Principal's residence at the above school, it is regretted that there has been such a delay in handling the accounts. However, as the expenditure was much higher than we had anticipated, we were obliged to obtain funds in the 1949-50 appropriation to complete the building, and these funds have only recently been authorized.\n\nWe now have what we consider a sufficient amount to pay the outstanding accounts, and arrangements are being made to forward by airmail a cheque for $358.00 in favour of Rev. J.W. Ellis, in payment of your Voucher No. 20 covering the cost of meals for carpenters and helpers.\n\nAs you are aware, no official has the right to engage a contractor without first obtaining the Minister's approval. Consequently, when the prefabricated building was supplied and you applied for an accountable advance, we inferred that you were proceeding with the erection of the building by day labour, as you did not submit the name and address of any contractor for approval.\n\nWhen we received your Voucher No. 19, it was presumed to be a Credit Voucher for the amount advanced to you. The main payment for which you requested credit was in connection with a payment to Robert Campbell.\nBuilding Contractor. The first item on the account read \"Labour 1190 hours\" in an amount of $1,937.75. Acceptance of this Credit Voucher has been discussed with the Treasury Branch, but they simply will not recognize it as we have no contract signed with Mr. Campbell.\n\nWe do not wish you to infer that we consider that Mr. Campbell has not paid the men who worked on the job, but from the information on our files, it appears both to us and the Treasury Branch that he was simply the foreman, and consequently, for auditing purposes a mere statement to the effect that a sum of money was paid out to him is not sufficient. We are obliged to have receipted paylists signed by the men to whom the money was actually paid. At this point we feel it advisable to bring to your attention the fact that government auditing regulations are very exacting, and the Auditor General requires receipts showing that monies paid out have been received by those to whom payment is due. This is to avoid any subsequent claim against the government.\n\nWe attach the covering Voucher which you forwarded. It should have read \"Credit Voucher in favour of R.J. Meek (In Trust)\". The top of your Voucher read \"Pay to Robert Campbell\". This was not necessary, as he had already been paid by you from the accountable advance forwarded to you. Consequently, to settle Voucher No. 19, we will have to have a new covering Voucher reading in the correct manner, and we will have to receive a certified paylist as mentioned above, covering the labour in an amount of $1,937.75.\n\nWhat has been said above regarding Voucher No. 19 applies also to Voucher No. 55. We will have to have a receipted paylist for the expenditure of $1,099.10 -- the first item on the Voucher.\nWe will also require an explanation of the reason for the 10% charge on the account attached to Voucher No. 55. If Mr. Campbell was engaged as foreman at a certain rate plus 10%, it should have been brought to our attention in the first place and authority received before proceeding. However, if you give us an explanation of the matter, we will endeavour to have the account accepted by the Treasury.\n\nRegarding the item of $72.50 on Voucher No. 55 for meals for workmen, we desire to know the exact date for which meals are charged. This is in accordance with auditing regulations, so that the Voucher on our files will show that there has been no duplication of payment.\n\nRegarding Voucher No. 156, we note that there is a surcharge of 10%. This is similar to the one mentioned in connection with Voucher No. 55, and an explanation is required. We also wish to know the dates and the rate per hour for which there is a charge of 32 hours for labour. We cannot understand why it was necessary to have Mr. Campbell purchase the supplies if he expected 10% of their cost, as we believe that the materials could have been bought by yourself, and thereby save this extra charge. An explanation would be appreciated.\n\nWith reference to Voucher No. 157, we require to know the exact dates for which Mr. Campbell requests payment of an amount of $19.50 for meals.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated in order that the matter may be settled.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nAttachs.\nIndian Education\n\n14 Nov 1949\n\n516 49 50\n\n13-491 School #940\n\n940-5\n\nRe construction of Principal's residence, Carcross Indian Residential School.................. $5,000.00\n\nNote: Funds for this purpose included in 1949-50 appropriation.\n\nDec/48 Vr 20 Rev.J.W.

MACKAY\n\nRe: Carcross Indian Residential School\n\nDuring the early war years, this residential school burned, and naturally the Department was not in a position to replace it then. Therefore, the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada purchased a large prefabricated building, and with changes and alterations to the small buildings left standing, proceeded to operate a residential school with a reduced pupilage of 60 children.\n\nNaturally the Society has been pressing for the re-erection of this building, and we have written to Canon Dixon of the M.S.C.C. suggesting that a dormitory block similar to that erected at the Wabasca C.E. Residential School, might be acceptable also at Carcross. Our idea was naturally that it would be relatively easy to prepare the plans and specifications of another dormitory building for Carcross, if it were similar to that successfully being used now at Wabasca.\n\nIt is our intention to include a sum of $175,000.00 in our 1950-51 Estimates for the erection of this dormitory block. Major Clark has visited the school and recommends that the present prefabricated building be converted for classroom use, for which it will be quite satisfactory. As we have recently erected a good Principal's residence, this should place the Carcross Residential School in a good position for the continued education of some 60 Indian children.\n\nBernard F.

May I first remind you that the Yukon Agency has been more or less dormant for a number of years during which no building has taken place; there was, therefore, no precedent for the sort of project I was asked to undertake. I consulted Part X (Construction and Engineering) of Indian Agent's References and Regulations, but apparently did not interpret Para. 192 (Financial) aright. The Director's letter of June 2nd, 1948, file 166-1-5 (E) stated that funds had been provided for the purchase of a prefabricated house, and I assumed, whether rightly or wrongly, that construction costs had been provided for in the Estimates by Headquarters.\n\nRobert Campbell of Whitehorse is the Yukon Agent for Prefabricated Structures, the firm supplying the house, and it is only natural that I referred to him for the erection of the Principal's Residence. As this was a departure from the usual construction in the Yukon, being the first one erected, Mr. Campbell would not give me a firm estimate. He stated he would superintend the construction of the building for cost of wages and materials purchased by him, plus 10 per cent. I regret to say, owing to my very frequent absences in the field during the summer months, I did not report this to you, but was under the impression I had done so. This error is the crux of the unfortunate subsequent happenings. There is no written contract with Robert Campbell.\n\nYou will please note that at no time had I assumed responsibilities for which I had no authority. All of my vouchers in connection with work performed by Robert Campbell quote as authority file 166-1-6 (E) dated July 7th, 1948. This was actually the Accountable Advance of $500.00 with which I paid for excavation of basement and carpenter work including building materials.\n\nIn explanation of my voucher 19 of Jan. 8th, 1949; of the total of $2513.06, I paid Robert Campbell $24.16, being the balance of my Accountable Advance. The sum of $2488.90 is still payable to Robert Campbell. However, I am attaching hereto amended voucher submitted in accordance with your instructions and also paylist receipted by...\nmembers of Mr. Campbell's crew, amounting to $1937.75.\n\nWith reference to your 7th paragraph and my voucher 55, I am attaching duly receipted paylist in the amount of $1099.10. Also Item for $72.50, meals at Carcross, has been receipted, with exact dates shown.\n\nYour paragraph 8. My explanation of Mr. Campbell's 10 per cent charges is given in second paragraph. The 10 per cent covered his outlay in payment of wages, materials and supplies. While it is apparent that a savings would have been effected if all purchases had gone through this office, I could not guarantee to Mr. Campbell nor to the Department the time necessary to consummate such transactions during our short and extremely busy summer, though in the wintertime I am in a much better position to devote my attention to building projects. As you may imagine Mr. Campbell is in an excellent position to obtain lumber and building supplies, and knows all the methods of circumventing shortages and expediting material. To give you a complete picture, I could not ask Clerk MacDonald to spare any time on this project as probably 95% of his time is taken up with Family Allowance matters.\n\nRegarding your tenth paragraph and my voucher 156. Item \"32 hours labour - $57.60\" is for carpenter work, with broken time, between February 15th and February 20th, at the rate of $1.80 per hour.\n\nIt is unfortunate that until receipt of your letter at this office on Nov. 16th, 1949, I had no specific knowledge of incorrect procedure. I sent telegrams to you dated March 29th, April 18th, June 7th, July 18th and August 8th, concerning payment of vouchers, receiving a reply on August 8th.\n\nMr. W.S.

T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated June 25th, file No 166-1-10, also accountable cheque No 1221, amount $200.00 for the travelling expenses of the pupils going to and from the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that funds are extremely limited and that the above amount is all that the Department can provide during the current fiscal year for pupils travelling expenses.\n\nThe principal has been notified, also the Missionaries at the different Indian centres, of the limited amount available for travelling expenses of pupils. I have advised them not to accept any more applications for admission to the school except locally where no travelling is involved, unless parents are prepared to pay the fares of the children applying for admission.\n\nI may say that one girl was discharged at the end of June her travelling expenses being paid to Dawson. Before your letter was received I had arranged for three pupils from Carmacks and three or possibly four from Champagne Landing and two children have been sent from here, all new pupils, and one boy discharged last May whose fare had to be paid to Whitehorse. When these expenses are paid the grant allowed will be just about absorbed. Half fares are obtained for all children under 12 years when going to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

The contents of this file have been read over very carefully but do not tell us whether the children in question are grant earning pupils or not. I should imagine that the best way to find out would be to refer the matter to Ottawa again. Our position in the matter is quite clear. Even though we would like to keep the children at the school yet if they are not grant earning pupils it means that we have to feed and clothe them and not receive the usual per capita grant of $250.00 a year. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson are now in Carcross waiting to take the children back with them to Atlin presumably for the summer holidays although I feel that owing to the death of Susie Anderson last winter they are contemplating taking them away for good. Mr. Hawksley, who is now here, is to interview them this afternoon. What the outcome\nof this interview will be I cannot say as yet but you will be notified in due course.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy in placing the papers regarding the Anderson children at my disposal and which I am enclosing herewith,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Grant\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. In an interview with the Rev. J. Hawkins, the Anderson parents stated that they only wanted their children out for the summer holidays. There is the possibility though that if investigations reveal that they are not grant-earning pupils they will be discharged.\n\nN.C. Grant\nSir,\n\nRe:- Anderson's Children. Carcross Indian School- Carcross. Y.T.\n\nI beg to submit a letter received from the present Principal of the Carcross Industrial School, with respect to the above Children. In a letter received from The Indian Commissioner of Victoria B.C. dated Jan 18th 1930 the following information is contained \"it is anticipated that the matter will be carefully considered in all its bearings by the Department and that in due course its instructions will be conveyed to you\" Signd. W.E. Ditchburn.\n\nTherefore the matter was placed on the Office files, and it was taken for granted that the Children had been admitted Officially to the Carcross School, and that the School was enabled to receive payment for those children.\n\nHowever, it now seems that such is not the case and so the whole matter is once again submitted for your kind consideration.\n\nI am.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 14, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the Anderson children.\n\nIn regard to these children, I would refer you to official telegram of January 31st, 1930, which read as follows:-\n\n\"Reference your telegram of twenty-ninth instant, Anderson children may remain in Carcross School until you are further advised.\"\n\nSince that time, the names of the three children have appeared regularly on the return of the Carcross School and grant has been allowed for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThos. F. H. Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nDawson, Y.T. August 7th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated July 27th, file No 166-1-10, notifying me of the Department's approval of the admission of Peter and Ida Henry, members of the Peel River Band, to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Rev principal has been duly notified of the Department's approval of the admission of both these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental letter dated September 26th, 1929, No. 166-1-10 in which certain children including three by the name of Anderson were permitted to enter the Choontia Indian Residential School, Carcross, Yukon Territory, as pupils from the Stikine Indian Agency, B.C.\n\nFrom Information furnished by Mr. Agent Harper Reed, the two Anderson children (the third having died) were allowed the usual summer vacation and their parents have positively refused to have these children return to the School. It appears that the death of the third child has prejudiced the parents against the School. Although the Agent has intimated that the cost of sending these children back to Carcross School will be about $75.00, he thinks it may be as well for the children to be allowed an extended vacation over the coming winter. The principal of the School, however, cannot agree to this as when the parents took the children on vacation they were assured by the principal that they would remain out of School only for the period of the holidays. The principal also believes that these cases should be dealt firmly with in order to avoid advantage being taken of the leniency by other Indian parents to the detriment of the school next summer.\n\nIn addition to the Anderson children two children of Indian Pat Mcclusky (Stikine Agency) of Telegraph Creek, are similarly truant pupils of Carcross School and the parents refuse to return them. The environment of these children is said to be anything but good, the father being a drunkard and the mother having gone off to live with a white man leaving the children with other Indians.\n\nThe sending of the Mcclusky children would be an additional heavy charge upon the Department. In view of the fact that the children would have to have an escort, the expenses of the latter would also have to be met. There being no constable attached to the Stikine Agency, a special officer would likely have to be commissioned by the Indian Agent.\n\nIn view of the heavy cost of having these children conveyed as truants for so great a distance and at so large an expense, I have deemed it advisable that the circumstances be reported upon to the Department and its instructions obtained before incurring the cost of the necessary procedure.\n\nKindly wire advise in this connection in order that I may communicate with Agent Reed before he leaves Atlin.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 940-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1931.\n\nW.

Mackenzie, Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the quarterly returns of attendance at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the quarter ending September 30th, 1931.\n\nRegarding Bessie Anderson, pupil 083, she was taken home by her parents at the end of the June quarter and has not been returned. She is one of the pupils from the Stickine Agency.\n\nWith reference to Stella Allen, pupil 084, admitted to the Whitehorse Hospital suffering from tuberculosis, Dr. Wride advises that she be not returned to the school for health reasons; she is being discharged.\n\nTom Anderson, pupil 89, Mike McClusky, pupil 97, and Roy McClusky, pupil 98, were all taken by their parents at the end of the June quarter and have not returned. These three pupils were from the Stickine Agency, sent to the school by Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent for the Stickine Agency.\n\nEnclosures,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo, enclosing the September quarter return of the Carcross Indian Residential School. Early in September, the Department had received a letter from Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, with reference to Bessie Anderson - No. 083; Tom Anderson - No. 89; Mike McClinsky - No. 97; and Roy McClinsky - No. 98. In view of the expense involved, it was decided not to return these children to the Carcross School. You should so inform the Principal and their names should not appear on future returns.\n\nThe discharge of Stella Allan - No. 084, is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y. T.\nSir:-\n\nAn Indian boy from the Pelly River (Billie Johnnie) has been in the hospital at Whitehorse for a year suffering from a tubercular ankle joint. When I was in Whitehorse last September I visited the hospital and found that the boy could get about very well on crutches and in other ways appeared to be normal. A suggestion was made to Dr Wride that the boy might be sent to the Carcross Indian Residential School thus saving the expense at the hospital (over $100.00 per month).\n\nI beg to report that this has now been done, the boy arrived at the school on October 20th. This boy's home being at Ross River where there is no mail service during the winter it is impossible to get the regular form or application for admission filled up by his parents. In view of the foregoing I wish to ask the Department to make the usual per capita grant for this boy until opportunity offers to get the regular form filled in.\n\nIt would appear only just that the school authorities be allowed the usual grant as they will have to feed, clothe and give him necessary attention. The cost of keeping him at the school is considerably less than the hospital charges. It is hoped that this will meet with favorable consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 2335-5 of the 4th instant, I have to say that the admission of Billie Johnnie to the Carcross Residential School is approved. It is understood that the condition of his health will not be a menace to the health of the other pupils at the school. The usual per capita grant will be allowed for him from the date of his admission. When it is possible to secure an application form, you should forward this for the Department's file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated November 6th, file No 166-1-10, in reference to Bessie Anderson, No 982; Tom Anderson, No 89; Mike McClusky, No 97; and Roy McClusky, No 98; pupils of the Carcross Indian Residential School who failed to return to the school after the summer holidays.\n\nThe Principal has been notified that, in view of the expense involved, the Department decided not to return these children to the school.\n\nYour letter was misdirected to the Indian Office, Brantford and was remailed to its destination by the Superintendent, Lt Col C.E. Morgan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated November 26th, file No 166-1-10, in reference to the admission of Billie Johnny to the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that since applying to the Department for the per capita grant for this boy Dr Wride has found it necessary to take him back to the hospital. He did not make good progress while resident at the school, the t.b. which is in his system has gone to the lungs, for this reason the Doctor deemed it advisable to take him back to the hospital for further treatment.\n\nThis boy was isolated during the whole period that he was in residence at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.\nSecretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 12th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 2335-5 of the 18th ultimo, with reference to Billie Johnny. It is noted that the medical officer has had this boy returned to the hospital. Until the doctor definitely decides regarding his health, this boy's name may be retained on the quarterly return of the Carcross Residential School but no grant should be requested for him while he is absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.

During the winter, Long Jim goes off with Eva, the step daughter, and a complaint was laid against him, by his wife Nellie. Inspector Munsch of the R.C.M.P. cleared the matter up, by sending the wife and her family to here, and keeping Long Jim at Liard to trap. It is understood that he will also pay in to the Inspector, value for the up-keep of his family this spring.\n\nSince last Fall the family have been on the nation Sheet of this Office, as they are destitute. Nellie the wife is a fine Indian woman and doing all she can to bring them up correctly. The two lads, especially are now at the age when they will either go good or bad, and should certainly be taken away from this very bad half-breed town, where morals are not considered.\n\nTherefore, it is thought correct to take these two boys over to Atlin, when my visit is paid there, in about a month's time, and see them safe under the care of Mr Grant of the Carcross School.\n\nThe Girl Ethel, with it is hoped two other girls, can be placed in this school, next spring when it is possible to get them over to Carcross, but the papers for her admission are submitted now.\n\nBoth parents are most desirous that their children go to this School, and the matter has been under way for nearly two years, but it is a hard job to get parents to allow their children to go so far away.\n\nAll of which, Sir, it is hoped meets with your approval with the assurance that the cost to all concerned is of course much less, over the winter trail, than if they were sent during the summer time, per coast wise U.S.A. boats.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\nFamily Record: Long Jimmy Dease, Liard & Dease Lake.\n\nFather: Long Jim DEASE. Good worker and trapper.

Age 33. Mother of above child. One of the troublesome Paddy ward Family of Atlin, all given trouble but can't help it. Mary lived with Billy Fan years ago, and Lillian is their daughter. Later Mary went to live with Pat Mc Clusky, taking Lillian with her. Children by Pat are three - two boys, and one girl. Mary states that Billy Fan never really supported Lillian and therefore her girl. This girl cause of untold rows, so to settle the matter, Mary requested that she be sent to Carcross School with others going in 1929, which was done. In spring 1930 Mary and Pat went to Wrangell, S.E. Alaska and worked in a cannery. Pat returned for Guide on Big Game Hunt, leaving Mary down there. Mary then ran away with a Phillipino, leaving the two boys in Wrangell, and taking her young daughter with her. She is still on the coast, and claims to be a U.S.A. Citizen. Immigration Authorities advised both sides of the line, but at that the matter died.\n\nBilly FAN. Father of Lillian. age 53. Always by himself and makes good money, never in debt. He is one of the old sort, does not believe in schools or Indian Trap Lines. Is connected with the \"Joe Colburn\" bunch of Indians and of The Allied Tribes Assoc. Affair. Best Big Game Guide we have. Now lays claim to Lillian and demands her release from School, also that her name be changed to Nellie Fan. Says she will be \"no good\" if she stays there. wants her to be returned so that she can look after his camp and his old Mother. Inclined to get very \"uppish\" over the matter. Has offered to make \"will\" (what of is not know) in her favour.\n\nPat Mc Clusky. age 46. Husband of Mary, father of three children by her, two boys, and one girl. He is a wild unsettled Indians always drunk when possible, and troublesome but one of the best worst men around. After Mary left him down at Wrangell, he went there and took his two boys to Carcross School, under proper papers Etc. However in Fall of 1931, after a lot of trouble with Law Authorities, he called at the School and got hold of his Boys, and hit the bush and has been out ever since. Matter taken up with Indian Commissioner Victoria, but expenses involved considered far too much for action to be taken.\n\nThe above long detail is rendered as it is thought the matter might again come up for attention, in the future.\n\nMay a ruling be given, as to if the girls name may be altered to Nellie Fan, and to whom, and also when, the Girl should be allowed to leave the School. A sample of her work is enclosed.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nHarper Tees, Indian Agent\nOttawa, March 16th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, with reference to Lillian McCluskey - No. 087 of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThe information given in your letter has been carefully noted and, as the Department considers that it is in her best interests to remain in the Carcross School, we are not prepared to authorize her discharge. It is also considered that she should not be permitted to leave the school during the holiday period as, if such permission was granted, it is unlikely that she would be returned.\n\nYou should so inform the Reverend Principal of the Carcross School and advise him that this girl should not be permitted to leave the school without first securing the Department's authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

April 11th., 1932.\n\nHarper Reed Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Reed,\n\nWith regard to Lena and Jeffy Williams I would like to say how pleased I am that they have been admitted to the Indian school at Carcross. A father of two myself, the plight of these two destitute waifs rather got under my skin. The little girl's condition will improve considerably under institutional treatment - and only with such supervised treatment. As for Jeffy I thought he was a particularly bright and healthy little chap and I'm very glad he is in a place where he will not be subjected to the various maladies to which he undoubtedly would succumb were he to remain with only his father's or some indifferent person's care. In my opinion the only chance these Indian kiddies have of keeping good health is to be placed in a school as early as possible.\n\nWith kindest regards I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL.G.C. d'Easum, M.B.\nChootla Indian Residential School\n\nCarcross, Yukon, Canada\nvia Skagway, Alaska\n\nApril 8th, 1932.\n\nHarper Reed Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed:\n\nEnclosed you will find the following:\n\n1. A picture of the children from your agency which are now at the school. You will recall that this picture was taken during your recent visit. If you require any more prints we shall be delighted to send them.\n\n2. Application for Admission Forms for Jeffy and Lena Williams which have been duly witnessed. Mr. Frank Williams came to the school yesterday and after reading your letter of the 4th inst., which accompanied the Application Forms the only thing to do was to accept both charges even though they are both under age. Miss Seale our Boy's Supervisor who was consulted concerning the admission of the boy, who is little more than a baby, was delighted to have such a small boy to care for, so in this respect there will be no difficulty. As far as the Department at Ottawa is concerned I feel sure that if they know the circumstances surrounding their admission at such an age will raise no objections and allow the usual grant. You will no doubt explain things to them when the Application for Admission Forms are sent in. To my mind the school is the proper and only place for destitute children no matter what their age may be.\n\nIn connection with Agnes Crow Dr. Wride will be written to by this mail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAtlin, B.C.\nApril 4th 1932.\n\nH. C. M. Grant, Esq.\nPrincipal.\nCarcross Indian School.\n\nDear Mr Grant,\n\nWith further regard to Frank Williams children who were going to come to your care. Upon return to Atlin Frank came in from the Taku River. As stated his wife with another child have died this winter, so he is certainly up against it. I have passed the two children through the local doctor here and you will see what he says but I think the younger of the two is really too small to be taken in charge by yourself.\n\nHowever I have instructed Agness Crew, who is new in charge of the two kiddies to report to you, and what you decide goes. Agness Crew is also destitute, being the sister of Frank Williams wife, and her only relative living being the Johnston family in Carcross, to whom she is now going and staying with till the Spring sets in good.\n\nIf you turn down the youngsters or only one they will have to go and live with the Johnston family, in care of Agness till Springtime.\n\nIt would be advisable for Dr Wride to look into the matter and between you two settle what is best, and let me know.\n\nWhen doing this please return the papers as they have to go to Ottawa for final admission.\n\nAlso ask Dr Wride to look over Agness who he is well acquainted with, as I think there is something the matter with her, he will do this of course, and she could be sent for when needed.\n\nThis is all I can do in the matter now.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.\n\nThe Johnston family also are destitute - drawing Ration - reason head of family just out of hospital. They lost a youngster also last fall - Summer should see this man working again.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nApril 1st 1932.\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe...Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: WILLIAMS, Lena.\nEnglish name: ditto\nAge: Born October 22, 1926.\nName of Band: Atlin Band.\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: WILLIAMS Frank.\nMother's full name and No.: Wife of above Clarha.\nParents living or dead: Father alive.

Members Church of England.\nHusband. Frank. WILLIAMS Atlin Band. 29 years\nWife. Clarah. -- 34 died on Taku River Winter 1931.\nBilly -- age 9.

Fall/31.\nDaughter -- 1. care Agnes Crow.\n\nThe Father is an intelligent and hard working Indian, and lives with his family at the lower end of the Taku River. His trapground returns are not large, whilst wages now received due to the drop in Silver, is hardly sufficient for their needs. Clarah, the last never recovered good health, after the last child was born, and this last Fall the younger daughter died, and later on the Wife passed away. This left the Indian with two youngsters and a baby on his hands, with only his wife's half sister, who also had a baby, to care for his family's affairs, which was too much for him to carry on with.\n\nHe arrived in Atlin at the same time as I returned from the Carcross School, and humbly requested that the above two children, may be admitted to this school, so that he could get away for a Beaver Hunt, and make some money.\n\nAs he really has no other place to send his children, and that two were already there, he was told to go on to Carcross, and interview the Principal, Mr Grant.\n\nTo this end the necessary papers were made out, and are herewith attached, with also some correspondence that has passed over the matter.\n\nAll of which, Sir, is humbly forwarded with the hope that this hard case will meet with your benevolent consideration, and that the action taken, ore correct authority had been received, will be excused on the grounds that great delay and some little expense would have been incurred, had that authority been first requested.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 27th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that, in view of your special report, the Department approves of the admission of Jeffy and Lena Williams to the Carcross Indian Residential School and you may so inform the Principal.\n\nThe admission of these children is not to form a precedent for the admission of other children under age as it is only under very exceptional circumstances that the Department can favourably consider such applicants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Mar. 16th, with regard to the above Indian Girl, now in the Caribou Indian School.\n\nThe instructions therein contained was at once passed on to the Principal, Mr Grant, and in his reply the following short report on the Girl was received:\n\n\"Considering her age, 9 years, Nellie Fann shows promise of benefiting greatly from the training that she is receiving. Our classroom teacher Miss F. M. Whyte, in a report states as follows\u2014\n\nNellie Mc Cluskey (Fann) age 9. Grade 1. writes an excellent hand for her age, and is making very satisfactory progress indeed with her reading and elementary arithmetic. She has a great liking for drawing and shows promise at it. Her conduct is good.\"\n\nHer Father Billy Fann will be advised, in due course of the progress that his child is making and also be acquainted of the Departments ruling in this matter. This of course he will object to, and as he is one of \"the Joe Colburn\" followers, perhaps the matter may come up for attention later on when every way possible will be used to show him that it is for the child's best interests, that she stays at the school.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

Grant for the return of two truant pupils I beg to report that these two boys ran away on Sunday morning, July 3rd. Following the usual custom the pupils were all sent into the school grounds after breakfast for fresh air and exercise, the two boys very calmly walked off and were not missed until the muster for service. A search for the boys was instantly started but no trace of them was obtained until Monday morning when they were reported as having arrived at the section house at Cowley on the railway some 32 miles from the school. While arranging for them to be put on the train about due from Whitehorse they overheard the plans that were being made over the telephone and again disappeared. A wire was then sent to the R.C.M.P. and the Rector of Whitehorse to keep on the look out for them, they were caught by a constable of the R.C.M.P. about five miles from Whitehorse and taken into the town and kept at the barracks until the arrival of the principal to escort them back to the school.\n\nIn the case of Chappie Sam, he was brought up from Carmacks by the Bishop of Yukon to Whitehorse to be examined by Dr Wride. This boy was certified as being unfit to enter the Carcross school therefore he was returned to his parents.\n\nNo accountable cheque having come to hand from the Department to meet these expenditures they were paid by me from personal funds.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F.

In the first place, payment of the account should be requested in favour of yourself and not as it appears on the top of your voucher.\n\nOne voucher should be forwarded covering items 1, 2, 6 and 7, which refer to expenditures for transportation of pupils to and from the Carcross Indian Residential School. A second voucher should be forwarded for items 3 and 4, which are, apparently, your own travelling expenses and a third voucher should be submitted for item 5, covering freight charges paid on drugs sent to Old Crow. On receipt of these three vouchers properly prepared, immediate consideration will be given to the question of payment.\n\nOur funds this year are extremely limited and it is doubtful if any more expenditure can be authorized for the transportation of children to and from the Carcross School other than that already paid. You should so inform the Principal of the Carcross School. If there is any further small expenditure in this regard that you consider the Department should pay, you may submit a voucher giving full particulars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDawson, Y.

September 20th,1932.\n\nSir,- I have the honor to enclose herewith the applications for admission to the Carcross Indian Residential School of Alfred and Pauline Ellis and Lily Johnson, these children are all members of the Carcross band.\n\nIn explanation of the delay in forwarding these applications I may say that in the case of the Ellis children it was a matter of getting the health certificate filled in by the doctor, it will be noted that the applications were made in May but it was not until September 12th, that the medical examination could be made.\n\nIn the case of Frank Miller, this boy was taken from Carmacks to the school by the Bishop of Yukon who, unfortunately, did not fill in the usual form filled in and signed by the father. After the boy had gone to the school the parents went away to the hills to hunt and trap and will probably stay there until next spring. Efforts have been made to locate the parents for the purpose of obtaining the signature of the father, up to date we have not been able to do this. I have therefore taken the liberty of signing for the father with whom I have some correspondence in the earlier part of this year concerning the boy being admitted to the school to which he was very anxious to send him. We hope this will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Hawksley.\n\nA.F.

Since her discharge she has been taken care of by various Indian families, for some months past she has been cared for by Mrs Martha Johnson, a resident of the Indian village at Carcross, who has signed the application as her guardian; it is not known where her father is and her mother is dead. The father has not supported Jessie since she left the school.\n\nDr R.J.Wride, after a careful examination, states that the girl is quite fit to re-enter the school.

The allowance of $200.00 being already expended.\n\nUp to date the cheque for the amount stated has not yet come to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Hawksley,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, the office file on the case of Lillian Mc Clusky - No 087 Carcross Indian Residential School, for your consideration and necessary instructions.\n\nRev.H.M.C. Grant Principal of the above school, with also myself have come to the conclusion that perhaps it would be better to release this Indian Girl from the school now, rather than allow her to learn more knowledge than will be of any use to her, in her native home.\n\nThe Mother's Family- the Paddy Wards of Atlin claim the girl, indian fashion, but the family is one of great trouble, and their girls of no use.\n\nAs the attached file will show, the Mother is now in S.E. Alaska, and is likely to stay there, and therefore out of the question as to the returning of Nellie to her.\n\nThe Father Billy Fann, really wants the girl, and will no doubt give her all the attention that is necessary, and has consistently requested that she be returned to his care.\n\nThe Step Father Mc Clusky is not interested in the affair at all, and is keeping away in the woods with his two boys.\n\nTherefore may instructions be received to return Nelly to her Father Billy Fann, and if granted he has promised to fetch her from the school with his Dog-team next Fall.\n\nI am.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to Lillian McClusky. The June quarter return of the Carcross Indian Residential School shows that this girl is only eleven years of age and I note from your correspondence that you suggest that she return to her father and keep house for him. The Department is inclined to feel that it is hardly fair to this girl to require her to take over such duties at her age. It is felt that it would be in her best interests to remain in the Carcross School for another year or two. Even though she does not make rapid progress in classroom work, she would, no doubt, receive considerable domestic training which would be useful to her in later years. However, if you consider that she should be discharged at the present time, you may again write the Department.\n\nThe file which you forwarded is returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.

Before leaving school, this lad was given a pass signed by the writer showing that his holidays terminated at 6:30 P.M. of August 12th, 1933. As you can see from the date of this communication he is approximately one week late and can be regarded as a truant unless of course his absence is due to sickness.\n\nAs members of the R.C.M.P. act in the capacity of truant officers it would be appreciated if steps were taken to investigate this matter and bring about his return to school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n(Sgd) H.C.M.

On Sept. 5th, 1933, I left Champagne obtaining transportation by George Chamber's gas boat on patrol to the foot of Dezadeash Lake where Donjek BROWN resides with his parents. I arrived this same date and interviewed John Brown, the boy's father, who stated as follows:\n\n\"My son, Donjek, obtained leave of absence from the Carcross Indian School sometime in June and was supposed to return there on August 12th, 1933. I did not have any money to pay his fare from my residence to the Carcross School until a few days ago. I have been working on Squaw Creek for the past few weeks and now that I have earned enough money for my boy's fare, it is my intentions to send him at the first opportunity.\"\n\n3. On this same date, I took charge of the boy and proceeded to Champagne arriving in the late p.m.\n\n4. On Sept. 7th, 1933, I left Champagne for Whitehorse enroute to Dawson on transfer, travelling by Police Car which was at Champagne in connection with the weights and measures duty, and escorted BROWN. I arrived at Whitehorse in p.m. and handed BROWN over to the N.C.O. In Charge Whitehorse.\n\n5. I may state that although the boy was absent from school, in my opinion, it was not the boy's fault and if the father had had the money for the boy's fare from his home to Carcross, I believe that the boy would have been willing to go.\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 940-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n6.

She will not be keeping house for her father so much as helping around the camp, and generally growing up to the life she will have to live in the bush.\n\nThere is a case of a returned school girl, back from the Le Jack R.C. Mission of British Columbia, down at Liard Post, who has grown out of the ways of the wild bush, and her life at present is hardly worth living, she is looked down upon by her own folk. However she is making the best of the matter and perhaps after a while will fit into place. This routine has now stopped, and the mission at Mc Dames Creek is doing good school work, at the same time keeping the children in their own ways of life.\n\nTherefore it is sincerely thought it would be better to allow Lillian to go home now than at a later date, as it would be better for her in the long run. She will suffer no hardships and shall be supplied such books etc as might be of help to her from this Office.\n\nI am,\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.\nAct. Supt Indian Education.\nDept.

We trust that this boy's immediate discharge will be looked upon favourably by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis boy's father, Mr. George Sidney of Carcross, recently returned home from the General Hospital at Whitehorse. The writer has been informed that his heart is in a bad shape and that for him to do any strenuous work would be going contrary to medical advice. The discharge of this pupil has been talked over with Corporal Blatta here who agrees with me that under the circumstances, seeing that his father has a trap line out and cannot attend to same, his immediate discharge is advisable. It is more than likely that if this boy is retained at school his parents will have to receive relief from the Department of Indian Affairs. With Pete home such should not be necessary.\n\nAs far as the school is concerned I may add that this boy's discharge from the school will be welcomed for during the past few months he has not been a good influence over his associates and has given us considerable trouble.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(signed)\nH.

The matter of discharges requiring immediate consideration may, therefore, be left in the hands of the Principal and yourself, to take whatever action you believe best under the circumstances.

Philip Joseph who reaches the age of 18 yrs. this year and whose discharge will no doubt be put into effect some time after the end of June. This pupil's register number is 73.\n\n2.

I would, therefore, request that either you or the Principal certify on each copy as follows: \"Services Rendered: Charges Fair and Just\". The account should then be returned to the Department and payment will be made.\n\nIn connection with accounts for transportation expenses of pupils of the Carcross School, I would request that you advise the Principal that, in future, when he is applying for the discharge of a pupil, he should state whether it will be necessary to pay any transportation costs, and, if so, state the amount. He should receive the necessary authority before incurring any expenditure. Our funds for payment of transportation expenses of pupils to and from Indian residential schools are limited, and it is expected that Principals will obtain authority before incurring any expenditure which the Department will be called upon to pay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Phillip Joseph has already been discharged. With regards to Howard Dease we would like the permission of the Superintendent General to keep him in school another year. The reason for this request is that he has a younger brother in school (102 - Wilfred Dease) who does not reach sixteen years of age until next year and both these lads wish to leave school together. This matter was discussed with Indian Agent Harper Reed of the Stikine Agency last winter and he thinks that it would be for the best if it could be arranged that these two boys leave school at the same time.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 17, 1935.\n\nRev.

Attached hereto please find application for admission to the Carcross Residential School made on behalf of the above named two girls.\n\n2. I cannot recommend that these girls be admitted to the school and my reason for so doing is on the grounds that these girls are not in a condition of health to warrant their admission.\n\n3. It will be noted that Dr Nunn in his report of medical examination states that they are fit for admission, but states that there is an unhealthy family history in connection with both these girls.\n\n4. From my personal knowledge of this family I would state that the father is suffering from tubercular disease and is in very poor condition, also that within the past three months two of the younger children of this family have died from tubercular disease, and that from my observation of these two candidates I am not satisfied that their health is such that they should go to the residential school and mix with the other pupils there.\n\n5. Keeping in mind the result of an Indian girl, Alice Simple, having been sent from a family practically the same as the Simon's, to the school at Carcross and that she was only there for a few months when she had to be removed to the General Hospital at Whitehorse where she had to be kept for over a year, I am of the opinion that to send these two Simon's girls to the school would only be a cause of considerable expense to the Department in the very near future.\n6. I might state that I had the opportunity to take this matter up with the Principal of the School, the Rev Mr Grant, when he was in Dawson recently, and he saw these girls and he is of the same opinion as myself that they, in view of the family history, are unsuitable to be admitted to the school.\n\n7.

G.S. Pragnell.\n\nJohn Sinkut:\n\nThe schooling of Indian children in the Stikine Agency was dealt with in my August 1930, report of inspection of this agency. It would appear that until a definite policy is adopted, we shall have to make the best arrangements possible for the care of these children as suggested by the Inspector.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nStikine,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.,\nSeptember 4th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a Report covering the month of August 1936.\n\nUpon my arrival in Carcross, Rev. Grant, in charge of the Indian Residential School, located there, turned back to my care the two Dease boys who return to their mother at Telegraph Creek. The two lads are fine examples of what is possible, if the right kind of Indians are selected for this expensive schooling. They were very much admired during the long journey home, by all who met them.\n\nReaching Skagway it was with much difficulty that passages were arranged abroad the U.S.A. S/ship Northwestern, to carry us to Wrangell.\n\nTourist traffic this year especially, has been very heavy and a Canadian or for that matter anybody, is not allowed to travel from one U.S.A. Port - to another, on a Canadian Boat. As is usual the American boats pick up freight at every point possible and we were aboard this boat for six full days. The two Indian lads took the opportunity, at each port of call, of speaking to all the Indian Curio workers about the quantity of moose hides to be had in the Cassiar, and it is hoped that their mother will reap a benefit from some future sales.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nAug 2, 1936.\n\nReturning from the Atlin Inspection, this summer the two Indian lads - Howard & Willie Dease were picked up at Carcross Y.T.

Referring to the letter of the Chief, Training Division, dated September 1st 1937, I beg to state that I have taken this matter up with the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T. and the following are the facts of the case.\n\n2. In regard to the request made by John Semple, Indian of the Peel River tribe, but now residing at Moosehide Y.T., in which he asks that his son Alfred Semple be returned to him from the school at Carcross, the boy referred to is undoubtedly the pupil Alfred Semple, Register No 112, and whose name has appeared on the last twelve quarterly returns for the School.\n\n3. It is noted that in the letter written by the father he states that the boy is 18 years old, this is not correct, if the father gave the correct age of the boy at the time the Application for Admission forms were prepared.\n\n4. These forms were dated January 2nd 1934 and the age given at that time by the father was thirteen, so it would appear that the age of the boy now is 15\u00bd years, not 18 years as stated by the father, and I am of the opinion that this is purely in keeping with the practice of the Indians in the Yukon when they want to get their children out of the school, the age they give is not in keeping with the age given at the time of admission, this is the cause of considerable trouble and I am of the opinion that the age given at admission is the one which should govern at all times.\n\n5. In any event, according to the Indian Act, this boy is due for discharge in 1938, and I do not see any reason for his discharge before the finish of the present academic year, in the first place the father, John Semple, has been convicted for intoxication three times in the past two years and also has a conviction for assault registered against him in that time.\n\nJohn Semple's wife has left him and is now living with another Indian, and for this family upheaval, he is, in my opinion, after hearing both of their stories, entirely to blame and under all the circumstance I do not consider him to be a fit person to have charge of the boy at the present time, he is well aware of my views in this matter, as I had already informed him that the boy could not be allowed out of the school until he had completed his full course and also that I expected to see an improvement in his, John Semple, conduct before the boy was entrusted to his care.\n\nG. Binning, A/Supt.\nDept Indian Affairs.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.\nChief, Training Division.\nDept Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 940-10, part 4)\nOttawa, November 25, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of November 9th with reference to Alfred Semple, No. 112, of the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department is not prepared to approve the discharge of this boy from the Carcross School at the present time and you should so inform the father.\n\nI have also noted the information that you give in the last paragraph of your letter. Before application is made for this boy's discharge next June, you should advise the Department if the father's conduct has improved. If not, it might be necessary to keep the boy in Carcross for a longer period. Of course, every endeavour should be made by the Principal to make his training as practical as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

Nelson as guardian, and the following are the facts in relation to this boy.\n\nDixon John, father of Willie Smith, had four children, Willie being the youngest. Dixon John's wife, Alice, was a sister to Mrs N.C. Nelson, and Mrs Dixon John died when Willie was ten months old. This boy was adopted by his grandmother, Mrs Jack Smith, but she died last spring, and the boy was then taken by Mrs Nelson, but she is not in a position to continue supporting this boy.\n\nAt no time since the death of this boy's mother, has the father had the boy in his care, and it would appear that the father has never had anything to do with the bringing up of this child.\n\nG.

Binning, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDawson, Y. T.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a request from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross, that one of the pupils Register No 112, Alfred Semple, be not discharged from the School this year.\n\nThere has already been correspondence in regard to this boy, your file 166-1-10, and the reason that the principal objects to his discharge is because during the past year this boy has been unruly, going to town without a pass and smoking all because he expects to be discharged this year. The Principal is of the opinion that if he is kept in school for another year that it will be an example to the rest of the older boys and let them see that they cannot disobey orders in their last year.\n\nIn my previous report regarding this lad, I spoke of the father, this man has been in the Blackstone country for the winter so that I cannot say whether there is any improvement in his behaviour or not, or whether he is yet fit to have charge of this lad.\n\nThe Principal also informs me that he has had a request from the parents of Register No 0115, Mabel Sidney, that this girl be kept in the school until she reaches the age of 18 years. This girl was not admitted to the school until the fall of 1935 and consequently has not had a great deal of schooling, this is the reason her parents wish her to remain at school for a longer period.\n\nI would be pleased if you would notify me in regard to the wishes of the Department as to these two pupils.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\n\nG. Binning, A/Supt\nDept Indian Affairs.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 11th instant you may inform the Principal of the Carcross Residential School that Alfred Semple, No. 112, and Mabel Sidney, No. 0115, may remain in the Carcross Indian Residential School until the close of the academic year 1938-39. If it is desired to keep them after that date further application should be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. Binning, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nDawson, Y. T.\nWe, the undersigned, respectfully request Captain G. Binning, R.C.M.P., Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Yukon, that he give his approval and recommend to the Department of Indian Affairs that the following children be given their discharge from the CARCROSS Indian Residential School:\n\nRegister Number 096 - Ada Johns.\nRegister Number 123 - Arthur Dawson.\nRegister Number 0119 - Hilda Dawson.\n\nIt is felt that as these children are a decidedly bad influence over the other scholars and are creating a spirit of dissatisfaction not only amongst the school children but amongst certain Indian families in the southern Yukon, their discharge should be put into effect immediately.\n\nH.

White\nFarm Instructor\n\nKitchen Matron\n\nEngineer\n\nx x x\nCaptain G. Binning, R.U.M.P.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDAWSON, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past winter the staff and myself have had a great deal of trouble in dealing with and trying to make amenable to discipline the following children:\n\nRegister Number 096 - Ada Johns.\nRegister Number 125 - Arthur Dawson.\nRegister Number 0119 - Hilda Dawson.\n\nAfter making every effort without any apparent success the staff and myself are convinced that in the interests of the other pupils and the school in general these children should be given their immediate discharge. The attached statement, signed by every member of the staff shows that they have given this matter careful consideration and are unanimous with regard to what should be done to remedy an unfortunate situation.\n\nThese three children can be put into the category of agitators and not only are they a disturbing influence amongst the other pupils but are causing a spirit of dissatisfaction amongst certain Indian families in the southern Yukon. I have it on good authority that not long ago Register No. 096 - Ada Johns - made the following statement to her father, Johnnie Johns of Carcross - \"The floor sweepings are being fed to the children\". Needless to say such a statement is absurd and entirely false but has done a great deal of harm. Mr. Johnnie Johns as a result\nhas been saying that he is going to take Ada out of the school because the floor sweepings are being fed to the children. A few years ago, shortly after this girl was admitted to school, her father, who is very conscious of the fact that he has more money than other Indians, wanted his daughter given special food which he said he was prepared to pay for. It was only with great difficulty that he was persuaded that such a course of action would not be wise and could not be followed in the school. He seemed to resent the fact that his daughter would not be accorded different treatment from the children of other poor Indians.\n\nLast Fall two children were admitted to this school, Register Number 123 - Arthur Dawson and Register Number 0119 - Hilda Dawson. During the past winter Mr. Geo. Dawson of Whitehorse visited his children at the school and on his return to Whitehorse stated that he was going to take his children out of school because his children said \"it is too strict, have to get up too early, work too hard, not enough to eat and have to eat dog rice.\" Naturally such an absurd statement which apparently Mr. Geo. Dawson believes and is propagating is creating a spirit of dissatisfaction amongst certain Indian families in and around Whitehorse.\n\nHaving these three dissatisfied children in the school is creating a spirit of dissatisfaction also amongst the other children and makes things very difficult for the staff. Both Mr. Johnnie Johns and Mr. Geo. Dawson are fairly well off for Indians and because they have money think that their children in the school should be treated differently from other children. Possibly in an effort to impress their financial status upon the other children in the school they are constantly sending their children expensive clothing and presents which is not a good thing and arouses quite a feeling of jealousy. As Mr. Johnnie Johns and Mr. Geo. Dawson are well able to provide for their children and very critical of our efforts I feel that it would be only a just thing for their places to be filled by children who haven't such 'wealthy' parents and who really need the food, clothing and attention the school provides.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nDawson Y.T.\nMay 16th 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nAttached hereto please find a letter and petition signed by the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T. and also signed by all members of the staff of the school.\n\nIn regard to the recommendations of the Principal as to the discharge of three pupils from the school, would state that I concur in this and would recommend to the Department that these three children should be discharged from the School immediately.\n\nIn regard to Register No. 96, Ada Johns, would state that the Principal has complained to me previously about this girl but it was agreed to try and see if she could not be made more amenable to discipline, but apparently this has been found impossible, would state that her father Johnnie Johns is a licensed guide in the Yukon and consequently is able to earn quite a little money by taking out hunting parties, he considers himself superior to the other Indians in the Carcross District.\n\nI do not know Mr Geo Dawson or his circumstances but concur in the Principal's recommendation for the discharge of his children from the school.\n\nShould you decide to uphold the Principal in this matter, would you please notify me by radiogram so that these children could be discharged at the earliest possible moment.\n\nG.

According to the Indian the Bishop promised the discharge of the two girls in 1940 but nothing was said about the transportation of the two girls back to McPherson.\n\nBonnetplume would like to know next Treaty time (1938) what arrangements are going to be made either by the department or mission authorities for the return of his two daughters in 1940. If no arrangements are made it is his intention to start for Carcross in the fall of 1939, in order that he himself may bring his girls back in 1940.\n\nThis would appear to be an early enquiry but with the time it will take the department to communicate with Principal H.C.M.Grant of the Anglican Mission school, Carcross, and forward word to me a long time will have elapsed.\n\nI would think and trust the department will see the way to relieve the Indian of the long trip and expense of getting his children.

According to the Indian the Bishop promised the discharge of the two girls in 1940 but nothing was said about the transportation of the two girls back to McPherson.\n\n\"Bonnetplume would like to know next Treaty time (1939) what arrangements are going to be made either by the Department or Mission authorities for the return of his two daughters in 1940. If no arrangements are made it is his intention to start for Carcross in the fall of 1939, in order that he himself may bring his girls back in 1940.\"\n\nPlease let me know if it is your intention to apply for the discharge of these girls at the end of June, 1940, and at the same time you should state what arrangements you can make for having them returned to their home at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

T.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\nINDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION\n\nCHOOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nCARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\n\nAugust 24th 1938.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe 166 - 1 - 10.\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of the eight instant in connection with Dr. J.P. Harvey's report about the children of Alfred Bonnetplume - No. 25 - member of the Louchoux Band No. 7.\n\nIt would seem that this Indian did not give Dr. Harvey a true report regarding the admission of his children to this school. They were not recruited at Fort Macpherson by Bishop Sovereign. At the time their Application for Admission Papers were signed Alfred Bonnetplume was residing in Moosehide, a small Indian village a few miles out of Dawson, Y.T. This is verified by the signatures on their Applications for Admission. Alfred Bonnetplume's signature was witnessed by the Rev. C.H. Jenkins, then Missionary - in - Charge at Moosehide and The Rev. John Hawkeley then Indian Agent for the Yukon signed these papers. I was speaking to The Rt. Rev. W.A. Geddes, D.D., now bishop of the Yukon about this matter a few days ago and he stated that Bishop Sovereign was never in Fort Macpherson during the time he was Bishop of this Diocese.\n\nThen with regard to the promise that Alfred Bonnetplume said was made to him by Bishop Sovereign that his children would be discharged in 1940\nis one I feel can be questioned. I have no knowledge of such a promise being made and doubt very much whether Bishop Sovereign would speak on an issue which is clearly one for your Department to decide. The present Bishop of the Yukon assured me a few days ago that no Bishop has the authority to say how long an Indian child is to be in school, so I question very much whether Bishop Sovereign made the promise he is credited with making.\n\nI have had a great deal of correspondence from Alfred Bonnetplume and his wife about these children. To put the matter mildly he is anything but consistent. On May 3rd 1937 he wrote me from Fort Macpherson stating that he only promised to leave his children here for five years. On July 24th 1937 he requested the Rev. Alex. Dewdney - Missionary at Fort Macpherson - to write to me about the discharge of his children. In this letter Mr. Dewdney credits Alfred Bonnetplume with the following statement:\n\n\"He says he didn't make any definite promise as to how long he would leave them but reserved the right to take them back when he wished.\"\n\nTo add to his inconsistency it may be said that these children were admitted to this school in the year 1933. According to Dr. Harvey's report Alfred Bonnetplume states that Bishop Sovereign promised the discharge of the two girls in 1940. This would make their residence in school extend over a period of seven years.\n\nIn dealing with all the correspondence, including a telegram, received from this Indian I have repeatedly told him that when he placed his children in school and signed the Application for Admission Papers he agreed to leave them here \"under the Guardianship of the Principal for such a term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper\". He has also been advised that, according to the Indian Act, unless some very good reason for an early discharge was given to your Department, all\nIndian children were required to remain in school until they were sixteen years of age. Working on this basis he was informed, that, according to the ages given on Admission, Jessie Bonnetplume would not be able to leave until 1941 and Sarah Bonnetplume until 1943. I told him that if he wished his two girls to leave at the same time the Department of Indian Affairs might agree to Jessie remaining here until she was eighteen years of age which would be in 1943 the year Sarah Bonnetplume reaches the age of 16 years. This plan commends itself to me, besides being in accordance with the Indian Act, by the fact that the Rev. Alex Dewdney in his letter to me of December 9th 1937 writes as follows:\n\n\"He (Alfred Bonnetplume) is not very well and has quite a large family to support.\"\n\nAs an alternative plan I would be quite prepared, if your Department agrees, to apply for their discharge in 1941 even though the younger of the two girls will then be only 14 years of age.\n\nAs to where these two girls be sent on discharge I would suggest that they be sent to the place they were recruited from, viz., Moosehide, Y.T. Alfred Bonnetplume could be advised in plenty of time so that he could be there to meet them. It would seem as if he at one time figured that they would be sent to Moosehide on discharge for on June 18th 1937 he wired me from Aklavik as follows:\n\n\"Please send my daughters Jessie and Sarah Bonnetplume to Moosehide in time for me to get them first boat next spring reply collect.\"\n\nAs I am bound to have further correspondence from this Indian I would be pleased to\nadvised which of the two plans commends itself to you. It seems only the humane thing to do to let both these girls go at the same time, that is, if they are to be sent to Moosehide, Y.T., for the journey from Fort Macpherson to Moosehide is a long one of approximately 500 miles.\n\nAs an afterthought, in view of the fact that there are many Applications for Admission to this school on hand, which cannot be considered for lack of accommodation, I must admit that the plan of letting both these girls go in 1941 is the one that commends itself to the writer more strongly than the one of keeping the older girl here until she is 18 years of age.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter of the 24th ultimo I favour your suggestion that the two Bonnetplume girls be discharged from the Carcross Residential School at the end of June, 1941. However, as it is not necessary to make a definite decision in this regard at the present time I am forwarding a copy of your letter to the Indian Agent with a view to obtaining his comments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCarcross, Y.T.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 29 and my reply of August 8 with reference to the two Bonnetplume girls who are pupils of the Carcross Indian Residential School I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Principal of the Carcross School dated August 24.\n\nThe Department is inclined to favour Rev. Mr. Grant's suggestion that the two girls be kept at Carcross until the end of June, 1941. However, in forwarding you the copy of the letter I wish to place the matter before you and would be pleased to receive your comments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. J. P. Harvey,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nFort Norman N.W.T.\nSept. 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe your letter of Sept. 8, 1938, file 166-1-10. It would appear from Mr. Grant's letter that the Indian Bonnetplume is indeed inconsistent. It was while on the treaty trip and staying with Mr. Dewdney, the missioner at MacPherson, that the requests were made to me. There was no mention made at the time of Moosehide nor of his correspondence with the school.\n\nWith the facts before me, I think as you do that the two girls be kept until the end of June 1941 and then be returned to Moosehide Y.T. where their father can meet them.\n\nIf this is satisfactory to you, I will advise Bonnetplume through Mr. Dewdney, that he can meet his girls there at the above mentioned date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 24 regarding the children of Alfred Bonnetplume the Indian Agent, Dr. J. P. Harvey, has written to the Department and states that he considers it would be satisfactory to keep these girls until 1941 at which time they should be sent to Moosehide. The Department approves of this arrangement on the understanding that the father will be notified sufficiently ahead of time to enable him to be at Moosehide when the girls arrive.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The Department feels that it would be preferable if you handled all transportation costs of children as you are aware of the amount, if any, the Department is prepared to allow for this item of expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

H.C.M. Grant, Principal, Indian Residential School, Carcross, Y.T. The Principal of that institution is aware of the amount which the Department allows for transportation of children to and from that school. This amount is limited as the Indians are expected as far as possible to either pay the transportation costs of their children or bring them to the school without cost. This is the only manner in which we can keep control of this item of expenditure.\n\nG. A. Jeckell, Esq.,\nController of Yukon Territory,\nLands, Parks and Forests Branch,\nDept.

I believe it would be much more satisfactory to this Office if directions re the payment of accounts were received directly from the Department, and not as you suggest through the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A.T.

She became 16 years of age on March 28th.\n\nOn April 9th 1940 No. 0100 Hannah Smith was permitted to go home. Her age on the March quarterly return was given as 15\u00bd. This was an error and should have read 16\u00bd.\n\nI gather from your letter that when a child reaches the age of 16 years it is necessary that an application be made to the Department for either his or her discharge or a recommendation that the child be kept in school for a longer period. The procedure followed here in the past has been to discharge all children who have reached the age of 16 years and who, in our opinion, should not be kept in school for\nlonger period, without making a formal application to the Department. In future, unless I hear from you to the contrary an application for discharge will be made in all cases.\n\nWould you therefore please authorize the discharge of the following children all of which will or have reached the age of 16 years this year. The first four were listed in your letter to which this is an answer.\n\nNo. 089 Mary Davis,\nNo. 0104 - Esther Roberts\nNo. 0105 - Annie Roberts\nNo. 0112 - Rowena Baum,\nNo. 0108 - Jessie Williams\nNo. 099 - Alfredda Ellis\nNo. 107 - George Sidney\nNo. 108 - Wilfred Edwards\nNo. 125 - George Henry\n\nExcept in the cases of No. 099 - Alfredda Ellis, No. 107 - George Sidney and No. 108 - Wilfred Edwards, whose homes are in Carcross, these children who live quite a distance from here could not be discharged until navigation opens. This would be sometime in June. Such being the case it is felt advisable to keep them in school until the close of the present academic year. As No. 099 - Alfredda Ellis, No. 107 - George Sidney and No. 108 - Wilfred Edwards do not reach the age of 16 years until after the end of June I would recommend that they remain in school until June 30th 1940.\n\nI regret that an error has been made in the ages of some of the children on the quarterly returns. In preparing these returns the ages of the children have been taken from the Classroom Register. These have been carefully checked with\nthose given on the Application for Admission and corrections that are necessary have been made. In closing I might add that occasionally the parents or guardian give the incorrect age when a child is admitted and a correction has to be made after the child has been in school a few years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nOttawa,\nMay 16, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant the discharge of the following pupils from the Carcross Residential School at the end of June, 1940, is approved:\n\nNo. 089 Mary Davis          No. 099 Alfredda Ellis\n\" 0104 Esther Roberts       \" 107 George Sidney\n\" 0105 Annie Roberts        \" 108 Wilfred Edwards\n\" 0112 Rowena Baum          \" 125 George Henry\n\" 0108 Jessie Williams\n\nThe fifth paragraph of your letter is not very clear. Possibly you desire to keep pupils 099, 107 and 108 until June 30, 1941. If so, you should advise me.\n\nThe inference you obtained from my letter of the 17th ultimo regarding the procedure to be followed when pupils reach the age of 16 is correct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

He was driving one of the school teams down a hill. The wagon wheel hit a stone and the rack, of heavy construction, came off the rear bulk. The horse became unmanageable and the boy fell off. The rear of the rack, which was dragging on the ground went over him and cut his head open from the left eye to almost the top of his head. The cut was very deep and exposed a considerable portion of his skull. There was quite a lot of bleeding. After consulting the school nurse the doctor was called. As soon as he saw the injury he said he would have to take the boy to hospital and give him a general anaesthetic before any stitching could be done. Whilst transporting the injured boy to the plane the doctor remarked that there was a possibility an hour after the accident severe haemorrhage might occur.\n\nApologizing for not reporting the details of this accident to you at an earlier date.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nINDIAN AND ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION\n\nCHOOUTLA INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nCARCROSS, YUKON, CANADA\n\nJuly 15th 1940.\n\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn October 7th 1938 - Re 166-1-10 -\nyou wrote me as follows:-\n\n\"With further reference to your letter of August 24th regarding\nthe children of Alfred Bonnetplume the Indian Agent, Dr. J.P.\nHarvey, has written to the Department and states that he\nconsiders it would be satisfactory to keep these girls until\n1941 at which time they should be sent to Moosehide. The\nDepartment approves of this arrangement on the understanding\nthat the father will be notified sufficiently ahead of time\nto enable him to be at Moosehide when the girls arrive.\"\n\nI have just received a letter from Alfred\nBonnetplume in which he states that he would like his girls\nto be sent to Mayo, Yukon instead of to Moosehide. He plans to\nbe at Mayo on or about March 20th 1941. In connection with\nthis matter I beg to state as follows:-\n1. If his children are to be at Mayo, Y.T. on the date specified it would be necessary for them to travel by 'plane from Whitehorse, Y.T. The cost of the 'plane trip for the two girls would be $100.00. The railway fare from Carcross to Whitehorse for the two girls would be $8.60. As the 'plane trip from Whitehorse to Dawson (Moosehide) would be $120.00 a saving in transportation would be effected in sending them to Mayo.\n\n2. Apparently Alfred Bonnetplume intends to take his girls from Mayo to Fort Macpherson by dog-team. If the children had to wait here until navigation opens this would not be possible.\n\nRequesting from you authority to send these girls by 'plane from Whitehorse to Mayo, Yukon next March,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nOttawa,\nJuly 29, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the children of Alfred Bonnetplume.\n\nFrom information on our file it appears that this man is travelling around the country to a considerable extent and there does not appear to be any reason why, during the next six or seven months, he could not pay a visit to the Carcross School and take his children home without any expense to the Department. Our funds are so limited that it is impossible to consider allowing the amount that you mention would be required to send the two girls to Mayo.\n\nAt any time that he comes to the school the discharge of the girls may be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

He has remained around Carcross for the last twelve months hoping to get work. Not being able to do so and on hearing from his sister that there was a job waiting him to Dawson he asked that his fare be paid home. This has been done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M.

Please prepare another account for the transportation of the child requiring hospitalization.\n\nWith regard to Harry Davis it is noted that he was discharged from the Carcross School last year. We can only consider payment of transportation home from a residential school when the pupil proceeds home immediately after his discharge. When over a year has elapsed since his discharge the question of paying transportation is a matter for the Welfare Branch to deal with and in consulting the officials of that Branch I am informed that owing to lack of funds it is not possible for them to consider paying transportation of able-bodied Indians. Under these circumstances I regret that payment for the transportation of Harry Davis cannot be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.G.M.

On November 1st it was necessary to wire Dr. F.B. Roth in Whitehorse, as follows:\n   \"Feel advisable wire you school boy appears be quite ill difficulty in breathing pain left chest temperature during last twenty-four hours maximum one hundred and two minimum one hundred and one.\"\n\n2. In about fifteen minutes the following reply was received:\n   \"Advise mustard poultice every four hours aspirin grain five same intervals Stop Will talk you phone nine A.M. tomorrow\".\n\n3. At 8:00 A.M. next morning, November 2nd, I advised Dr. Roth that there was no change in the patient's condition. If anything he appeared to be worse. Arrangements then had to be made for the doctor to see this pupil. The only way this could be done was for the Doctor to come from Whitehorse to Carcross by plane. On arrival he examined the boy and the diagnosis was pneumonia. The patient was taken by the doctor in the plane to Whitehorse for hospitalization.\n\n4. As to the seriousness of this pupil's illness I may say that he has been in hospital over a month. I am pleased to be able to report though, that, according to the latest report, he is making satisfactory progress and expected back in residence in the course of a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

McPherson N. T.\n\n3-1-41.\n\n1. Whilst on patrol this date at Ft. McPherson, the writer received the above mentioned request.\n\nHeadquarters\n2. Mrs. BONNETTLENE states that she and her husband had resided in Dawson City Y.T. until 1933 when they moved to Ft. McPherson N. T. They left behind, and in the care of the Anglican Mission of Dawson, their two daughters, Jesse Jane BONNETTLENE, age 17, and Sarah BONNETTLENE, age 16. At that time their intention was leave them at school for two or three years, then bring them to McPherson. They later found that the trip to Dawson would be impossible due to poor health and financial difficulties. Mrs. BONNETTLENE has asked the help of the Anglican Mission in McPherson and also Dr. HAWK, the Indian Agent. She has also written direct to the Mission in Dawson, but in all cases receives no satisfaction. She now requests that the government supply transportation for her children, as there is no other way of recovering them.\n\nSub-Division\nDetachment\nP.C.R.\n\n3. The writer interviewed the Rev. A.B. DOWNEY of the Anglican Mission at Ft. McPherson in the above connection. He states that the children are at the Anglican School at Carcross Y.T. and not at Dawson City, as believed by the parents. He has written via Bishop and also the Indian Agent, requesting that something be done in the way of transportation for the children in question. It is stated Mr. BONNETTLENE has received no satisfaction in this matter.\n\n4. Due to the poor circumstances in which the above mentioned parents find themselves, it seems that a trip from Ft. McPherson to Carcross by dog team, and return with the children, is out of the question.\n\n5. According to the Treaty Indian list at this detachment, the above mentioned subjects name is spelled BONNETTLENE, but when interviewed by the writer, through an interpreter the name was given as BONNETTLENE.\n\nJ.

H.C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCarcross, Y.T.\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of the 5th instant.\n\nNot knowing when the birthdays of the majority of pupils are we followed the practice for some years of advancing the age of each pupil one year on the first of January. This meant that as we do not usually discharge pupils until June 30th the names of children who become 16 years of age in any given year were shown on two quarterly returns (Jan. - Mar. & Apr. - June) as being 16 years of age. On April 17th 1940 you wrote me as follows:-\n\n\"The March return shows the undermentioned pupils as being over 16 years of age:\"\nNo. 089 Mary Davis\n\" 0104 Esther Roberts\n\" 0105 Annie Roberts\n\" 0112 Rowena Baum.\n\nPlease let me know if it is your intention to apply for the discharge of the abovementioned girls at the end of June next. If not, you should state definitely why you desire them to remain in the school after that date.\"\n\nIn order to avoid having children, aged as 16 years, shown on the quarterly returns for the first two quarters it was felt advisable to advance their ages one year on the 1st of August and have such shown on the quarterly return for the quarter ending September 30th.\n\nThis accounts for the fact, referring to your letter of the 5th instant, why the children listed are shown on the March return as being only 15 years old. In connection with this list may I point out that the birthdays of No. 0109 Marjorie Smith and No. 106 Frank Miller are not known. The birthday of No. 122 William Smith is given on his Application for Admission as being on March 21st and that of No. 0100 Pauline Ellis as being on December 27th.\n\nOn my report for the fiscal year ending March 31st 1941 the following children were shown as being eligible for discharge this year:\n\nNo. 106 Frank Miller\nNo. 108 Wilfred Edwards\nNo. 122 William Smith\nNo. 0100 Pauline Ellis\nNo. 0106 Jessie Bonnetplume\nNo. 0109 Marjorie Smith\nNo. 106 Wilfred Edwards was discharged on May 1st of this year. Authority for doing so was given in your letter of April 24th 1941.\n\nI am rather perplexed to know what to do with No. 0106 Jessie Bonnetplume. There has been quite a bit of correspondence with your department over this girl and her sister No. 0107 Sarah. Your last letter, dated July 29th 1940, in connection with these pupils reads as follows:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the children of Alfred Bonnetplume. From information on our file it appears that this man is travelling around the country to a considerable extent and there does not appear to be any reason why, during the next six or seven months, he could not pay a visit to the Carcross School and take his children home without any expense to the Department. Our funds are so limited that it is impossible to consider allowing the amount that you mention would be required to send the two girls to Mayo.\n\nAt any time that he comes to the school the discharge of the girls may be granted.\"\n\nUp to the present Alfred Bonnetplume has not put in an appearance. I should imagine, in view of the expense in sending these children to Fort Macpherson, which journey from here would have to be either by aeroplane (charter trip) or Via Edmonton, you would wish, even though No. 0106 Jessie Bonnetplume will be 16 years of age this year, that she be kept here until her father or someone appointed by him calls for this girl and her sister.\n\nWhilst writing about pupils due for discharge would you kindly authorize the discharge of the following\nthe same to be put into effect on June 30th 1941:\n\nNo. 106 Frank Miller\nNo. 123 William Smith\nNo. 0100 Pauline Ellis\nNo. 0109 Marjorie Smith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M.

Valentine of Dawson, Y.T., but\nno information is available concerning these girls.\nRev. Valentine, however, recalls that these girls had\nresided at 12 Mile Creek about three years ago. A check\nhas been made of the Mooshide Reserve, and none of the\nnatives there have seen the girls for some time; they\nhaving not been in this district since they were at 12\nMile Creek.\n\n3. Whilst on patrol to Fertymile District, re\nthe taking of the Census, Cst. Widdis enumerated all\nIndians and residents of 12 Mile Creek, Y.T., but no\ngirls by this name were seen or enumerated.\n\n4. It is possible that if these girls left\nCarcross, Y.T., with the intention of visiting Dawson\nduring this past summer, that they might have stopped over\nat the home of natives in the Ft. Selkirk area, and it\nis suggested that inquiries be instituted there, if\nthe whereabouts of the girls is not forthcoming.\n\nHANDED OVER EXPENSES NIL.\n\nSigned.\nCst.\nReg.

FORWARDED 9-10-41 for your information. On receipt of your communication of 9-9-41 a thorough check was made with the Indian agent, the Hostel and town of Dawson, and the Indian Reserve at Moonshade. The two girls had visited 12 Mile Creek three years ago but had returned to Carcross. No trace of them could be found in this vicinity.\n\n2. An airmail communication was forwarded to the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Carcross, and the following is his reply:\n\nChootla Indian Residential School,\nCarcross, Yukon, Canada.\nOctober 4th, 1941.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.Police,\nDawson, Yukon.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the Bonnetplume children. A day or so after your letter was received I had a letter from the Rev. Alex Dewdney of Fort McPherson, N.W.T., which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Just a few lines about the Bonnetplume children. Their mother and father are very worried about them, because they do not really know where they are. We believe they are in Dawson and I have assured them over and over that either the mission or the government will see that the girls are looked after until they can get home but still it is natural for them to worry. We have been after the agent here to try to have them sent all the way home, but no results so far. Alfred is talking of going to Dawson after Christmas, but he should not really make the trip. Neither he nor his family are in the physical condition to stand it. They have lost several children with him in the last few years. Can you send us some definite information as to their whereabouts and who is looking after them? Also whether you know of any plan for their return here? I would be glad if you could send a wire as we have no more mails till December.\"\n\nIn reply to the above I sent Mr Dewdney the following wire which I feel will give you the information required:\n\n\"Jessie and Sarah still at Carcross School stop. In nineteen thirty seven Alfred wired me to send the girls to Moonshade near Dawson stop Department of Indian Affairs said this could be done in nineteen forty one stop Last year Alfred wrote me asking girls be sent to Mayo in March before navigation opened stop Department would not sanction cost plane trip from here to Mayo and advised that as Alfred appeared to be travelling around country to a considerable extent he should come to Carcross for children stop In May this year I informed Department Bonnetplume children still at school stop Reply stated that if father does not call for them within next six months Department was to be advised.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. H.C.M.Grant Principal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 940-10, part 4)\n3. There is no longer an Indian Mission at Dawson, and the Hostel at this point does not take in Indian children. In view of the fact that the two girls are safely at Carcross and that the Department of Indian Affairs has the matter of their transportation directly in hand, no further action is required.\n\n4. Three copies of this report is being forwarded direct to Aklavit by air-mail for information of Red River dett; and the Indian agent at Fort Norman.\n\nCASE CONCLUDED\nHANDED TO DEPT.

Sir: Forwarded 16-10-1941; this is further to my minute to you of 9-9-1941.\n\n2. It will be noted that copies of this report have been sent to our Aklatik Detachment for their information, and that of our Arctic Red River Detachment, as well as the Indian Agent at Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\n3. I wish to point out that it will be impossible for the father of these Indian girls, Alfred Bonnetplume of Fort McPherson, N.W.T., to proceed by either dog-team or canoe from Ft. McPherson to Carcross, Y.T., in order to take the girls back home to McPherson, and he cannot afford to pay for the transportation of the girls from Carcross to Fort McPherson by other means such airplane and River Steamer.\n\n4. I would request that this matter be referred to the Indian Affairs Branch. In the meantime, I am closing my file.\n\nCASE CONCLUDED\nHANDED TO DEPT. CONCERNED.\n\nE.J. Martin, Insp.,\nCommanding \"G\" Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking the September quarter return of the Carcross Residential School it is noted that Bertha Baum is shown to have entered the school on the 14th of September, 1941. The Principal requested 92 days' grant for her but should have only requested grant from the 14th of September to the 30th of September. This has been changed.\n\nThe correct aggregate number of days is 3336 instead of 3418 as shown by the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.A. Jeckell,\nIndian Agent,\nDawson, Y.T.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO. 41 D 1074-3-L-1.\n\nOTTAWA, October 20, 1941.\n\nReferred by direction of The Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nTO:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nBFH/FEG.\nBentha Baum\nEnld 14-9-41-\n92 days Requested changed\nto 16 days\nAggregate number of\ndays: Converted from\n3412 to 3336\nArea: 36.26\n\u00d7 2266.25\nNovember 17th 1941\n\nThe Rev. Alex S. Dewdney, B.A., L.Th.,\nPORT MACPHERSON, N.W.T.\n\nDear Alex:\n\nA few weeks ago Jessie Bonnetplume stated that instead of going home in the near future or as soon as the Department of Indian Affairs or her parents make it possible for her to do so she would like to continue on with her schooling.\n\nShe is at present in Grade VIII and would like to go through High School and eventually be trained as a nurse.\n\nBefore I can take this matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs I feel it would be advisable to secure Alfred's permission. Would you, therefore, take this matter up with the parents and let me know their decision as soon as possible.\n\nJessie is a very promising pupil and from an\nacademic point of view would I think have little or no difficulty in reaching the goal desired. As other Indian girls in other residential schools have achieved distinction in this respect the question of getting the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs would not I think present any difficulty at all.\n\nWith regard to Sarah Bonnetplume I may say that this child has little or no inclination at all to continue on with her studies. All she wants to do when her schooling is over is to return home. No doubt the pending return home of this child will make it somewhat easier for her parents to give their consent for Jessie to remain on here and enter a hospital at a later date.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe 166-1-10.\n\nOn June 10th 1941 you wrote me as follows re Register No. 0106 Jessie Bonnetplume:-\n\n\"Jessie Bonnetplume and her sister may remain in the school until the father calls for them. If, however, he does not call within the next six months you should advise us.\"\n\nAs six months has elapsed since you wrote this is to advise that the father has not yet called for these children.\n\nA few weeks ago Jessie Bonnetplume, who has reached the age of 16 years, made the request that she\nbe allowed to continue on with her schooling. She is at present in Grade VIII and would like to go through High School and eventually be trained for the nursing profession. Consequently I wrote, on November 17th 1941, to the Rev. Alex Dewdney of Fort Macpherson, N.W.T. regarding the matter. A copy of my letter is enclosed. I have not yet received a reply but hope to do so in the course of a few weeks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant\n\nEncl. H.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 31, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to Jessie Bonnetplume.\n\nThis girl and her sister may remain in the school for a further period and every endeavour should be made to reach the father and have him arrange to take them home.\n\nIf they are not out of the school by the end of June, 1942, you should advise this office. I note your suggestion that Jessie should receive assistance in order that she might train for the nursing profession. Funds at our disposal are so limited that we cannot consider this proposal and it should be definitely understood by all parties concerned that no such payment can be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

No. 126 Chris Henry, No. 0120 Jane Henry and No. 0121 Winnie Henry did not return to school after the last summer holidays. Their truancy was reported to Indian Agent G.A. Jeckell. On December 27th 1941 Mr. Jeckell wrote me as follows regarding this matter:-\n\n\"I am of the opinion that under the circumstances it would not be practicable nor advisable to strictly enforce the applicable sections of the Indian Act. This matter may come up again in September, 1942, at which time it can be further dealt with.\"\n\nIn view of this their names were omitted from our\nMarch quarterly return.\n\nFor your information I may say that a few weeks ago I received a letter from the father of these children in which he stated that he intends to place No. 126 - Chris Henry and No. 0121 - Winnie Henry back in school in September of this year. No. 0120 Jane Henry will not be sent back as she has by this time reached the age of 16 years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.C.M. Grant, Principal.\nOttawa,\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 5th and 6th instant, the Department approves the discharge from the Carcross School of the pupils numbered 111, 125, 130, 0120 and 0121.\n\nIf any of the above children are under 16 years of age and a request is received from the parents for their re-admission, you may then apply to the Department for permission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I am returning one copy of these application forms and keeping the other copy. On the copy which we are retaining you have written \"Particulars have been requested of R.C.M.P.\". I infer from this that you are not certain that these children are eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to an Indian residential school and consequently a decision regarding their admission will be deferred until we hear further from you.\n\nWe recently received the September quarter return of the Carcross School and it is noted that no applications or certificates of health have yet been received for pupils numbered 134, 135, 137 and 0131.\n\nIt is also noted that Albert Jackson, No. 136, died during the quarter.

Grant,\nPrincipal.\n\nChooutla Indian Residential School\n\nJanuary 31st, 1943.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nDAWSON, Yukon.\n\nSir:-\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of January 27th, 1943. The practice followed at this school in past years and one that met with the approval of the one who was Indian Agent at the time I was appointed Principal was to bring pupils into the school before their Applications for Admission were approved by the Department. The reason for this is that if a parent wished to place a child in school in the fall and the school management had to wait for official approval which sometimes takes several weeks, navigation by that time would be closed and the child in question would have to wait until the following year.\n\nLast fall, working under this plan I recruited pupils numbered 134, 135, 137 and 0131. On October 1st I mailed you their Applications for Admissions. On October 14th you returned them to me as a condemnation of the buildings by the doctor raised the question of the possibility of the school being closed. The solution as you know to this problem was settled by the Department agreeing to a reduction in pupilage. Amongst those discharged were numbers 134, 135, 137 and 0131. Consequently their Applications for Admission were not sent to you again. As we had these children in residence for a certain length of time it was felt that even though their admission was not officially approved we should receive for them the usual per capita grant for the time they were in residence.\n\nAlbert Jackson, No. 136, whose death was reported on the September quarterly return, was, at the time of his disease, in the same category as numbers 134, 135, 137 and 0131. As he was not officially a pupil of the school it was thought the the procedure followed in the preparation of a Memorandum (Form 414) would not be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"H.C.M. Grant,\" Principal.\nFebruary 15th, 1943.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 2nd, 1943 with regard to applications and certificates of health not being received for pupils numbered 134, 135, 137 and 0131. Enclosed herewith is copy of communication received from the Reverend H.C.M. Grant under date of January 31st, which is self-explanatory.\n\nJ.E.

In his letter it is noted that the Department is under the impression that the transportation, for which a charge of $160.00 has been made, was furnished by the 'School Truck'. Would you be so good as to inform Mr. Phelan that the school here does not own a truck or any other motor driven vehicle.\n\nOn more than one occasion during the past 14 years I have tried through our Head Office in Winnipeg and through your office to have the Department supply this school with a truck. No success has attended our efforts.\n\nAfter the fire in 1939 the school occupied various houses in the village of Carcross and the farm situated on the old school site about two miles from Carcross was kept in operation. Four times a day the school boys who assisted with the farm work had to be transported from Carcross Village to the farm and under such circumstances a truck was a necessity. Consequently out of personal funds I purchased a new Ford V8 One Ton Truck which cost me in the neighbourhood of $1500.00.\n\nDuring the past five years this truck has been used almost entirely for the benefit of the Indians and for most of this service no charge has been made. In the winter of 1942-43 it was necessary on several occasions to transport sick Indians from here to the Whitehorse Hospital and for each of these trips the Department paid me $20.00. To give you some idea of the extent of the service rendered to the Indian School here and to the Carcross Indians during this five year period I may say that my truck has covered over 35,000 miles. Almost every day now this vehicle is used in the school yard hauling wood to the various buildings and when not so engaged used to haul supplies, etc., from the Carcross Station to the school. For such services I am not receiving any remuneration.\n\nAs you know there have been times in the past when the railway has been out of commission on account of slides, etc., and there are days when no trains are scheduled to run. On such occasions if a child or a Carcross Indian is seriously ill the only other alternative to a car or truck to get such person to hospital is to charter a plane and the cost of such service is greatly in excess of $20.00. In view of this there have been occasions when my car and truck have saved the Department a considerable sum of money.\n\nIn view of the facts stated above it would be appreciated if you would ask the Department to reconsider the payment of the account for $160.00 and regard favourable other accounts which were mailed to you at a later date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. C. M. Grant (Sgd)\nVen. H.C.M. Grant\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6481, file 940-10, part 5)\nDawson, V. T.,\nNovember 28, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Your File 156-1-10\n\nFurther to your letter of November 1, copy of which was forwarded by me to Venerable Archdeacon H. C. M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School, I have now received from the latter an explanation of the accounts mentioned in your letter, as well as others which have recently been submitted by the writer. I enclose herewith copy of Venerable Archdeacon Grant's letter for your consideration.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJEG/ACB.\nEnc.-l.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nWe have received several accounts recently from Reverend H.C.M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross School, for transportation of pupils and transportation of equipment for the school by truck. We were under the impression that the truck was owned by the M.S.C.C. and, as it is customary for residential schools to truck supplies and transport children in their own vehicles without cost to the Department, payment of these accounts has been refused.\n\nInformation to the above effect was sent to Reverend Mr. Grant and in reply he states that the school does not own a truck but that the truck being used was purchased by him from his own funds and since the time of the purchase he has had it operated for the school.\n\nWe wish to be fair in our treatment of any school, but it is unusual for the Principal to personally own a truck and then set his own rate for its use. For instance, the accounts submitted indicate that he expects 20\u00a2 a mile for its use. I realize that operation is more expensive in the Yukon than in the more settled parts of Canada, but at the same time the rate requested by the Principal appears to us to be excessive. We would like to reach some basis equitable to all parties concerned and on the suggestion of Mr. Hoey I am submitting the matter to you and would appreciate having your views.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n164 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDawson, Y. T.\nDecember 6, 1944.\n\nChief, Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nRef.: 166-1-10\n\nI have your letter of November 20th, and note that the $80.00 account forwarded in my letter of November 9 is not being paid, and that I am to so advise the Principal of the Carcross Residential School. You no doubt have in your possession by now the further correspondence between Venerable Archdeacon H.C.M. Grant and the writer, stemming from your letter of November 1, which please note was immediately reported.\n\nI take it that if the account, payment of which was originally questioned, is favourably reconsidered, the $80.00 item which is the subject of this letter, may also be reconsidered, and that I will receive advice as to this in due course. In the meantime I am advising the Archdeacon of the contents of your letter of November 20.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 15 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Transportation at Carcross.\n\nI have to acknowledge your 166-1-10 of December 8, in regard to accounts for transportation by truck submitted by Principal Grant of the above school.\n\nWe have carefully noted what you say and have at once written to our Principal to ask further information about this matter. I may say that this is the first information we have received that a truck was being used at the school. We endeavoured for some time to secure such a vehicle, together with other items of equipment, from the American camp near Carcross. To the best of my knowledge this was not possible, and I know that there are no horses at the school, and it has undoubtedly been necessary to make some arrangement to bring supplies from the village some miles away. I shall write again as soon as we hear from Mr. Grant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHAA/MA Secretary.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSeptember 1st 1944\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the CARCROSS (Yukon) Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child \u2014\nEnglish name Elizabeth JOHNS\nAge 15 years\nName of Band CARCROSS\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid \u2014\nFather's full name and No Peter JOHNS\nMother's full name and No Agnes JOHNS\nParents living or dead Both parents living.\nState of child's health Apparently good.\nReligion Church of England\nDoes applicant speak English?

We are now in receipt of further information from the Principal of our Carcross school re. use of truck for transportation of supplies and pupils and beg to submit the following explanation.\n\nMr. Grant appears to have been under the impression that as his local Indian agent forwarded the accounts to your Department, he certified them and thereby gave his approval to the rates inserted. Conditions since the destruction of the school by fire, have been most difficult. The necessity for housing pupils and staff in more than one building, making adequate arrangements for feeding them and the unforeseen arrival of strange troops caused many complications which made the task of administration by the Principal an unenviable one.\n\nThe uncertainty as to whether the school should be rebuilt on the former site, transferred to Dawson or temporarily suspended were questions which required serious consideration. As you will remember there was at one time a suggestion that the school should be reopened at Dawson, and that another principal might be appointed to replace Mr. Grant who would assume more responsible Missionary duties under the Bishop. These suggestions were however eventually discarded and it was decided to rebuild the Chootla School on its former site with Mr. Grant remaining as principal. It was assumed by the Commission that all these questions would be considered by the Bishop in consultation with Mr. Grant and that he also would be advised to the necessity of using Mr. Grant's truck for transportation purpose along the new highway.\n\nIn view of all these involved and difficult circumstances the Commission would greatly appreciate your most generous consideration of all these points and submit their views for your decision.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nRMH.\nDawson, Y.

The latter is presently living at Macpherson, N.W.T. Mrs. Chitzi has three children: Lily, Margaret, and Eileen. I do not know the exact ages of these three children, but the youngest is under seven, and the other two are between seven and twelve years of age, I understand.\n\nBishop W. A. Geddes approached the writer this morning with the request that authorization be obtained for the admission of the two younger children to the Carcross Residential School. Apparently the mother is hard put to support these children and has indicated her desire to have them looked after in this way.\n\nReverend Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Ellis, Missionaries at Old Crow, are coming out this summer by the first boat, which, at the present time, is the only boat which is definitely scheduled to go to Fort Yukon. It was thought that they could bring the Chitzi children with them, and give them safe conduct right to Carcross. This would mean that the children would reach there about the first of July. The full term does not start until September, but there is no other boat connection unless the last White Pass trip in September goes through to Fort Yukon. If the children waited for this boat, they would have to come unattended, and would be at least a month late for the school opening.\n\nWill the Department authorize the admission of these two Chitzi children into the Carcross Residential School (assuming that applications in proper form will be submitted) and also authorize boat transportation for them in manner indicated from Fort Yukon, Alaska, to Whitehorse?\n\nJ.

A. Geddes under date of July 14, from Vancouver, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Today I received a radiogram from Corporal Kirk at Old Crow stating that John Moses an Indian at Old Crow, wished to send his two girls aged 10 and 8 to the Carcross School.\n\nWould you kindly ask the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa if they would approve the admission of these children to the Carcross School.\n\nThe Radiogram also asked what arrangements could be made about paying their transportation. It might be well to find out at the same time whether the Indian Affairs Branch will bear the cost of these transportation charges or any part of them.\n\n(over)\nIn order to save time if you should have a reply from Ottawa before I return to Dawson would you please communicate direct with Corporal Kirk.\"\n\nWill you please acquaint me with the Department's reaction to this request.

She could easily be sent, by the local bus, to the care of the Sisters at Fort Saint John Hospital, wherefrom the local Indian agent could arrange to have her accompanied either to Grouard or to Joussard Residential Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.L.Coudert O.M.I., Vicar apost.of Whitehorse\nOttawa, January 7, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that the orphan girl May, illegitimate daughter of deceased Mary Louis of the Lansing Creek Band, in Mayo, is at present in the local hospital at Whitehorse, Yukon, and that it is intended to later place her in the Carcross School.\n\nOur correspondent supplies the following information regarding this girl:\n\n\"Little orphan May is a Catholic Indian child, born of a Catholic Indian mother, and baptized by the Catholic Missionary in Mayo.\n\n\"After the death of her mother, shortly after her birth, she was adopted by the Catholic Indian Band of Lansing Creek, to which Mary Louis belonged; then she was partly supported by her presumed white father, Mike Tomoff, who later on was married before me to another Catholic Indian woman, Layza Lightning, who is herself a Catholic of the same Lansing Creek Band.\n\n\"After the death of Mike Tomoff, which occurred some time last Fall, I received a letter from Father J.

According to the testimonies of Mrs. Billy Johnson and Mr. Bill Hall all their children would have been baptized in the Catholic Church but I was unable to trace the records previous to my time.\n\nHoping that the above information will prove valuable to the Officials of the Branch and convince them of the urgency of our request for an Indian Boarding School in or near Teslin,\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.L. Coudert O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Whitehorse.\n\nP.S. Enclosed you will find the Baptism Certificates of Catherine Johnson, Teddy John Hall, Margaret Charley and Jacky Charley.\nOttawa, 14th January, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo enclosing Baptismal Certificates with reference to certain children who have been admitted to the Carcross Residential School.\n\nThis letter is being brought to the attention of the Director.\n\nWith particular reference to the Baptismal Certificates, which I am returning, I submit the following information:\n\nMargaret and Jacky Charley - In letter dated December 18th, 1945, which reached this Branch during the first week in January, the Acting Indian Agent submitted an application for each of these children for admission to the Carcross Residential School. The application forms stated their religion as Roman Catholic and the Indian Agent was advised in official letters of January 3rd and 8th that we were not prepared to approve the admission of these children to the Carcross School in view of Sub-section 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nCatherine Johnson - We do not appear to have any child in the Carcross School with this name. Possibly the pupil registered as Kathleen Johnson is the same person as the application form stated that Kathleen Johnson was Born March 17, 1937, which compares with the Baptismal Certificate which you forwarded. The application form for the admission of this girl to the Carcross School was submitted to the Department in a letter dated December 26th, 1944, and the form stated her religion was Church of England and consequently her admission to Carcross School was approved.\n\nTeddy John Hall - This boy's name was not shown on the September Quarter Return of the Carcross School. There is a boy named John Douglas Hall on the return but the application form for this particular boy states he was born on April 25, 1932 and his religion is Church of England. This is a different birth date than the one stated for Teddy John Hall and consequently I presume this is not the same boy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

The Baptism records of John Douglas and Isabella, however, being in the Register of Atlin, and having no missionary resident in Atlin at present, I was unable to secure the Certificates of Baptism for John Douglas and Isabella; Teddy John was baptised in the local hospital in Whitehorse and I had no difficulty in finding his record.\n\nThe case of those children being identical as that of Billy Johnson's children, I think that they should be allowed to stay in the Carcross School until the Branch provides a Catholic Boarding School for them in the North. The parents are justly reluctant to have their children sent out thousands of miles away for schooling; moreover, our Catholic Boarding Schools of Alberta and B.C. being actually filled up to their full quota, I do not feel inclined to ask either Bishop Langlois or Bishop Jordan to keep our children of the North free of charge in their already crowded school, unless the Branch makes a special provision for them.\n\nc.-Margaret and Jacky Charley.-The same applies to Margaret and Jacky Charley, unless the parents are willing to send their children to one of our Catholic Boarding Schools \"outside\", and the Branch arranges for their support.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nd.-Orphan May Tomoff's case.-In the case of orphan May Tomoff's case brought to your attention on January 23, conditions are very different, because the said child is altogether an orphan, and as such comes entirely under the responsibility of the Branch.- The Branch should see, therefore, in her case that subsection 2 of Section 10 of the Act be strictly observed, and that such a child be sent to a Catholic Institution; even if our Catholic Boarding Schools of Alberta and B.C. have already their full quota of boarders, it is the duty of the Branch to provide for the support of such a child and see that the necessary grant be given to the School willing to accept her.\n\nI suggested Grouard School and already wrote to the Principal to announce the coming of May Tomoff, since some 18 children of the Vicariate of Whitehorse are already staying there, and means of communication between the Yukon and the Grouard School are very easy over the Alaska Highway.\n\nHoping that those lengthy explanations will clarify all the cases brought recently to your attention, I count on the spirit of fairness of the Officials of the Branch to see that a Catholic Boarding School be granted without any further delay to the Catholic Indians of our Vicariate in the vicinity of Teslin.\n\nYours sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.L.

A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. In other words, the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child should be brought up, and his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\n\"In accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a Protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a justice of the peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavits must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department.\"\n\nIn view of the above ruling it would seem that if Dick Bean Charlie, an ex-pupil of this school and the father of Margaret CHARLIE, is willing to take the necessary affidavit it would be in order for his children to be admitted to this school. Please advise on this point.\nIt is noted in your letter that no mention is made of this girl's brother, Jackie Charlie, who is also in residence here. I presume that whatever course of action is followed with regard to Margaret would apply equally to her brother.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. C. M. Grant (Sgd.)\n\nH. C.M. Grant,\nPrincipal.\nDawson, Y.

When the child Phares was brought for Baptism, the Mounted Police and the officiating clergyman were under the impression that the child was to be called \"Paris\" and endeavoured to dissuade the parents in the matter of their choice of names. The father, however, was quite definite in the matter, and produced his well-thumbed copy of Scriptural translation to indicate that the name Phares had been taken therefrom. I regret that I am not able to quote chapter and verse.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would let me have a decision in this matter as soon as possible, as there are only two more boat connections with Old Crow, and arrangements will have to be made without delay.\n\nJ.

This office has had no official advice about these admissions, and no admission forms have been submitted.\n\nWill the Department please advise if they have knowledge of these admissions, and if the Agent's certificate is required on the forms?\n\nIt is believed that the children admitted to the school are:\n\nEmma, age 9\nSamuel, age 11\nElmer Silas, age 13\nWilfred, age 15\n\nR.H.S.

Meek, Indian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Yukon.\n\nWe have not yet received the September quarter return of the Carcross Indian Residential School and I would appreciate it if you would request the Principal to prepare and forward this to us immediately.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health for all new pupils should be also forwarded. Please advise the Principal that the quarterly return should be prepared promptly at the end of each quarter and forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the June quarter return of the Carcross school is dated July 1, 1946. Presumably this entry was made at the school. However, the return apparently did not leave Dawson until Sept. 25. It would appear that there was some unusual delay.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Quarterly Return for Indian Residential School at Carcross Y.T., for period ending September 30th, 1946.\n\nAlso Form I.A. 411, Admission and Discharge of Pupils during the Quarter.\n\nI am advised by Rev.

Meek, Acting Indian Agent, Whitehorse,Y.T.\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return of the Carcross Indian Residential School, the Department requests application forms for the following pupils:\n\nJeremy Peter Joseph, Abraham Peter Joseph, Jerome Thomas, Phares Thomas, Isaac Thomas, Archie Tizya, Jackie Kodwat, Helen Tizya, Lena Tizya, Mary Roberts, Doreen Mason.\n\nDavid Johnston, Elmer Johnston, Samuel Johnston, Pete Sidney, Randall Bill, Josephine Netro, Caroline Moses, Mildred Tizya, Ethel Tizya, Doris Roberts, Emma Johnston.\n\nThe discharge of the following is also approved:\n\nNo. 143 No. 154\n148 0136\n\nWe regret to learn the death of pupil No. 0167 Caroline Moses.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe your letter of Dec. 12th, 1946, file 166-1-10 (WT 1),\nand the September quarterly return for Carcross Indian\nResidential School. This return was forwarded by me on\nDecember 2nd, to you and should be in your hands by this\ntime. I might point out that during the winter, land\nmail is very slow, there being only one boat out to Vancouver\nevery ten days at the best. The delay of Archdeacon\nH.G.M. Grant in submitting the quarterly return is no doubt\ndue to the fact he went outside for a serious medical operation\nand was away almost two months.\n\nI am communicating with the Principal regarding Application\nForms and Certificates of Health for new pupils. Re your\nlast paragraph, I flew down to Dawson on the third week of\nSeptember, 1946, and found considerable correspondence awaiting\nme, and any delay at that time was caused by the change of\npersonnel in this Agency, and by the removal of all files and\ncorrespondence from Dawson to Whitehorse.\n\n(R.J.

Meek, Indian Agent,\nWHITEHOUSE, Yukon.\n\nThe Family Allowance Division has directed our attention to the following two pupils at the Carcross School:\n\nNo. 168, Jimmy Duggan\nNo. 0165, Evelyn McGunday\n\nWe are advised that these children are recognized as white and not as Indians. On reviewing our file, we can find no application forms or certificates of health which have been submitted for them.\n\nPlease make immediate inquiries and if they have white status, they are not eligible for the Carcross school. We would like to hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\nJanuary 17th, 1947.\n\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of 15th instant re opening of Day School at Whitehorse, and particularly with regard to second paragraph dealing with children taken away from Carcross Residential School.\n\nI have interviewed Archdeacon H.C.M. Grant, Principal of the Carcross Residential School who informs me that the following children have been taken away by their parents: Lena Sam, Russell Sam, and Agnes Jackson. Rev. Grant stated that he was in full accord with their leaving, as for many years it has been a source of trouble when parents called for their children from Whitehorse, and did not return them after the holidays.\n\nThe following children have also been taken away from Carcross: Grace, Douglas and Harry Smarch of Teslin. Vera Takamatsu of Little Atlin. Grace Smarch was sick at the time, and there is reasonable excuse for her being in the care of her parents. As to the other, Rev. Grant states they are now out of school without permission. I am communicating with the Family Allowances to recommend that allowances remain suspended.\n\nIn the meantime I am endeavoring to get several children from the more inaccessible areas to take the places of those who have left. Does permission from your Department have to be applied for before any children are sent to Carcross Residential School?\n\nR.J. Meek\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 4th, 1947.\n\nR.J. Meek, Indian Agent, Whitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th inst., with reference to several children who have left the Carcross Residential School.\n\nThe discharge of Lena Sam, Russell Sam and Agnes Jackson is approved.\n\nAs the principal of the Carcross School, Mr. Grant, states that Grace, Douglas and Harry Smarch and Vera Takamatsu were not given permission to remain away from school, every effort should be made to have them returned to the Carcross School at an early date.\n\nIt is usual to have the Department's approval before children are admitted to Indian Residential Schools. However, in isolated places we realize that this is sometimes difficult and you may find it necessary to place children in Carcross School before receiving formal permission from the Department. In all such cases you should make certain that they are eligible for admission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto please find Indian Residential School Quarterly Return for the Carcross Residential School, Carcross, Y.T., for quarter ending December 31st, 1946.\n\nAlso copy of Form 411, Admission and Discharge of Pupils at the Carcross Indian Residential School for the same quarter.\n\nI have taken up the matter of outstanding Applications for Admission and Certificates of Health of the new pupils with Rev.

L) re several children leaving Carcross Residential School without permission.\n\nOn Saturday, March 8th, I visited the home of Vera Takamatsu, in company with R.C.M.P. patrol, to Little Atlin, some 25 miles from Carcross, and about 40 miles from Whitehorse. Vera Takamatsu is living with her mother, an Indian, who was formerly married to a Japanese. Mr. Takamatsu is now dead, and the widow is living with a white man named Matthews.\n\nMr. Matthews is looking after all the children of Mrs. Takamatsu, and wishes to have the children regarded as white. He does not wish the girl Vera to return to Carcross Residential School, but wishes to move the family to Whitehorse and enter her in the Whitehorse Public School. None of the children of Mrs. Takamatsu are registered at this office as receiving Family Allowances, and I infer that they are regarded as of white status.\n\nArchdeacon H.C.M. Grant writes in part as follows: \"With regard to Vera Takamatsu and the Smarch children I am not at all anxious to have them back. The non-return of Vera Takamatsu will not deprive her of a schooling for I understand that her mother Mrs. Jessie Takamatsu, and the man who is living with (Mr. Matthews) are now residing in Whitehorse. No doubt a place for this girl could be had in the Rev. H.I.

S.

A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. In other words, the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child should be brought up, and his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\n\"In accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a Justice of the Peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavits must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department.\"\n\nIn view of the above I could, if the Department so desires, write to the mother (Mrs. Pat Henry, who is now living in the U.S.A.),\nand get her to mail me the affidavit referred to above.\n\nIn dealing with this case I feel it is worth noting that Mrs. Pat Henry is a Protestant or was when she was a pupil of this school. She was then known as Doolah McGundy. As Evelyn is illegitimate, I presume that the religious faith of the father would not determine the religious faith of the child.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) H.C.M. Grant.\nArchdeacon. Principal Carcross School.\nand get her to mail me the affidavit referred to above.\n\nIn dealing with this case I feel it is worth noting that Mrs. Pat Henry is a Protestant or was when she was a pupil of this school. She was then known as Doolah McGundy. As Evelyn is illegitimate, I presume that the religious faith of the father would not determine the religious faith of the child.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) H.C.M. Grant.\nArchdeacon. Principal Carcross School.\nCarcross Indian Residential School,\nCARCROSS, Yukon,\nMarch 26th, 1947.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nWHITEHORSE, Y.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is a reply to your letter of the 19th instant regarding Jimmy Drugan and Evelyn McGundy.\n\nWith regard to the eligibility of Evelyn McGundy's admission to this school I think it could be covered by the following ruling, such ruling being embodied in a letter the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs wrote to the General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada on October 16th, 1922:\n\n\"The opinion of the Department of Justice is that a Protestant child is one born of Protestant parents, or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Protestant school, or a school conducted under Protestant auspices. A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school, or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. In other words, the father has a right to direct and regulate the religious faith in which his child should be brought up, and his wishes must be regarded unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them.\n\n\"In accordance with this view, if a Protestant parent wishes his child placed in a Roman Catholic school and brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, or a Roman Catholic parent his child in a protestant school and brought up in the Protestant religion, he may do so, but for the protection of the Department, we demand in such cases an affidavit to that effect by the father. Such affidavit must be made before a Justice of the Peace, Indian Agent, or other person authorized to take affidavits, and the person who takes such affidavits must certify that the statements set forth in the affidavit were read over or interpreted and explained to the deponent who thoroughly understood the same. In cases of bona fide adoption, the religion and wishes of the foster father will be recognized by the Department.\"\n\nIn view of the above I could, if the Department so desires, write to the mother (Mrs. Pat Henry, who is now living in the U.S.A.),\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYour letter of February 26th, file 166-1-10 (WT 1) re Evelyn McGunday, pupil at Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter I communicated your wishes to Archdeacon H.C.M. Grant, and in reply he quoted a ruling of the Indian Affairs Branch of October 16th 1922. I attach hereto two copies of his letter for your information.\n\nAs Evelyn has no place to go if discharged from the Carcross School, and I do not know of any relatives, it is considered advisable she remain there until her case is settled.\n\n(R.J.

H.C.M. Grant, Principal, Carcross Residential School, Carcross, Yukon.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following pupils from the Carcross Indian Residential School:\n\nNo. 0147 No. 151\n0149 177\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEarly in July I received a letter from L.H. Phinney, Stipendiary Magistrate, Dawson, Y.T., concerning Albert James Joe, a pupil of Carcross Residential School. It appears that the father of the boy, Tanana Joe, of Dawson, an elderly man of about 73 or 74 years, makes his living by cutting logs and rafting them downstream to Dawson. With advancing years he is not now capable of handling a raft of logs, and requested Mr. Phinney to make representations to have Albert returned to Dawson.\n\nNot knowing the custom in this Agency, I communicated with Archdeacon H.C.M. Grant, Principal of Carcross Residential School. He replied that it has been the custom in the past for children from the northern Yukon to remain at the school all summer. I thereupon replied to Mr. Phinney that it could be assumed that Albert would not be returning to Dawson for the summer.\n\nAlbert Joe is 14\u00bd years, there is no doubt he would be a great assistance to his aging father. In a conversation with Mr. Phinney today he states that there is now a school at Moosehide to which Albert may attend. It may also be a case, if Tanana Joe receives no assistance in his work, for him and his wife to seek indigent rations. Mr. Phinney who is conversant with the case, recommends that consideration be given to having Albert returned to his parents.\n\nMay this application for discharge of Albert Joe receive your earliest attention. In view of the above information I would recommend that discharge be granted.\n\nR.J. Meek\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nCopy sent to Principal of Carcross.\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1947.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent, Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 18th, in view of your recommendation, the Department approves the discharge of Albert James Joe from the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is hoped that Albert may continue his studies at Moosehide as mentioned in your letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nKB/HH.\nOn August 17th it was reported to me by Mr. Grant, Carcross Residential School, that two Indian pupils, Billy Peter Johnnie, age 15, and Peter Isaac, age 12, had left the school the previous day and had not returned. It was thought that they had run away and were endeavoring to return to their parents. Billy Johnnie's home being at Dawson, and Peter Isaac's quite a number of miles up the Felly River.\n\nI immediately informed the police and several other people who might see these boys. On August 20th it was reported that these two boys were down the Yukon River at the south end of Lake LaBerge, endeavoring to float downstream on a raft. The Lake and river are much too dangerous for youngsters.\n\nRev. J. Ellice was in Whitehorse at the time, he is the recently appointed Principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School. I conferred with him and it was decided to let Billy Johnnie return to Dawson, he being a big boy and becoming a bit troublesome at the school; I understand he ran away once before. We further decided that Peter Isaac should be returned to the school. I contacted a Mr. G.W. Grady who was going downstream by outboard motor and gave him letters of authority to the purser on the boats to take these boys to their respective destinations. I also arranged for transportation at the head office of the B.Y.N. Co., Whitehorse.\n\nOn August 25th Peter Isaac returned to Whitehorse, I took him to the train for Carcross the following day, and he was returned to the school. Billy Peter Johnnie returned to Dawson where he will be able to attend the Moosehide Day School.\n\n(R.J.

He wished to place her in Carcross School, a residential school under the auspices of the Church of England. In fact he had already taken her to the school and at the present date she is still there.\n\nFrom the information given me by Johnston, there seemed no reason to doubt the acceptance of Cecilia Johnston. Several days later, Rev. J. Ellis, Principal of Carcross School, brought in a form application for Admission, for Cecilia, denoting Freddie Johnston the father, and Lena Johnston (deceased) the mother. Cecilia's religion was given as Roman Catholic. Rev. Ellis had questioned the father on this point who claimed he was formerly a member of the R.C. church but now wished to return to his original belief, as a member of the C. of E.\n\nOn the advice of Archdeacon H.C.M. Grant, former Principal of the School, who was familiar with the case, Cecilia's religion was noted as Roman Catholic. I took up the matter with Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., Whitehorse, who stated that Freddie Johnston's status within the Roman Catholic church was \"a Roman Catholic in bad standing\". He stated he would object on principle to Cecilia's admittance to Carcross School.\n\nAt the present time it appears Johnston is a member of the Church of England, he has one child, Isaac, at Grouard Residential School. He stated to me he would not send Cecilia to an R.C. School, as he is not a member of the Church.\n\nIn the meantime Cecilia attends school. Rev. Ellis wishes to know if he is in order in maintaining the child there.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nMr. R. J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y. T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to Cecilia Johnston.\n\nYou should point out to the Principal of the Carcross School that children whose religious status is doubtful must not be admitted to the school until all facts are placed before the Department and our decision has been given.\n\nIf Freddie Johnston wishes his girl enrolled at the Carcross School, it will be necessary for him to forward a statutory declaration indicating that he is not now recognized as a Roman Catholic.\n\nBernard F.

It is also noted that numerous pupils have been omitted from the September Return who were in residence according to the June Return and should automatically be entitled to sixty-two days.\n\nPupils who enter hospital are entitled up to thirty days grant according to our circular letter 150-89, a copy of which is attached hereto.\n\nOne final point is that a pupil should retain the same school number as is originally allotted him.

Please note that Elizabeth Kodwat 0148, Jackie Kodwat 176, Arthur Kodwat 153, and Fred Kodwat 164, have not returned to Carcross School for the Quarter.\n\nThe Kodwat family (including the Charlies who are related) are the problem family of Whitehorse. During the latter part of August a drunken fight at the Kodwat home put the mother in hospital and Dick Bean Charlie, her brother-in-law in jail. As there was no one to look after these children Rev. H.I. Lee placed them in a dormitory he had prepared for a residential school in Whitehorse. They have been continuously maintained by Rev. Lee. Another sister, Annie Kodwat, who has been maintained by a half-breed family named D. Hume, of Champagne, requested that Annie be placed at Rev. Lee's school along with her other brothers and sisters.\n\nThe matter has been taken up with Rev. Ellis and Rev. Lee, they are both anxious to do whatever would be in the best interests of the children. In a recent inspection of Carcross School I received the impression that the accommodation is now at capacity. I would suggest the best solution would be the official discharge of the Kodwat children from Carcross School, and their maintenance at the Whitehorse Day School.\n\n(R.J.

Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to the Kodwat children.\n\nWe presume from your letter that these children were allowed out on holidays and did not return on the expiration of their leave. We feel that in order to maintain proper discipline the children should be returned to the Carcross School at the earliest possible date provided the Principal is willing to accept them.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve placing them in the school conducted by Rev. Mr. Lee.

J.W. Ellis, principal of the Carcross School who has replied as follows:\n\nRe Four Kodwat children. I am sorry that it is impossible for me to take these children. At the present time we have 49 children in residence and we are very crowded.\n\nLack of accommodation at Carcross School was heightened somewhat by the return of several children to school from the Whitehorse General Hospital where they had been patients for quite a few months. At the present time the Kodwat children are being maintained by Rev. H.I. Lee at Whitehorse.\n\n(R.J. Meek)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nFollowing our last letter of Nov. 25, 1947 regarding the irregular diversion of Blackfoot children from our Catholic School to the R.C. School, have you yet received any report which contradicts the statement I gave in my letter of Oct. 1. The matter is important and in justice to all parties concerned should not be dropped until equitably settled.\n\nYours sincerely,\nWalks Yakon\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto please find Stencil No. 41, for the Carcross Indian Residential School, Yukon Agency, showing discharges for the children of Agnes Johns LOJ-1470. Peter Johns, father of these children was granted his enfranchisement certificate some two or three months ago. The children are now attending the white school in Carcross village.\n\nI would recommend that Agnes Johns LOJ-1470 be paid under Category A in the future. Their postal address is Carcross, Y.T.\n\n(R.J.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nCarcross Residential School\n\nI am informed by Rev. J.W. Ellis, principal of the Carcross Indian Residential School that Jeremy Peter of Old Crow, Y.T. will reach the age of 16 this year. He will not be greatly benefited by further education. Old Crow is a particularly remote village and is reached by river steamer sailing down to Fort Yukon, Alaska, thence up the Porcupine River by small boat to Old Crow. Transportation conditions vary considerably, and Jeremy Peter should be allowed to leave the Carcross School at any time after June 1st when conditions warrant. I presume the fare is paid through this agency.\n\nMary Roberts of Moosehide near Dawson, reaches the age of 16 in November of this year. She would not benefit by further education. Will it be in order to return her to Moosehide after school closes for the summer.\n\n[Signature]\nR.J. Meek\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, March 25, 1948.\n\nMr. R.J. Meek, Indian Agent,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, the Department approves the discharge of Jeremy Peter and Mary Roberts from the Carcross Residential School at the end of the current academic year. It is further noted that Jeremy Peter may leave about June 1st, depending on travel conditions.\n\nIf the parents are not in a position to provide for their transportation, you may do so.

It seems as if a considerable amount of extra work is caused the school when preparing the Return by including the names of these inactive pupils. It is, therefore, suggested that you confirm the intentions of the parents regarding their children's future attendance and if no satisfactory answer is obtained, the undermentioned pupils should be officially discharged and their names removed from the School Returns:\n\nNo. 145 Robert Jbe,\n153 Arthur Kodwat,\n156 Sam Lawrence\n158 Douglas Smarch,\n159 Harry Smarch,\n164 Fred Kodwat,\n176 Jackie Kodwat,\n177 David Johnson,\n0135 Daisy Hall\n0140 Francis Joe,\n0141 Kathleen Joe,\n0144 Rosalie Allen,\n0148 Elizabeth Kodwat,\n0156 Grace Smarch.\n\nHospitalized:\n167 Stanley Johnson,\n0160 Clara Moses.\nIt is also pointed out that the Admission and Discharge Form No. 411 was omitted when submitting the March Return.

Canon Cook and the Reverend Principal of Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom a conversation with Inspector Spartan, RCMP, yesterday I learned that the police would welcome our taking corrective action with these children. Their father is said to be unable to supervise them, and it is accomplishing nothing to prosecute him further.\n\nThe denominational factor requires that the children be assigned to a school conducted under Protestant auspices. As accommodation is not available at the Rev. Mr. Lee's hostel, the nearest available school is Carcross.\n\nMr. Shatoom has, however, a legal right to challenge this assignment, but he must do so immediately upon your informing him of the decision to assign these children to Carcross. You should tell him that he has that right and inquire whether he wishes to exercise it now by making an affidavit stating that it is his wish that the school to which the children are to be assigned shall be one conducted under the auspices of a denomination other than the one to which he himself adheres. If he wants a Roman Catholic environment for his children, enquiries should have been made to discover where accommodation is available now\u2014not in September.\n\nIf Mr. Shatoom is agreeable to the normal and expected procedure, please have admission forms completed, signed by him with an independent witness, and forwarded to Ottawa. As I anticipate approval of this action, please arrange for Rev. Mr. Ellis to take the children into residence forthwith.

There are also a number of pupils at Telegraph Creek with Anglican affiliation but these are now enrolled in the Provincial School at that point so that accommodation is not at the present time required for them. There may, of course, at a later date, be one or two of these because of home circumstances who will have to be taken out of the day school and placed in the Residential school. These could very well attend your school in the Yukon.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW. S.

Indian Agency,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.,\n\nOn October 21st we wrote you to the effect that applications for the admission of pupils to the Carcross Indian Residential School had not been received for some pupils while they were admitted to the school for institutional care.\n\nAs these returns are reviewed by Treasury and the Auditor we must have full information regarding each pupil, therefore, we require the application forms before the Quarterly Return reaches us.\n\nWe have made some exceptions in the past but the general procedure as mentioned above must be followed in the future. We will be obliged to withhold payment of per capita allowance until the application forms are received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nNovember 23, 1950\n\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nCarcross Residential School\n\nPayment of Grants for September, 1950, Quarter\n\nReference is to correspondence item No. 15181 being a circular addressed to Principals of Residential Schools under the direction of the Anglican Indian School Administration.\n\nThere is a minute from Canon Cook to Colonel Neary that indicates that the monetary matters referred to in the circular were a subject of previous discussion and agreement.\n\nThe Quarterly Return from Carcross School, however, is probably being audited at a reduced amount that falls considerably short of the amount which the Principal is entitled to claim and has claimed, although he may have to some extent changed the manner of making the claim.\n\nMay I suggest that this Division anticipate the receipt of any reproach. Carcross is a small-pupilage school which has fixed administrative expenses and probably operates at a deficit. I recommend that an assurance go forward that the amount to be paid for the September Quarter will more nearly approximate the amount that has been claimed.\n\nC.A.F.
