These are in connection with the school for building a new chimney, and you will notice at the bottom of Mr. Bell's account $4.00; this is for making a sand table. I had the chimney built when Mr. Johnston was up there doing some mason work on the agency house. It will be remembered that when I wrote the Dept about this work Johnston told me it would not cost more than $200 but when he finished the work it cost $400 more, but of course it would not stop before it was finished and I trust the Dept will honor the accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E.

It is noted that the difference between A. and C. and between B. and D. are very small, consisting practically in the difference of cost in the intake.\n\nIt is also noted that you make a wide difference between the excavation required for a three inch pipe and that required for a one inch pipe. The excavation required in either case is the same. The only difference in cost between the systems is the difference between the cost of the two different pipes.\n\nA three inch pipe is larger than necessary and a one inch pipe is too small to be used as a main under almost any circumstances;\n\nYour plans and specifications have been returned to you by registered mail. Please amend them in the following particulars:\n\n1. The main pipe to be two (2) inch galvanized iron. To be not less than four (4) feet below the surface of the ground.\n2. Service pipe to be 5/8 inch instead of half inch and lead pipe instead of galvanized iron.\n3. Plan No. 2 for the intake to be adopted.\n\nA. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6122, File 383-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to report to the Department I am in receipt of a school requisition from Miss Burke, of the No. 1, Cape Croker School, which includes supplies for school lunches, etc., and I hereto enclose this for the Department.\n\nIn connection with the school lunches, Miss Burke has asked me to request the Department, if it would be possible to periodically have a loaf of bread and a pound of butter supplied, to supplement the present school lunch supplies. She states this would be for benefit of pupils who come quite a distance to school, and who at times bring no noon meal, depending on the school lunch.\n\nIn my own estimation, this procedure seems hardly practical, as it is to be feared that soon none of the pupils would bring any noon meal with them, and the school pupils would then entirely be depending on the school lunch supplies.\n\nI am,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind.

I have discussed the matter with Mr. Poste but perhaps it would be well if you would advise that the basement of the school be thoroughly inspected and repaired by a competent person. Last year the work done by the Indians was a failure.\n\nWill you please let me know if any complaint reached Ottawa re religious holidays. I suspect Mrs. Bell from Port Olyn School complained to Inspector Gane. Mr. Poste told me he had heard no murmuring whatever either in the council or out.\n\nSincerely yours,\nSadie Burke.\nOttawa, July 10, 1935.\n\nDear Miss Burke:\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Phelan, who has been in British Columbia during the past six weeks, I wish to reply to your letter to him.\n\nMr. Agent Peste is being written to make inquiry into the faulty drainage in the basement of the Cape Croker Indian Day School. He is being asked to submit a recommendation as to what should be done, how the labour should be carried out and the cost. When his report is received, favourable consideration will be given to authorizing the work.\n\nNo complaints have reached the Department regarding religious holidays.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss S. J. Burke,\nGirls' Indian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nOttawa, July 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Sadie Burke, teacher of the Cape Croker Indian Day School, in which she states that, owing to faulty drainage and a breakage in the cistern, the cellar is constantly flooded. She states she has discussed the matter with you and that the work done by an Indian last year was a failure.\n\nI would request that you examine the drainage at this school and furnish the Department with a report, stating the work you would recommend in order to overcome the present condition. Please give an estimate of the cost of the work which you believe should be done, and you should state if you would consider that Indian labour would be satisfactory.\n\nYour early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. C. Peste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nR. R. No. 5,\nWiarton, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter No. 8-1-5, dated July 10th, inst., regarding the condition of the cellar of the residence of the Cape Croker Indian Day School.\n\nIt appears that Miss Burke is under the impression that repairs to the cistern were done last year, which was not so. Miss Burke asked last year to have the cistern thoroughly cleaned, when work was done. In my opinion, the present condition is caused from the overflow of the cistern, after a rain, causing the cellar floor to be frequently damp. This condition can be helped again by having the cistern drained and cleaned, and patching it inside, also repairing the overflow pipe. It is impossible to entirely prevent damp on the cellar floor as, after heavy rains, the water seeps through under the foundation. The same conditions exactly exist here in the cellar of the Agency residence.\n\nTo entirely prevent this condition at the School, would incur a very heavy expense, as a drain would have to be dug outside the foundation of the school, as outlet for the surplus water.\n\nTo repair the cistern, and the overflow pipe, would cost around the sum of $10.00., and in my opinion, Indian labour would be quite suitable for this work.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Ind. Affs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the faulty drainage and the overflowing of the cistern in the cellar of the Cape Croker Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $10.00, in having the cistern drained, cleaned and patched inside and also having the overflow pipe repaired. It is noted that Indian labour will be suitable for this work.\n\nYou should see that the work is completed before the school re-opens. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. C. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nR. R. No. 5,\nWiarton, Ont.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nWill you please see that the school supplies requisitioned in June are forwarded as soon as possible? We are handicapped in our work for want of material.\n\nI have had the walls of the upstairs cleaned. If the Department would give a grant of eight dollars I could have the woodwork painted and the ceilings murocoed.\n\nWhen I returned to the reserve I found that the cattle had harvested and carried nearly all my garden products. Last night they came and finished what was left, scaring me the while with their cow-bells.\n\nWould the Department consider giving a garden fence or having the old one thoroughly repaired?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSadie Jo Burke.\nOttawa, September 11th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Cape Croker Indian Day School, please authorize the teacher to purchase paint and murocco to the value of $8.00, in order that she may have the walls of the upstairs cleaned.\n\nPlease advise the Department, at once, the approximate cost of repairing the fence around the Cape Croker School. The Department has been informed that the fence is badly broken at the present time and that, as a result, the teacher's garden has been destroyed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

School, but added that Ottawa might not agree to such a sum. As I have forty-six children attending at present and will probably have fifty or more in December, would it be possible to let the grant go through.\n\nI neglected to mention in my requisition that the silk cloth was for the floor. There is a rug in Eaton's for $2.25 that will fit the room. Would it be in order to have Mr. Poole order this one? Might I ask that the bedding be requisitioned be purchased ready-made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6122, File 383-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1935.\n\nDear Miss Burke,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, I would point out that the grant for prizes at Christmas is paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education and, consequently, the Indians have no authority to decide what amount can be allowed. Mr. Poste is being written today and informed that $10.00 will be allowed for this purpose at the Cape Croker Indian Day School. This is the same amount as was provided last year and is all that the Department can allow.\n\nWe have just received the enclosed requisition from you. A number of the items have been ordered from the Government Stationery Office and should reach you in the near future. With reference to your other requests, I would point out that our appropriation is limited and that the demands are many. We have received strict instructions to keep expenditures to the lowest possible point between now and the close of the fiscal year on March 31st, next. I would, therefore, appreciate your again reviewing this requisition with a view to deleting the articles which are not absolutely necessary. While the Department wishes you to be comfortable, I think you will realize that, in view of the many demands that we receive, it is not possible to grant all requests, especially in view of the fact that strict orders have been received to keep down expenditures.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

A. #59111 in regard to Mr. A. C. Poste, Indian Agent, R. R. #5, Wiarton, Ont. for the period October 1st to December 31st, 1935.\n\nAppreciating your patronage, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAM\nSpanish, Ont.\nAugust 15, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have been rather worried over the Cape Croker school. Anyone who has a skeleton key can enter. I ordered a Yale lock but it had not come when I left July 3. Will you please authorize Mr. Poste to purchase one and see that it is put on the front door. I also ordered a padlock for the large gate. If it is not padlocked the gate will be left constantly open and the splendid new fence will be of no avail.\n\nThe school pumps are both out of order half the time. I would suggest that the man who sunk the pump would come and repair it. He lives near the reserve and examined it just before I left.\n\nThe toilets have not been repaired. The doors do not stay closed, the boxes are gone to pieces and the pits are not deep enough to accommodate the number now attending. I think Mr. Game reported this before. Nothing has been done about it.\n\nSince the new fence was built one of the gates was dispensed with. As a result the people climb over the fence and break the wire. I suggested to Mr. Poste that one or more styles be built but he seemed to think it would be too expensive. Will the Department consider having this done? I think one of the Indians could do the work. Otherwise the fence will be torn in no time.\n\nI have been taking rather a heavy course since July 6th in Toronto. There seems to be a general tendency to get away as far as possible from anything that was formerly considered O.K. in the teaching system.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Burke, teacher of the Cape Croker Indian Day School, with reference to certain repairs that are required at the school.\n\nPlease purchase a new Yale lock and have it put on the front door. A padlock is also required for the large gate.\n\nMiss Burke states that the school pumps are out of order. The cost of repairing these will, no doubt, be reasonable, and you should arrange to have this work done before the school reopens.\n\nIf the toilets have not been repaired, you should also arrange for this at once.\n\nMiss Burke also states that since the new fence was built one of the gates was dispensed with and, as a result, people climb over the fence and break the wire. Would it not be possible to have one or two stiles built at a reasonable cost?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Poste, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nR. R.

This matter has been brought to the Department's attention on several occasions in the past and I hope that you will make a determined effort to avoid any repetition. The manner suggested of disposing of these bats is the only reasonable one which you can follow in view of the fact that poisoning them would involve considerable danger to the person spreading the poison.\n\nYou may arrange for kalsomining the teacher's living quarters also for painting the kitchen.

I understood that either the salary of the janitor would be increased or a small grant would be made for special work done in connection with the school grounds.\n\nThe special tasks mentioned were: Hauling across the yard and piling in the basement twenty-five cords of furnace wood and twenty cords of kitchen wood; moving, raking and setting the school grounds; Ploughing, harrowing and discarding the school garden.\n\nThe janitor gave his work up.\nthe sweeping, scrubbing, furnace work etc in connection with the janitor work of the school.\n\nThe agent is here at present. We discussed having the children do some of the work to lessen expenses but we both anticipate trouble from the parents if the children are asked to do much.\n\nMr. Suffnell agrees with me that a grant covering the extra expenses would be necessary in this particular case.\n\nTrusting I have not encroached too far on your valuable time\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSuffnell\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSolic J. Burke\nSir;-\n\nI beg to report to you motion #8 passed by the Cape Croker council at their regular meeting held here October 11th, Chief and all councillors present.\n\nMoved by P.C. Nadjiwon A. Jones that we authorize our agent to write to the Department in detail as to the condition that No. 1 school is overcrowded with pupils and that our council feels that an extension class room is required or another building for such purpose, also to inform the education department to send a man and look over the situation and have another teacher appointed in order to teach the kindergarten class.\n\nCd.\n\nNote\u2014; I beg to report to the Department that the above motion was passed at the council meeting in regards to No. 1 school being overcrowded. At the present time the teacher has on the roll 48 pupils she seems to find it hard to do justice to the beginners with so many classes to teach. In order to have another teacher there would have to be another class room added.\n\nI would be glad to be advised by the Department in regards to the above motion.\n\nThe Secretary,\nInd Affs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of letter dated the 10th instant from Miss S. J. Burke, teacher of the Cape Croker No. 1 Indian Day School, in which she states that she has expended $10.25 for moving the wood; $8 for ploughing the garden; $8 for mowing the grounds around the school and $1.00 for cleaning chimneys and furnace pipes. No doubt, she has receipts for these expenditures, and you may prepare a voucher and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nIncidentally, you might let me know why it was necessary for Miss Burke to expend an amount of $10.25 for moving the wood. Is it not possible to have the wood piled close to the school and thus avoid extra expense in having it moved?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. W.

No. 5,\nWiariton, Ont.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWill you please let me know what the Department intends me to do for a kitchen range? Our stove is worn out.\n\nMy housekeeper intended giving cooking lessons (if she has a stove). I have ordered some kitchen utensils and would appreciate being permitted to choose them myself. I have sent the requisition to Mr. Duffnell. Indeed, two sickles and one long grass shear on June's requisition. Will you please give Mr. Duffnell permission to purchase them for the school. During the summer the school fence has been damaged by the football players. All it needs is to have it stitched and steepled. Will you please give permission\nfor this.\n\nNew Red Cavalry children refused admission to Spanish School. I understand they were accepted. They and the Eskimos surely need looking after.\n\nCould you let me have the following books for the grade VIII classroom as possible:\n\n3 New Curriculum Arithmetic Gr VIII (Hinnton)\n3 Life and Literature pt II Copp Clark\n3 History of Britain (MacMillan)\n3 The Story of England\n3 New Course in English Composition\nClark Invint\n\n3 The Old World Past Present (Scott, Houst)\n1) Teacher's Guide, Life Literature Bk II Nelson\n2) English Practice Gr VIII ed.

Burke, Wiarton, Ont.\n\nThis $1.00 allowance represents a discount of 10% granted on all purchases, excepting Meats and Groceries, made through the D.A.\n\nWe trust this explanation will clear up the matter, and thank you for your patronage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. Eaton Co.\n\nVL/EW\nOttawa, February 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant and thank you for the information supplied but I would be pleased if you would elucidate the statement,- \"This $1.00 allowance represents a discount of 10% granted on all purchases, excepting Meats and Groceries, made through the D.A.\"\n\nDuring the past couple of months we have received three small refunds from your store, 10% discount on D.A. accounts. The purchases were made by teachers in Indian Schools owned by the Department. Is this the reason that the discount was allowed or is it allowed on all D.A. accounts when the Department makes payment?\n\nI would like to be in a position to know when it is in order to deduct the 10% discount and consider that this can only be satisfactorily arrived at by you marking the discount on the accounts.\n\nI have before me a number of D.A. accounts from one of your Branch stores which have been paid by the Department at their full face value, no evidence of a 10% discount appearing on the accounts but before requesting a refund I would like to have a full explanation of the discount in question.\n\nI also notice that on January 28, 1939, your store was forwarded cheque No.78254, for $26.80, in payment for a cook stove supplied an Indian of the Golden Lake Reserve, Ont., the letters \"D.A.\" appeared on the account form but no number. Are we entitled to a refund of $2.68?\n\nAny information you can supply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nThe T.Eaton Co., Ltd.,\nD.A.

We regret we are unable to show the discount on the invoice, but it is in order to deduct the 10% from the invoices forwarded you from the D.A. Office. As intimated in our letter we will be pleased to hear from you again in regard to the purchases at Branch Stores and we will take the matter up and ascertain if allowance can be made on these goods.\n\nThanking you for your favours and trusting we will hear from you again, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\n[T.EATON CO]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The following is a simple method of water purification:\n\nA level teaspoonful of chloride of lime should be rubbed into a teacupful of water. This solution should be diluted with three cupfuls of water and a teaspoonful of the whole quantity added to each two-gallon pailful of drinking water.\n\nThis will give .4 or .5 parts of free chlorine to a million parts of water, sufficient to destroy in ten minutes all typhoid and colon bacilli or other dysentery producing organisms in the water. Moreover, all traces of the chlorine will rapidly disappear.\n\nThe method of purification has been tested with Toronto Bay water inoculated with millions of bacteria. Every germ has been destroyed, and it has been unnecessary to boil the water.\n\nThe above information should be given to the teacher and she can purify the water used by the pupils of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

In your letter of September 12th, 1934, you stated that the necessary work had been done.\n\nWhen Public School Inspector Game visited the Cape Croker School on May 13th, 1936, he again reported that bats were infesting the attic and you were written on May 22nd, 1936, to take immediate steps to have the attic cleaned. You did not reply to this latter letter.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of Inspector Game's report regarding his visit to the Cape Croker School on the 29th ultimo, and part of his report reads, - \"Elimination of bats from the attic. This nuisance is worse than ever.\"\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention. It should be possible to have the bats in the attic killed and the attic thoroughly cleaned.

It is evident that these bats come back in spite of all that can be done to exterminate them. However, in consultation with a Wiarton druggist, he suggested that the attic be thoroughly fumigated with a preparation - as this method of getting rid of the pest has been successful elsewhere. Consequently I had this done, and the room thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed, and the attic is now free of the bats.\n\nThe voucher forms covering the expense of this work are being forwarded to the Department.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Ind.

If this matter has not yet received your attention please attend to it at once. You should not only destroy the bats at present in the attic, but clean the attic thoroughly and block all means of bats getting into this room.\n\nPlease let me know when this work is completed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

He is a most immoral man also a liar, and not fit to teach the minds of young children.\n\nI am an English woman married to an Indian here Joseph Copas and proud of it, but I hear from white people on all sides the remark \"Jessey you marrying an Indian simply because of immoral drunkards like this one about the Indians as a race are a cheaper breed of people than whites, another thing I wish to complain about.\"\n\nOct 29th\n\nNOV 8 1821\nI have 5 children attending school here. I am bound to send them here as there is no other school. They are clean minded English boys, but the conduct of Mr. Jones won't keep them clean long. A few weeks back I had occasion to go see Mr. Jones. As he punished three of my children I called them thieves because a certain child named Raymond Breuille (a white child, son of the store keeper, great friend of Jones) lost his knife. He stole a child's book etc., but as he kept where in the room he attacked them. When I went to them about it\u2014of course he did not like it\u2014and told the whole school if it had been a man he would...\nHave kicked his ass at the school a nice remark to make to children. The other day my boy Norman found a horse shoe in the road his child Brunelle accused him of taking it & told me of my first boys that if he did not return it she would give him an hiding. My boy is 9 & his Brunelle 13, he hit my boy & was parted by an Indian. My eldest boy was so mad he went down to give Eric by a hiding. When he saw him coming he got away. I ordered him away. Next morning when my child Norman (who I might kill for a knaps medal boy) went to school he ordered him out & to go only my children but to the Indians.\nChildren as well he pays them\nno attention what ever. Simply\nteaches these Brunelle children\nso he can please the mother. I\ninquired of different Indian children\nabout my boy coming home & they all\nsay that Jones said he dismissed\nhim from the school. Where all\nthe mother in the vicinity was with\nMrs. Robert Marsden Jones & his\nown lips told me he was fond\nof her. I am sure there is not a\ncleaner or straighter woman on\nthe Island than Mrs. Robert Marsden\n& it's a shame a worthless drunk\nlike this man should cause\nthis woman's character to be\ntaken away from her also to\nhis & wreck a good name.\n\nMrs. Jones to Mr. Brunelle\nOttawa, November 9, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mrs. J. Coppegog, a white woman married to an Indian, at Christian Island, and also a resolution of certain members of the Christian Island band. Both these communications, the latter of which is signed by forty-one Indians, are referring again to the moral character and general unfitness of Mr. Thomas Jones, the teacher of the Christian Island school. It is strongly recommended that this man be dismissed.\n\nUnder date of the 14th ultimo the Department wrote to you explaining that it was not the intention to ask for the resignation of Mr. Jones, without further information from you as to his improper conduct. Under the same date I wrote to Mr. Jones, asking him to exercise more care and requesting him to answer my communication. I have not heard from him, and I am satisfied that, if the statement of behaviour alleged in the communications to hand today is true, this matter should be taken up again immediately.\n\nWould you make a detailed report concerning this man and his activities, immediately. I would be pleased, also, to hear from you as to the standing of this Mrs. J. Coppegog and of Mr. Albert Menague (Councillor). It appears from the hand-writing of the resolution that it was prepared by this last named Indian.\n\nAs a rule the Department pays little attention to complaints that do not originate with our agent in the field, but this matter seems to be persistent and must have a grain of truth. We cannot afford to hire the services of a teacher for an Indian day school if there is any question as to his moral calibre. Is it your opinion that Mr. Walter Simone, Secretary of the Council, who headed the deputation from the Christian Island band to this Department on October 14th, was properly representing the feeling of the Council?

This matter has again been brought to our attention in a rather striking manner, and I have written to Mr. Agent Picotte, asking for a further report. It is our wish, however, to be fair in this and any other matter, and I ask for an immediate response to my communication of the 14th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 14th, etc., received, contents noted. I beg to say in view of the report made to the Department as to my conduct on the Island and not aware of any such underhand work in progress. I am much regret that such went to headquarters for as far as I was concerned as you intimated a little ago and take should have settled this. I beg to say that was the course I took when I found my mistakes and as this occurred last July, I thought this was settled when the party involved accepted my apology and during holidays. I gave the people to understand that I had other openings and desired to know.\nfrom them as to whether they are needing my services any longer which was as the Dept. is aware they requested me by a resolution in Council to stay another term and consequently adjusted matters for another term I am glad to note in your letter the lenient way you are dealing with me and will bear in mind my position more closely and I must say that from that date mentioned there has been nothing in my conduct that anyone could say against me and am in friendly terms with everyone. Of course I want the Dept. to understand me that I am doing my work just as faithfully as ever and it has been my highest ambition in my life to help educate my people believing that this is the best way to help them to an\neven footing on the progress of time, and I believe, my record at your office will confirm my idea, since I have sacrificed the best part of my life in the service of Education my people not for the salary that is in it but I feel I owe this to them, probably I should not have written my own personal ideas but I feel I am writing to one who feels the same as I do.\n\nLastly I am sorry I erred but it has been a splendid lesson for we are all subject to mistakes and mine must be foremost. I assure you that you will never again have any reason to feel that I am not conducting myself civilly. In closing I regret to note that Mrs Jones is mentioned in this matter for there is no one on this Island that can say...\ntruthfully anything against Mrs. Jones as to her conduct and relationship with the people she comes in contact with and as you are aware that such a matter of false report in order to discredit one's character is a serious offence and in view of this fact after consideration I have convinced Mrs. Jones to leave the matter stand as it is.\n\nI hope I have not bored you with this letter and I hope I have made clear to you my future intentions as to myself.\n\nHoping to hear from you.\n\nRemain your humble servant,\n\nThomas Jones\nTo the Indian Department, Ottawa.\n\nSir, We are of the Christian Island Band of Indians, the Department that we understand certain particulars do were not authorized by the Band or the Band go, and are the cause of the school teacher, Thomas, in the Island and to continue on teaching and we assure you do not approve his appointment as he is not worthy as a trial both he and Mrs Jones character and habit are not at all satisfactory and it is true that they are causing a great trouble to Mr & Mrs Robert Marston Members of this Band, and we ask the Department to dismiss him at once,\n\nEd.

I am not aware of what those facts reported to him, but what I know is this: When I received word from the Dept. to send a report of the conduct of the teacher of Mr. Jones and I told him about it and I also advised him to give his resignation, that he was well aware of the trouble he had caused in Macdonald's family, and that he also knew what very short would be, and it would be in his favor, before any reason for his resignation and I thought it would be accepted by the Dept., and end more trouble. He told me that if he was dismissed he would claim one year's salary, and before giving his resignation he would have a solicitor's advice about it. But he went to the members of the council and told them that I had ordered him to close the school, and as Willie him is a cousin to his wife he advanced him $20.00 to come with John Smith and the last Chief's Ring to Penetanguishene to Ottawa to find out on what authority I wanted the school closed.\n\nThey had a great powwow at the Council Hall over it; and they were very careful not to mention\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6123, File 384-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nThe meeting lasted all long after midnight; the council was satisfied that the delegation should come to Fortescue to investigate. Now what happens? The other three members of the council (Handyone) is how they got to Ottawa, and how they received their travelling expenses, as there was no resolution passed at that meeting to authorize them to go to Ottawa. The Chief was to go to something with the teepee and one of the councillors, but the Chief would have never consented to go to Ottawa, and the other two slipped across before he came to the boat.\n\nThe Acting Chief, Louis Coppergo, would like to have a copy of the resolution they may have produced when they went down, if they did have one.\n\nIn my opinion, as well as the signature attached to Mr. Coppergo's letter shows, the delegation was not representing the feelings of the Band.\n\nI sent a detailed report to the Dept concerning the teacher's activities, and after reading the copy of Mr. Coppergo's letter it would only be an addition to my report as what happened at school was corroborated by the band officer.\n\nMr. Coppergo is while women married to an Indian with five boys of school age and should have the preference over the white children of a certain store working for the Standard Chemical Co. I must say that Danielle's family has left the...\nSir,\n\nReserve since some three weeks ago.\n\nMrs. Chippego told me that she wrote her own letter, and Albert Drouin wrote the petition, and they cannot see what makes you think that it is the same handwriting in the two documents.\n\nI regret that my first effort was not made by the members of that delegation. I have nothing against them, but I gave him a free advice, and that at the time of the season when a person could get off the Reserve easily, as it is next to impossible for him to leave at present, and there is a feeling among the Band that he must have the Reserve altogether, so you may know Indians will refuse at the next election of some or, while they will serve at his service.\n\nThings are very quiet just at present with the Jones, but there is a bad feeling against the Secretary for trying to be the whole council all by himself.\n\nIf you have any instructions to give, please address to Secretary, as I will be there for a few days.\n\nSoblige\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC.J.

You are aware, no doubt, that the Band pay the salary of the teacher for this school, and that they engaged the services of Mr. Jones. Therefore, I feel that it is advisable to secure the recommendation of the Council before initiating any action with a view to a change of teachers at the Christian Island Indian Day School.\n\nIf, however, it is impossible to travel to and from Christian Island at this time, it would be well if you would postpone bringing this matter to a head until such time as travelling facilities are better. If you decide, in view of the season of the year, that Mr. Jones and family are unable to leave Christian Island, it would be well to draw to the attention of no one the subject matter of this communication. It would lead to poor service on the part of the teacher who knew that overtures were being made concerning his dismissal, and petty jealousies on the part of the members of the Band who are in favour of the retention of Mr. Jones.\n\nYour careful attention to this matter and an early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPenetang, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMO.\n\nIn answer to your letter dated Dec. 16th regarding the school teacher I may say that the Band pays the salary of the teacher, and they recommended the reappointment of Mr. Jones, but they have nothing to do in the engagement of a teacher. The Dept. has always done that for the Indians, and I don't think it would be a good policy to get a resolution of the council for the dismissal of a teacher; it would only cause more trouble. Jones and his wife have been very quiet and careful lately. The school service is good, and under the circumstances I think it would be wise to keep him all spring. There is no communication with the main land except in a small rowboat, and that is not too safe at times, the weather has been very discouraging for the children and things are quite satisfactory at present. However, if the teacher should forget himself again I think the Dept. should dismiss him at once.\n\nRussell P. Irvine, Esq.\nDept. of Indian Education\nOttawa\n\nJohn Lumley, Agent\nC. J.

You need take no further action at the present time, as long as Mr. Jones continues to give satisfactory service, and it will not be necessary to mention this matter to either Mr. Jones or the council.\n\nEarly next summer the question of engaging the services of another teacher can be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

May I review the facts, to refresh in your mind the situation.\n\nPrevious to 1915, the Methodist Missionary Society were represented on the reserve at Christian Island by a Mr. Oliver, who taught in the day school. This gentleman was not wholly satisfactory to the Indian population as a teacher, for the simple reason that his duties were too manifold and his energies were too often bent in other directions. At the time of his resignation, the Indian Council took upon themselves the appointment of the school teacher, and they have been more or less successful in supervising the school activities.\n\nThe present incumbent - a Mr. Jones - has been so careless in his actions outside of the classroom that this Department has had to call for his resignation. I believe, at the time of my last writing on this matter, that the solution was to return again to the missionary-teacher type.\n\nThe recent delegation to Ottawa from the Indian Band at Christian Island has been the cause of the change in the Department's policy for this particular school. There is a general unrest among the Indians of Ontario, and this Department has had to use considerable tact in all its relations with the individual bands. I have to inform you that I have made arrangements for a teacher at the Christian Island Indian Day School, in conjunction with the Indian Council at that point. This will relieve you of the duty of nominating a teacher to commence work September first, next.\n\nI am convinced that the Indian Band at Christian Island would be glad to have a missionary resident on the reserve and, if you are successful in finding a man for this cause, I feel that there is a real job for him. If you are likely to be unsuccessful in placing a man on this reserve, I would be pleased to have your permission to utilize the mission house as a teacher's residence. This is a very old\n\nRev. C.

I believe that I will be successful in having the Indian Band vote from their trust moneys sufficient for the repairs needed to make the residence habitable. I might inform you that the Indians of Christian Island pay all expenses in connection with the operation of the day school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 1, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to inform you that there has been a change in plan for the Christian Island Indian Day School, commencing the first of September, next. Mr. Peter Jackson has called at the office and has convinced the Department that it would be better for us to hire a teacher in conjunction with the Indian Council than to look to the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nI have asked Mr. Jackson to have the Council nominate a teacher to succeed Mr. Jones, and we have discussed two or three young men of good qualifications, who could fill the position admirably. My own choice is a Mr. Lorenzo Big Canoe, of Georgina Island, Ont. I have suggested to Mr. Jackson a salary of $700 plus bonus. It will be necessary for the band to pass a resolution, recommending Mr. Big Canoe or other teacher; authorizing the Department to pay from Band funds a salary of, say $700 (the bonus is paid by the Department); and, if possible, a vote of a few hundred dollars to repair the teacher's residence. This building, as you are aware, is church-owned, and I am making overtures to the authorities in Toronto with a view to permitting us to utilize it as a teacher's residence and to make the necessary repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. J.

I have received a reply to my letter, and in regard to this Reserve he says:\n\n\"I cannot recommend the Conference to station a man there for the missionary work only, because the task is so small. I regret the Indians have blocked the way for a Missionary Teacher, but we will hope that it will work for the best.\"\n\nSince I wrote you on June 3rd I received a letter of which the enclosed is a copy, and which shows that all of the Indians on the island are not agreeable to the decision reached by your Department concerning the control of the school on the island.\n\nMy personal judgment is that the Indians would be very much better served if we were allowed to send a Missionary Teacher there, who could both teach school and preach to them regularly. I hope you will reconsider your decision in this matter and allow us to do as I propose.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nEnc.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I understand that some complaints have gone in to your Department, and they want to have him dismissed or put off the Island.\n\nThis, I believe, is only two or three families, but all the others are very anxious to keep him there.\n\nHe no doubt has been an exceptionally good teacher, and I doubt if you can place him provided he is let go.\n\nI would strongly recommend that he be sustained, as I understand that he is an A1 teacher in every respect, and I think will give you exceptionally good service.\n\nIn any case be good enough to let me know at an early date what your intentions are, or if you intend to have him dismissed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nManley Chew\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jones be continued as teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School, and enclosing a communication from the Public School Inspector as to the success Mr. Jones has met with in his work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the services of Mr. Jones as teacher were satisfactory, it was found necessary to ask for his resignation on account of his personal conduct on the Reserve. A number of complaints have been made during the past year regarding his conduct and attention to a married woman. This led to considerable trouble among the Indian factions on the Reserve. A petition received in October, last, signed by 41 Indians referred to the moral character and the consequent unfitness of Mr. Jones as teacher of this school, and asked that he be dismissed.\n\nThis matter was taken up with Mr. Jones and he was asked to exercise more care in his conduct. We desired to be entirely fair with him and give him every chance, and also received his promise that he would give no further cause for complaint. However, since then we have received copies of letters written by him to the woman referred to above, which, to say the least, are most indiscreet. It was, therefore, considered in the interests of the work and as we had given him every chance, that we could not further continue his services. He was informed by official letter of May 26th, last, that he should hand his resignation to the Indian Agent to take effect June 30th.\n\nThe appointment of a teacher to succeed Mr. Jones has been left in the hands of the Indian Council, and we are informed that a special council meeting was called on very short notice with only a few members of the Band present at which a resolution was passed to retain Mr. Jones' services. A protest against the manner in which this meeting was called and the re-appointment of Mr. Jones signed by some of the councillors and secretary of the Band has also been received.\n\nThe Department feels that the re-appointment of Mr. Jones would only lead to continual ill-will between the two factions on the Reserve, and that it is better, in the interests of all concerned, that a new teacher be secured. We have informed the Indians that, if they wish the services of an Indian teacher, we will approve of the appointment of Lorenzo Big Canoe of Georgina Island, who is regarded of good qualifications. However, if the Indians fail to come to a unanimous agreement regarding the appointment of a teacher, we will have to ask the authorities of the Methodist Church to make an appointment, as this school is carried on under the auspices of that Church, they having expressed a desire to nominate a missionary-teacher to\n\nManley Chew, Esq., M.P.,\nPenetanguishene,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jones be retained as teacher for the next school year, I beg to say that the Department cannot approve of the re-appointment of Mr. Jones.\n\nIt is hoped that the council will agree to the appointment of Mr. Lorenzo Big Canoe, or some other properly qualified person.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

McLean,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your favor of the 6th inst., written by Mr. A. S. Williams, apparently in your absence.\n\nI have no interest whatever in who should be school teacher at Christian Islands. I know personally the Indians over there, and as well I am acquainted with Mr. Jones. Practically all of the council have been in to see me in connection with this. I think fully 90% of the Indians at Christian Islands are very anxious to have Mr. Jones remain as teacher. This is the only reason why I have taken the matter up with you.\n\nI note that the conduct of Mr. Jones has not been very good, and from the tone of your letter it would look to me as though you are taking the proper stand, but I do know that the council, and the Indians, almost all of them, are very anxious that he remain there. He has not approached me himself in this connection.\n\nWould it not be well to have the council meet in full and vote on this question. I do not intend to press the matter, as you should know more about it than myself, but I do meet the Indians almost every day, and I know this is the feeling on the island, outside of possibly three or four, and I do know that Mr. Jones has been an exceptionally good teacher, and is very capable in every way.\n\nBefore making any change it would pay you to go into the matter further.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6123, File 384-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, July 20th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a number of communications regarding a teacher for the next school year for the Christian Island Indian Day School. Mr. Chong, M.P., forwarded a resolution which was moved by Frank Copegoog and seconded by John Hawk and signed by Chief Henry Jackson that Thomas Jones be retained as teacher. A protest was received signed by Albert Monague, Edward King and Robt. Marston against this resolution, which they state was passed at a special Council called by Chief Jackson on very short notice, at which very few members were present.\n\nAs you are aware, owing to the conduct of Mr. Jones, the Department cannot approve of his services being continued. It would be advisable for you to call a full Council of the Band and have them come to some definite arrangement regarding the appointment of a teacher. The Council should understand that we cannot approve of the re-appointment of Mr. Jones.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of June 1st, last, stating the name of a young Indian who would be satisfactory as teacher. You should inform the Band that if they do not come to a unanimous agreement that we will have no other recourse but to request the Methodist Church authorities to nominate a teacher.\n\nThis matter should receive your early attention, in order that the services of a teacher can be secured in time to re-open the school after the present summer holidays. An early reply stating the action you have taken in this matter is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. Picotte, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6123, File 384-1, part 2)\nOTTAWA, July 20th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant in further reference to the continuing of the services of Mr. Thos. Jones as teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School, I beg to say that, in view of the relationship of Mr. Jones with a married woman on the Reserve, we are not prepared to re-appoint him for the next school year.\n\nWhile it is no doubt true that a number of the Indians desire his re-appointment, there is another faction which has strongly protested against his re-engagement, and it is considered, in the interest of all concerned, that the services of a new teacher be secured.\n\nThe appointment of a new teacher has been left in the hands of the Council, which must be confirmed at a full meeting of the same, and if they cannot arrive at a unanimous agreement as to the teacher they desire, we will have no recourse but to call upon the authorities of the Methodist Church to nominate a teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nfor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nManley Chew, Esq., M.P.,\nPenetanguishene,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nAnswering your letter of July 20th regarding a teacher, I may say that I spoke to the chief some time ago but nothing has been done yet; the councillors are all away and I am sure nothing will be done. I presume that when Jackson tried to convince the Dept. that it would be better for the council to hire teachers in future he just wanted to get a chance to keep Jones in spite of the rest of the Band and when that did not succeed he put the matter aside and went to see further trouble. Regarding the Mission house, I think it needs a lot of repair if done properly, it should start from the foundation up. However it is comfortable as it is and if we have a lady teacher she should be supplied with fuel for the winter.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nC.J.

There is a certain amount of friction between two factions on the Reserve, one of which desires the re-appointment of Jones and the other wishes to obtain a new teacher. The Agent states that he is sure nothing will be done by the Council to appoint a teacher, and we are informing him that this matter will be taken away from the control of the Council and other steps taken to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for this school.\n\nIn our letter of June 3rd, last, you stated that you had been arranging to nominate a missionary-teacher at Christian Island, one who could both teach school and preach regularly. However, at that time, as you were informed, we left the nomination of a teacher in the hands of the Council. As the Council have failed to come to an agreement in the selection of a teacher, I shall be pleased if you will endeavour to obtain the services of a suitable teacher for this point. A man who could perform both missionary and teaching duties would be satisfactory. If the services of such a man can be obtained, the Department will be glad to accept him. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. The salary allowed the teacher will be at the same rate as was paid the former teacher, Thomas Jones, viz: $800 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society, Wesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir;-\n\nRE CHRISTIAN ISLAND.\n\nOn returning to the office, after an absence of several weeks, I find your letter of August 14th on my file. You inform me that the Indian Council, at Christian Island, has taken no steps to appoint a Teacher to succeed Thos. Jones, and request that we nominate a Missionary Teacher for this position.\n\nI write to say that I will do the best I can to find a suitable man, and will notify you of results at the earliest possible moment.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nThis is to certify that I have had no communications in any form nor have I exchanged words with Mrs. R. Maclean ever since the report was made to the Indian Department in the spring of 1871 after I had replied a letter from the Dept. of Interior and any report or statement that may be circulated contrary to this statement of mine is absolutely false.\n\nThomas James.\nChristian Island Aug. 15/22\n\nMarley Chew M.P.\nMidland\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a special council meeting of the Christian Island Band of Indians in connection with the appointment of a teacher for Christian Island day school, two names were submitted in the persons of Mr. George Big Canoe and Georgeine Beard, and Thomas Jones was appointed by 90 per cent of the voting members of the Band; and the Indians will not be satisfied with anyone else other than their choice. I am of the opinion any move contrary to the wishes of the Indians by the Department would create trouble. In the past, the Methodist Missionary Society had the privilege of nominating a teacher, which it had been noted did not work out to the interest of the Indians. I have seen many cases where teachers selected by the mission...\nWith respect to teaching in school as concerned\u2014old ministers and men who can not get a job on a living salary were being sent here as teachers and the result was disappointment and failure\u2014and a great disadvantage to our children\u2014\n\nAbout 3 years ago\u2014an arrangement was arrived at by myself and J.D. Maclean of the Indian Department whom I have found is with heart and soul to forward the uplift of the Indians in this matter\u2014it was agreed that the Christian Island Council\u2014would have the privilege of nominating their school teacher\u2014and this arrangement was satisfactory and there is no reason to change the system.\n\nMr. Ross has lived carefully on the island. The Indians have not complained of his conduct\u2014since the Marauders affair in the spring of 1921.\n\nMr. Beattie the agent I have told has urged marauders on the matter\u2014which caused this matter to open out again while our force is right here and is willing to start when school opens.\nShall we give another year on the island? This service has been very satisfactory; children were learning rapidly. Since nothing showed done in this affair, the progress of the children knowing the conditions as I am on the island, it is not in the interest of the Indians that a change be made. However, the Indian Department will change its attitude on the matter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief Henry Jackson\nCopy of Resolution\nSpecial Council Held\nAug. 14th/22\n\nTo School Teachers\nMoved by Simon Marks\nSeconded by Peter Sylvester\nThat we retain these terms\nfor teachers on the list,\nfor this season coming.\n\nCarried,\n\nChief Henry Jackson\nPenetanguishene,\nOntario.\nAug. 21, 1922.\n\nMr. J.

I\ntold them that I would forward any correspondence they had.\nThis is quite as far as I would care to go, but they seem to\nbe very firm on having Mr. Thomas Jones act as teacher. These\nletters might throw some light on the case. I have not had a\nchance to see the agent, Mr. Picotte, about this; would like\nto have seen him personally. The facts are he has been out on\nthe island pretty much all summer, and I have not had a chance\nto see him.\n\nThere might be something behind it all that I am not\naware of, and it is just possible that I am only getting one\nside of the case. From what I can gather they are very anxious\nto have Jones reinstated. You might let me know what decision\nyou have come to in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

His conduct during the past year was such as led to considerable friction among the different factions on the reserve.

He informs us that he is endeavouring to find a suitable man.

MONTOUR for the position of Missionary Teacher on Christian Island Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Rev. James Drew wrote me concerning him, and among other things said:\n\n\"This young man certainly has the gift of teaching. He taught school on the Six Nations Reserve and also in the New Credit School. He is a Local Preacher of some two or more years' standing, and also has been recommended as a suitable candidate for the ministry of our Church. He spent last year at Wesleyan College, Montreal. I have made enquiries about him and from the men who have known him from his earliest days there is the feeling that he would be just the man you need for the work. I know his father and brothers, and I also have learned from others that his home life is above the average Indian's home. He spent some four years under Mr. McVitty at Muncey, and his record there was a good one.\"\n\nI wrote to Mr. McVitty, enquiring about him and this morning have a reply in which he says:\n\n\"Enos Montour spent about four years here. One of the best boys we ever had. Since leaving here he has studied at Brantford Collegiate. Every report has been favorable.\"\n\nProf. Graham, of Wesleyan Theological College, Montreal, says:\n\n\"Mr. Montour is a very gifted young Indian from the Brantford Reserve. He is a fluent speaker and uses good language, and has a good comprehension of the fundamentals of our faith. He is a very interesting young man, and, I think, would be acceptable to the congregations of any mission field, or other field, for that matter.\"\n\nIf you will agree to his appointment, I will notify him at once. Although I am not sure that he is now available, I ask you to agree to his appointment, so that if he is available no time will be lost in making the appointment. He wrote me on the 30th of June and I am sorry to say that, owing to uncertainty about his address,\nit has taken us a good while to gather the information which I give you above.\n\nIf he is not available I think I know another man whom we could secure for the position, but Montour impresses me as being likely to make the greater success of the work at Christian Island.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

A young man has been recommended to me for this position, but I am reluctant to take any action in regard to his appointment until I know whether the services of Lorenzo Big Canoe are acceptable, as teacher of the school on that Reserve.\n\nWould it, in your judgment, be advisable to make a change in the appointment of teacher there?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.

In the reports which have been received from the Public School Inspector, the local Indian Agent and officials of this Department who have visited the Reserve they have stated that he is performing very satisfactory work. The Public School Inspector states that he is doing \"exceptionally good work\". The Indian parents like him, and there has been a good attendance during the past year.

Have you any other school where you could place him?\n\nI am in touch with a young man, a matriculant of the University, twenty-five years of age, who would be willing to serve as Missionary Teacher on Christian Island, but I would not propose that he displace Friend Big Canoe, unless you have some school where Big Canoe could serve quite as well as on Christian Island.

The Indians are satisfied with his services and desire that he remain. He maintained a good attendance during the year. We are not aware of any other school to which he could be appointed, unless to the Mud Lake (Chemong) Indian Day School, and, as you are being informed in another communication, an urgent request has been received from the Indian Agent that Mr. Arthur Smith be retained for the next school year. The Department does not desire to make any change in teacher at Christian Island, but will be guided by any arrangements which you would recommend be made.

I hope to be in a position in a few days to submit to you a statement of the qualifications of the one whose appointment I would recommend.\n\nThe Missionary Teachers at Moraviantown, Alderville and Gibson are, I understand, giving great satisfaction both to the Indian Department and to the Indians themselves, and I am satisfied that if we had an equally efficient teacher at Christian Island, as anyone of the three referred to, the Indians would be well satisfied with the arrangement.\n\nI cannot but feel that to be governed by the request of the Council, to which you refer, would not be in the best interests of the Indians on Christian Island, and inasmuch as you have already agreed to the appointment of a Missionary Teacher at Christian Island, as previous correspondence goes to show, I think...\nOttawa, July 6, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to teaching services at the Christian Island Indian Day School.

I have been in correspondence with the Missionary Society that is associated with this Department in the conduct of this school and they have written in part as follows:\n\n\"To send a Missionary there - who would have nothing to do but the work that usually falls to a missionary on such a field - would be to give him less than a man's job and would involve very heavy expense, which in these days of financial stringency we want to avoid.

I understand Mr. Cowling, Missionary Teacher, was attending a conference in Toronto. From all I could learn there does not appear to be much progress being made in this school. There seems to be quite a bit of dissatisfaction among the Indians with the work of Mr. Cowling. I had a number of complaints made to me regarding his methods of disciplining the pupils. It is reported that he is in the habit of taking the boys by the chin and back of the head and lifting them off their feet. One girl, daughter of the Truant Officer, had her knee injured by being thrown against a desk. It is also stated that he is impatient and quick tempered with the pupils. The Agent informed me that the pupils are backward in their studies. There is no Manual training or needlework taught; nothing to vary the routine studies or make classroom work attractive. Mr. Cowling is about 70 years of age and I understand is a very fine type of a Christian gentleman but his position built upon the fact that the Indians towards him, his usefulness as a teacher of Indian children is over. This school has a roll of 53 pupils and requires a younger teacher. I have no hesitation in recommending that Mr. Cowling be replaced by a younger and more energetic teacher with a sympathetic understanding of Indian boys and girls, one who would bring leadership and encouragement among the young people on the reserve. There is a splendid field for such a teacher, male or female.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, September 30th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Inspector McGookin of this Department visited Christian Island recently and his report concerning the services of Mr. R. Cowling is such that it is my duty to write to you asking that a change be made at your Society's earliest convenience. Our officer reports that there is considerable dissatisfaction among the Indians concerning Mr. Cowling's work and it appears that his usefulness has ended. The Christian Island Indian Day School has an enrolment of fifty-three (53) pupils and requires a strong, energetic teacher. It is the Department's opinion that Mr. Cowling's age militates against attractive classroom activity for our wards. I shall be glad to learn what steps you take to improve the service at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Robt. B.

McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nOct. 3rd,\n1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated September 30th (File No. 6-1-1), I beg to state that Mr. Cowling resigned his position at the end of June but at the urgent request from this office reconsidered his decision and promised to remain in charge another year.\n\nThis is the first intimation of any dissatisfaction in connection with his work either on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs or the Indians themselves. It is quite clear that Mr. Cowling has no intention of remaining at Christian Island after the close of next school term and I trust that it will not be necessary to make any change until then.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCGY:AMA.\nOttawa, October 5, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to continuing the services of Mr. R. Cowling as teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that arrangements were made with Mr. Cowling by your office to remain in charge for another year, and the Department will approve of his continuing as teacher at Christian Island until the end of the present school year, viz., June 30, next, and it will not be necessary to make any change in teacher until that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nOct. 15,\n1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis acknowledges receipt of your letter of the 5th instant (File 6-1-1) re Mr. Cowling who is stationed at Christian Island, and we thank you for the information it contains.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAMA.\nSir,\n\nFrom recent conversation with Mr Robert Cowling, United Church Missionary, and Day School teacher, of the Reserve, I understand it is his intention to submit his resignation during the coming summer.\n\nThis being the case, and with the future welfare of the Indian people in view, I wish to take this early opportunity of asking the Department, if when the occasion arises and a new appointment has to be made, will they kindly give consideration to the selection of a Missionary-Teacher who has a Second Class Certificate, and is also qualified to teach Manual Training. A married man, not over middle age, who's wife would be willing to reside on the Reserve, and who would be interested enough to take an active part in social work and moral welfare of the Indian people.\n\nI beg to state, the reason I am making this request is, with reference to the teaching of manual training in the school, I consider that under existing conditions on Christian Island, better results would be obtained from the pupils if this subject were included in their every day studies.\n\nThe Indian children of this Reserve are naturally backward in education, and I attribute this fact to the conditions under which they live, being resident on an Island they have not the same chance as Indian children living on the mainland, who are constantly mixing with the white people, and who naturally learn the English language more quickly and therefore advance in education more rapidly.\n\nVery few of the children of this Reserve can speak English at all, with the result they are backward in their studies, and are not very interested in school work, if manual training were taught, I consider it\nit would be both interesting and instructive, and would help the children to gain useful knowledge more quickly.\n\nWith reference to my suggestion for a married man, not past middle age, and one who's wife would be willing to live on the Reserve and help with the work, I consider the moral standards of the people would greatly improve if there were a Missionary and his wife, who were young enough, and energetic enough, to devote part of their time to working among the people and encourage them along the lines of healthful and useful activities.\n\nIt appears to me that in the past very little has been done along these lines, with the result that, more especially among the younger people, who having had nothing of interest to occupy their minds, and no decent places of amusement to go to during leisure hours, they have reverted to pastimes that are not beneficial to them.\n\nFrom experience I find the Indian people are interested and appreciate what is being done along social lines, societies have been formed more especially among the women, and good results are being achieved, but the leadership falls to one or two and what is now needed is more help to carry on this work, this can be secured by the appointment of able and willing Missionary workers.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade,\n\nAgent\nOttawa, January 31, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the teaching services at the Christian Island Indian Day School, I have to inform you that a communication has been received from Mr. H. J. Eade, Indian Agent, Christian Island. He strongly recommends that, when a new appointment is made at the beginning of the next school year, the services of a married teacher be obtained. It is possible that your Society would be glad to have this recommendation before you when selecting a successor to the present incumbent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

It is noted you recommend that the services of a married teacher be engaged for the next academic year, to succeed the present incumbent.\n\nThe Department is communicating with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted and who nominate the teachers. They are being informed of your recommendations. It is hoped that the church authorities will be able to secure the services of a married teacher who, with the assistance of his wife, will greatly improve the moral standards of the people and achieve good results in the work at the school.

Sir:\n\nI have to refer you to your letter dated February 3rd, last, with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the coming school year at the Christian Island Indian Day School. I should be pleased if you would forward, at an early date, the nomination of a qualified teacher, giving full particulars regarding qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Robt. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nI understand from Mr. Indian Agent Eade that Christian Island school was built in 1850. At the Fall Fair, September 2nd and 3rd, this building was used as an exhibit hall, and on the second day there was a heavy rainfall. In addition to two or three good-sized streams of water pouring from the ceiling on the tables, rain beat in the sides of the window sashes and poured in at the tops of the windows. Had school been in session it would have been impossible for the children to sit on the east side of the schoolroom. The teacher said he had never seen it like this before, but I feel sure that in any east wind the rain would beat in at the windows.\n\nI made inquiries of the Agent and understand that there are a number of children on the Island who never attend school. I talked with many of the women and some of them were frank in their opinion that the children learn nothing at school and might better be of some use at home. So far as I can ascertain there has never been an Indian of Christian Island pass the Entrance, although many of the young people appear to be bright and interested.\n\nJudging by the number of children of school age, I feel sure that a two room school such as that at Rama is badly needed. The whole reserve would benefit if the teachers appointed were young and interested in sports or welfare work.\nOttawa, September 24, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Barner:\n\nAn officer of the Department, who has recently returned from Christian Island, is of the opinion that several improvements are necessary in our services there if progress is to be achieved. In the first place, the school building needs replacement, and, as there are nearly 700 children of school age on this reserve - most of whom at the present time are Protestant - the Department is considering the advisability of erecting a 2-classroom school. As far as the teaching services are concerned, I have learned that Mr. Joblin cannot be considered successful. His poor health, doubtlessly, has much to do with his lack of enthusiasm, but the work of your Society and this Department is suffering. I am informed that Mr. Joblin takes practically no interest in reserve affairs generally and his activities as missionary teacher are confined solely to one preaching service per week and to the regular school hours. Much of his time is spent away from the Island altogether, and I know that you would wish to have this information, so that plans can be made for another year.\n\nThe suggestion comes to my mind that it might be advisable to conduct an undenominational school of 2 classrooms. There are some Catholic children on the reserve who have attended the school in the past, and this suggests that a school with no church control might be successful in enlisting the cooperation of all on the Island. Father Cadot is the Catholic missionary for the Island. He visits there periodically during the year, and, from what the Department knows of his attitude, I believe that he would be glad to have the members of his flock attend such an institution.\n\nPlease discuss this with Mr. Beaton at the first opportunity and let the Department have a recommendation from your Society.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Mr. Dean has also requested that I ask the Department to consider the question of taking manual training in the school amongst the higher classes, and to supply him with the tools and material necessary for this work, just what the cost of the tools required would be I cannot state, but I have also enclosed a letter and list of articles necessary for this work which has been given to Mr. Dean by a friend who is a teacher of manual training in Ottawa.\n\nI personally consider that manual training would be of real benefit to the boys of Christian Island school, I am sure that Mr. Dean who is a young man and a new teacher on the reserve would do his best to promote interest in the work and make it a success.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

I am returning the list enclosed in your letter, and would request that you take this matter up with the teacher with a view to ascertaining the minimum supply of tools and material absolutely necessary, also an estimate of the cost involved. Would it be necessary to supply manual training benches? When we have full information as to the cost, consideration will be given whether funds to supply the equipment required can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The children are certainly responding to his efforts.\n\nWhen we responded to the late Mr. Ferrier's request that a younger teacher be nominated for Christian Island it was with the understanding that a new school building should be erected with two class rooms, and while the severe financial depression has interfered with the plans of the Department I trust that this case will be kept in mind, as I am quite sure that Mr. Dean ought to have assistance if the best work is to be done among the children of that place.\n\nWith kindest wishes,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dean the teacher, received an urgent message from his home at Ottawa, stating that his father was dying, and asking him and his mother, who has been staying with him on the Island, to return at once. Mr Dean's mother being an invalid, it was impossible for her to travel alone, they therefore left together on Friday Jan 6th, and to date I have not received any word from him, as to when he is likely to return, although I expect him back any day, during his absence the school will have to remain closed, but I am hoping he will be back in time to commence school next week.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.W.

Mr. Dean received a message that his father who has been very sick in the Ottawa hospital, for some time, was very much worse, and not expected to live.

I would be pleased if you would advise us what should be done that the school may be conducted with the maximum of efficiency.\n\nIt seems practically impossible to carry on without some change, as we have already 52 enrolled, and expect a beginners class of about 8 who are required to attend under the School Attendance Act. At present the room is overcrowded as six new seats were added last winter making a total of 56.\n\nIt seems that it may be necessary either to refuse admission to the beginners which seems to me to be undesirable, or to take part of the classes in the morning and the remainder in the afternoon, with a possible extension of school hours to enable us to cover the work.\n\nThese appear to be the only alternatives in view of the fact that conditions prevent us from securing assistance. Were it possible to have assistance, the only additional supplies would be 3 or 4 tables and a cupboard which would convert the Council Hall into a class room. Thanking you for your advice.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6123, File 384-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter written by the Rev. C.C. Dean, of Christian Island, and addressed to you. Mr. Dean in his letter has expressed himself very fully regarding the teaching conditions of the Christian Island Day School at the present time. There is no question but what the school is overcrowded, and that it is almost impossible for a teacher to do full justice to the pupils, apart from the fact there are several more children, possibly about eight who will be of age to commence school this coming term. The present school is full to the limit with desks, and I really do not see how these new pupils can be accommodated unless some other provision can be arranged.\n\nMr. Dean in his letter has suggested that part of the school classes could be taken in the morning, and the remainder in the afternoon; this arrangement would of course mean that the pupils would not receive the same amount of instruction as they would only be attending half days. The Indian children of Christian Island are very backward owing to the isolation and the fact that they do not mix with the white people, the parents converse in the Indian language, and the children do not commence to learn English until they start to school; consequently it makes it very hard for the teacher to show any progress for the first year or so, you will therefore understand that an arrangement for half day classes would not help the pupils any, and would make it far harder for the teacher.\n\nMr. Dean is a very good teacher and is very enthusiastic, but I am afraid that he will become discouraged unless some assistance can be given him with his school work. If it is at all possible I would recommend that assistance be given in the appointment of another teacher to take the junior classes, and that the Council Hall be used as a class room for the time being.\n\nMr. Sutherland\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eade\n\nAgent\nOttawa, August 28, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. C. G. Dean, teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School, regarding the crowded condition of the building and recommending that assistance be given by the appointment of another teacher, using the council hall as an extra classroom.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, during the coming academic year, the Department will be unable to provide for an extra teacher or to fit up an additional classroom. Regarding the suggestion of the teacher, that part of the pupils be taken in the morning class and the remainder in the afternoon, I have to say that it might overcome the present difficulty, in connection with overcrowding, if only those pupils of school age, that is, between 7 and 16 years, were allowed to attend. In the last quarterly return, the teacher does not state the ages of the pupils in the column for that purpose. I would request that, in preparing his returns in future, he will give the age of each pupil. It is possible that there are a number of children in attendance under 7 years of age. If there is not room to accommodate them, they should remain at home.\n\nThe need for extra school accommodation on this reserve has been noted, and it is hoped that Mr. Dean will make the best arrangements possible for carrying on the work during the coming academic year. The Department is not in favour of the half day classes, if same can be avoided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. J.

P., Penetanguishene, Ont., regarding Rev. C. C. Dean, teacher, Christian Island Indian Day School, who, he states, was operated on for appendicitis, I have to say that, on the third instant, a night letter was sent Mr. H. J. Eade, Christian Island c/o Dr. W. M. Nettleton, Penetang, Ont., requesting particulars. Mr. Eade was instructed to arrange for the services of Vernon H. Morris, Victoria Harbour, to take charge during the absence of Mr. Dean. He was further informed in the telegram that it was intended, later, to appoint Mr. Morris as teacher of a second classroom which it is proposed to open in the council hall on the reserve.\n\nChristian Island is isolated from the mainland and it is very difficult, at this season of the year, to get a message across. We usually forward telegrams to our agent in care of Dr. Nettleton, who always arranges to have them forwarded to Christian Island at the earliest opportunity. The route to the island from Penetang is to drive by road to Cedar Point, a distance of 16 miles, and then by a smoke signal attract the Indians on the island, 3\u00bd miles distant, who come across in a boat.\n\nTelegrams or communications this season of the year may remain undelivered for several days, as it is entirely unsafe in rough water to cross to the island. No reply has been received from the Agent to our telegram. Mr. Dean's mother resides in Ottawa and she has received no information that her son was operated upon for appendicitis. No doubt, when Mr. Eade receives the message, he will communicate with Mr. Morris and arrange that he take over Mr. Dean's duties.\n\nIt is intended to carry out the instructions, as contained in your memorandum of the 26th ultimo, regarding the appointment of Mr. Morris as assistant teacher; but, as it will be necessary to fit up the extra classroom in the council hall and as the fall term will soon be completed, it was intended to have things ready and Mr. Morris could begin duties as assistant teacher as from the first of January, next.\n\nAs soon as a reply is received from the Agent, you will be advised.\n42 27 DL COLLECT\n\nPENETANG ONT 8 1110A\n\nSECRETARY INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nREFERENCE YOUR TELEGRAM NOVEMBER THIRD RE OBTAINING SERVICES VERNON H MORRIS VICTORIAHARBOUR AS SCHOOL TEACHER STOP MORRIS REPORTED FOR DUTY NOVEMBER SIXTH MR DEAN DOING WELL\n\nH J EADE AGENT\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Sutherland\n\nWith reference to the employment of an Assistant Teacher for the Christian Island School, I am informed by the Civil Service Commission that it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Treasury Board in order to employ Mr. Vernon Morris continuously after the return of the present teacher.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nNovember 10th, 1933.\nNovember 10, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memo of the 26th ultimo, regarding the appointment of an additional teacher at the Christian Island Indian Day School, I have to say that, as advised, Mr. Vernon H.

Order in Council No. 44/1367, dated June 14, 1932, does not permit an increase in establishment. It would therefore be necessary to obtain the consent of the Treasury Board, as stated, before Mr. Morris' services can be continued as assistant teacher after the return of the regular worker.

As stated in the memorandum, Rev. C. C. Dean, the regular teacher, is ill. A substitute was engaged on November 6 to conduct the school in his absence. It has been represented to the Department that in view of the enrolment at this school, some sixty pupils, there is need for a second teacher and the opening of a second classroom. This would constitute an increase in our teaching establishment. The teacher would be paid at the rate of $30.00 a month, less 10%, and funds are available in our appropriation for Indian Education.

C.C. Dean during his absence on account of serious illness.\n\nI have to state that owing to weather conditions your telegram sent care of Dr. J.M. Nettleton of Penetang, did not reach Christian Island until the evening of November 29th, consequently Mr. Morris was teaching two days over the time specified in your message. This however could not be helped, as the mail could not cross and there is no telephone to the island. Dating from November 5th the day Mr. Morris opened school until the date of your telegram, Mr. Morris has taught sixteen teaching days. I have now advised him of your instructions and he is prepared to return home until such times as he is notified to return to Christian Island. In the meantime he would be very glad to have whatever salary is due him, and has asked that it be sent to his address at Victoria Harbour, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nOnt.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

In this connection it is noted that Mr. Morris arrived to begin duties on the 2nd instant and that the equipment was transferred to the room in the council hall, which will be used as a second classroom, to be occupied by the senior classes under the charge of Mr. Dean.\n\nAn order is being forwarded the Government Stationery Office here to supply the classroom material considered necessary, with the exception of the teacher's desk, a thermometer, a water pail and a clock. You may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of a clock of the Big Ben type, one inexpensive thermometer and one galvanized water pail.\n\nWith reference to a desk for the teacher, it is considered that a table with drawer would be satisfactory, and you may arrange for the purchase of same and also, if required, a chair for the teacher's use. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the purchases. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Sch. at Christian\nIsland in Feb 6/871\n\nPP\n27/9/84\nOttawa, September 28th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church authorities have directed attention to the fact that approximately thirty (30) Roman Catholic children have been in attendance at the Christian Island United Church Indian Day School and, consequently, they have expressed a desire for the establishment of a Roman Catholic Day School on the reserve.\n\nThe Indian Agent has reported that between twenty-five (25) and thirty (30) children whose parents are recognized as Roman Catholics are in attendance at the present Christian Island School. As it is the intention of the Indian Act that separate educational facilities be provided for Roman Catholic and Protestant children, the Department has decided to give favourable consideration to the establishment of a school for the Roman Catholic Indian children on the Christian Island Reserve. A female teacher is being transferred from another Indian day school to take charge of this new school which will be conducted in the Council Hall, leaving the present school building for the United Church Indian Day School.\n\nWith the establishment of this new school, only one teacher will be required at the United Church School and Mr. Vernon Morris, who has been the second teacher at Christian Island for the past year, is being transferred to the Oneida No. 2 Indian Day School.\n\nInstructions are being issued to the Indian Agent to see that children whose parents are recognized as Roman Catholics attend the R. C. School and children whose parents are recognized as Protestants attend the U. C. School. Transfers from one school to the other must not be made without the consent of the Department.\n\nThe changes necessitated by the opening of the Roman Catholic School will take effect on October 15th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

It will be brought to his attention on his return, - probably about the middle of November.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to Mr. Beaton\n\nMLT.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nNovember 29th,\n1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Christian Island Indian Day School.\n\nI am sorry that owing to pressure of work I have not been able to visit Christian Island since I returned from the West. I delayed acknowledging receipt of your letter of September 28th, hoping that I might be able to see the situation at first-hand before replying. I was at Christian Island, however, quite recently and Dr. Arthur Barner was there just a few weeks ago, so I think we are fairly well informed in regard to existing conditions.\n\nI would like to call your attention to the correspondence and interviews with officers of the Department of Indian Affairs concerning Christian Island during the last three years.\n\nOn September 24th, 1931, a letter was written to Dr. Arthur Barner, our Superintendent of Indian Missions, informing us that an officer of the Department had recently returned from Christian Island and reported that several improvements were necessary if progress was to be achieved; namely, a new school building; a fully qualified teacher in place of Mr. Joblin, who was our nominee at that time; and a second teacher.\n\nIn the second paragraph of this letter, you will find a proposal that we should consider an undenominational school of two classrooms. If you will take the time to read the correspondence and to discuss the question with the men who are still in the Department of Indian Education and who were there at that time, you will recognize that the response of the United Church to these suggestions was sincere and co-operative; and on June 15th, Mr. Barner wrote to the Department nominating Rev. Carl C. Dean as the missionary-teacher and said:\n\n\"This nomination is made in response to the request of the Department for a young man to take charge of the work on Christian Island. When the time comes for the appointment of a second teacher, we shall be glad to co-operate with you.\"\n\nFrom time to time as I visited Ottawa, I impressed upon the Department the necessity of a second teacher, and each time I was informed that there was a Treasury Board ruling rendering it impossible to make new appointments. Imagine our surprise when we...\nsuddenly received a communication from Mr. Vernon Morris, announcing that he had been appointed second teacher at Christian Island. This is not exactly our conception of co-operation.\n\nThat Mr. Dean has made a great success of his work on the Island needs no comment. The very fact that for the first time in the history of the school there were pupils in an entrance class speaks eloquently of the confidence which the Indians have come to have in him and his leadership.\n\nIn view of this history, we were certainly unprepared for your communication of September 28th, informing us that the pupils were being separated according to denominational affiliation; that a Roman Catholic teacher was being appointed, etc. Evidently, the price of sincere co-operation with the Department of Indian Affairs at the present time in the improvement of personnel and teaching methods is to be completely disregarded. The more earnestly one tries to improve the technique and efficiency of the educational work under the direction of the United Church, the less he is consulted about changes which are in contemplation by the Department.\n\nI wish to state emphatically that, if the Chief and Councillors of Christian Island have come to the conclusion that in justice to the minority there should be one Roman Catholic teacher, the United Church would welcome the opportunity of co-operating in a public school where, for example, the new appointee would teach the junior grades and the present teacher, Mr. Dean, the senior grades, the pupils being separated for half an hour a day according to denominational affiliation for religious instruction. As it is at present, Mr. Dean finds himself left with 44 children in 11 classes and cannot possibly teach successfully the course of study outlined by the Ontario Department of Education.\n\nI realise that it is probably too late to protest, but I speak for the Board of Home Missions of the United Church when I say that we feel very keenly the injustice of the method which has been followed in the making of these changes at Christian Island.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nRe: Christian Island Indian Day School.\n\nI desire to make formal application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the appointment of a second teacher to the United Church Day School on Christian Island, and submit the following for your consideration:\n\n(1) The present teacher, Rev. C. C. Dean, has forty-four children in eleven classes, making quite impossible any kind of effective work. If the Department will look into the records, they will discover that this is twice the number who were attending the school when Mr. Dean was appointed three years ago and is a great tribute to his work as a teacher. He had high hopes of getting some pupils through the Entrance this year, - the first time such a thing has happened on Christian Island, - but that will be impossible unless he can get assistance.\n\n(2) If the teacher appointed is a woman, accommodation can be provided for her in the United Church minister's residence, now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Daan. We should have this new teacher on the ground at the beginning of the next term, and it may require a little time to find someone who we can be sure will be compatible.\n\n(3) We will make application to the Chief and Councillors for the use of the Council House, and if they refuse, the class can begin in the Young Men's Club Room, which was fitted up in the basement of the church last year. The room is well heated and for a small group of children, the lighting will be adequate.\n\n(4) Mr. Dean is feeling quite discouraged over the changes which have been made recently in the establishment of a separate school on the Island. The Department and the United Church have few persons in the service who are as efficient and conscientious as he is. I very greatly fear that we shall lose him unless we can decrease the additional teaching responsibility which has suddenly devolved upon him. When he went to Christian Island and the school was small, he could manage fairly well, but as the number of pupils increased and the quality of the work done improved, his influence in the community also grew, so that the calls upon him for other forms of community service are continually increasing. It would\nbe a great pity if we should lose him.\n\nHoping that the Department will give serious and immediate consideration to this very reasonable request,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nDecember 14, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, requesting the appointment of a second teacher to the United Church Indian Day School on Christian Island.\n\nIn this connection I would say that I am referring your request to the Honourable the Superintendent General, with the recommendation that he approve the appointment of a second teacher as from January first, next.

A. Allan\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Day School, Christian Island, Ontario.\n\nI regret to inform you that it has been found necessary to transfer Rev. C. C. Dean, who for the last three years has been senior teacher in the Indian Day School at Christian Island, to another appointment. As his successor I desire to nominate Mr. H. S. Rawlings. Mr. Rawlings has had four years' teaching experience - two years at Blind River, Ontario, and two years in the Entrance room of one of the largest public schools in London, Ontario. He holds a permanent second-class certificate now, but will be able, by taking a couple of courses at the Summer School at the University of Toronto next year, to secure his first-class standing. During his period of service at Blind River, he taught a number of Indian and Half-breed children and is intensely interested in the whole problem of Indian education.\n\nMrs. Rawlings, who was formerly Miss Helen Roberts, R.N., will undoubtedly be a great help in the work to which they are giving themselves. I have met Mr. and Mrs. Rawlings personally and have checked carefully both their character and professional references and feel satisfied that they will be worthy successors of Mr. and Mrs. Dean.\n\nMiss Mabel Nesbitt, the present teacher of the Junior Room, will continue during the coming academic year.\n\nI would greatly appreciate an almost immediate answer regarding this nomination, as it will be much to the advantage of Mr. and Mrs. Rawlings to have a week or two at Christian Island with the Deans before they leave.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReverend C. C. Dean, senior teacher of the United Church Indian Day School on the Christian Island Indian Reserve (No. 30 - Electoral District of Simcoe East) is giving up duties at the end of the present school year.\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the school is conducted, nominate the services of Mr. H. S. Rawlings. He has had four years' teaching experience and holds a permanent second class certificate for the province of Ontario. His wife, who would accompany him, is a registered nurse and will, no doubt, be of great help in the work among the Indian homes on the reserve. The salary rating for this position is $85 per teaching month.\n\nI would appreciate your concurrence in the appointment of Mr. Rawlings as senior teacher for the coming school year at the Christian Island United Church Indian Day School.

Nesbitt,\nChristian Island,\nOnt.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDecember 10th,\n1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Christian Island Indian Day School\n\nI would like to call the attention of the Government to the great need of a new day school for the housing of the United Church children on Christian Island. This matter has been under discussion between the Church and the Department of Indian Affairs for at least six years. When I first discussed it with Mr. Russell Ferrier, the Superintendent of Indian Education, he asked me not to press the matter, in order that the Government might have time to explore the possibility of building a two-roomed school which would be directly under the Department. He said he was well aware that the old building which is now being used as the junior classroom was no credit to the Government.\n\nWhen the additional teacher was later appointed, we made temporary arrangements with the Chief and Council to house the senior class in the Council House. The arrangement is unsatisfactory for reasons which are self-evident.\n\nWe understand that the Government is now proceeding to build for the minority group on Christian Island a new school and teacherage. The idea of establishing a school which would be directly under the Department has therefore been definitely abandoned. It is obviously unfair that the Church which has given religious leadership to the Indians on Christian Island for more than a hundred years and conducted a day school for their children for many years before the Department of Indian Affairs assumed any responsibility for the teacher's salary, should be expected to accept the type of accommodation which has been provided for its classrooms, on the plea that the Government has no money to erect new buildings, while the minority group, whose presence on the Island is of comparatively recent date, should be able to secure a new school building and teacherage. This is not a criticism of the decision to build a school for the minority. Once the decision has been made to appoint a teacher they are undoubtedly entitled to the necessary building and equipment.\nI am therefore writing to ask, on behalf of the United Church, that in the Estimates which are presented to Parliament for the fiscal year, beginning April 1st, an amount should be included for a new two-roomed school and teacherage on Christian Island. I think the way in which we have carried on for several years under the handicaps mentioned above is an indication of our willingness to co-operate with the Department of Indian Affairs, but we are firmly convinced that the time has come when for this and other reasons, which need not be enumerated, we ought to have a new building. This is particularly true in view of the fact that the Government now apparently has money to spend on new buildings.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJBsMLT\nOttawa, December 15, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, pointing out the necessity of a new school for the United Church Indian children on the Christian Island Reserve.\n\nProvision is being made in our estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38 for the erection of a new United Church school on this Reserve. It is hoped that this item in our estimates will be approved by Parliament, and, if so, the work will proceed next summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Joblin\nto the Prime Minister,\nNovember 26th, 1936.\n\n\"I explained to you that having given my life to the work of Missionary Teacher among the Indians, I had no special preparation for any other work, and when left without a position, or any provision for the future after twenty-two years service, I began working out on farms and have been following that work for the past five years.\n\n\"I don't object to hard work, but at my age, being over fifty, it is rather strenuous, and the wages are so small that only the bare necessities of life can be had. This year there is a doctor's bill of twenty-five dollars to pay, and our eleven year old lad (our only child) requires work done to his teeth which the dentist says will cost around thirty dollars. Professional men don't seem to realize that a poor man can't afford to pay the prices they demand.\n\n\"I have education enough for any ordinary position and there must be plenty of jobs in the gift of the Government that I could do acceptably. With my experience with the Indians I could have qualified admirably for the position of Indian Agent on some Reservation but the Department was not willing to give me any such chance.\n\n\"I would much prefer working if any suitable work can be had, but if not, don't you think some sort of yearly allowance could be arranged, because teaching in Government schools did not place one in line for the usual pension or superannuation.\"\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDR.

The Truant Officer, teachers and myself are endeavouring to secure a better attendance at the schools but so far have not met with any decided success.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nAgent, in Charge.\nSchools closed at the end of June. All the teachers have signified their intention to continue for the next school term commencing on October 1st, 1940. The attendance at the Bay schools was very low in June due to the fact that parents in many cases went off the reserve to work and took their children with them. All three of the day school teachers are planning on taking a summer course this summer. The Inspector of the United Church school was apparently unable to get across the Bay when he got to Cedar Point. This was on account of the large waves. As a result, no inspection was made of the U.C. school during the past term.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON CHRISTIAN ISLD.

They have taken their children with them thus effecting the school attendance considerably. I expect this to become even more serious next month. However it has its compensations. Indian children are brought into contact with white people and benefit considerably by it.\n\nH.S. Rawlings\nActing Indian Agent.\nDr. G. E.

Moore,  \nActing Supt. of Medical Services,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nRe-educational system at Christian Island.\n\nIn my opinion, the extensive sickness on Christian Island is due to malnutrition. The inhabitants seem helpless and do not sufficiently exert themselves to help themselves. I do not suppose anything much can be done to help the adults but it seems to me that a change in the educational system would help the children. The present system of teaching is similar to that in other parts of the province and I doubt if it is adapted to the Indians who are mentally under-par. I have studied the educational system used in the Mental Hospital for children at Orillia. It is very practical and helps the children to make a living for themselves. I feel sure that, if we procured a teacher from the Orillia Mental Hospital, the children would become an asset rather than a liability as they are now.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGET: EA\n\n(DR. G.E. TANNER)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6123, File 384-1, part 3)\nOttawa, October 6, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Tanner:\n\nYour letter of the first instant, addressed to Dr. Moore, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I appreciate very fully your interest in the educational courses provided at the Christian Island Indian day schools and your anxiousness to have these courses improved.\n\nWe intimated, in a circular sent out about three years ago, that at least one third of the regular study period should be devoted to vocational instruction and it is gratifying to be able to report that most of our teachers have brought their courses of study into conformity with our wishes.\n\nI am reasonably familiar with the courses of study provided at mental hospitals and at the institutions established for the care of subnormal boys and girls, and I am aware also that these courses of study have been improved during the last five or six year period. I am not at all sure, however, that it would be wise to adopt such a course at any of our schools until a careful survey had been made by a psychiatrist of the I.Q. standing of the pupils. If the teachers in charge of the schools at Christian Island are sufficiently interested, they will experience little difficulty in securing the services of an official of the Ontario Department of Education to make -\n\nDr. G. E. Tanner,\nPhysician and Surgeon,\nMidland, Ont.\nmake this test. The educational authorities at Toronto should be approached through the local inspectors; or, if the teachers so desire, we might undertake the negotiations from here.\n\nI am sending forward, for your information, excerpts from Inspectors' reports recently received by the Department. These reports will give you a fair idea of what is being accomplished at other Indian day schools throughout the country.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nR. A.

The Agency boat is not operating due to engine trouble. Agent was advised to have it towed to the mainland and to obtain prices to have it put in order submitting same to Ottawa for approval.

They have suggested that possibly they may be able to get away some time around the 16th of March, returning to again take up their work on 26th.\n\nAs they have pointed out in their letter, that master is always hard to get out and in, particularly when the it comes in early April.\n\nI see no reason why we cannot conform to this request, and would recommend your approval.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. M. Hurle\nOttawa, February 9, 1945.\n\nMr. G. E. Hurley, Acting Indian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to allowing the teachers of the Christian Island Schools to take the Easter holiday leave in March, rather than at the regular time, owing to travelling conditions to and from the island.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Department does not favour taking holidays at other than the prescribed times. Part of the object in operating schools on a reserve is to train the children in matters of punctuality and make them recognize that fair rules, issued for the guidance of all, must be followed. To allow special favours, such as that requested by the teachers of the Christian Island schools, makes it appear to the Indians as if we are operating the schools for the benefit of the teachers rather than for the benefit of the pupils. With these thoughts in mind, I am extremely sorry that the teachers saw fit to ask for this special privilege. However, if they so desire, they may take the Easter holiday period during the dates mentioned in your letter, on the distinct understanding that they will be back on duty on March 26.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI hesitate to complain, and I really do not intend to do so. But I feel that it is my responsibility to report this matter. For some time I have felt that all is not well with things at the United Church School.\n\nThis came to a climax when I read to Mr. Stephens your letter regarding the vacation period allowed for Easter. He more or less feels that he confering an honour upon the Dept. by teaching here, and said that the job doesn't a thing to him; this remark was brought about when I pointed out to him the necessity of punctuality being taught Indians.\n\nHe has never been very particular about starting on time, nor does he allow the children their regular recess time. Just yesterday I was coming past the school, when he called me in to discuss a little matter, the children were still out playing. I asked him what time it was; it was then 3:20 PM. I drew this to his attention, and he made some remark about the children doing something and had detained him from calling them back to their work, all I could see them doing was that some were playing cards.\n\nI really believe that he is satisfied, but Mrs. Stephens is not at all so, she misses the social life, and quite frankly say so.\n\nI realize the difficulty of replacement of teachers, but surely there is someone that is familiar with Indians, and Indian education that we could employ.\n\nI have hesitated for some time to make this report, but when one comes out and distinctly states that a job doesn't mean a thing, what other inference is one to arrive at, than that they are not satisfied with the position.\n\nI am making this report with the idea in mind, that if you deem it advisable for a change to be made, you will have ample to do so.\n\nWe have two children of our own going to school, and naturally we are anxious to have them get an education. I know that you will treat this as confidential.\n\nG. E. Hurl, A/Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have also decided that we should set up a monthly report card system. This would give me closer check on those that are not regular attendants at school.\n\nThen I sent in the family allowance forms I left them all payable to the individuals, I felt that they should be given a chance, then if they continue to transgress, I will then notify the Allowance board to have the checks forwarded for administration through the office.\n\nG.

I realize that my lack of normal school training has made it more difficult for me to cope with the peculiarities of Indian school teaching, such as the isolation from resource material and the lack of appreciation of education in the home. I feel that it would not be fair to the pupils here for me to stay on if there is a possibility or a trained and experienced teacher for them.\n\nHowever, I would not like to see the children without a teacher next year; so, if a qualified teacher is not available, you might get in touch with me prior to the reopening of school, and I would again consider the matter very carefully.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Isabel Alexander.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nChristian Island Indian Day School\n\nWe have received the attached letter of resignation from Miss Isabel Alexander, teacher of the above school.\n\nFurther to our discussion of recent date, would you please nominate a replacement teacher for the September term.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Dean, teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School, was ill during part of the December quarter, and, while he was absent from the school, Mr. Vernon H. Morris was employed as substitute teacher for 22 days (November 6th to November 27th). Authority for Mr. Morris' engagement was received from the office of the Superintendent General.\n\nIn the case of a teacher who has been in our employ more than a year, it has been the practice of the Department, in the past, to allow reasonable sick leave with pay. No definite length of sick leave has ever been adopted, and, in the majority of cases in the past, when a teacher has been sick, the school has remained closed and no substitute engaged.\n\nIn view of our past procedure, I consider that Mr. Dean should be paid in full for the December quarter, and I would appreciate your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the outside of the room, they have two rows of single desks about six or eight inches apart. Instead of seven rows as now, they could have four outside rows having 9 desks and 2 rows having 4 or 5 desks each. Chairs are a poor substitute for backs.\nOttawa, June 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Christian Island Indian Day School, states that the seating can be greatly improved by a re-arrangement of the desks. He states that, instead of seven rows of desks as at present, the desks should be arranged in four outside rows, each having nine desks, and two rows in the centre, having four or five desks in each, and that, when the desks are so arranged, rear seats should be provided.\n\nI have to request that, during the coming summer holidays, you will have the desks re-arranged, as recommended by the Inspector. After this has been done, please inform the Department of the size of each rear desk in each row and also the name of the manufacturer of the desks, when the Department will consider ordering six rear seats - one for each row of desks. The name of the manufacturer of the desks will, no doubt, be stamped in the metal part of the desk, as well as the size of the rear desk in each row. The Inspector states that the present seating arrangement is little better than double desks; as on the outside of the room there are two rows about 6 or 8 inches apart.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You should see that a good grade of the full quantity of wood is supplied, and the cost should not exceed approximately $4.50 per cord.\n\nPlease arrange to see that the lavatories in connection with this school are thoroughly cleaned and any repairs required to same carried out before the school reopens. Please keep any cost in connection with the repairs, etc., as low as possible.\n\nThe Department will approve of you supplying strips of wood to fasten to the bottom of the desks. It is noted that you consider the cost of these strips would not exceed $5 and the labour in fastening the desks to the strips would be a nominal amount.\n\nIn rearranging the seating in the classroom, we would refer you to official letter of June 13th, last, regarding the suggestion of the Public School Inspector that these desks be arranged in four outside rows, each having nine desks, and two rows in the centre, having four or five desks in each.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the wood and also covering the cost of repairing and cleaning the lavatories and for the strips of wood and fastening the desks thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The purchase of this equipment was made necessary because of the fact that since the appointment of Mr Vernon Morris as assistant teacher, eleven new beginners have been added to the school roll, making the total now on the register sixty nine, forty four are of junior grades and are taught by Mr Morris in the School house, the remaining twenty five are of senior grades and taught by the principle Mr Dean in the Community Hall. Owing to the increase in the number of pupils all desks with the exception of seven are now in use in the school house. The object of securing tables was that, the hall is constantly in used for community purposes after school hours and tables could be moved away better than desks which would have to be screwed to the floor, each table accommodates five pupils. With reference to the cupboard this is very necessary as there is no suitable cupboard room in the hall, and as there are numerous books and other small equipment which have to be looked after carefully it is essential that they be put away at the end of each day and locked up in a safe place. In the event of a new school being built at Christian Island at some future date this equipment could be transferred and used to advantage.

It is hoped that no trouble will develop on the part of the Catholic members of the Band, due to the use of the hall.\n\nAn order is being placed for the forwarding of a number of school desks, a teacher's desk and chair to your address, Penetang, Ont., as requested on the requisition. Further, an order is being forwarded the Government Stationery Office to send, addressed to the teacher, Christian Island, Ont., the classroom material considered necessary.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of one water pail and one axe, forwarding a certified account, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the cupboard for books, etc., it is considered that it would be cheaper for you to have a cupboard made, locally. You may purchase any material required. It is not necessary that any large expense be incurred. A suitable lock should be installed. When the cupboard has been completed, you should forward an account, in the usual manner, for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. A.

Mr. Deas.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 17/\n\nMr. Churchill\n\nThis was returned with the draft letter to Mr. Starr.\n\nDo you want it for your files?\n\nK.O.\nOttawa, June 14, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Starr:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the request of the Indians of the Christian Island Band, for the erection of a two-roomed school building and teachers' residence, for the benefit of the Indian children whose parents are members of the United Church of Canada.\n\nOwing to pressing demands for the erection of school buildings, on reserves where there is no provision for educational facilities, it was not found possible to provide the funds required to erect a new school building for the Protestant children at Christian Island. It is intended to erect a building for the Roman Catholic children, as there are no adequate school facilities for the children of that faith.\n\nWhile the present school facilities for the Protestant children are also inadequate, yet, I would point out that this school has been carrying on under similar conditions for several years, and their requirements are not so pressing as in the case of the Catholic school. The need of a new two-roomed school building for the Protestant children will be kept in mind and an effort made to obtain the funds necessary to erect a suitable building when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are in course of preparation. We were unable to obtain any part of the appropriation under the Public Works Construction Act to carry out a building programme which included the erection of a school for the Protestant children at Christian Island.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Gordon in Penetang. He promised me that he would pay all this when the cheque comes.\n\nYours Truly,\nSylvester Cofipegorq\nDear Sir,\n\nAm enclosing a letter brought to the office by Sylvester Copegog as he claims he has no right to pay order held against him by Mr Gendron at Penetang as Mr Allen was to square it up for these trips he took him to town. No doubt Mr Allen's expense sheet for these months Jan and Feb 1935 will show whether Copegog was ever paid for these trips or not. I hate to doubt a man's word but it is hard to believe all the things that Mr Allen did not do. I have looked the old voucher record and find no record of a voucher for these trips so no doubt they were put on the travelling expense. What would you advise in this matter?\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

To this you should attach an itemized statement showing the goods he supplied to Copegog. This account should be signed by Copegog, acknowledging receipt of the goods. You should, also, attach the order issued by the former Agent to Marsden.\n\nA similar voucher may be prepared in favour of S. R. Gendron.

Omitted to mention above that the roof also needs a little repair.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 24th, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the request of the Christian Island Council for payment of rent for the Council Hall for the period it has been used as a school.\n\nThe Department has made no provision in the current year's appropriation for payment of rent for this building. The Council's request, therefore, cannot receive favourable consideration. As a matter of fact, it was understood at the time the second classroom was established that no rent would be charged for the use of the Council Hall.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.

King\nSecretary Howard King\n\nCarried\nDear Sir,\n\nAm enclosing Resolution of Christian Island Council requesting that the site for new School be changed. The site now chosen is a very satisfactory one, where the children will not be playing in the blazing hot sun all day but have a few shade trees and lots of ground for even a school garden which I hope to interest them in. Of course it will be a little farther for some of the Councilors' children to walk but it will make it a lot closer for some of the farmer's children and it is on the farms we want these people not sitting down in the village doing nothing. As far as I can see the more encouragement the farmer is given the more we are going to get out on their farms. I recommend that the site be left, the one already chosen. As far as the water not being fit to use, the Agency is just as close to cemetery as the school will be and the water here is pure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The bell now on the old school could be transferred to the new one with very little cost but the belfry should be built right away before the building progresses much further. Could the engineering department be asked to add this as an extra it should not cost more than $100.00. The bell on the school is a benefit to the whole community as it is the only means of marking time during weekdays and will be sorely missed.

When completed it will provide a quite\nmodern type of accommodation for the teacher and pupils.\nI was particularly pleased with the splendid lighting\nfacilities, and the provision for cloak-rooms.\n\nMore blackboard space would be an advantage, I consider;\nand I do not think that adequate provision has been made for\nproper ventilation. The Teacher's desk set on a platform\nis not in conformity with modern Educational thought, and it\nis most regrettable that better play-ground facilities have\nnot been provided. I am rather disappointed, too, that\nbasement rooms have not been provided where, besides affording\na playroom in inclement weather, provision could be made for\ninstruction in handicrafts, cooking, sewing, manual training,\netc. It is my conviction that the objectives of educational\neffort in this community should be to train the boys and girls\nto meet the ordinary problems of living, rather than to drill\nscholastic formulae which they will probably never use.\nEX'D.\n\nNovember 18, 1937.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Wardle.\n\nFrom reports received from our School Inspector it would appear to be necessary to have the following changes made in plans prepared in the future for our Indian Day Schools.\n\n1.

Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, to have a door cut between the two classrooms in the U.C. school. This has been needed since the school was built as it has always been necessary for teachers and pupils to get to either classroom by going through the Residence or around the outside; both were very inconvenient.\n\nIt seems reasonable to expect that the door would cost in the neighbourhood of $8 to $10. Then, of course, there would be the door frame, and the labour for putting it in. I would say that the approximate cost would be $20.00.\n\nIn checking the condition of the school I find that there are other minor repairs needed which should be done at the same time \u2014 such repairs as to window leaks, door locks etc. Only in one case has any damage been due to a pupil and that was only a small window in the toilet house.\n\nI would estimate that the entire cost including labour, would not exceed $30.00, and I would recommend making the necessary repairs.\n\nI trust that The Dep't will see fit to grant the above-mentioned expenditure and that authority may be given as soon as possible so that the work may be done during the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Br.,\nOttawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Indian Agent, Christian Island,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(1942)\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEach year it has been the custom for the Teachers of our schools to make hot Cocoa drinks for the children during the winter months. We have felt that this procedure is splendid in that the hot drink each morning seems to give the children the much-needed energy.\n\nI would recommend that, if possible, hot drinks be again granted from now until Easter.\n\nEstimation of supplies are as follows:\n\n3 tins canned milk (condensed) per day\n25 lbs. cocoa per month\n30 lbs. sugar per month\n3 lbs. salt for flavouring entire period\n\n(The above estimations are for all three schoolrooms, supplies would be divided accordingly)\n\nCondensed milk is preferable at approximately $10 per can, because of sanitation --- also as a general rule there is not enough extra fresh milk on the Island to supply the schools each day.\n\nI would suggest that 100 lb. bag of sugar be purchased and if any were left over it could be kept for the next winter. The cocoa may be purchased in bulk.\n\nI trust that the Dep't. will see fit to grant this expenditure.\n\nI am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\nChristian Island, Ont.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Br.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant the Department approves serving a hot drink at the Christian Island U.C. and Christian Island R.C.

It is extremely difficult to secure this type of equipment at the present time and it has occurred to me that there may possibly be an Indian on the Christian Island Reserve who could erect a suitable table and two benches. You may purchase the material required and make the necessary arrangements to have an Indian do this work. The cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

School\nJanuary until Easter - Christie Island\n\n3\u00bd cases canned milk (168 tins, large)\n18 lbs. Cocoa\n30 lbs. sugar\n1 box salt\n\nH.G. Cowan\nR. C. School\nDec. 1st, 1942\n\nDear Mr. Hurl:\nWe would like to have school on Saturday so as to finish up the school term on the 18th, in case we have a chance to go across for a few days. Will that be O.K. with you?\n\n2. We will need stove wood in a very few days.\n\n3. If the children are given cocoa from Jan. 4th to the 1st. of April or until Easter. We will need at least 62 cans of milk (allowing one can for each school day) 5 or 6 pounds of cocoa, and about 30 pounds of\nsugar. That allows 1/2 pounds of sugar per child over the three months. I think this would be the least we could do with for the children.\n\nNow, about the split peas, you could do what you think best. If you think the children should have them, Sister will be glad to prepare the soup. We leave it to your judgment.\n\nSincerely \u2014\nSister Agnes Black\nChristian Island, Jan 26, 1943\n\nThe Secretary Indian Affairs Branch Dept., Mines & Resources\n\nI am informed that it is the custom to provide some noon day drinks for the school children for the winter months. I will inclose for your consideration the lists which I have received from Mr. Cowan and Sister Black.\n\nI presume I will have to be given special permission to buy the sugar requirements.\n\nThis would mean that we would need:\n- 5 cases of milk\n- 50 lbs. Sugar\n- 24 lbs. Cocoa\n- 2 boxes of salt\n- 10 lbs. Split peas\n\nYour early reply is anticipated.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1943.\n\nEXD.\n\nMr. G.E. Hurl, Acting Indian Agent, Christian Island, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to providing a hot drink at the Christian Island R.C. School. It has been our custom to supply a hot drink at both the Christian Island R.C. and the Christian Island U.C. Schools for the months of January, February and March. You may do so this year and purchase the quantities of milk, sugar, cocoa, salt and split peas that you believe are needed at both schools. The total cost of these articles last year was in the vicinity of $40.00 and the expenditure this year should not exceed this amount by any large sum.\n\nR.A.
