C.\n\nRe: Repairs - Kitwanga Day School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in which you intimate that the cost of the repairs necessary at the above-noted school will amount to approximately $127.58. Although this is substantially more than the amount we had in mind when we authorized you to proceed with this work in our letter of July 19, we nevertheless feel that the repairs should be undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nI must express regret that we seem to find it impossible to proceed with repairs at Indian day schools until the approach of the opening date each year. The fact that we undertake repairs from time to time with the school in operation must, of necessity, result in certain hardships and inconveniences to the teacher in charge. Would it be possible for you to circularize your agents with respect to this matter and have a list of the repairs necessary at our day schools sent forward to the Department early in June of each year? Your consideration of this suggestion would be very much appreciated.\n\nR. A.

Just why some Agents fail to make\nthis a regular practice is difficult to understand as it is\nobviously the proper time to do the work and there is usually\nmore opportunity for the Agent to give the necessary super-\nvision then than when the schools are in session. Of course,\nbuilding materials continue to be difficult to obtain and this\nmay sometimes be the reason for delay in having repairs made.\n\nIt seems to me that in order to get the desired\naction, this office should establish the practice of instructing\nall Agents in the month of May each year to send in their\nrequisitions for school repairs, based on the provision made\nin their annual estimates for such expenditures, and arrangements\nwill be made accordingly.\n\nD.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n18th instant, the Department approves an\nexpenditure of $20 for repairs at the Kitwanga\nDay School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nFurther to my letter of June 2nd, regarding the alterations and improvements recommended by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. T. F. Robson, to the Kitwanga Indian Day School building, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letter of July 3rd wherein authority is requested for an expenditure of $20.00 to cover the cost of materials and labour in blocking up the windows facing the pupils and the installation of the new blackboards which were supplied last year.\n\nExtensive repairs were made to this building last year but, due to the excessive costs of labour, the funds provided were insufficient for this work. While no provision was made in the Estimates for the expenditure, the application is recommended for your approval if funds are available.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nD.M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYour file - 1-11-5\nRe - Kitwanga I.D. School\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 2nd, I wish to advise that two pieces of blackboard were received by this school and were to have been installed over part of the windows facing the pupils.\n\nThe estimated cost of installing the ceiling was also to include the blocking up of the windows and the installing of the blackboards. Due to the length of time taken by the Indian of putting in the new ceiling, entrance porch and steps, there was no money left for the windows and blackboards.\n\nI would estimate the cost of materials and labour in blocking up the windows and hanging the blackboards about $20.00 and I would make application for this amount.\n\nAs to Mr. School Inspector Robson's recommendation for cloakroom accommodation at this school, it will be necessary to extend the school building, the cost of which might be considerable. I am therefore listing the alterations and interior decorations to the school in the 1944-45 Estimates.\n\nI enclose as requested the daily attendance of the last school term to June 14th.\n\nS.

It is realized that the cost of materials and labour is a good deal more than anticipated but as Kitwanga is some distance away, it was impossible to personally supervise the construction of these toilets. However, after a recent visit to the Kitwanga Indian Day School, School Inspector Davey assured me that the buildings are of excellent appearance, being sturdily constructed, painted, and roofed with proper roofing material. Vouchers covering the cost of materials are attached hereto. The two Indians employed to construct the toilets are now awaiting payment.

W. Morrow, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn behalf of the Methodist Church I beg leave to apply for a grant for the China Hat Indian Day School to you and through you to the Indian Department.\n\nAs you understand all the circumstances connected with the said school, I hope that you will be able to recommend this application to the favorable notice of the Department. Our desire is to do the best we can for the benefit of the children and should the grant be given it will be an incentive to increased efficiency in that direction.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. Whittington.\nOTTAWA, 29th May, 1905\n\nR. 4 623\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant I beg to say that provision is made in the estimates for 1905-6 for the salary of a teacher for the China Hat school, and if this school is in operation the grant will be available on the 1st July next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, May 20th, 1905.\n\nFile No. 262,481.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, dated the 12th instant, received from Mr. Agent Morrow, of the North West Coast Agency, covering an application dated the 13th of July, 1904, addressed to him by Rev. Dr. Whittington, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Missions in B. C. for the usual grant for a teacher's salary at the Indian day school in the China Hat village. It will be observed that the Agent recommends that the request be complied with provided the Methodist Church authorities will undertake to complete the building lately erected. I think the suggestion a good one and would ask that a grant be provided on that understanding. For the information of the Department I may state that the China Hat school has been in operation for a lengthy term of years without assistance of any kind from the Department and is quite deserving of the aid now asked to encourage the teacher in his good work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose you herewith an application in duplicate, from the Rev Dr Whittington dated July 13th/1904, requesting that the Department of Indian affairs make a grant to the China Hat Indian day school, which school is under the direction of the Rev George Edgar.\n\nOwing to this school building not being finished on my last visit to this reserve, and having some doubts as to the attendance of children at school, I have held Dr Whittington's application pending further information considered necessary till the present time.\n\nA short time ago I made application to the Department for a grant to purchase material, for the completion of this building, but same did not meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nTo-day I have the honour to mail you school returns which I have just received for Dec./04 and March/05 quarters, and in looking over same find the attendance fully equal to that of other small schools, in view of which, I beg to recommend that a grant be allowed this school, providing Rev Dr Whittington will undertake to complete the building, which I have no doubt he will if the grant is made and dates as in the case of the grant made to the Hartley Bay school from Oct 1st/04.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6399, File 825-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from Mr. George Read, who has been teaching the day school at China Hat. Mr. Read asks that his daughter Harriet be permitted to take his place in the school room, as he himself is getting old and worn out. I know Miss Read, and think she is quite capable of fulfilling the duties of teaching this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo whom it may concern\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to state, that, it was an error on my part, when I sent in to you last quarterly school returns ending Sep 30th 1914, for the Day school here. My daughter alone did all the teaching for the few days that the school was open after the pupils with their parents had returned from the salmon canneries.\n\nHowever, I did something during that same quarter. I repaired the roof; and painted the schoolhouse throughout, and got a sufficient supply of firewood on hand to last the school for the whole of the winter.\n\nI trust that both The Government and The church will agree for my daughter to teach the school here in my place, she was 20 years old last July, even though she is inexperienced; and has gone no further in her own studies than to pass through The Public school in Victoria. Her parents I am confident would assist her in any difficult teaching as far has we are able, so that the pupils would not suffer. Dear Sir, my reason for writing thus, is, I have been laboring among the Indians of this Province in connection with The Methodist Church nearly 27 years, and wherever I have been stationed I have had the Day school to attend to, and has a result; I must confess that my nerves are greatly shattered, my sight impaired, and I am wrecked physically. I have been sorely handicapped from infancy with my sight, I never remember seeing with one eye, and the other greatly hampered by a large cataract growing over the sight.\n\nDear Sir, Pardon me for writing so, but I thought it my duty.\nto explain matters a little. You too, will also agree that when people are afflicted and getting on in years they are very apt to seem ingly without cause; to get irritable. Children need patient and forbearing teachers, yes. Indian children too.\n\nWishing you and yours every blessing and prosperity during 1915 and always,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nGeorge Read\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of November 20th No 262481/1: re teacher at China Hat-\n\nGeorge Reade who has been missionary there for some time has been removed and Mr. Edgar has been appointed with the understanding that he was not only missionary but was responsible for the oversight and welfare of the school; his daughter whom I believe is well qualified to teach the school is Mrs. S. J. Preston, and I understand that she has been charge assisting her father since the first of October, the date upon which Mr. Reade completed his work.

Morris, teacher of the Klemtu Indian Day School. I fear that the break in her service will seriously affect anything that can be done in her case. Her five years' service with the Alberni and Pile Hills Residential Schools cannot be counted, as she was not even classed as a temporary Civil Servant at that time. Strictly, she was an employee of the Church. There was a three year break between 1919 and 1922, when she was not in Indian work, and then she left Kispiox in December, 1928 and did not take up duties at Klemtu until September, 1929. The Superannuation and Retirement Act refers always to continuous service. She has been at Klemtu for three years, and the Department regrets that all that can be done for her will be one month's salary upon retirement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMay 11th, 1932.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier, M.A.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nWhen I was with you in the month of March I promised to secure from Miss Morrice of Klemtu a statement regarding her years of service with the Department. I am therefore giving you the following extract from a letter which she has written dated April 27th. This will enable you to decide what can be done for her when she leaves Klemtu at the end of June.\n\n\"You ask regarding my years in the Indian Work.\nAlberni Boarding School 1910\nFile Hills Boarding School 1911,12,13,14.\nWhite Bear Indian School 1918-1919.\nKisploex and Skeena Crossing 1922-1928 (inclusive)\nKlemtu 1929 up to present time.\n\nIn 1914 I left File Hills to take furlough but as I wished to get my certificate made permanent I applied to Regina to attend Normal School there. I was advised by Mr. McKechnie, who had been my teacher in Belleville High School, to take a white school for 1915 and enter Normal 1916 which I did, at close of Normal I returned to Carnbrogie as only by getting favorable report of teaching by Inspector of white school would my certificate be ratified. I taught there till close of end of 1917 and received favorable report. I was then called home to help care for my brother. Then I spent all of 1918-19 in Indian work at White Bear leaving there to have an operation on my eyes for trouble caused by looking after infected eyes at File Hills. By advice of local physician I had been using blue stone and every time the trouble returned I used bluestone, till the lens thickened and I could not see, so I had operation first on left eye and when the left eye was entirely well had one on the right eye. There being\nno opening for me then in Indian work I again in 1921 taught in white school at Crichton, Saskatchewan. My brother-in-law then wrote asking me to come to my sister who was suffering from cancer. When she was some better I went to Kipling at request of Mr. Cairns and you are aware of my doings since.\n\nHaving taught steadily you might say I should have saved enough to look after myself but my two operations cost $600 (including paying two doctors and twice in hospital) my Normal cost slightly over $300 and two years ago I used all I had saved since to pay mortgage off the house or my sister with whom I make my home. My other sister got out of work just a month after I paid it off and since then Nov. 1929 I have had largely to keep them as well as pay my own expenses.\"\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner\n\nAB:JGA.\nOttawa, June 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the request of Miss Lillie Morrice, teacher of the Klemtu Indian Day School, for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Miss Morrice is in receipt of salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month, and this compares favourably with the salaries paid to teachers in the other Indian day schools in your agency. As you are doubtless aware, this school is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, and we look to the church authorities for recommendations for increases. Our appropriation was greatly reduced this year and I therefore regret that we will be unable to consider increases in salaries of teachers. It is noted that Miss Morrice does not intend to resign and will remain as teacher at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Pougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report the receipt of letter from Miss Lillie Morrice, teacher at Klemtu, dated 21st inst., from which is quoted:\n\n\"I would be very glad if you would recommend that my salary be increased. I have a professional second grade certificate which permits me to teach in a white school where my salary would be much larger. In the Chrichton school in Saskatchewan in 1921 I received \u00a3400.00; in Kispiox Indian school I was receiving \u00a31000.00; six months before I came here.\"\n\nMiss Morrice also states that she does not intend to resign; and that the reason for her request of raise of salary is that she has two sisters which she helps to support. One of these lost her position last year by staying home a couple of days to look after her other sister who has never been well since she was overseas nursing.\n\nIt was a great disappointment to this teacher that no new school with teacher's residence could be built this year. She has to board with two old people, (Missionary and wife). They are half-breeds, and live somewhat after the Indian fashion.\n\nUnless it is contrary to the general policy of the Department I can recommend that she be allowed the same salary at Klemtu as she previously had at Kispiox, namely \u00a31000.00 per annum.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 11th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that a cheque for $100., being the balance due on account of the salary of the teacher of the Kletu Indian Day School for the academic year 1929-30, will be forwarded under separate cover. The Department regrets that the salary of this teacher was only paid previously at the rate of $85 a teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the salary of the teacher of the Indian Day School at Klemtu, B.C., for the school year 1929-30, I notice that the amounts received from the Department for the four quarters aggregate $50.00, being at the rate of $25.00 per teaching month.\n\nI beg to state that if you will refer to your letter of July 15th, 1929, (File 162-12-1), you will find that the understanding we had with the Department when Miss Lillie Morrice was appointed was for a salary of $95.00 per teaching month, and under that arrangement we have been paying at that rate.\n\nWe shall be glad to have the Department correct what is evidently an oversight.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJNS.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also discussed this matter with the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, and as both of you were agreeable to this course of action, we presented the name of Mr. McConnell to the B.C. Conference. That Conference closed its sessions last week and our suggestion was accepted by them, so that I am prepared now to make the official nomination of Rev. R. L. McConnell, B.A., who holds a professional certificate as missionary teacher at Klemtu, B.C. I shall be much obliged if Mr. McConnell can be appointed at the same salary which has been paid to Miss Morrice. I am sure he will make an excellent supply for that place.\n\nI have received a letter from Captain Barry assuring me that he will co-operate in the way which was suggested and forward to me those he considers suitable for other openings in our work.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am sorry that it is impossible to help her to a greater extent but we appreciate very much the provision which will be made and if the Department will send a cheque for the month's salary in due course we will see that it is forwarded to Miss Morrice.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:NEF\nOttawa, June 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the authorities of the United Church of Canada have nominated the services of Rev.

McConnell,\" the present teacher at this school, that he is leaving the school at the end of the present school year, and that the United Church is sending him to Kitamaat as Missionary, but that he will not have any teaching work there.\n\nThis little school at Klemtu is in a very poor state from an educational point of view. It will take a well qualified teacher to pull it up to standard. If it were not that someone must be left to help the Indians here, I should recommend that the school be closed, but on consideration I believe that it would be better to build a new school and teacher's residence and appoint a married man or a young man who could act as Missionary as well as teach the school. No single girl could be sent to this village. If a Missionary could be selected whose wife was a qualified teacher we might be able to work up this school again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEmerald H.

She had been nominated by the Board of Home Missions on the recommendation of Rev. Mr. Bunt, Superintendent of United Church Missions in British Columbia. We were under the impression that this woman intended to continue as teacher of this school and consequently forwarded the usual salary cheques addressed to her at Klemtu, B.C., for the months of October and November. In a report just received from the Acting Indian Agent he states that Klemtu has neither a teacher nor missionary. I should appreciate it if you would communicate with the Postmaster at Klemtu and ascertain if these cheques are still awaiting claimant in the post office, in which case they should be returned to this office.

At Kitimat there were 64 on the roll in the beginning of October with a possible attendance of 75 which is far too many pupils for one teacher.

Vanmatter.\n\nMr. Vanmatter is about 41 years of age and has had a number of years' teaching experience in the Province of Saskatchewan in which he holds a First Class Permanent Certificate. He served in the latter end of the Great War with the Royal Air Force, and is a married man with three children. He is anxious to do missionary work and I think, from his record as a Teacher, he will be successful in that line.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your confirmation of this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nOttawa, September 1, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Klemtu Indian Day School, No. 825\n\nIn my memorandum of August 23, you were advised that Mr. Francis W.

A. Rossy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 1, 1932.\n\nDear Dr. Dorsey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you intimate that Mr. Chilton is unable to undertake the task of teacher at the Klemtu school. I note with interest that it is your intention to send forward a nomination for the position at this school just as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAugust 30th,\n1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe seem to be having a great deal more trouble than usual in filling our schools in British Columbia. Mr. Bunt, our Superintendent, has tried to get men and we have tried.\n\nI wrote you a week or so ago about Klentu. The fact is that we had an application from Mr. Chilton, and we had received his acceptance. He has now written a letter declining the situation. In view of the explanations contained in that letter, I am sending you a copy. Despite the fact that this places us rather in a hole, I do not feel like doing anything but express my sympathy to Mr. Chilton for his state of health.\n\nWe are hoping to have a recommendation to send to you by wire in the course of a day or so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:GWF.\nDr. George Dorcy,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorcy:\n\nI am in receipt of a second telegram from you in response to my wire of yesterday. May I respectfully submit an explanation of my somewhat pusillanimous attitude in regard to accepting the appointment you so kindly offered at Kleskun. Shortly before the close of school this year I suffered a nervous breakdown and my recovery has been so retarded that the unexpected arrival of your telegram placed me in something of a quandary as I was uncertain as to whether or not I was well enough to undertake the duties of a missionary-teacher. After mature consideration I decided to decline the appointment and wired you accordingly. On Monday I received a letter from my father urging me to accept and acting on his advice I sent you a second message asking that my application be reconsidered. I have since, however, suffered a relapse of the nervous condition and feel that, notwithstanding my sincere desire to take advantage of the excellent opportunity you have so generously offered, my health is so precarious at this time that I would be unable to properly fulfil my duties in a position of this kind.\n\nMay I sincerely apologize for the trouble I have caused you and please accept my sincere thanks for your kindness.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSigned - \"Frank W. Chilton\"\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of letter sent forward under today's date to the Rev. Dr. Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Church.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have had some difficulty in getting a teacher for Kletu. Mr. Bunt, our Superintendent, has done all he can to get a man in British Columbia who would be suitable from the standpoint of teaching and the missionary work, and he has been unable to do so.\n\nI beg, however, to submit the nomination of Mr. Francis W. Chilton whose father is a minister of the United Church in the British Columbia Conference at Union Bay. Mr. Chilton is a graduate of the Normal School at Regina, with a First Class Professional Certificate. He is a married man with two children; a returned soldier with certain disability due to gas. He has been teaching at Elrose, Sask., for twelve years. His services certainly have been satisfactory. He is 41 years of age.\n\nWe should appreciate it if the Department would accept him as our nomination for Kletu. We believe that he could do the work as a teacher and he would certainly be of great help in the community.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(DD:BJ)\nMr. R. A.

However, the reason remains the same and in my wife's opinion we should remain with my mother until we work out a satisfactory arrangement for her. So with may regrets, circumstances will compel me to resign my work at Klemtu. Would you inform the department in this regard?\n\nThe keys will be with Mrs. Reid at Klemtu. The books and everything will be in first class shape and there will be data as regards everything and suggestions as to the future, waiting for the new people.\n\nI will write the Agent and arrange for the winter fuel.\n\nThe remarks made as to my welcome back to the work should my affairs work out satisfactorily were appreciated. I will also write to the Indians and pave the way, the best way I know, for the new man.\n\nIn closing, I would like to state my appreciation of the Missionary Board, the Church and Drs. Osterhout and Wilson. I have worked under them for five years and Dr. Osterhout was like a father to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned - Charles von Storch.\nThe four day schools opened by Sept. 6th.\n\nThe average attendance however, was very low.

I took the matter up when I was there, and secured the co-operation of the officials in British Columbia.\n\nI also interviewed Miss Pitts, and talked to her about the work and the desire to have a change made.\n\nFrom the report submitted by Captain Barry - which you showed me - I gathered that there was every disposition on his part to have both Mr. Von Storch and Miss Pitts given an opportunity to make good somewhere else.\n\nI beg, therefore, to nominate to your Department as the Teacher at Klemmy Mr. Charles Von Storch.\n\nFor Ucluelet I beg to nominate Mr. E. B. Severson who has been our Missionary-Teacher at Port Essington. I know that Captain Barry's report concerning Mr. Severson was not too enthusiastic, but at the same time I gathered that he might have another opportunity in a different type of community. That is why we are nominating him for Ucluelet.\n\nFor Campbell River I beg to nominate Miss Ketra Pitts who has been serving at Alberni.\n\nWith kindest regards, believe me\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD:BJ\nBella Coola, B.C., April 7th, 1937.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MARCH 1937.\n\nAll the schools were visited and an almost perfect attendance was found in all of them.

C. He states that he understands Rev. R. L. McConnell, the present teacher, is giving up duties at the end of this school year.\n\nThe Inspector states that this school is in a very poor state, from an educational point of view and that it will take a well qualified teacher to bring it up to standard. He recommends the engagement of a married man or a young man who could act as missionary as well as carry out the teaching duties. He states that no single girl should be sent to this point.\n\nNo doubt, you will be aware if Mr. McConnell is giving up duties. If so, I would request that you nominate the services of a qualified male teacher for the coming academic year.

This is a special concession and it is hoped that you will keep the matter in mind and let us know later if the change in school hours has resulted in a better attendance.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Anfield's report for the month of November, 1943, on the Klemtu Indian Day School\n\nThe teacher appeared to be a bit harsh in her handling of the youngsters, and a careful check on this phase will be made on my next visit to this school in December. Due to there being no illumination by electricity or lamps, and the darkness prevalent in this area at this time of year, it is recommended that school hours be from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily, Monday through Friday.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nKlemtu Day School opened on October 1st, with Mrs. Snodgrass as teacher. Work is now being done to improve the conditions of this school.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 7, 1946.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield, Indian Agent,\nBella Coola, British Columbia.\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of April 8 with reference to attendance at the Klemtu School.\n\nFrom that letter it is evident that this school is overcrowded. Would it be possible to rent any other building at Klemtu which would accommodate the pupils that should attend?\n\nWe have noted the necessity for a new school at Klemtu, but it will not be possible to consider its erection this year. As you are aware, our public building program has been curtailed owing to the policy of encouraging the erection of private homes.\n\nI was not aware of the ruling which is stated to have been made by the former School Inspector in regard to attendance of pupils. At the moment it may not be possible to provide accommodation for all pupils between 7 and 16, but if new accommodation can be secured, it should be distinctly understood by all parties concerned that the Department considers all children from 7 to 16 years of age should attend school regularly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Klemtu School Attendance Report - March, 1946.\n\nAt Klemtu there are thirty-six children of school age, vide Ind.Act 10.1. Of this number, five are in the Residential School at Alert Bay, leaving thirty-one in the village.\n\nThe desk seating capacity of the Day School is twenty-three which number crowds the room to its capacity. The school is very old, condemned for use and should be replaced without delay with a modern building and proper equipment.\n\nThe teacher has refused to permit the following pupils to attend school on the grounds that there is no suitable seating capacity for their age:\n\nRebecca Sandy, born January 4th, 1931, discharged from Alert Bay Indian Residential School 1945 for non-return.\nMae Robinson, born May 7th, 1931.\nDora Brown, born August 25th, 1931.\nLilian Starr, born July 8th, 1932.\nRoy Collinson, born December 8th, 1930.\nPercy Starr, born February 20th, 1931., graduated from Alert Bay I.R.S., in 1945.\nStephen Robinson, born March 13th, 1931.\nMedric Robinson, born September 22nd, 1932.\n\nAs these children have been excluded from attending school for lack of room and on the instructions of the teachers, based on rulings made in previous years by the Department's Inspector, and as both the Ind.Act S.10.1 and the Family Allowance Act, 1945 are involved a ruling is requested as to whether these children shall remain in pay or be cut off family allowance.\n\nF. Earl Infield,\nIndian Agent.\nAt Klemtu good work has been done and Mrs. Snodgrass after three years of faithful service is leaving this school with its very poor physical plant. She has applied for appointment as senior teacher at Bella Coola, and deserves the appointment in spite of her age.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nMajor D. H.

Consequently, we are making this nomination to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 22nd,\n1946.\nOttawa, April 2, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay, in which he states that Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass intends to give up duties as teacher of the Klenotu Day School on June 30. She has requested that she be transferred to the position of senior teacher at the Bella Coola School for the academic year 1946-47. Indian Commissioner MacKay recommends this transfer. I would appreciate it if you would let me know if you agree.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of March 12th, together with a letter of March 1st from Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass, tendering her resignation as teacher of the Klemtu Indian Day School, and asking that consideration be given to her appointment as teacher of the senior classroom at the Bella Coola Indian Day School as from September 1st next.\n\nIn view of the information given by Mr. Anfield, I concur in his recommendation that Mrs. Snodgrass be transferred to the senior classroom of the Bella Coola School.\n\nfor D.

Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find notice of resignation of Mrs. Isabel Snodgrass, teacher at the Klemtu Indian Day School, same to take effect as at June 30th.\n\nIt is also noted that Mrs. Snodgrass makes application for appointment as teacher in the senior classroom of the Bella Coola Day School as from September 1st next.\n\nMrs. Snodgrass has done good work at Klemtu for the past three years under very difficult circumstances. Her pupils have made real progress and Mrs. Snodgrass's teaching methods have improved tremendously in that time. It is my opinion that she would make an excellent job of the senior classroom at Bella Coola and as Miss Wright, should she remain another year wishes to keep the junior room, the matter may work out very satisfactorily for all concerned.\n\nIt is recommended that the resignation at Klemtu be accepted as tendered and that if nominated by the Church involved, Mrs. Snodgrass be appointed to the senior classroom teachership at Bella Coola as from September 1st, 1946.\n\nF.

No teacher is yet in residence at Bella Coola, but advice has been received of the appointment of Miss Anne Wright to this post. There is a need of a second teacher at Bella Coola where some 70 children of school age are now at home. At this village, the Agent is negotiating for the rental of a nice little cottage as a teachers' residence.\n\nAttendance at the Day Schools opened to date has been very good, reflecting in some measure the value of the Family Allowance payments. A few children from the Agency were admitted to the Residential School at Alert Bay, none to Alberni.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nEducation Day Schools in the agency closed at the end of June, following an academic year of real progress. Schools at Bella Coola, Bella Bella and Kitamaat were inspected by the Provincial Inspector of Schools with very satisfactory reports in all cases. The school at Klemtu was inspected on several occasions by the Agent, who found teaching and other conditions satisfactory. In general there is a noticeably improved interest being shown in all day schools by pupils and parents and the standing of the children is good. Attendance at all schools has improved with the exception of Kitamaat, where the industrial requirements of the adult population resulted in a very unsatisfactory attendance record. At Bella Coola, a second room has been prepared. The teacher during the past year, Miss L. Fleming, has resigned. At Bella Bella, Mrs. D. Martin, senior room teacher resigned and a successor, Mrs. Scott, has been appointed for Sept. 1st. At Kitamaat, Mr. Gordon Robinson, senior room teacher has resigned in order to attend Normal School this winter. Only one teacher will be required at this School this winter.\n\nF.

This teacher has done splendid work, under extremely difficult conditions, and it is good news to me as Agent that she plans to return.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPEA/D\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nDuring the month inspections were carried out at the Bella Coola, Bella Bella (two division) and Klemtu Day Schools. In all three schools, satisfactory teaching is being carried on, but the problem is still one of securing better attendance. If the herring run materializes, the attendance at Bella Bella will drop sharply. In Bella Coola we are fortunate in securing an exceptionally good teacher in Miss Fleming and the response of the pupils is excellent. If a continuity of this type of teacher could be secured, better progress would be noticeable among the Indian children.\n\nF.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nJune 17th, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nYour file 2-11-2; 1st June, 1944, Klemtu teachership.\n\nMrs. Isobel Snodgrass has done good work at the Klemtu Indian School during the present academic year. She is a teacher of what might be termed the \"old school\", and her methods are somewhat harsh, but she has definitely taught the children at Klemtu more than they have learned for some years past.\n\nI have inspected this School several times during the past seven months, and a steady progress has been noted, the response of the children to teaching has been marked, and the general tone of the school improved. Mrs. Snodgrass was asked to be less severe in her methods, and she has made an effort to co-operate.\n\nShe has had the support of the parents, who on many occasions have expressed their gratification for her services to the school and village life in general.\n\nIt is my understanding that Inspector Thorstenstein will not be able to inspect this school this academic year due to the Agency boat being laid up for repairs. I have discussed Mrs. Snodgrass's work with him, and have no hesitation in recommending that her services be retained for another academic year, commencing Sept. 1st, next, when the parents of the Klemtu children have promised to have their children ready for school attendance. This recommendation is made having in mind the extreme difficulty of obtaining qualified teachers with modern training.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools:\n\nNo schools were inspected during the month as arrival times at Klemtu and Bella Bella were inconvenient or on Saturdays; there is a possibility that Bella Coola Day School may re-open shortly, as the United Church have nominated a teacher for the remaining two months of the academic year; Mrs. Anfield has consented to provide board and room for this girl who is expected May 4th. A report has been sent to the Indian Commissioner for B.C. recommending that Kitamaat, if reopened, be confined to a one-room school, and the dispensary be moved to the Day School basement, and the nurse quartered in the teacherage. Inspector Thorntonstein expects to visit the Bella Bella and Klemtu schools, also Bella Coola if opened, in the latter part of May.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nDay schools at Bella Coola, Klemtu, Bella Bella (2 division) and the empty schoolhouse at Kitimat were all carefully inspected. Attendance is not satisfactory at all; Klemtu and Bella Coola have most unsuitable persons as teachers; and the closing of the latter school has been recommended. I am afraid that the School at Bella Bella will suffer a serious attendance lapse. War services take men and women in a wholesale manner from the villages winter as well as summer, and if the war goes on much longer, the entire social economy of these Indians will require serious review. In the old days there were at least six months in which the parents would be home; today in some villages, they are home for two weeks at kms or for a wedding or funerals; and children by the score are not attending school at all.\n\nIt is very moot point in my opinion, as to whether home life in Indian villages will ever return to its former status, and I foresee the possibility of \"ghost Villages\" not long hence. Just where Councils will fit in to the picture of the future is a baffling problem, and future objectives along these lines will need careful study.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools; Day.\n\nAll schools in operation were visited and inspected. It is a shame that no teachers are available for Kitammat and Bella Coola. Attendance at Bella Bella is fairly good, but I am afraid that after the new year, it will take a slump as many of these people are due to go to Namu Cannery for work. The school at Bella Coola is overcrowded. Repairs have been done at Klemtu and the building at least looks clean inside. It will last until better days come and a proper unit can be put up, with teachers quarters attached. It is suggested that at Kitammat a local Indian with Grade XI standing be appointed interim teacher, to get one room going at least. He seems a fine kind of young man, and he could not be any worse than some white interim or temporary appointments at present in action.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 14, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $50.00 for improving the school grounds at the Klemtu Indian Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have received an application from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield for authority to expend $50.00 for improvement to the school grounds at Kitasoo Indian Reserve No. 1 (Klentu). Mr. Inspector Coleman recently visited this village with Mr. Anfield and found occasion to instruct the Indians to clean up their village in the interests of sanitation, but advises that the school buildings and surroundings were in a worse condition than any of the Indian houses and surroundings.

A survey of the field\nsituation at Kletu has been made and there is no\nbuilding even remotely suitable that could be used as\na school in this village and the carrying out of the\nDepartment's regulations re attendance of Indian child-\nren at school in Kletu will have to await the building\nof a new school. The Chief and leading men have offered\nthe use of the Church as a temporary school but the build-\ning is quite unsuitable for such a purpose. It is as old\nas the present school, lighting is bad and heating would\nbe a very expensive problem.\n\nIf the United Church are able to secure a suitable\nteacher for this location, it is recommended that the\npresent building be used but that pupilage be limited to\n20 children only.\n\nF.

Mr. Pruden has confirmed to a certain extent that the condition of the classroom and teacherage at Klemtu is as described by Mrs. Conroy and certainly had we known this prior to her departure from Vancouver her assignment to this school would not have been recommended.\n\nThe matter of repairs to the teacherage, which is the United Church Mission House, is being attended to but as it is doubtful if we will be able to secure a teacher for this school, and in view of the fact that the construction of a new school is contemplated it is not considered that repairs to the classroom building should be carried out.\n\nIn order to recompense Mrs. Conroy in part for the unnecessary expense she was put to in travelling to and from Klemtu I should like to recommend that she be paid salary from the time she left Vancouver on Sept. 11th until she returned here on October 6th, although the actual period the school was opened was from Sept. 15th to October 3rd inclusive.\n\nThe question of the assignment of Mrs. Conroy to another school will be the subject of a separate communication.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. H.

Ferrier - No. 162-12-3 - in reference to the payment of the teacher at Klemtu School, B.C., and stated that the cheques for the teacher of this school should come direct to this office and not to the Woman's Missionary Society. I have enquired at the office of the latter organization and find that no cheque has been received from the Department for the Klemtu School. It may be that the returns have not come in from the Indian Agent and that this explains the delayed payment. I am writing again in order to make sure that when the cheque is made out it should be in favor of the Treasurer of The United Church of Canada.\n\nI have a letter from Rev. T. Ferrier, Brandon, in which he authorizes me to pay Miss Blanche Rendle the sum of $42.50 for ten days' teaching of the Klemtu School during the month of September, and Miss Mabel Widsten, who succeeded her, an amount at the same rate from September 21st to September 30th. This will adjust the matter satisfactorily to the end of September.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ferrier, dated October 29th and numbered 162-12-3, in reference to the Kletu Indian Day School, and note that the Department is paying the salary of the teacher to the Treasurer of the Woman's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada. I should like to correct that by saying that hitherto the cheques for the teacher of this school have been sent direct to this office, and you will be good enough to have this done in future.\n\nI am waiting to hear from Rev. T.

She taught for two weeks (ten days), when Miss Mabel Widsten arrived, and started work. It may be better to pay the teachers separately. Miss Rendle lives at Bella Coola, where her father is missionary.\"\n\nThe salary of the teacher at the Klemtu School is paid to the Treasurer of the Women's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada, and, in view of the Agent's report that the school was not re-opened until September 10th, the Department does not consider that it should be required to pay salary for the full month. Before making payment, however, I would appreciate your advising me what amount the Women's Missionary Society is allowing for salary at this school for the month of September.\n\nIn making payment, it is presumed that it will be sufficient for the Department to issue one cheque in favour of the Women's Missionary Society as they, no doubt, will settle with the two teachers concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6399, File 825-3, part 1)\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief of Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nJuly 14th,\n1938.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: SALARY OF MR. J.B. GLOVER,\n\nFirst of all, may I explain the arrangement which we have with Mr. Glover regarding his salary. He receives his monthly cheques from Ottawa, endorses them over to The United Church of Canada and forwards them to this office. To the $900 per year which your Department pays him, we add our grant for missionary services and send the whole amount to Mr. Glover in twelve monthly instalments.\n\nA month ago, we received from Mr. Glover two cheques which, from the dates on them, appeared to be for April and May. We wrote him regarding this as our records do not include any cheque for March. We now have his reply in which he says that the two cheques were for April and May, and that he had sent his March cheque to our office early in April. We have again searched the records both in this office and in the Treasurer's Department and can find no trace of the March payment. Will you kindly inquire into this and find out if Mr. Glover's cheque for March has been cashed?\n\nA statement of the cheques we have received this year may be of help to you in this inquiry. They are as follows, each for $90.00:\n\nReceived in Toronto -\nFor December, 1937 - Jan. 7, 1938.\n\" January, 1938 - Feb. 2.\n\" February - March 25.\n\" March - ?\n\" April - June 10.\n\" May - June 10.\n\" June - July 14.\n\nThe last of these is No. B67525 and is dated June 30th.\n\nWe shall appreciate it very much if your Department can help us to locate the missing cheque.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6399, File 825-3, part 1)\nOttawa, July 15, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the March salary cheque of Mr. J. B. Glover, teacher of the Klemtu Indian Day School during the past academic year.\n\nOur records show that cheque No. 53232 was issued and sent to Mr. Glover in payment of his March salary. We phoned the Finance Department today and find that the cheque is still outstanding. Apparently it must have been lost in the mail.\n\nTo permit our issuing a new cheque, it will be necessary to have a Bond of Indemnity form completed. I am obtaining one of the necessary forms and will forward it to you early next week. The delay in sending this form is due to the fact that we have to obtain it from the head office of the Treasury Branch and certain formalities are required before they will permit us to send one of these out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Glover, Klemtu, B.C.\n\nThe above noted salary cheque is reported as having been lost subsequent to delivery to the payee.\n\nAs Mr. Glover is a school teacher and we at present have no assurance that his services will be continued during the next school year, I am enclosing herewith Bond of Indemnity form. Will you kindly have particulars regarding cheque filled in and return form to this office.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nWAB/B\nOttawa, July 25th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSalary Cheque No. 53232 - $90.00 March 31/38.\n\nI am today in receipt of a communication from Rev. George Dorey, Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, Toronto, stating that cheque No. 53232 for $90.00 in your favour and representing salary for March, 1938, has not been received by that office.\n\nRev. Mr. Dorey also explains the arrangement between yourself and the United Church of Canada, whereby monthly salary cheques for your services as teacher are forwarded by you to the United Church of Canada at Toronto. He also states that you have informed him that you endorsed the March salary cheque and forwarded it to Toronto. Evidently it has been lost in the mails.\n\nAs this Department pays salary directly to you, the necessary formalities in connection with the issuing of a duplicate cheque must be performed by yourself and I am inclosing Bond of Indemnity form herewith. When this form has been completed by yourself and two sureties and duly witnessed, kindly return it to this office. The question of issuing a duplicate cheque will then be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.B. Glover, Esq.,\nKlentu, B.C.\n\nWAB/J\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that $84.50 will be required for labour and if an accountable cheque is needed please let me know and it will be forwarded.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to my letter of June 19th enclosing a report on Nlemu Indian Day School by Mr. B. Thorsteinsson, who was at the school on April 1st last.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Levelton in this connection and enclose herewith his reply of May 14th setting out the various repairs necessary to bring the school into a reasonable condition until such time as it can be replaced by a new building. Also his letter of the 1st instant giving the cost of material when delivered as $67.72 which with labour at $84.50 would amount to a total of $172.22.\n\nIf funds can be provided for this purpose, I would recommend approval of the application as the school is in a very poor shape.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIn reference to your letter of May 27th, No. 215-2-4586, re repairs to school at Klamath, I beg to say that I wrote several firms handling building material, both local and at Vancouver, and so far the only quotation which I have received is from the H.J. Wells Lumber Co. of Vancouver.\n\nTheir quotation is $76.25 F.O.B. deck at Vancouver, with estimated freight charges to Klamath of $1150 additional.\n\nThese quotations are subject to stocks being available and any price change which may come into effect before date of shipment.\n\nI note that the price of all grades of lumber advanced $4.00 per M.sq at June 16th.\n\nT.A. Swelten\nA/Indian Agent\nMajor D.M. Hackey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver B.C.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Apr. 29th, No. 215-2-3991, re: Klemtu Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection beg to advise that I have just recently returned from a trip North to Kitamaat with the School Inspector, and took this occasion to make a closer survey of the conditions prevailing at this school.\n\nThe teacher pointed out that there was a leak in the roof near a corner of the class room, and upon investigation I found that quite a number of the shingles had blown off, leaving the roof boards exposed in several places. West side of roof will have to be replaced.\n\nThe inside of the building is one big gray smudge from smoke, caused by the old stove, and before anything can be done to brighten it, the whole room, ceiling and walls will all have to be thoroughly cleaned, with a strong soap or lye solution.\n\nThere is a very high ceiling in this room, and a movable scaffold will have to be made so that the ceiling can be reached.\n\nAfter a thorough washing, possibly some of the cheaper wall coverings, such as Vello, or kalsomine, can be used to lighten up the interior. There is a small entry at the front of the main class room, and part of the roof of this is also gone, and will have to be replaced, also the foundation under this is giving way, so that the front will have to be jacked up.\n\nIn the matter of the toilets, I would recommend that new ones be built, and that they be placed at least 50 feet apart. The old ones are under the same roof, and are placed so close to the class room, that it is very unsanitary.\n\nI am enclosing a bill of material needed for the various repairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.A.

Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe supplies for Klemtu (Kitasu) Indian Day School.\n\nWith further reference to the requisition for supplies submitted last mail for this Indian Day School, the teacher, Mrs. Isobel Snodgrass, requested permission to buy a small clock and a broom for this school.\n\nThese items could be obtained at the local cannery store and authority is requested to purchase them, and submit bills to the Department. The broom will cost about 90 cents, and the clock, a standard alarm type about $2.75.\n\nThis teacher, Mrs. Snodgrass, a fairly elderly woman, is living alone in the old mission house. She has no radio or other means of entertaining herself, and as the village is a particularly lonely sort of place, I was wondering if the Department would care to approach the United Church Home Mission Board with the suggestion that as this worker is a nominee of theirs, and ranks as a missionary-teacher, it might be well in the interests of her welfare and mental stability to make an appeal to one or other of their Churches to supply her with a battery operated radio of not less than five tube power.

Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses;\n\nThat it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, say that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this building be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR ONE-ROOM SCHOOL AND ATTACHED TEACHER'S QUARTERS TO BE PREFABRICATED BY PREFABRICATED STRUCTURES, Ltd., VANCOUVER, B.C., FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\n(1) GENERAL - Good grade Pacific Coast Fir, Hemlock or Cedar especially selected for the purpose for which it is to be used.\n\n(2) FOUNDATIONS - One 6 x 8 ins. centre beam to be supplied for each wing of the building.\n\n(3) BASEMENT - Basement sash, doors, stairs, beams and posts to be supplied.\n\n(4) WATER TABLE - This to be supplied if building to be placed on full concrete foundation.

Mines & Resources.\n\nPhoned by..........\nTo...........\n\nPP/MGD\n\nCOPY 3\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Klemtu Indian Day School\n\nI am enclosing herewith confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date wherein I recommend the construction of the above mentioned building on a day labour basis under the supervision of Messrs. Widsten and Logan of Bella Bella.\n\nWe have been confronted with many difficulties in planning for the erection of this school due largely to the location of the school site. Klemtu is located approximately forty miles north of Bella Bella on a inside channel and while there is a dock at the cannery on the Reserve there is no road from the dock to the school site nor is there a road suitable for transporting materials from the beach to the site. Widsten and Logan have a self-propelled barge which with some clearing of the waterfront below the school site may be landed on the beach at that point. From there it is proposed to build a plank road up a fairly steep grade, a distance of approximately 130' to the flat on which the school is to be built. Prefabricated sections of the building and other materials will be hauled up this incline with a power winch, all of which adds substantially to the cost of the building and provision for which is made in the estimated labour cost of $5000.\n\nIn addition to this difficulty we find that the closest gravel deposit is 25 miles from Klemtu up the coast and to haul gravel this distance by barge for the purpose of putting in a cement foundation is entirely uneconomical and would increase the cost of the building by as much as $6000. We have, therefore, decided to put in a partial basement to accommodate the heating unit. This basement...\n16 feet square, will be excavated to a depth of approximately four feet and cribbed with treated planking. The entire building will be erected on treated cedar posts which will be sunk a depth of four feet to hard-pan and sheeted in to ground level.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of landing material at the site and as it is not feasible to load material from the cannery dock on to the barge, we propose shipping all the materials to Ocean Falls where there are facilities for loading the barge from the dock; the item $250 barge hire will cover cost of transporting the materials from Ocean Falls to the beach at Klemtu.\n\nWe are reasonably certain that arrangements can be made with the Klemtu Cannery which is on the Reserve to provide room and board for the crew of seven men who, in a period of seven weeks can, we believe, complete the building, including interior and exterior painting. We propose to pay the foreman of the crew at the rate of $1.56 an hour which is the prevailing rate, three carpenters $1.40 an hour and four labourers at $1.10 an hour, with time and a half for overtime and double time on Sunday. Labour costs are estimated on this basis and are recommended for acceptance for the reason that we find it impossible to interest anyone else in erecting this building for us. There is absolutely nothing for the men to do at Klemtu and actually it will probably work out that we will save money by authorizing them to work overtime, thus completing the building in a shorter period with reduced maintenance costs for the crew. We will also be obliged to pay the men's fare either from Vancouver or Prince Rupert to Klemtu and return.\n\nWe have spent considerable time with Messrs. Widsten and Logan and with their foreman-carpenter, Mr. Nordin, in arranging all details in connection with the erection of this building and I am reasonably certain that we could not make more favourable arrangements, if any, for the erection of this building.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Klemtu Indian Day School\n\nI am enclosing herewith confirmation of my Army Signals message of today's date wherein I recommend the construction of the above mentioned building on a day labour basis under the supervision of Messrs. Widsten and Logan of Bella Bella.\n\nWe have been confronted with many difficulties in planning for the erection of this school due largely to the location of the school site. Klemtu is located approximately forty miles north of Bella Bella on a inside channel and while there is a dock at the cannery on the Reserve there is no road from the dock to the school site nor is there a road suitable for transporting materials from the beach to the site. Widsten and Logan have a self-propelled barge which with some clearing of the waterfront below the school site may be landed on the beach at that point. From there it is proposed to build a plank road up a fairly steep grade, a distance of approximately 180' to the flat on which the school is to be built. Prefabricated sections of the building and other materials will be hauled up this incline with a power winch, all of which adds substantially to the cost of the building and provision for which is made in the estimated labour cost of $5000.\n\nIn addition to this difficulty we find that the closest gravel deposit is 25 miles from Klemtu up the coast and to haul gravel this distance by barge for the purpose of putting in a cement foundation is entirely uneconomical and would increase the cost of the building by as much as $6000. We have, therefore, decided to put in a partial basement to accommodate the heating unit. This basement...\n16 feet square, will be excavated to a depth of approximately four feet and cribbed with treated planking. The entire building will be erected on treated cedar posts which will be sunk a depth of four feet to hard-pan and sheeted in to ground level.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of landing material at the site and as it is not feasible to load material from the cannery dock on to the barge, we propose shipping all the materials to Ocean Falls where there are facilities for loading the barge from the dock; the item $350 barge hire will cover cost of transporting the materials from Ocean Falls to the beach at Klemtu.\n\nWe are reasonably certain that arrangements can be made with the Klemtu Cannery which is on the Reserve to provide room and board for the crew of seven men who, in a period of seven weeks can, we believe, complete the building, including interior and exterior painting. We propose to pay the foreman of the crew at the rate of $1.56 an hour which is the prevailing rate, three carpenters $1.40 an hour and four labourers at $1.10 an hour, with time and a half for overtime and double time on Sunday. Labour costs are estimated on this basis and are recommended for acceptance for the reason that we find it impossible to interest anyone else in erecting this building for us. There is absolutely nothing for the men to do at Klemtu and actually it will probably work out that we will save money by authorizing them to work overtime, thus completing the building in a shorter period with reduced maintenance costs for the crew. We will also be obliged to pay the men's fare either from Vancouver or Prince Rupert to Klemtu and return.\n\nWe have spent considerable time with Messrs. Widsten and Logan and with their foreman-carpenter, Mr. Nordin, in arranging all details in connection with the erection of this building and I am reasonably certain that we could not make more favourable arrangements, if any, for the erection of this building. The labour crew are immediately available and some of them will go to Klemtu as soon as the proposal is approved and will proceed with the installation of the basement, foundation posts, plank road, etc., and in the event that the proposal is not approved sooner I would ask that it be favourably considered immediately on receipt of this letter as the extent of our construction program is such that we cannot possibly devote more time to this project and Widsten and Logan will not wait\nindefinitely for a decision.\n\nIt is proposed to have labour costs paid from the Bella Coola Agency office and I would ask that an accountable advance of $5000 for this purpose be forwarded to Mr. Pruden at the earliest possible date.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\n\nW.

Widsten and Logan of Bella Bella a self-propelled barge for transporting materials from the boat to the beach. Their account, which includes the supply of a small quantity of lumber, foundation posts, etc., and barge hire, at a cost of $750.41, has now been received.\n\n\"I would also refer to Mr. Neary's letter of August 2nd, 1947, in connection with the acquisition by the Department of building No. 5, Bella Bella Sea Plane Base, from the War Assets Corporation, and subsequent correspondence to the effect that the proposed use of this building for additional classroom facilities at Bella Bella would not be economical. Messrs. Widsten and Logan purchased a number of other buildings at the Sea Plane Base, having established a permanent marine repair shop and other facilities, and are anxious to add building No. 5 to their establishment. While I am aware that Government property may not be disposed of other than through War Assets Corporation, it has occurred to me that inasmuch as building No. 5 was purchased for school construction...\"\nthe intent of the purchase would be complied with if the building was transferred to Widsten and Logan to apply on their account. They have offered $550 for the building as it stands and I would recommend that if at all possible permission be granted to turn the building over to them, they to assume responsibility for compliance with all the terms of the Sales Order, the $550 being applied on their account above referred to, which amounts to $768.41.\"\n\nThe building referred to in the above letter was purchased under authority of P.O. 23067 of August 8, 1947. It was purchased on the recommendation of Mr. Acting Indian Agent Findlay and our District Inspector of Indian Schools. Efforts to have this building moved proved unsuccessful. We arranged for an engineer from the Lands and Development Services Branch to inspect the building and he in turn recommended taking the building completely apart as the only practical method of removal. Mr. Bills advised that it would appear questionable whether, if the building were demolished and the material salvaged, much of such material could be economically utilized in a standard building.\n\nCould we please be advised whether authority can be issued to sell this building to Messrs. Widsten and Logan of Bella Bella, as indicated in Mr. Arnell's letter.\n\nBernard F. Hardy,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Klemtu School Construction Accounts\n\nIn my letter of July 29th outlining a proposal for the erection of the above mentioned school I advised that we proposed hiring from Messrs.

Widsten and Logan, of Bella Bella, but it consequently developed that they themselves could not supervise the project and they turned the matter over to their foreman-carpenter, Mr. E. Nordin. The 10% for supervision is, therefore, payable to Mr. Nordin, who arranged for the employment of labour, receipt of materials at the site, etc., and actually assumed full responsibility for completion of the building.\n\nWe have been awaiting receipt of full information from Mr. Pruden with regard to labour costs, which information is now to hand, reference his Credit Voucher No. 89 attached, and previous Credit Voucher No. 866, already submitted. On the basis of this information, the attached Voucher No. 28, in the amount of $475.89, payable to Mr. Nordin, has been prepared in this Office and is recommended for payment.\n\nIt should be noted that Mr. Nordin's percentage is based on gross wages paid to carpenter's helpers only up until the\ndate they left Klemtu (November 2nd) and although some minor construction was carried on after that date, it is not considered that any percentage of labour costs incurred after Mr. Nordin left Klemtu would be payable to him. Also excluded from the total of labour costs from which the percentage is computed, are costs for labour not actually engaged in the construction of the building.\n\nIt is felt that this settlement should be satisfactory to Mr. Nordin and I would ask that a cheque in his favour be forwarded in care of this Office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 2 | Ten percent of amount of gross wages paid to carpenters and carpenter's helpers for construction of Indian Day School at Klemtu, for supervision in accordance with agreement - as per statement attached. | $475.89 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Klentu School Construction\n\nMr. Levelton has returned from Klentu and reports as follows. The carpenter and painter were paid off and left Klentu October 27th. Mr. and Mrs. Norlin are remaining another week to complete plumbing. All fares have been paid to Vancouver. Mr. and Mrs. Norlin are paid up to and including October 27th.\n\nMr. Levelton wired you advising that the teacher not leave Vancouver until November 5th. No coal had yet arrived. The wood had not been put in as had been promised and as the Chief Councillor was away no assurance was possible when the wood would be put in. It is expected that Chief Councillor Brown will be in the village by today, as he has always been most co-operative, I am sure he will make every effort to have the wood put in. The man who had promised to do this work had subsequently been employed by Mr. Norlin to help with the plumbing. I have wired Chief Councillor Brown as follows:\n\n\"Have wired teacher to stay in Vancouver until coal and wood are in school cellar. Wire me when coal has arrived and wood is cut and stored.\"\n\nThe following wire has gone forward to you:\n\n\"Levelton reports no fuel Klentu. Have wired council to notify me when fuel is in. Suggest Roylands remain Vancouver until further notice from here. Letter in mail.\"\n\nMr. Levelton's wire to you from Klentu noted items missing from plumbing. Drain assembly for bathtub had not yet arrived from Hock, Oregon & right as asked in my wire of October 16th. Flange for toilet bowl with bolts for attaching same were found not to be in the order when it was unpacked. Quarter bend for three inch soil pipe, this item was not included in my original order by an oversight. Lead stub three inches by eleven inches long to connect from toilet flange to soil pipe 3/4\" threaded pipe elbow. These were found necessary when Mr. Norlin commenced to lay out plumbing. One 3/4\" compression stop. This is for drain to range boiler which was not provided.\n\nThe following items of household equipment had not yet arrived. Window shades throughout, draperies throughout, curtain rods throughout, towel racks, coal oil bracket lamp for bathroom, triangle dust mop, wet mop, set of table cutlery or flatware. The last item is the most important since housekeeping would be difficult without table flatware. The other items could come forward later. No doubt there will be other necessary items which I have missed in my order.\n\nMr. Norlin considerably underestimated the time it would take to finish the job when I was last at Klentu. I had serious doubts myself that he could finish by the 27th. He however reiterated this date so definitely to my second questions on the subject that I could only take his word for it. I believe possibly his men were wearying after the long continuous work period and probably did not respond during the last week as he had hoped. He has now hired two Indians to assist with digging, etc. during the final stages.\n\nThere is now $142.65 left in the wage account. I will hold this to pay the Indians and hope it will prove sufficient. I had hoped to complete the installation of the plumbing within the $5,000.00 sent here to pay wages. Plumbing was not of course originally estimated within that figure. However had the rise in wage rates not intervened since estimates were prepared, the plumbing could have been included.\n\n(over)\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nOttawa, Canada\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nMcKENZIE TAXI COMPANY\nTAXI AND TRANSFER\n\nAlex McRee Co., Ltd. \u2014 Printers \u2014 Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nNov. 13 Freight prepaid on lumber for Klemtu mission $5.25\n\nDec. 27 Freight prepaid on lumber for Klemtu mission $2.40\n\n$7.65\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Jan. 8 | To freight on lumber shipments to Klemtu school and mission house | $51.65 |\n\nVote: 516-04-352\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Pruden's letter of Feb. 17th and enclosures referred to therein, including credit voucher No. 166 accounting in full for all funds advanced to meet labour costs.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Pruden has attached a summary of the cost of the construction of this school which, I might mention, is not entirely complete as we have yet to arrange during the next fiscal year for installation of a furnace, and that a further accountable advance of $160 is required to complete payment of labour costs. I would recommend that this amount be forwarded to Mr. Pruden on the definite understanding that it is to be accounted for prior to April 1st.\n\n-W. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\nRe: Klenthi School Construction\n\nFurther to my 1-1-3 of January 31st, reference your file 1-11-3, attached is voucher 166, supported by labour returns covering the work done by Mr. Peder Holland up to January 8th. I have put in fifty-three cents to make up enough to cover wages and L. I. O. contributions for the period. The accountable advance for labour has now been fully expended.\n\nThe following labour returns remain unpaid:\n\nMr. Peder Holland for week ending Jan. 14th total $44.42\n\" \" \" \" \" \" \" 2nd \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" 30.35\n\" \" \" \" \" \" \" 20th \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" 24.89\n\nWork ceased on January 27th because heavy frost made the finishing of the outside work such as setting septic tank and digging drain from outside toilets uneconomical. This work will be resumed as soon as the ground has thawed and it is estimated that about $50.00 will complete it. To cover unpaid labour returns and cover the estimated work to complete this construction I will require about $100.00.\n\nI had fully expected that the period to January 22nd would complete the work. Mr. Holland has been supplying me with a daily account of each day's work and I notice the following items which I believe readily account for the extra time spent:\n\n1. The solder work on the plumbing was not satisfactory. The system had to be drained several times in an attempt to repair leaks.\n\n2. On January 2nd a shipment of galvanized piping arrived from Gordon & Holmes. This was doubtless a duplicate of an earlier order. Mr. Holland considered it wise to replace some of the copper pipe where leaks still persisted with the galvanized piping and threaded joints with which he was more familiar. This carried the work up to January 14th.\n\n3. Kitchen woodwork, which I had noted was unfinished, occupied the next two days.\n\n4. On January 15th it was found that the hot water tank would not heat in the bathroom where it had been placed. It was disconnected and moved to the kitchen where it worked satisfactorily. This brought the work to January 16th.\n\n5. Four and a half days the following week were spent in clearing and building bases. This was necessary to provide a place to pile fuel which I had ordered put in and to clear a route for the train from the outdoor toilets.\n\n6. Three days of the following week were spent in finishing and painting woodwork inside the building.\n\nThe work remaining which awaits thawing of the ground, includes connecting the septic tank. It will be recalled that I am doubtful that this tank will work in the shallow pit where it is now installed. This point remains in doubt.\n\n(over)\n## Cost of Klemtu Day School\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Building                                  | $6,768.61|\n| Foundation, chimney                       | $88.66   |\n| Plumbing                                  | $40.79   |\n| Accessories, range boiler, range, heater, etc. | $43.95   |\n| Roofing                                   | $31.05   |\n| Wages                                     | $500.00  |\n\nTotal: $14,073.06\n# DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\n## INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\n### TREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: Credit Voucher\n\nAddress: Indian Agency Trust Account,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Aug.30/48  | Asset advance for wages-construction Klentu Day School |        |\n| Dec.6/48   | Ind.

Attached are accounts from Union Steamships Limited, showing breakdown of the fares paid by this agency's cheque 89541 in the amount of $124.80. Union Steamships have neglected to mark these accounts \"paid\". I am therefore attaching their covering letter which refers to \"fares paid\". Since it would necessitate a further delay of three weeks to send the accounts back for a \"paid\" notation, I trust the letter and the cheque reference will be satisfactory evidence that this item was paid. The Union Steamships letter arrived during my absence from the office and this is the first mail by which it could be forwarded.\n\nRegarding overpayment to Robert Barton, attached is this Agency's voucher 801, correcting this overpayment in voucher 89.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Klemtu Indian Day School\n\nWhen annual school paint requisition was forwarded it was hoped the above school would not require attention this year. No inspection of the premises had been made since November.\n\nThis spring it was evident the whole building should have attention. Mr. Davey has informed that no funds will be available for outside painting.\n\nIt is felt that the interior of the class room, hall and teacherage should receive attention at least. Attached is school requisition covering paint required to do a minimum job this year to carry over until a complete painting can be undertaken. Floor varnish is already on hand.\n\nMr. Feder Hoiland, husband of the teacher, can do this work on an hourly basis. His accounts for time can be vouchered as received.\n\nI recommend that this paint be supplied at once and shipped to Mr. Hoiland in order that the work may proceed during the holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. H. Brown,\nSub. Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Klemtu Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Supt. Pruden's letter of June 30th attached, a total of nine gallons of paint is required for interior painting of the above-mentioned school and labour costs are estimated at approximately $150. A total of $200 should meet the cost of both material and labour and I would recommend that this amount be encumbered and that I be authorized to purchase the paint in Vancouver.\n\nAlthough Mr. Pruden suggests that labour costs can be paid by voucher I think it would be preferable in this case, as payment is to be made on an hourly basis, to forward him an accountable advance of $150.00.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nSecretary\n\nIn May of 1949, while in Vancouver, I lost a cheque paid to me by your dept. for work on Indian schools in B.C. The Indian commissioner of the Bank of Montreal asked me to wait 6 weeks before writing to you to see if the unendorsed cheque had been returned or if it had been found and cashed by someone outside of Vancouver.\n\nI lost it after bank closing time on Saturday and notified the bank 18 am Monday - so would be grateful for any information you may be able to give. The cheque was over $100 and the bank suggested I write to you immediately.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Nordin\n7th August, 1950.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of August 2nd regarding the attached communication from Mr. E. Norden, this man was employed as construction foreman during the erection of the new school at Klemtu. Wages on the project were paid from the office of the Indian Superintendent at Bella Coola, but from the information on file, I doubt if any payment amounting to $1700 was made to Mr. Norden. Furthermore no one in this office has any recollection of Mr. Norden having complained with regard to the loss of a cheque for this amount.

It seems very peculiar to me, that the Roman Catholics, with much smaller schools than ours, should be receiving government grants, whilst our schools are receiving none. If our schools were in the same villages as theirs I might understand it; but in no way whatever does our schools interfere with theirs. One of our schools is on the Quamichan Reserve where two thirds of the people petitioned for it, some three years ago. The Roman Catholics have never had a school. The other school is on the same facts apply as in the Quamichan case.\n\nBoth of our schools are regularly inspected by Mr Green, and results of his inspection duly reported to Ottawa.

He suggests that some assistance in the way of shoes, clothing, etc., should be given them, so that they may be able to attend the school.\n\nThis would appear to be a case where it would be more advisable to send these boys to an industrial school and I have to ask you to look into the matter and report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools, on the Koksilah school, dated\nJanuary 30, 1911. Original on File 295667/6\n\nThree boys who attend are in very destitute circumstances, their father is dead, their mother re-married to a worthless young fellow, who refuses to provide for them. If the step-father cannot be made to provide for them I would recommend that these three boys receive some assistance in the way of clothes and shoes, so that they may attend the school without suffering from the cold. They cannot read yet, but wish to attend school. Failing this I should recommend their being placed in an Industrial school. So far they have only had such old shoes, etc., as the teacher could give them. Their names are Jones Louis, Lester Louis and Joseph Louis and I should think them to average from eight to twelve years.\nOttawa, July 19, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of May 15th, last, in which you were asked for a report in regard to three destitute boys in attendance at the Kekeliah day school.

The eldest is too\nold, the two younger ones went to Kuper Island industrial\nschool on probation for a few weeks last July, when it was\nfound that they were not at all adapted for school life and\nwere sent home.\n\nI agree with the suggestion made by Mr. Green to\nprovide shoes and clothing as an experiment I gave them\neach one pair of shoes and pants, after they received the\nclothing they attended very regularly.\n\nThe teacher reports them dull and stupid and although\nthey have attended school for some years they have not got\nbeyond the first standard.\n\nI consider it in the best interest of the children\nand the schools in cases similar to the above to give slight\nassistance in clothing, etc., from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

The average attendance last quarter was 6.08, but Mr. J.A. Rockstader expected a good showing this quarter, this generally being the best quarter in the year, as the Indians are now all home.

We have concluded that, to do the work satisfactorily, a man should be on the Reserve and not at the village where this property is situated, and the school should be situated where the girls could attend as well as the boys. Such is not the case where the building is now situated since they have to travel some two miles through the woods. We have secured a property close by the reserve and near enough for the children to attend. We will build a suitable mission house and place of worship. A school building will be needed. One suitable for the location will cost about $1500, and I herewith make request to the Department that provision be made for a school building to be put up during the coming summer. If the Department desired it, our man on the ground, Mr. Docksteader, would be able to oversee the erection of the building. The church will be prepared to deed over to the Department the land upon which the school building is built.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEL. TF.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I might add for the information of the Department that for the entire quarter all of the pupils customarily attending the school have been with their parents at the Fraser river fishing, and from there to the hop fields.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher Koksilah day school.\nOttawa, March 11, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo in reference to the erection of a new school for the Indians of the Kekilah reserve, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your suggestion that a building should be erected on the land owned by the church where the church proposes to erect a mission house and church is noted.\n\nIt is recognized that a school located where proposed would be more central than the one now in use and the Department is of opinion that it might be well for the church when erecting the other two buildings above mentioned to also erect a suitable day school with sufficient accommodation for the number of children that will attend, the building when completed and necessary land in connection with it to be then transferred to the Department, it to be understood that the Department would only pay be called upon to pay the actual cost of construction. The Department would like to have your views on this suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

A. Dockstader, teacher of the Koksilah Day School, in which he states that the school was closed during the September quarter, last, on account of the pupils being away with their parents at the fishing and hop fields.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that if Mr. Dockstader was present on the reserve during the quarter his salary for that period will be paid to the Methodist Missionary Society and you will instruct him to be good enough to prepare and forward a return giving the names of the pupils and stating thereon the reasons why the school was closed and the salary will then be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW.

Cairns on the Koksilah Day School.\n\nFor six months of the year the attendance is fairly good. There is some chance to make progress. English is not used in the homes and so slow progress is made in acquiring English. The matter of erecting new buildings is under consideration. A school house, a chapel and a residence for the teacher are contemplated. In that connection, provision will be made for a \"School Garden\". I find a ready response from all with whom I have spoken in connection with this. Some complain that the school hours from 9 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. are too long. Part of this time could be spent with advantage in the garden learning to cultivate the soil and producing flowers and vegetables.\nOttawa, November 25th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector W.F.

I took the matter up with Mr. Dockstader and he said he would require the assistance of the truant officer to help him in getting a more regular attendance.

In my judgment it would be absolutely impossible for a teacher to give all his time to the school. It is a very difficult matter for him to get an attendance for 200 teaching days in the year, and outside of that there would be absolutely nothing to do. If any change is made in the policy on this particular Reserve, I would suggest that it be in the form of an Instructor in Gardening and farming. The Church purchased 25 acres of land and about 2 of this is very good agricultural land and well adapted for gardening. I think that a fine object lesson might be made for the Indians by having a first class garden, but to put a Missionary and Teacher among a handful of Indians would be more of an object lesson to the Indians in the way of getting the.\n\nWe have a splendid plant there and a very nice house, outbuildings, Church and School-house, and if any arrangement can be made whereby a second employee can be obtained, he can be used in the way of Industrial training and object lessons to the Indians, and I would strongly favor such a move, but to put a man in charge of the Mission work and a teacher in charge of the School would be an outrage on the part of His Church and State that I do not think could be justified.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

It is my belief that there is certainly not sufficient work to warrant the expense out of a missionary and teacher. In my judgment it would be absolutely impossible for a teacher to live off his time to the school. It is a very difficult matter for him to get accommodation for two months. Even in the year, and I believe it that there could be absolutely nothing to do. If any change is made in the policy on this particular reserve, I would suggest that it be in the form of an instructor in gardening and farming. The school purchased by Mr. H. Land and about 30 acres of land is very good agricultural land and well adapted for cultivation. I think it is a fine subject lesson that should be made for the Indians by having a first class garden, but to put a missionary and teacher among a handful of Indians would be more of an object lesson to the Indians than any other thing.\n\nWe have a telephone plant there and a very nice house, schoolhouse, church and schoolhouse, and if any arrangement can be made whereby a second one-roomed building can be obtained, we shall be able to the way of industrial training and subject lessons to the Indians, and I would strongly recommend a move, but to put a man in charge of the Indians' work and a teacher in charge of the school so I see no other use the post of the Church and State that I do not think could be justified.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

H. Cairns, the question of a janitor was discussed, and we both thought that if the position could be given to one of the pupils who regularly attend, with the understanding with the parents that it include such scavenger work as required for toilets, etc., it would be a good policy. During the past the teacher has attended to the sweeping, lighting fires, and hiring a scrubwoman at his own expense, as well as having the scavenging work done. This position could be filled for at least $50.00 per year and would relieve the teacher of a very undesirable and unpleasant occupation, which is really not his duty. It would furthermore create a better interest in the school by having a janitor appointed by the Dept. from among the families whose children attend most regularly.\n\nSgd. C. A. Dockstader,\nTeacher\nOttawa, February 4, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo enclosing Quit Claim Deed from the Methodist Church in Canada to His Majesty King George V., as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, of the lot at Koksilah, B.C., on which the school building was erected by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this deed is satisfactory and has been accepted by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He will also be told to have oversight of the pupils of other schools in the Cowichan Agency, in order that they may go to school regularly in future.\n\nI may say that the Department is pleased to learn that satisfactory conditions prevail at the Kuper Island school.\n\nThe Department approves of your action with respect to the outbreak of smallpox at Gateway, Montana.

Ditchburn Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that the Department has learned that the attendance at the day schools in the Cowichan Agency, particularly at the Koksilah School and the Quamichan School is far from satisfactory, and therefore, it is desired that you will give particular attention to have the pupils go to school regularly. It is important that they shall take advantage of the arrangements made for their education, and you should impress this fact both upon the parents and the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Constable O'Connell came to Duncan the same day and I instructed him as truant officer to see that all the available pupils were sent to school. I am of the opinion that if a little more firmness were used by both Agent Robertson and Constable O'Connell to see that the children went to school more regularly good results would be obtained. In this particular instance sickness among the children has had a good deal to do with the poor average attendance, but at other times the attendance at this school is not what it ought to be.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. W.E. Ditchburn\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing the March quarter return of the Koksilah Indian Day School, together with a voucher for payment of the teacher's salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot decide as to the amount of salary due Mr. Dockstader, the teacher, as the school was closed the entire quarter on account of his illness. It is noted that by the returns received that this school has only been open 10 days since the summer holidays, namely, six days in the September quarter and four days in the December quarter, 1918. Full salary has been allowed for the September and December quarters, but before payment of salary for the March quarter can be made it will be necessary for the teacher to forward a certificate from a doctor stating that he was unable to teach on account of illness. You should also state whether he received any authority from you or from the health authorities to close the school during the epidemic of influenza.\n\nIt is considered that if this school cannot be kept in operation it might as well be closed. You should furnish a full report concerning the conditions at this point and also state as to the likelihood of the school being open continuously in future, and also, as to the amount of salary you consider Mr. Dockstader should receive for the March quarter. A reply is desired so that the amount of salary due the teacher can be paid before the accounts are closed for the fiscal year 1918-19.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.

Johnson, in \nregard to the health of Rev. C. A. Dockstader, teacher \nof the Komilikah Indian day school, to say the teacher \nwas threatened with a nervous breakdown.\n\nI may add that during the month of November \nand December last while the epidemic of Influenza was \nso bad among the Indians, Mr. Dockstader worked very hard, \nvisiting, advising and nursing them until he was taken \ndown with the disease himself, although he recovered, he \nis still suffering from the after effects of the \ndisease.\n\nThe school was closed in the last December quarter on the recommendation of the Department's medical officer Dr. W. Dykes, on account of a suspected case of measles in October and an epidemic of Influenza in November and December. There was no sickness among the children during the March quarter.\n\nIn regard to amount of salary to be allowed \nfor the March quarter, I consider that one half of grant \nfor the quarter, if allowed would be fair and right.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq., \nAsst. Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs \nOttawa.\nAs to continuing the school, Mr. Dockstader, re-opened it on the 28th, ultimo. There are 13 children who could attend if their parents are at home, but the children's parents are either Roman Catholic or Shakers.\n\nI will report later, about the end of the present quarter as to the prospects of keeping the school open continuously.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the number of days the Koksilah School was closed during the past year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your explanations in regard to this matter are satisfactory. It is hoped that you will be able to keep this school open more regularly during the present year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. A. Dockstader,\nKoksilah Indian Day School,\nKoksilah, B. C.\nMethodist Indian Mission,\nKoksilah, B.C., Aug 7, 19\u2014\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from the Indian Agent informing me of a communication which he had received from the Department, and from which the following is an excerpt:\n\nIt is noted by the returns that this school\u2014Koksilah\u2014was only open forty-two days in the month of June quarter, closed during the entire March quarter, was only open four days during the December quarter last, and six days in the September quarter last, etc., etc.\n\nIt is only just to myself that I be permitted to make a personal explanation, and to disclaim any personal responsibility for the conditions cited. September quarter is always a difficult one in which to have school at all. The Indians leave here in August for the hop picking, and do not return as a rule until the last of September. It is usually the last week in September before there are any pupils here to open school with. December quarter was closed the entire quarter, with the exception of the six days mentioned, by order of the M.H.O. for the district on account of Influenza. The ban was not lifted until well on in January for the school. During the entire March quarter and until after Easter in the June quarter I was so ill that it was quite impossible that I should have re-opened the school. As a matter of fact I reopened the school for the sake of getting it going again, although in no condition of health to do it.\nI have no authority to engage a substitute while ill, and could not have possibly attended to it even if I had.\n\nI quite recognize the fairness of the attitude of the Department, and agree with them that the school should be kept open whenever children are here to attend it. I think if you will investigate my record for the past several years you will see that I have always been faithful in the discharge of my duties, and that the school has never been closed through any neglect on my part.\n\nI simply wanted to make this explanation as it is not a pleasant thing to face during the coming year, that there should be any feeling of dissatisfaction with my personal actions in the discharge of my duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. A. Stockstader\nMethodist Missionary.\nOttawa, July 17, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the June quarter return of the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted by the returns that this school was only open forty-two days during the June quarter, was closed during the entire March quarter, was only open four days during the December quarter, last, and six days in the September quarter, last. Although the influenza epidemic interfered with the work, still it is considered that this school should have been in operation a greater number of days than it was. It is hoped that, if Mr. Dockstader continues as teacher during the next year, that he will be able to keep this school open continuously, as it is not worth while continuing the school unless a great improvement is shown in respect to the number of days it is open. You will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans, B.C.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRES ON THE KOKSIKAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school has been closed on account of the illness of the teacher. He had a relapse after an attack of the Spanish influenza. School re-opened April 26th. Since that date 15 pupils have been in attendance representing nine families.\n\nThe teacher thinks that the prospects of the school are good for this year. In the past many pupils from this school have gone to Ceqaleetza Industrial school.\n\nThe parents seem inclined to send their children to the day school.\n\nDate of Inspection\u2014May 26th, 1919.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 2nd and 3rd instants regarding the attendance and days taught at the Koksilah Indian Day School and enclosing a certificate of health from Dr. L. H. Johnson in regard to the health of the teacher, Rev. C. A. Dockstader.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as the school was closed on account of the illness of the teacher owing to the influenza epidemic which visited the reserve, it is considered that it was through no fault of the teacher that he was unable to carry on his duties during the quarter and a cheque for the full salary due is being sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, to whom payment of the salary for this school is made.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Dockstader resumed duties on the 28th of April last. It is hoped that he will be able to secure a good attendance of all the Indian children of school age during the balance of the school year.\n\nThe Department will await your reply at the end of the present quarter as to the prospects of continuing this school after that time.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station,\nB. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving in mind the necessity of increased efficiency of the school under my charge, I am making the following request:\n\nActing as I am in the dual capacity of Missionary and teacher on this reserve, I find that it has become very difficult to so divide the two so that they will not clash. It has been somewhat of an annoyance, and also detrimental to the best interests of the school work.\n\nI have tried to so arrange my work so that this will not be necessary, and I have also tried to impress upon them the fact that they must call at other times, but I must say that it has been a most difficult matter to get them to do so. I have thought that if your department could oblige me by sending me a notice, either printed or typed, stating that from your standpoint you were not favorable to any unnecessary calls at the school during hours, and which I would place in a conspicuous place near the building, it would be of considerable assistance. In any event they would thus understand that I was not acting entirely on my own initiative in discouraging these calls.\n\nNaturally there are legitimate visits that I am always pleased to have from those who may come to visit the school as a school. But I am desirous that the other part of my work may be handled out of the regulation hours.\n\nThanking you in advance for any assistance you can render,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Inspector recommends a change of policy regarding this school. He states that a qualified teacher should be placed in charge so that the work may be taken up in September and vigorously pushed.\n\nIt would seem that a change in teacher at this school is needed and I, therefore, place this matter before you for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

It is now absolutely necessary in the interest of the Indian children that he take a Normal School course if he is to do justice to the work. I hereby recommend a change of policy regarding this school. A qualified teacher should be placed here so that the work may be taken up in September and vigorously pushed.

You should point out to the Indians the interference in the work of conducting the classes which their visits on matters other than those pertaining to the school work occasions to yourself and the pupils.

A. Dockstader.\nOttawa, February 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th ultimo, referring to the education of the Indian children on the Cowichan reserve. I have noted that there are 80 children of school age in the Quamichan, Comoxaken, Ahnapson, Clamalamute, Somence and Koksilah bands.\n\nAs you may know, at one time there were two day schools for the Quamichan band, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic and Methodist churches. These were closed in 1917 and 1912, respectively, because of poor attendance. There was a Roman Catholic school for the Somence band which met a similar fate in 1910. There remains now the one Koksilah Indian Day School, with an average attendance of about 10.\n\nI have noted that you have made a careful study of the educational needs on the Cowichan, and the Department is giving earnest consideration to your suggestions. As soon as funds can be provided we will endeavour to build a day school on the north of the river, between the Quamichan and Comoxaken bands. You might inform the Department if we own any school buildings in the vicinity and if any school equipment, such as desks and blackboards, is available. The Department's policy is to allow a church to have the supervision over these day schools, and it is thought that this school to the north of the river should be conducted under the Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nFor the requirements of the children to the south of the river, you have recommended the moving of the Koksilah Indian Day School. In reply I wish to state that we have taken up with the Methodist Church authorities the advisability of moving their school to a point near the Koksilah railway station. I believe it would be advisable to have it continue under their auspices. Would you give an estimate of the cost of moving this building and intimate to the Department if its condition would permit of such moving. I understand that it was erected in 1916 and is the property of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

In the past the education of the Indian children of the Quamichan, Somenos and Koksilah bands has met with little success, due to poor attendance. Four Indian day schools, two Roman Catholic and two Methodist, have been in operation from time to time. At present there is but one school in operation, the Koksilah Indian Day School, under the auspices of the Methodist church.\n\nMr. Agent Lomas, of Duncan, B.C., feels that there should be two Indian day schools on the Cowichan reserve and that one should be built on the north side between the Quamichan and Comoxen bands for the Indian children north of the Cowichan reserve; the Khemispson and part of the Clemclemalute bands would have access to this school.\n\nThe Indians south of the river could send their children to the Koksilah Indian Day School if it were moved to a point near the Koksilah railway station. Then it could cater to the needs of the Somenos and Koksilah bands and to the Quamichan and Clemclemalute who live south of the river.\n\nIn view of our agent's report, will you investigate, on behalf of the Methodist Missionary Society, the advisability of moving the Koksilah Indian Day School to a point near the Koksilah railway station. This matter should be attended to without delay, as Mr. Agent Lomas claims the building is in danger of being washed away during high water.\n\nI might add that as soon as the Department can build north of the river, the Roman Catholic church will be asked to secure a teacher, as they have a strong cause at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nFebruary 2nd, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM REGARDING THE REQUEST OF MR. AGENT LOMAS TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE RESERVES IN THE CONICHAH AREA.\n\nQuamichan Reserve:\nThere were formerly two Indian schools in operation on this reserve, viz: the Quamichan day school under the auspices of the R.C. church and the Cowichan under the auspices of the Methodist church. The R.C. school was closed June 30, 1917. The Indians were away from the reserve from April to October of each year and there was a very poor attendance during the winter months. The Methodist school was open for a few years. It was closed June 30, 1912, on account of poor attendance.\n\nSomenga Reserve:\nA school was opened on this reserve in 1900 and carried on under R.C. auspices. It was closed in 1910 on account of want of interest on the part of the Indians and the poor attendance.\n\nKoksilah Reserve:\nThere is at present a school conducted on this reserve under the auspices of the Methodist church. There is an enrolment of 18 and an average attendance of 9. The teacher, Janet H. Gibson, is paid a salary of $750 per annum.\n\nThere have never been schools on the Comeaken, Khenipson, or Clamclemaluta Reserves.\n\nThe latest census returns available are for the year 1916, but it is noted that the agent states there are approximately 80 children of school age on the above reserves. They belong to the Methodist and R.C. denominations.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report the following matter for your information and advice, in regard to the education of Indian children in this Agency, adjacent to Duncan and embracing the Quamichan, Comoxen, Thompson, Clonelalute, Soquenos and Koksilah Indian Reserves.\n\nIn this area there are approximately eighty children of school age, and the only school being the Koksilah Day School with an average of twenty pupils, and average attendance of nine. The reason of the small attendance being that this school is situated on an isolated corner of the Reserve, rendering it impossible to get a greater attendance owing to the great distance the children have to walk.\n\nIt seems to be imperative that if the children on the above Reservations are to receive an education that a new day school will have to be built at a point to be decided upon, between Quamichan and Comoxen Reserves, on the north side of the Cowichan River, which would give access to the Comoxen, Thompson, part of the Clonelalute children and those on the Quamichan Reserve lying to the north of the river.\n\nI understand that the Methodist Mission Society are about to approach the Department with a view of having the Koksilah Indian day School moved to a point near the Koksilah Railway Station, which would then give access to part of the Clonelalute, the Soquenos, and Koksilah bands and those on the Quamichan reserve, lying to the south of the Cowichan River.\n\nI have made a careful study of this question, and should like to most strongly point out to you, that if the Department see fit to build a new school and move the Koksilah school, that qualified teachers be appointed and that they be absolutely non-sectarian and that no religious instruction be allowed in the schools during school hours.\n\nMy reasons for suggesting this are, that in a scattered area as this, that we must insist upon the children attending the school within their reasonable reach, irrespective of their religious followings, and I feel certain that should the Department carry out something along these lines, that both the Protestant and Roman Catholic Institutions would be agreeable.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-1, part 1)\nA few days ago the Reverend Father Scheelen, the Reverend Mr. Gibson, and Mr. R. H. Chirnside, Inspector of Indian School for B.C., called at my office in regard to schools etc.; I made the suggestion that no religious instruction should be given during school hours; to this I think I can safely say that they were agreeable, and to me it seems the only way of getting the children educated and avoiding the long standing grievance that now exists.\n\nUnder this head and having regard to the present Komilik Indian Day School, I should like to point out to the Department that this school is in danger of being washed away yearly during high water. It is situated on an island in the Cowichan River, consisting of about two acres, and during the high water in November last, a considerable portion of the Island was washed away, and the bridge over which the children cross to school was also washed out.\n\nThe question might be asked why most of the children are not sent to the Kuper Island Industrial school; to this might I say, that this school is at present practically full to its capacity, and I am sorry to say that over fifty per cent of the pupils being from outside this Agency.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlfred W. Lowne,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, March 16th, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing the resignation of Miss Janet Gibson and the application of her sister for the position of teacher of the Koksilah Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the qualifications of Miss Phyllis Gibson are in order, and the Department will approve of her appointment.\n\nMr. Agent Lomas is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

This resignation was forwarded along with the application of Miss Phyllis Gibson by the Rev. T. Ferrier, Supt. of Methodist Indian Schools.\n\nThe appointment of Miss Phyllis Gibson to the position of teacher of the Koksilah Indian day school is approved. It is understood that her salary will be the same as that received by her sister.\n\nKindly inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Have notified Miss Phyllis that her application will be acceptable with the sanction of the Dept. Will you kindly notify her.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nRev. J. Ferrier,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly accept my resignation as teacher of Koksilah Indian Day School. I know it is not customary to leave in the middle of a term, but I had put my application in for training as a nurse at the Duncan Hospital, expecting to go there at the end of the summer, instead of which I have received a hurried call. If you will accept my resignation in favor of my sister Phyllis she will take over my duties at the end of March.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJanet Robertson.\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith apply for position of teacher of the Hoksilah Indian Day School in place of my sister, who wishes to go into training for a nurse.\n\nIf you remember I taught the Indian Day School at Bella Coola for some time. Rev. A.

In the meantime, I may say that the school at Koksilah may be in danger of being washed by the river, any undermining would hardly occur in the next ten years. But bank is gradually washing away and will eventually reach the foundation of the building. It all depends upon flood conditions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\n\nIndustrial School.\n\nGD.\nHaving reference to yours of the 9th, February last in regard to Day Schools in this locality, I would say I can get no trace of any school equipment outside of what is now used at the Present Kokiliah Indian Day School.\n\nIt is gratifying indeed to hear that the Department intend giving consideration to my request to build a school near the Quamichan Reserve.\n\nI am endeavoring through the Reverend Mr. Gibson, Methodist Missionary at Kokiliah to get the use of a small church at Quamichan for school purposes temporarily, the church in question being practically abandoned by the Methodist Mission.\n\nHaving regard to the removal of the present Indian Day School at Kokiliah, I am afraid that it would be impossible to move this building intact, it being built on solid concrete foundation, and furthermore the road over which it would have to be moved is very narrow and uneven.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nAlfred H. Lomas,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussel T. Merier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 29, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 175-T-2, referring to the day schools on the Cowichan reserve. I have noted that there appears to be no school equipment, other than what is at present in use, and that it would be inadvisable to move the Koksilah Indian Day School to a more central point.\n\nI am hopeful that we may be in a position to build a day school north of the river, on the Quamichan reserve, which will be conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. Would the educational needs for your locality be met, if this school were put in operation and the Koksilah Indian Day School, under Methodist auspices, continued its activities on the present site?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlfred H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your official letter of February 9th #295667-1:\n\nI have recently visited these reserves. The Methodist Missionary Society owns a school building on the north side of the river situated on reserve land. If this is of any value to the Department to start school on the Quenichen reserve, the Church will be quite willing to give the building which may be removed if not in the best location, without any formal transfer.\n\nThe Kokailah school is not in any immediate danger by the floods of the river. It may be safe for many years. The danger is in having the children going to and from the school during high water. If it is thought best to move the building to the village the Methodist Church has a house and lot there that may be obtained providing it has not been sold. It is now up for sale.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa, June 17, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding the establishing of school facilities for the children on the Quinichan Reserve, I beg to say that a communication has been received from Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, in which he states that the Methodist Missionary Society owns a school building on the north side of the river, situated on reserve land; and that, if this will be of any value for school purposes on the Quinichan Reserve, the church would be quite willing to give it for that purpose. Mr. Ferrier states, further, that if this building is not in the best location, it could be removed without any formal transfer from the church authorities.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will report whether this building would be suitable for school purposes to be conducted for the benefit of the Methodist Indian children residing on the reserve. You should also state whether the present situation of this building is central to meet the requirements of a majority of the children. If not centrally located, but suitable for school purposes, would you recommend that the building be removed to a more central site. I shall be pleased, also, if you will state approximately what it would cost to fit this building up for classroom purposes and, if necessary, to remove it to another location. If this building is utilized, it will be necessary to supply desks, blackboards, etc., and the number and size of the desks and dimensions of the blackboards, with full shipping directions should be given.\n\nWe shall be pleased to receive full particulars regarding the above, together with your opinion as to the advisability of utilizing this building for the purpose of providing school facilities for the children of the Methodist parents on the reserve. As soon as this information is received, we will be in a position to decide whether we will undertake the expense involved in fitting up the building and furnishing the classroom. I should also like you to state the number of children of school age who are Methodist and would likely attend if the school was opened.\n\nAs you have been informed, the Department is giving consideration to the question of erecting a school on this reserve for the benefit of the children of the Roman Catholic faith. As soon as our Supplementary Estimates have been passed, we will be in a position to decide whether a new building for the education of the Catholic children will be erected this year or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As soon as his reply is received, we will be in a position to decide as to whether we can utilize this building or not.\n\nIn the meantime, I beg to thank you for the offer of this building without any formal transfer, if required for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Fowler,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI hereby wish to call the attention of the Indian Department to the fact that there are at present 85 catholic children of school age in the Cowichan district without the benefits of education. In the Somass reserve near Duncan, there are twenty catholic children of school age only four of them attend a new school regularly a school conducted by the auspices of the Methodist church at Hosilatla, at a distance of between two or three miles.\n\nOn the roll of that school - the only school in the district - are 13 children, all of these except one, are catholic children.\n\nAccording to the regulations relating to the education of native children, schools under catholic auspices should be treated I know, but again complaints have been received that the Indian day school is not a success. Still I believe the day school will be a success, if the teacher be paid a salary fairly commensurate with her work and the legal provision for compulsory education be enforced.\n\nI am aware the Dept. that no missionary I can be counted upon to do all in my power to help in the work of education.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Francis Bouchard,\nCatholic priest.\nOttawa, July 8, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his recent visit to the Koksilah Indian Day School, recommends that Dr. Watson, the Medical Health Officer, be requested to examine the pupils after the holidays, say October next.\n\nYou may arrange with the Doctor to visit this school and make an examination of the pupils, also to furnish a report through your office of any cases requiring special medical attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It will, therefore, not be necessary for you to furnish a report, as requested in our letter of the 17th instant, regarding the removal of this building to a central site, and have it fitted up for classroom purposes. I may further add for your information that an amount has been provided in our Supplementary Estimates for the current year for the erection of a new day school building on this Reserve for the benefit of the children of the Roman Catholic faith.

A new school building was erected in 1915, on land transferred from the Methodist Church to this Department.\n\nI am requesting Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, who is at present in British Columbia, to visit this reserve and enquire into the point raised by Rev.

For your information, I might state that the school at Koksilah was first started under the auspices of the Methodist Church on or about September first, 1909.

Inasmuch as the Roman Catholics and the Methodists are the two religious bodies concerned and for some time past the only school operated for the two Reserves being at Koksilah under the management of the Methodist Church, I would agree to the proposal of undenominational schools being established providing a Roman Catholic teacher is engaged for the Quamichan children and a Protestant teacher engaged for the Koksilah Reserve.\n\nIn agreeing to this arrangement we do so with the hope that all Protestant children on the Quamichan side will attend the school with the Roman Catholic teacher, and that all Roman Catholic children on the Koksilah side will attend the school with the Protestant teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCOPY\n\nPlaced on File 295667-1\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer again to your letter of June 12th, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Father Beshouwers, of Duncan, B.C., with reference to the religion of the children in attendance at the Koksilah Indian Day School which has been conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church.\n\nAs I intimated to you in my communication of this file number, of June 17th, I asked the Superintendent of Indian Education to visit the reserve and enquire into the point raised by you and the Rev. Father. Our officer reports that the children attending the Koksilah Indian Day School are both Protestant and Roman Catholic and that the school should be conducted along the undenominational lines. The present Teacher, Miss Phyllis Gibson, will remain in charge for the coming academic year, but it will not be part of her duties to give religious instruction of any kind.\n\nIf it is your wish that the Roman Catholic pupils at the Koksilah Day School receive religious instruction, the Department will be pleased to arrange for our agent to set aside an hour a week when Father Beshouwers could meet the children of your faith. The Methodist Church Missionaries would be given similar opportunity to direct the religious training of the Protestant children in attendance. In the event of this arrangement the children, upon admittance to the school, will have to be classified as Roman Catholic or Protestant.\n\nI trust that this arrangement to conduct the Koksilah Day School in an undenominational manner will be satisfactory to you and to the Rev. Father Beshouwers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 21st ultimo, referring to the future policy in connection with the Quamichan and Kokilah Indian Day Schools, near Duncan, B.C., as you are aware, the Superintendent of Indian Education visited this reserve this summer and, after a conference at which the Indian Agent, the Inspector of Indian Schools and Roman Catholic and Methodist Church representatives were present, it was decided that the Kokilah School should be classed as undenominational. The present Teacher, Miss Rhylle Gibson, will remain in charge, but there should be no religious instruction offered to the pupils in attendance.\n\nThe Department believes that all the Protestant children resident in the vicinity are close enough to this school to attend. It is understood that the Roman Catholic children who are nearer the Kokilah than the Quamichan school will also attend the first mentioned class.\n\nI might inform you that the Department is erecting a day school on the Quamichan Reserve, close to the Indian Village of Comoxen. As all the children in this vicinity are Roman Catholic, this school will be conducted under the auspices of that church.\n\nI have noted that you would agree to both schools being undenominational; but the Department has ruled that the Kokilah School, due to the mixed population, should be undenominational and that the Quamichan School, which could contain no Protestant children - as there are none living in the vicinity, should be Roman Catholic. Mr. Indian Agent Lomas is being informed of this decision and we are asking him to communicate with Rev. Mr. Gibson and the Rev. Father Boshowers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Father Boshouwer, of Duncan, B.C., and endorsed by His Lordship the Bishop of Victoria, referring to the desire of the Roman Catholic Church in connection with the management of the Koksilah Indian Day School, formerly conducted under Methodist auspices. I have noted that it is your request that no religious instruction be offered the pupils in attendance at the above mentioned school, and I wish to assure you that our agent will be informed of your wishes, and will arrange for the classes to be carried on in a strictly undenominational manner.\n\nI would suggest that you intimate to Father Boshouwer the desirability of having the Roman Catholic children attend this school if it is nearer to their homes than the new school being erected at Quamichan.\n\nYou might inform the resident missionary that if conditions continue to warrant the erection of another day school on the Somenos Reserve, near Duncan, this will receive the serious consideration of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nOttawa, October 11, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to refer further to the subject matter of official letter, of this file number, of the 18th ultimo.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to your communication dated 21st September, No. 295667-1, re Kohsilah School, I am enclosing a letter from Father Francis, and endorsed by Bishop Macdonald, in which it is requested that no religion at the present time be taught in the Kohsilah School, under present circumstances they consider this to be the best arrangement.\n\nYou will note that an application is made by them for a day school at Somence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-1, part 1)\nHonorable Sir:-\n\nMay I direct the attention of the Indian Department to the following:\n\nAt a meeting held at Duncan, B.C., Mr. Russell Ferrier presiding, it was decided that a Catholic school be built at Komiaken for the children residing on the Komiaken, Ghenepson, Tlemlimilite, Quamichan reserves.\n\nIt was also proposed that the present Konsilah school -- until now under the auspices of the Methodist Church -- be made either a public school with no religious instruction or a neutral school with religious instruction to be given at stated times after school hours by priest or minister to children belonging to their respective denominations --- this proposed change to be made, as of the eighteen children on the school roll, only six are Methodists, or claimed to be so by the Methodist missionary, the remaining children being Catholics.\nThe approval of this proposition was left to the decision of His Lordship, the Bishop of Victoria. With regard to this school, may I add that the Koheilah school was built under false pretenses. At the time of the erection, only a small number of the children on the roll were Methodists, and there was no prospect whatever of an increase in the future, as time has proved. Again this school was built, the local Indian agent not even having been consulted, as Mr. Robertson can testify. Again it was built in an out-of-the-way part of the district, hardly accessible, necessitating the building of a bridge to reach the school; this bridge has already been swept away by the floods of the Cowichan River, and so will the -- sooner or later -- the school itself. Mr. Ferrier will give you a verbal detailed report on this.\n\nMay I ask the Department that a school under Catholic auspices be built next spring on the Somenos reserve near Duncan. On that reserve there are today 21 (twenty-one) children of school age, all Catholic children, of those only five or six attend at times the Koheilah school. Again, these same children are continually exposed to danger; for to reach the school they are forced to climb over half a dozen fences, cross the railway track and the railway bridge. In case of accident, who will be held responsible?\n\nMay I ask the Department that the Koheilah school be made temporarily a strictly public school with no religious instruction whatever; for we hope also to get one day a Catholic school around Koheilah. I trust to receive a favorable reply.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI enclose the foregoing application.\n\nAlexander Macdonald\nBishop of Victoria\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe she is about to be married, so that her services will be no longer available for that School. I have very much pleasure in nominating for the position Miss Maud Barner, who has completed her Senior Matriculation in the Province of Alberta, which is fully equivalent to the second class standing.\n\nI might mention that Miss Barner is a daughter of the Rev. Arthur Barner, who is doing such valuable work among our Indian people.\n\nTrusting that this nomination may meet with the approval of the Department,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has been informed by the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools that Miss Phyllis Gibson, teacher of the Loksilah Indian Day School, has resigned as from the 30th proximo. The Methodist Church representative nominated a successor, but he was informed that this school was now undenominational and that the appointment would be left with the Department's local officers. Please communicate with Mr. Inspector Cairns and arrange for a suitable successor, as from September first, next. Salary at the same rate as has been allowed Miss Gibson will be paid to a properly qualified incumbent.\n\nInasmuch as the best boarding arrangements can be made with the missionary living near the school, it might be advisable to secure an incumbent who would be willing to make arrangements to live in that home. However, the school is purely undenominational and you and Mr. Cairns will be expected to engage the best teacher available, irrespective of his or her church affiliation. The conduct of the school will continue to be guided by our general regulations and by my No. 296667-1 of September 18th and October 11th, 1922.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I regret that the Department cannot accept your nomination for this school, as it is undenominational. Please see official letter of September 18, 1922, in this connection.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Lomas, of Duncan, B.

Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year. As you were informed in official letter of May 9th, last, salary at the same rate as was allowed Miss Gibson would only be paid to a properly qualified incumbent.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Burner of her appointment, and arrange with her to take up duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays on or about September 1st next.

It is stated that the number of pupils who attend is 21, 19 of whom are Catholic and 2 Protestant.\n\nThis school has been conducted as an undenominational one from September, 1922. It was understood that it would be conducted on strictly undenominational lines, no religious instruction of any kind being given the pupils. Please advise the teacher accordingly.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as to the religious belief of the pupils at present attending. You should state whether you would recommend that the school be conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and a teacher of that denomination appointed as from, say, the beginning of the next school year. If there are only a few Protestant pupils, arrangements might be made to have them placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 22nd instant re. the Koksilah Indian Day School, and asking for a report upon it. I have just obtained from Reverend Mr. Miller, the United Church Missionary, the list of pupils attending this school who are registered in the baptismal book and belonging to the United Church. Out of 21 pupils registered, eight of these are bona fide members of the United Church.\n\nThis school is running very satisfactorily, with an excellent teacher, and considering the distance that the majority of the children have to travel, the attendance is very good. Only a day or two ago I was asked by some of the parents to look over the trail, with a view to having a few planks supplied in order to make the trail more passable.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would not consider for a minute recommending any change in this school, as the parents of all the pupils are well satisfied, and the teacher doing real good work.\n\nI have instructed the teacher that no religious instruction of any kind must be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Creighton also thinks that this Chinese boy who is quite clever, will be a good thing to have among the Indians, and show them how well and quickly the Chinese learn, and will give the others an incentive to work.\n\nI would like to recommend that this child be allowed to go to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, recommending that permission be granted a Chinese boy to attend the Koksilah Indian Day School. It is noted that the teacher is willing to have this boy attend and that there is accommodation for him.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you are in a better position to decide whether the Indians themselves would have any objection to the attendance of a Chinese boy with their children. If there is no objection on the part of the Indians and the teacher is willing to accept him, this Department would agree to his attendance. The matter will be left in the hands of the teacher and yourself to decide. If this boy is allowed to attend, his name should not be included on the quarterly returns of attendance of Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nMr. P. Phalen  \nSuperintendent of education  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFather Scheelen, an old missionary to the Cowichans Indians, and now a resident of Saanich B.C., told me that on the 17th of July 1925 he himself made an agreement with Mr. Gibson, at that time Methodist Minister at Kokilah, by which both of them were entitled to go and teach religion to the children of their respective church, at the Kokilah school after school hours. Both of them agreed to this, because, if I am not mistaken, there were not enough Methodist children to keep up the school and also because it was impossible to the Government to grant a needed Catholic school at Somenos and Kokilah.\n\nThe agreement was oral. It was made in the presence of Mr. Perrier, Mr. Cairns and Mr. Lomas, in the Indian Office at Duncan, on the above mentioned date.\n\nAs Mr. Graham does not think that he can rely enough on Father Scheelen's testimony to let me act according to the agreement, I am trying to locate records of this agreement. In the Indian Office, at Duncan, the records show that the meeting took place on the above mentioned date, and that were present all those mentioned by Father Scheelen; but no record is to be found of the agreement. Nothing also in Victoria.\n\nAs the agreement was not official, but was agreed to, if not suggested by Mr. Perrier, the only place where it could be recorded, would be in Mr. Perrier's diary.\n\nMr. Graham agreed that as long as the agreement was never official, it would be better not to make any official request for its acknowledgment. He left it entirely to me to write to you and ask if there is any record or the agreement in your office.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your kind attention, I am adding a few words, yet more personal. Best wishes to you and your family, from a young priest, you have met at Nuper Island during your last visit.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFather R.

Father Lauson in connection with allowing religious instruction for the Roman Catholic pupils at the Kekiskah Indian Day School after school hours.\n\nIn this connection I enclose, for your information, copy of official letter of September 16, 1922, to Very Rev. John Welsh, O.M.I., also copy of official letter of the same date to the former Agent, Mr. Alfred H. Lomas, with which was enclosed a copy of letter to Very Rev.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nRe- the Department letter dated January 3, 1936, No.152-8A-1 allowing religious instruction for Roman Catholic pupils at the Kekalak Indian Day School.\n\nAside from the Lord's Prayer in the morning religion has not been a part of the school curriculum. Up to date there has been no difference made between children of the different denominations and it is probable that with the introduction of these classes some difficulties may arise.\n\nThese instructions would be given after school hours meaning the Roman Catholic children would have to remain an extra hour until four o'clock. Seeing the majority of the children live at a distance of approximately two miles from the school it would mean them getting home very late. The children in the primary grades would probably not attend these classes as they are dismissed at two-thirty.\n\nThis instruction would be a drawback to the school routine. The school must be cleaned and the work for the following day prepared and put on the blackboard. When could this be done if the classroom was in use after school?\n\nI trust that some arrangements can be made where a class can be held that would not conflict with the school routine.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Signed) Ella M. Creighton.\nSir,\n\nI have pleasure in forwarding herewith a letter written by Miss O'Connell, dated January 25th, in connection with the question of the Roman Catholic Indians desiring to be allowed to receive religious instruction at the Roman Catholic Indian Day School.\n\nI took the liberty of writing to both the Missionary and Miss O'Connell, the teacher of Kehewa Indian Day School, and told them to discuss matters between themselves, and to advise me what consequences they came to.\n\nMiss O'Connell has informed me that the Roman Catholic children desire to receive religious instruction from their own people. She also stated that she had discussed the matter with the Missionary and he had pointed out that the Roman Catholic Church does not allow Roman Catholics to attend any other school than their own. Miss O'Connell also stated that she had discussed the matter with the Missionary and he had pointed out that the Roman Catholic Church does not allow Roman Catholics to attend any other school than their own.\n\nI have enclosed copies of letters I received from Miss O'Connell on this subject, and I would be glad of any further information or comment on this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, DATED MARCH 31, 1936, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KOKSILAH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nArrangements have now been made between the teacher and local Roman Catholic Missionary for a Catholic Priest to teach Religion to the Catholic children for an hour after 3 P.M. on Tuesdays. This arrangement has been made in accordance with the agreement arrived at in 1922 or thereabouts and following the receipt of definite instructions on the matter from the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa. The arrangement has been explained in detail to me by teacher and Priest and I consider that it ought to work well in this school.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, DATED MARCH 31, 1936, ACCOMPANYING HIS REPORT OF INSPECTION OF THE KOKSILAH INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Koksilah Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency, which I inspected this morning, March 31st. Previous to my inspection I had a long conference with Mr. Indian Agent Graham with regard to the Indian day schools in his agency, and particularly with regard to the Department's instructions relative to the giving of religious instruction by the local Catholic Priest at this Koksilah Indian Day School. This conference took place yesterday, but I had to wait till this morning to inspect the school as the teacher was ill yesterday and could not go to school.\n\nAfter my inspection of the school this morning I met the local United Church Missionary for a few minutes.\n\nVery good progress is being made at the Koksilah Indian Day School, and I have every reason to think that the good work being done by Miss Creighton will continue. While she was not entirely happy with regard to the giving of religious instruction after school by the Catholic Priest, as it involved some changes in her usual procedure of cleaning the school, etc., I am quite confident that the Department's instructions will be properly carried out. I am very pleased that this matter of instruction for the Catholic children has now been arranged for as mentioned in my report. My inspection this morning was mainly with a view to seeing just what arrangements had been made to comply with the Department's instructions in this matter.\nRe Religious Instruction at the KOKSILAH DAY SCHOOL.\n\nAnswering my letter of the 8 Jan., Mr. Phelan on the 13 Jan., 1936, sent me a copy of a letter to Rev. J. Welch, Ottawa, Sept. 18, 1922, regulating the matter. Here again, I would like to have a few informations. The letter says that \"the school should be conducted along the undenominational lines\". Is there any positive rules made by the Department regarding such schools or are rules made for each case.\n\nThe actual teacher is having the Lord's prayer said, thus following what is done in the schools of the Province. Is that according to the agreement? This matter was referred to the local Agent, who apparently could not reach any decision.\n\nP. S. - Religious instructions at Koksilah. I have been going there after school hours. But I noticed that children are not very willing to stay after school time. Moreover the teacher is taking some children home in her car; of which ride they are deprived when they have to stay. The situation would be worse yet if general transportation was practised. So, if the agreement regarding religious instruction could stand for, I would ask for a certain time during school hours.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn official letter of March 4th, last, you were instructed to make the necessary arrangements for religious instruction of the Catholic children attending the Koksilah Indian Day School. Subsequently, a report received from Inspector Barry stated that it had been agreed to have this instruction between the hours of 3 and 4 P.M. on Tuesday of each week. Please let me know if this arrangement is in effect at the present time and if it meets with the approval of the Catholic missionary, Rev. H. Lauson.\n\nWhen replying, please let me know the number of Catholic children attending this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nHere is my answer to your question of whether or not the actual agreement for religious instruction to the catholic children, attending the Kokeilah School, is meeting with my approval.\n\nAs you remember, the actual arrangement was accepted, only because we could not agree on the meaning of the agreement. But it was understood that the matter could be brought up again.\n\nI have noticed that this arrangement, is not enabling me to reach all the children of the Catholic Faith, as the younger ones are entitled to leave the school before that time, and as I can not see that it is the duty of the teacher to keep those children in school after the regular time.\n\nFurthermore it still seems to me, that according to the text of the agreement, one would be entitled to \"an hour\", during the regular School Time.\n\nI therefore ask for an arrangement, that would realise the purpose of the agreement, which is to enable the Catholic Priest and the United Church Minister to give religious instructions to all the children of their respective Faith.\n\nRegarding the point of the agreement, concerning the teacher, I am not asking to have it put into effect at present.\n\nTrusting that this statement will answer the purpose of the inquiry by the Department, I would ask you to send a copy to the Secretary of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nH.

Lauson for the privilege of giving religious instruction to the Roman Catholic children attending the Koksilah Indian Day School, between the hours of 3 and 4 p.m. on Tuesday of each week.\n\nI might say that this has been taken advantage of since granted last year, but according to Reverend Father Lauson's letter which I am enclosing, he thinks that this should be changed and an hour taken up, during school hours, which I am afraid if granted will interfere with the work, as the teacher finds now that she has difficulty in getting through the work.\n\nThe following is the standing of the children attending this school at the present moment; Protestants - 14, Roman Catholics - 9.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The Department raised no objection on that occasion, as will be seen from the Department's reply to Mr. Graham, copy of which is attached. I am forwarding herewith reports from Inspector Barry, Mr. Indian Agent Moore and Miss Perry, teacher at Koksilah School, on the subject of the attendance of the children in question at Koksilah. These reports are all favorable to these children continuing at Koksilah, and under the circumstances it might be as well to permit them to do so.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O. Box 444\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJune 7, 1939.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter 152-8-1 of April 16th 1939 dealing with the attendance at the Koksilah Indian Day School of certain Chinese pupils, it would now appear to be certain that the Department did give permission to Indian Agent Graham for the attendance of at least one Chinese boy, see Departmental letter 152-8A-1 dated June 1st 1938.\n\nIt happens from time to time that what are here described as Halfbreed children live on the Indian Reserves for some quite good reason. These pupils are living outside Provincial School Districts and there is no place for them to seek an education other than the local Indian Day School. The Chinese children of Hop Ho live on a rented part of the Indian Reserve outside Provincial School Koksilah District and are doing very well in the Indian Day School. The attendance of Chinese pupils at the Koksilah Indian Day School was reported in my letter of November 27th 1936 when forwarding a report on this school, and also in my report of April 16th 1937, March 10th 1938, and December 16th 1938. The children are doing well, have purchased their own supplies and even brought to school their own homemade desks. They are better behaved than the average pupil and give no extra work of any great extent to the teacher. I would most certainly request that they be permitted to continue attendance at the Koksilah Indian Day School while living on the Reserve.\n\nThough I do not know the facts in the case of the Barker children I take it that they are living on the local Indian Reserve and are in fact at least partly of Indian blood. I think that they might well be permitted to continue attendance for the present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nMay 19th, 1950.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th inst., and previous correspondence, file number above noted with reference to Chinese and Chinese children attending the Day schools in this Agency, I beg to submit below a list of the children doing so.\n\nKathleen Barker, 14 years, white, Benghazi School.\nFred Parker, 13 \" \" \" \" \" \"\nGeorge Parker, 12 \" \" \" \" \" \"\n\nDanny Hop No. 14 \" Chinese Nakakolah School\nPoveshugh No. 12 \" \" \" \" \" \"\nGerald Hop No. 10 \" \" \" \" \" \"\n\nIrene Georgeson, 10 \" Halfbreed \" \" \" \"\n\nI am attaching herewith a letter from the Teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School which I trust you will find self explanatory, and in view of her remarks I am not prepared to recommend that they be excluded from the school at this time. I refer to the Chinese children above listed as it would appear as if they are a help rather than a hindrance, to the other pupils. I also think that the case of the halfbreed pupil might be held in abeyance too.\n\nI enclose also a copy of a letter from the Department dated June 1st, 1950 which deals with this question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.M.

It is noted that the teacher is willing to have this boy attend and that there is accommodation for him.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you are in a better position to decide whether the Indians themselves would have any objection to the attendance of a Chinese boy with their children. If there is no objection on the part of the Indians and the teacher is willing to accept him, this Department would agree to his attendance. The matter will be left in the hands of the teacher and yourself to decide. If this boy is allowed to attend, his name should not be included on the quarterly returns of attendance of Indian children.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) A. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nBox 455,\nDuncan, B.C.,\nMay 5, 1939.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 28th, re the children other than Indians attending the Koksilah Indian Day School, I am permitting four children to attend.\n\nThree of them are Chinese, Pansy (age 14) Poppy (age 12) and Oswald (age 10) Hop Wo children of a Chinese farmer, who, I believe, renting land on the reserve. The other one is Irene Georgeson (age 10) halfbreed daughter of Mr. Wm. Georgeson of Saanich, B.C., and whose mother (deceased) was a Koksilah woman.\n\nI have admitted these children by verbal consent of former Indian Agent, Mr. Graham, with the understanding that they should obtain their own supplies, and in no way be dependent on the department. This has been strictly followed, and they are in no way hindering my work with the Indian children.\n\nThese four children are all attending with a good reason. Mr. Georgeson felt that since Irene was more Indian than white, and that for her own happiness and progress in work, she would be better in an Indian school. She is a bright happy youngster, has brought her own books and desk so as to be able to attend. She is no trouble in discipline or attendance. I feel she is a decided help in the class.\n\nThe Chinese children are attending because they are so far from the white school. They, also, have brought their own books and desks. They are very keen pupils and have had almost perfect attendance. I find that they provide enough competition in class work to spur the Indian children on to more neat and accurate work. I find the Chinese and Indians get along nicely socially, and I think it is good for the Indians to meet children of another race. It brings up many lessons in good sportsmanship.\n\nPersonally I would like to keep them as pupils in this school, for they are not taking up any more of my time during school hours, using supplies, or taking up any desks supplied by the\nDepartment for the Indian children, but they are, in my opinion, an asset to this school.\n\nTrusting that this information is satisfactory,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"Florence L. Perry\"\nDuncan, B.C., May 1st, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON GOWICHAN AGENCY FOR APRIL 1939.\n\nWith further reference to the matter mentioned in my report last month about children other than Indians attending some of the day schools in this agency and the statement made by me that the Department was aware of the practice and approved of it in certain cases, I would respectfully refer you to Official letter number 152-8 A-1 and dated June 1st, 1933. You will please see that this letter dealt with the case of a Chinese pupil and the ruling was that it was largely left in the hands of the teacher. As requested by the Commissioner in a recent letter on the matter, I will submit shortly a list of all children, other than Indians, attending these schools, as well as a copy of the letter quoted above.\n\nR.

C.\nOttawa, April 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Agent R. H. Moore, in his monthly report on the Cowichan agency, states:\n\n\"One matter which concerns me a great deal is the matter of White and Chinese children attending the day schools on the Cowichan Indian reserve. These children are the offspring of some of the renters of this reserve, but why their renting privileges should include the education of their children is beyond me. I understand that the Department has knowledge of this and approved of it on certain conditions, but I wish to bring the question to your attention again. I will give the whole question careful study during the next month and if I feel that there should be a change in the policy I will so advise.\"\n\nI was somewhat disturbed to learn that there are White and Chinese children attending Indian day schools in the Cowichan agency. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the attendance of these children was approved by the Department at any time. In any event, it is exceedingly difficult to administer day schools at which White and Indian children are enrolled. There always appears to be difficulty with respect to attendance, the payment of fees for tuition, etc.\n\nThe Indian school population of the Dominion is increasing at the rate of approximately 300 pupils per annum, and we are finding it very difficult indeed to secure the funds necessary to provide accommodation for the Indian pupils of the country.

C.\nI am of the opinion that the accommodation at Indian schools should be reserved for Indian children. In very exceptional cases this regulation might be modified but only on the recommendation of the Indian agent and in the case of British Columbia the Indian Commissioner.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this communication to Indian Agent Moore.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

No authority was given Miss Perry to employ a substitute and under these circumstances the voucher which you forwarded cannot be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. D. Caldwell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nOttawa, June 19, 1939.\n\nRe: Attendance of White and Chinese Children at Indian Day Schools\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 12th instant and also certain letters relating to the above noted subject, enclosed therewith.\n\nIn your letter you state: \"These reports are all favorable to these children continuing at Koksilah, and under the circumstances it might be well to permit them to do so.\"\n\nI was not aware of departmental letter dated June 1, 1933, in which permission was granted a Chinese boy to attend the Koksilah school. In any event, this letter should not be interpreted to mean that white or Chinese children are permitted to attend Indian day schools, unless their attendance has been authorized by the Agent, and in the case of British Columbia, by the Indian Commissioner.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that a year or two ago a regulation was approved by the Minister and passed, whereby half-breed children are no longer eligible for enrolment at residential schools. In view of this regulation, white or Chinese children should not be encouraged to attend our schools, except in exceptional cases and then only on the recommendation of the agent, approved by yourself. It has occurred to me, also, that it might be well to have this recommendation in the case of each school approved at the beginning of each academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Since then arrangements have been made to have the new school bus take two trips to and two trips from the school daily.

His reason for this recommendation is that on certain reserves practically all the Indians are absent both in the month of June and the month of September each year.\n\nAs a result of Commissioner MacKay's recommendations it has been decided to operate the Ste. Catherine's School and the Koksilah School for an eight-month period only during the academic year 1940-41. The former school is conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Church and the latter under United Church auspices. You will, therefore, note that during the coming academic year the Koksilah School will only be in operation for the period October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a general report for the month of May covering the affairs in the Cowichan Agency.\n\nOn account of the large number of Indians leaving this agency for the U.S.A. berry fields, it has meant that the attendance at all the day schools showed a decided drop in the attendance. In previous years, the families of those Indians doing longshoreing did not go away because they had work at home, and they helped to keep the attendance up. This year however, practically all the Indians left who did not have steady employment and took their families with them.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nR.H.

The Reverend Sister Mary Sheila, principal of the St. Catherine's School, received her salary cheque but the other two did not.\n\nAs a delay in the receipt of these cheques has meant considerable inconvenience to Miss Dougall and Mr. Corcoran, I would request that the Department be good enough to investigate the cause of the delay and have the cheques sent at the earliest possible moment.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n(R.H.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am a pupil of St. Catherine's School. I am in the eighth grade for the second year. I am very interested in High School. I thought if I had two years of grade eight I would be able to go to High School. I told the Principal, Sister Mary Sheila, that I wanted to go to High School. Sister told me that all her time was taken up, that she could not possibly teach me grade eight school work. Sister also told me that I had to buy my own books and I thought all Indian Day Schools were supplied with books, from grades one to grade eight. Sister told me that I was old enough to quite school, telling me that I should just be a good Indian girl.\n\nI went to see Mrs. Miller, the Tobinab Indian Day School Teacher. I asked her if she is willing to teach me my eighth grade, she consented and so I want to be transferred.\n\n(Signed) Janet Williams\nDuncan, B. C.\nNovember 27th, 1942.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nWe, the undersigned, Henry Williams and Maggie Williams, members of the Cowichan Band of Indians and the parents of Janet Williams 16 years, hereby request that the necessary permission be granted by the Indian Affairs Branch to allow our daughter Janet to transfer from the St. Catherine's Indian Day school to the Koksilah Indian Day school, in order that she may undertake the necessary studies preparatory to writing High School Examinations next Spring.\n\nSigned: ........................................ Henry Williams\n\n........................................ Maggie Williams\nSt. Catherine's Indian \"Day\" School,\nDuncan, B.C.\nNov. 20, 1942\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nRe: Janet Williams\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in reference to the above named pupil.\n\nReplying to your request for information on Janet's previous education I would say she runs a poor chance of covering in a satisfactory manner the work required for Grade Eight.\n\nAs St. Catherine's School follows a Vocational Training program, the time allotted to class work is naturally limited. Therefore, a pupil of Grade Eight standard in this school cannot compete with pupils following the B.C. Program in preparation for high school. Moreover, this school operates only eight months a year.\n\nWhile Janet has a good head she is wanting in perseverance. She figures well in arithmetic, grammar, spelling and art but lacks background in social studies, literature and science.\n\nIn her letter of application for transfer she states that I told her that she would have to buy her own books if she took eighth grade. This is a misleading statement. These books could have been requisitioned had she expressed a desire at an earlier date to study for high school but since she began only at the end of October there would have been no choice left but to purchase the books required for the grade.\n\nKnowing from experience the work and time required to prepare pupils for high school entrance I cannot see my way clear to put Janet through starting at this late date and closing school in May.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDuncan, B. C.\nNovember 23rd, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter which I received from a pupil of St. Catherine's School called Janet Williams 16 years ago asking that she be permitted to transfer from St. Catherine's Indian Day School to the Koksilah Indian Day School so that she can study with a view to passing her Entrance examination next summer, preparatory to going to High School. I also attach a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Sister Mary Sheila, Principal of St. Catherine's school regarding this matter which I trust you will find self explanatory, and from which it would appear as if the Principal does not wish to accept the responsibility of teaching Entrance subjects to some of her pupils at this late date, for various reasons.\n\nJanet Williams belongs to one of the best and most respected Indian families in the Agency, she is a cousin of Muriel Williams who is attending the Duncan High School, and strange to say Janet used to be a class mate of Muriel's, but a grade lower, when she went to Koksilah School and where she stayed until St. Catherine's opened when she was transferred there. Muriel stayed on at Koksilah and is now at least three grades ahead of Janet. My own opinion is that Janet has the ability and if there were others in the same school that had as much ambition as Janet and were in the same grade as she is I believe that Janet would show that she has perseverance. It is easy to understand why a pupil would lack perseverance at times when she is all alone in a class. At the present time there are two or three other pupils studying for their Entrance Examination at Koksilah Indian Day School, and I personally believe that it might be a good thing if Janet were permitted to transfer there and continue her studies. If she is not permitted to do this I am afraid that she will quit school altogether, and it can do no harm to give her a chance and see how she does at her exams, it will not cost any more and one extra will not make any difference to the Teacher, and I would so recommend.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

As St. Catherine's School is under Roman Catholic auspices and Koksilah Indian Day School is undenominational, having both Catholic and Protestant children, I advised Mr. Moore that it would be necessary to have an application for this transfer from the parents of this girl and this is also enclosed.\n\nIt will be noted in the last paragraph of the Reverend Principal's letter of the 20th ultimo that she cannot see her way clear to put this girl through the entrance course for the reason that the School closes in May. Under the circumstances, I would recommend that the necessary permission be given to Miss Janet Williams to continue her studies at Koksilah Day School for the term ending in June.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing correspondence with reference to Janet Williams' desire to transfer from the St. Catherine's to the Koksilah Day School.\n\nIn the first place I was surprised at the letter written by Sister Mary Sheila to Indian Agent Moore. As you will recall, I wrote to you on November 14 and pointed out that the average attendance at this school for several months past has been extremely small. As a matter of fact the last report received in the fall of 1941 indicated that Sister Sheila had only 22 pupils in her class of whom 4 were in Grade 8. Sister Sheila states in her letter that one of her reasons for not wishing to allot the necessary time for Grade 8 is that the St. Catherine's School follows a vocational programme. May I point out that manual training is an integral part of the British Columbia course of studies and the Department, therefore, cannot understand why this manual training should interfere with the Grade 8 standard.\n\nOn the other hand we have reviewed the returns and they indicate that, while Janet Williams attended school regularly during the March quarter, she only attended 18 days during the months of April and May and during that period was absent for 19 days. It might be concluded from this information that she is not particularly interested in school work.

Moore\nIndian Agent Duncan\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nAs you know I have three children aged eight, eleven and thirteen years. They have been attending St. Catherine Indian School some of the time. At present time they are at home and they are losing too much time from school. One reason for this is, that the river is high and I can not get them across it. This condition will be this way more or less until the winter and spring rains stop.\n\nWe are located much nearer to Koksi\u0142ah Indian Day School, which is within easy walking distance. If my children will be given permission to attend that school they will be able to attend school regularly, which I wish very much to have them do.\n\nI feel it my privilege to send my children to the Koksi\u0142ah Indian Day School if I know that they are going to get the school work and training there that I want them to have. As I feel about they will get it there, and I am anxious to get them in school there just as soon as possible. Hoping this will be ample reason.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDavid Page\nDuncan, B.C.\nJanuary 13th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to attach hereto in duplicate a letter which I have received from David Page, an Indian of the Cewichan Band, (Khenipsen) requesting permission to transfer his children from the St. Catherine's Indian Day School to the Kekskilah Indian Day School, both of which are on the Cewichan I.R. No. 1, for the reasons given.\n\nAt present, and ever since the St. Catherine's school opened, Pages' children have either had to cross the Cewichan River to get to school or else walk through the woods to get the bus at the Clemclemutz village. It can be said that these children could walk to the end of the bus-line which is right at the Kekskilah School but this would mean that they would have to leave home before 8 a.m. in the school days and would not get back home again until after 4 p.m. The worst feature of this would be that they would be walking the entire distance of 1\u00bd miles in the dark mornings.\n\nThese are all R.C. children and transfer of them from the St. Catherine's school to the Kekskilah school cannot be given without the consent of the Department.\n\nIf permission is given for them to attend Kekskilah school they can leave home in the morning at 8.30 or even later to get to school on time. Your early consideration of this matter will be appreciated.\n\n(R.H.Meere)\nIndian Agent.\n3-11-1.\n\nJan. 19, 1944.\n\nR. H.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the Koksilah Indian Day School. The Department has very carefully considered your letter and, subject to the conditions mentioned in the third paragraph, we approve Mr. Moore's suggestion and also authorize an expenditure of $250.\n\nIn approving the suggestion we have done so with some misgivings. We are not especially enthusiastic about moving the Koksilah school so close to the St. Catherine's School. However, as there are a number of Protestant children attending the Koksilah School, the Department would probably be subject to some criticism if we did not provide a school for them. It will be necessary for either Agent Moore or yourself to arrange with the Principal of the St. Catherine's School for the children from Koksilah to receive vocational instruction at the former school. This arrangement should be very carefully watched as we are hopeful that within a reasonable time the pupils who have attended Koksilah could be absorbed into the St. Catherine's School where the attendance has not been as large or as regular as we had hoped.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 24th instant, advising that Mrs. R. M. Miller, teacher at Koksilah Indian Day School has resigned her position to which she was appointed under authority of your letter of August 13th, 1942, (file 132-8A-1.)\n\nIt is understood that Miss Hill our teacher at Campbell River has made application to the United Church for a transfer to the Koksilah school and that Mrs. Waywell, who was in charge of the Indian Day School at Ahousaht last term is interested in succeeding Miss Hill at Campbell River. These applications are being dealt with by the local office of the United Church and, no doubt, the Department will be advised by the Toronto office of the church as to their wishes in the matter.\n\n/M\nEncl.\n\nD. H.

These instruments usually bring anywhere from $50.00 to $75.00 each at the sales. If approval is given to this request I would suggest that you send me a cheque for $75.00 so that if and when the opportunity offers I may have the available cash to make the purchase. Any funds left over will be returned immediately.\n\n(ReHoMoore)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nIn forwarding the resignation of Mrs. R.M.

The facts of the case follow:\n\nWhile this girl is a member of the Tsaycum Band, her mother was a Cowichan girl who married into the former Band, but only lived with her husband for 3 months. Apparently the marriage took place when the girl was under age and the necessary consent of her parents was not received. At all events, the child has lived most of the time with her grandmother on the Cow. I.R., and originally attended the Koksilah School. Later she went to live with the grandparents on the father's side and of course had to leave Koksilah school owing to the fact that she was a Catholic was sent to Kuper Is. Res. School. The next year she returned to the Cow. I.R. and on account of her religion I told her that she would have to go to St. Catherine's school, which she did last year. Now, she has just returned to the Cow. I.R., after being away fishing and wants to go to the Koksilah School because the school is only \u00bd a mile away from her present home and her half brother and cousin attend Koksilah School and go home at noon hour for their lunch or dinner, and her grandmother wants this granddaughter to do the same so that they will all get their dinner in the middle of the day. I don't usually refer these matters to the Dept. as I tell the Indians that they cannot change schools. However, I think an exception could be made in this case and as she is not the only Catholic attending the Koksilah School, which is actually non-denominational, I cannot see where there would be any harm in having all the children from the same house attend the same school. Please advise.\n\n(R. Moore) Indian Agent.\nOttawa, September 16, 1944.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B. C.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of the 8th instant, in which you recommend the purchase of a musical instrument, preferably a reed organ, for the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nWhile this is a somewhat unusual request, in view of the critical days in which we find ourselves, nevertheless, the Department is disposed to accept your recommendation, if a second hand instrument can be secured. It would be more convenient to us, however, if you sent forward the regular voucher for the amount immediately after the purchase.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON GOWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools are quite well attended generally, although in some instances attendance of some of the older pupils are inclined to be irregular. This can be accounted for by the fact that there is so much work available for teen age boys and girls in the canneries that they try and sneak in for a day or two each week, or work after school hours and then forget to get up out of bed the following morning. There are so many day schools now that it takes up a great deal of time and delays the other work of the agency accordingly.\n\nR.H.

However, Gordon & Charlotte\nwent to St. Catherine's before they went to the U.S.,\nand I do not wish to accept the responsibility for allowing them\nto go to Kekulah School, unless approval is given by the\nDept. I told their Uncle this morning that in my opinion they\nshould go to St. Catherine's but he informed me that Kekulah\nwas supposed to be a non-denominational school and it would be\nmuch more satisfactory for them to attend the same school as his\nown children and then they could all do their home work together\nand would get along better.

For some reason or other a lot of the parents don't like sending their children to this school, too much religion taught is the principal complaint, and pressure has to be constantly maintained to keep their children going. Many applications for transfer from St. Catherine's to the Kokslah school has been received in the Office, one or two of which have already been referred to the Department for consideration. I look for a much improved attendance this year however and hope that the prejudice of the Indians against St. Catherine's will eventually pass off.

When a transfer was applied for, I was notified as the Principal of the school, and asked by the Department to give reasons for or against. In the case in question, I have not been consulted.\n\nI would appreciate an explanation as to why my approval is needed for the transfer of some and not for others. It seems to me that if the children can be moved back and forth from one school to the other at will, then we are leaving the way clear for future trouble.\n\nFrom my point of view, I cannot see the necessity for a transfer for the above mentioned children unless a satisfactory explanation can be given.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary Sheila (sgd.)\nPrincipal.\nDUNLOP, B.C.,\nSept. 24, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

In this case, Gabriel does not live on Thalass Reserve, but lives at present in the Koksilah District, and as far as I am aware he is at liberty to send his children to whatever school he chooses, especially since the Department is contributing nothing toward the cost of educating the children.\n\nI would, however, also appreciate comment on the letter about the Bartleman children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H.

Moore,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe three children of Richard Thorne, Gordon, Charlotte and Gladys, I have been informed, are now attending the Kwikwetlem Indian Day School with the approval of the Department after they had been registered at St. Catherine's Indian Day School.\n\nTo say the least, I find this approval very strange. These children are R.C. from R.C. parents and according to the Indian Act should attend a school of their denomination. As they have lost their Mother, the normal place for them would have been River Island Boarding School. And if no place was available for them presently, they should have returned to St. Catherine's.\n\nI am aware of the fact that they are living with their uncle Chuck Thorne, and that he has the right to request their transfer. The reasons put forward, in my estimation are of a negligible nature, and if the Department allows transfers on such grounds, from one school to another, especially as is the case of R.C. children to a non-denominational school, the Department is surely giving occasion to difficulties of all kinds, and complicating in no small measure, the education work amongst the Indians.\n\nI would therefore appreciate it if you would ask the Department for a reconsideration of the matter, and for another decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLucien D. Leclair\nS.M.S.\nSup.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-1, part 2)\nOct. 1, 1945.\n\nR. H.

The Department's approval of their admission was likely based on the assumption that the children were not enrolled at the St. Catherine's School following their return from the United States and, consequently, there could be no objection to their admission to Koksilah, particularly as their legal guardian, Chuck Thorne, was definitely opposed to their going to St. Catherine's. If our understanding of this matter is correct, I would suggest that you discuss the matter with Sister Mary Sheila, pointing out that the children were not pupils of St. Catherine's School and, consequently, it appeared unnecessary to discuss with her their application for admission to the Koksilah School.\n\nWith reference to the children of Gabriel Bartleman, our views in this matter coincide with your own as it is considered that Gabriel has a right to send the children to any school he chooses providing the cost of educating them is not a charge to this Department.\n\nD.

Caldwell with regard to the same letter, copy of same enclosed. The following is a quotation from Mr. Caldwell's letter in reply to mine of November 3rd:\n\n\"In reference to your letter of even date regarding the transfer of the Dick Thorne children to the Kokslah Indian Day School, I would advise that your letter of Sept. 22nd last was sent to the Commissioner who advised that he sent the application to the Department without any recommendation; and the ruling Ottawa gave was likely based on the knowledge that these children were not enrolled at your school at the time - or immediately prior-to the date of their enrollment at Kokslah I.D. School. Furthermore, their guardian Chuck Thorne was opposed to their attending your school. Furthermore, I discussed this question with you at your school following receipt of the Commissioner's letter and pointed out that as the children were not pupils of your school it appeared unnecessary to discuss the question of their admission to Kokslah.\"\n\nThe clause \"as the children were not pupils of your school.\" is absolutely erroneous.

In the last sentence of your letter you mention the general policy of the Department with reference to the religious auspices under which children should be educated. I feel we should adhere to this policy very strictly and I certainly hope that the Thorne case will not be treated as a precedent.\n\nThe situation at the St. Catherine's School is another case which should be very carefully reviewed as soon as we secure the services of a new Inspector. If the staff at this school is not satisfactory I will have no hesitation in interviewing the Mother General of the Sisters of St. Ann and make certain that an efficient and qualified staff will always be in charge of this school. From an educational standpoint, the St. Catherine School should be a great deal better than the Koksilah Day School and this is said with no intention of reflecting on the teacher of the Koksilah School.

It is recognized that the general policy of the Department is to have Indian children attend a school of the religion to which they belong, but exceptions have been made and I should say as time passes more consideration shall likely be given to the wishes of the parents in such matters.\n\nD.H.

Dr. Beevor-Potts letter reads as follows:\n\n\"Re: Doris George\"\n\n\"This youngster is fit to go to school, however, as the parents live at Koksilah I would suggest that she be allowed to attend the Koksilah Indian Day School.\"\n\nSigned: \"C. H. Beevor-Potts, M.D.\"\n\nAs this child is an R.C. I maintained that she should go to St. Catherine's Indian Day School and so informed the guardians. However, they claim that, as she is a timid child, has never been to school before, and only 6\u00bd years of age, they prefer her to attend the school next door, as it means that she is away from home at least one hour less each day than if she had to go to St. Catherine's by bus.\n\nI wrote to Sister Mary Sheils to get her reaction to this but she said \"NO\" -- that Doris should go to St. Catherine's and she would not give her consent to her attending Koksilah.\n\nI am, therefore, referring the matter to the Department -- through you -- for a ruling. The sensible thing in my opinion is to allow her to go to Koksilah, there are other R.C.'s there and the child can go home for a hot meal at noon.\n\nR. H. Moore\nIndian Agent\nAirmail:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed is a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Moore requesting a ruling from the Department concerning the admission of Doris George to the Koksilah Indian Day School, which is operated on undenominational lines.\n\nIn view of the recommendation of the doctor and the proximity of the Koksilah Indian Day School to the pupil's home, it is recommended that she be permitted to attend this school.\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n;ms.\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Heary,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Mr. Arneil's letter dated April 20.\n\nKoksilah Indian Day School\n\nYou will note Mr. Davey reports very favourably with regard to the operation of the school but because of the unusually small classroom space, suggests that an effort should be made to secure the admission of grade 7 and 8 children to the Provincial Junior High School in Duncan.\n\nSuperintendent Moore is being requested to make tentative inquiries with regard to the possibility of this being effected.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(BG 10, Volume 6400)\n\nFile 826-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nGeneral Administration. 1907 - 1937\n\nFile 826-1, part 2\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nGeneral Administration. 1937 - 1947\n\nFile 826-3, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1923 - 1946\n\nFile 826-5, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1933 - 1939\n\nFile 826-5, part 2\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1939 - 1943\n\nFile 826-5, part 3\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1943 - 1947\n\nFile 826-5, part 4\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1940 - 1950\n\nFile 826-11, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Koksilah Protestant School -\nVocational Training. 1937 - 1948\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Phyllis K.

As you were informed in official letter of May 5th, last, salary at the same rate as was allowed Miss Gibson would only be paid to a properly qualified incumbent.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Barner of her appointment, and arrange with her to take up duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays on or about September 2nd, next.

(RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-3, part 1)\nOttawa, May 16, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing the resignation of Miss Maud Barner as teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, to take effect at the end of the present academic year, viz.: June 30th, and enclosing an application from Miss Josephine Archibald for the position, together with a recommendation from Rev. Arthur Barner.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will accept the resignation of Miss Barner, to take effect on the date mentioned.\n\nRelative to the appointment of Miss Archibald, it is noted that she has a Second Class Nova Scotia Teacher's License and has had several years' experience. The Department will approve of her appointment, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays next. The total salary allowed her will be at the rate of $95.00 per month for the ten teaching months in the year. We note that, as it is necessary for the teacher to board at the Methodist Mission, the missionary and his wife will board and lodge Miss Archibald.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Cairns of the approval granted for the appointment of Miss Archibald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nAlfred H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nTo Mr. Boomer\nDept. of Indian Education\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to what appears to be a great hardship and injustice to the teacher at this place and no doubt what I may have applied to all schools working under the same plan.\n\nIt is a question of the paying teachers quarterly instead of monthly, as are public schools do in B.C.\n\nOur Teacher (Miss Boomer) taught April, May and June when the school closed for summer holidays. From June 1st to the 16th of August she has not yet received her salary. Therefore she has not been paid for work done in April, May, and June, a long time for a girl to have to wait for her pay.\n\nAs you know Miss Boomer has left us, but another teacher has been appointed. I will start on Sept. 1st at the end of that month she will receive one month's salary and nothing more until Jan. 1926.\n\nCould the teacher still be paid quarterly? I worry much things, a bit anxious for them.\n\nI trust that you are keeping well.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nW. Heasman Gibson\nOttawa, August 17, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson;\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to salary payments at the Koksilah Indian Day School. I find that Miss Barner's salary cheque for the June quarter, amounting to $225, was sent to her in care of Mr. Indian Agent Lomas on July 17th. She should have received it some weeks ago.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible to pay teachers of Indian schools monthly. This question has been the subject of considerable correspondence and much deliberation. Salary is paid at the end of the September, December, March and June quarters, as soon as the school returns, properly certified by the Indian agent, reach the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. W. H. Gibson,\nKoksilah, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to make enquiry in regard to salary cheque due to Miss Maud G. Warner, teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, for the quarter ended June 30th, last. I am informed that the same has not yet been received by her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the non-receipt by Miss Burner of her June quarter salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this school was formerly conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and during that period the salary of the teacher was sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. As the school is now classed as undenominational, the cheque for the teacher's salary has recently been sent direct to her. When drawing the salary for the June quarter for the Koksilah School, it was overlooked that the cheque should be drawn in favour of the teacher, and it was sent instead to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. I am today writing him and requesting that he forward to you a cheque for $255 in favour of Miss Burner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nOttawa, August 20, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIndian Education Cheque No. 1900 for $255 sent to you on July 17th, last, included the following payments:\n\n- Hartley Bay School.......$255\n- Kitselas Day School.......$255\n- Koksilah Day School......$255\n\nIt was through error that the amount of $255 for the teacher of the Koksilah School was included in the above cheque and sent to you. As you are aware, the salary of this teacher is now being paid by the Department direct to her. Please arrange to have a cheque for $255 drawn in favour of Miss Maud G. Barner and sent to Mr. A. H. Lomas, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nI trust this mistake will not cause you too much inconvenience and that you will assist us by adjusting the matter as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Treasurer,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 21st, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding Miss Burner's salary cheque for the quarter ending June 30th, last, I find upon investigation that the information furnished in my letter of the 17th instant was inaccurate. Miss Burner's salary has been sent direct to herself at the end of each quarter, but through inadvertence the amount due her for the quarter ending June 30th, last, was sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto. I wrote him yesterday, and drew this matter to his attention, and requested him to immediately forward a cheque for $255 in favour of Miss Burner to Mr. Agent Lomas.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. W. H. Gibson,\nKoksilah,\nB.C.\nAugust 21st,\n1925.\n\nMr. Russell T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your favor of the 20th instant, asking that an error in forwarding $255.00 to this office for the teacher at Koksilah School be rectified by sending a cheque for the amount to Miss Maud G. Banner. In reply would say that a cheque is being forwarded to her address today.\n\nMiss Banner's present address is Toronto, as Mr. Banner is moving his family to this city and they are on their way - if not already here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNS.MT\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Humpbine H.

Further, you may arrange for the purchase of two No. 3 single school desks. They should be of the same type as those at present in use in the school. The above purchases should be made from firms on the approved list. You may also purchase a sheet iron protector for the stove, at a cost of approximately $3.00.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the above authorized expenditures.

This is similar to authority granted last year, in Department letter dated November 30th, No.152-8A-5.

The foot bridge leading to the school which is of truss construction, partly washed out and will have to have repairs done to it, as one of the piers washed out completely. The bridge is 110 feet long, and I managed to get it propped up until such time as the water drops, so that work could be done on it, and as the water is now receding very fast, I have an Indian who says he can repair the same at a cost of about $25.00.\n\nThe school building itself leaked very badly, with the result that the water came in and made a bad mess of the walls, which together with the woodwork in the hall should be refinished and stained and the front steps require to be repaired and painted and the two toilets were almost completely demolished by the storm, and they will have to be partly rebuilt as well as shingled. As this building was put up in 1915 it is only natural that it will require some repairs, especially after weathering a storm like we had. I have estimated that it will take about $50.00 to cover the cost of repairs required around this school, that is provided the roof does not have to be reshingled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

C.\nApril 6th, 1935.\n\nWe, the undersigned, and being the parents of children attending the Koksilah Indian Day School, residing at the Somenos Indian village, Cowichan I.R.No.1, hereby petition the Department to provide transportation facilities for our children to and from school.\n\nOwing to the great distance by road, our children all have to walk by the trail, which necessitates them crossing the Railway bridge on the Cowichan River\u2014which is always more or less dangerous; and then there is always the trouble of the trail flooding during all the season of high water in the River.\n\nMrs. Ed.

H. Clayton.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose two petitions from different Indians praying that the Department provide transportation for their children to the Koksilah and the Cowichan Indian Day Schools.\n\nThere are a number of children living at the Somence village, Cowichan Indian reserve, at Duncan, that go to both these schools. Reverend Father Neway and Mr. Neary, the teacher at Cowichan Day School have been transporting the children to the Cowichan Day School, but the other children that go the Koksilah Day school have had to walk, and in doing so have a dangerous railway bridge to cross over, as well as having a swollen River to contend with in the winter time, with the result that when the weather is bad the parents refuse to send them to school. The bridge is exceptionally dangerous, especially in snowy and frosty weather.\n\nYou will see from the petitions that there are 14 children for each of these schools, but five of those down on the list of the Cowichan Day School live at Quamichan, more than half way to the school. There are a number of other children at Clemolemaluts that do not attend school, that could be picked up, and thus augment the number stated in the petitions.\n\nI have delayed in forwarding these petitions until I could get what I considered a fair offer to do the work. The Vancouver Island Coach Lines wanted between $7.00 and $8.00 per day, which would amount to over $140.00 per month; and Mr. Kyle who runs a Taxi service asked $120.00. I considered both these figures far too high.\n\nYou will see from Reverend Father Neway's letter that he and Mr. Neary have offered to do the work for $15.00 a piece, and I am enclosing a letter also from a Mr. W.H. Hawkins who has a bus, and he has offered to do the Koksilah school for $40.00 a month, or the two of them for $60.00. I consider this offer very fair and just, as this man would go right around, and thus pick up the children before mentioned at Clemolemaluts.\n\nI think the time has come, in order to assure regular attendance that transportation should be provided, and I would be glad if the Department would give this matter favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 399-8-3 of June 10th, last, with reference to providing transportation for children attending the Koksilah and Cowichan Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe recommendation contained in your letter has received very careful consideration, but, owing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to authorize this year the expenditure that would be necessary to pay the wages of a person to transport the children to the schools mentioned. You may, however, bring up the matter again next year, and it will receive further consideration before the commencement of the academic year 1936-37.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

For instance, the two toilets had to be completely re-built, and the steps were in a worse condition than anticipated, and the walls of the school room were so badly stained that we had to give them two coats of kalsomine, all of which took time.\n\nWhen I first reported on this building, the roof to me looked perfectly good, but after the shingles dried out, during the very hot weather, we examined the same, and found the whole south side was just like a sieve, you could see daylight through it all over, but this of course will take up to a certain extent in the wet weather, but I am much afraid that it is going to leak more or less in various places, and as this school has been built now 21 years, it is time for it to be renewed, and in order to make a proper job, the whole of the south side walls require to be done, and this would necessitate taking off the old shingles and replacing with new ones, at an estimated cost of about $50.00, and I would like to recommend if at all possible that this be done.\n\nThe rest of the school is now I think in a very creditable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

(RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour File 152-8-5.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from Reverend Father Lauzon, S.M.M., regarding the transportation of pupils to and from the Cowichan Indian Day School. Father Lauzon refers to having discussed this matter with you during your visit to Duncan on June 3rd and 4th. I cannot at the moment recall having taken part in the conversation referred to.\n\nThe per capita rate for which Father Lauzon proposes to provide transportation for the Indian children is very reasonable when compared with the rates paid by the local School Boards for transportation of White children in the same area. Father Lauzon's application for authority to transport 30 children at $52.50 per month is recommended for favourable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs you remember, Mr. Hoey at his visit in Duncan, said that if I was able to secure transportation for more children, he would be willing to increase the grant at the actual per capita rate.\n\nEver since I have tried to get a car, large enough to take ten children at the time. The car I have now the intention of buying was $995.00 till lately. But because they can not sell it, they are willing to let it go at $895.00.\n\nMy plan is to trade my Austin for that car. I would have to pay $100.00 over on the trade. Moreover I would have to spend about $25.00 to equip it according to regulation of the Motor Act.\n\nHere is what I propose to you to be submitted to the Department. At the actual rate per capita, it would amount to $52.50 a month for 30 children. A total for the 9 months remaining of the school year, of $472.40.\n\nBesides after receiving a hint from a friend that the Traffic Department were quite exacting this year, I inquired indirectly, and the result is that I have my doubt as to whether or not I would be allowed to transport the children in my little car. Last year I was told although not by the police Department, that I could do it without any permit as long as it was not for commercial purposes. But now I am told that anyone receiving remuneration of any kind to transport children must have a permit from the Police Department. And I am nearly sure at least according to the written regulation that they would not allow me to take 5 children at the time in the Austin. Most probably I would have to cancel the transportation.\nNow this new car I intend to take is a seven passenger Plymouth. The Police Department has seen it and will allow me to carry ten children at the time. I will have all licenses required and the insurance covering a school bus for ten children.\n\nThe program will be to take ten children to Koksilah School. I will pick ten more on my way back to the Cowichan School, passing by the lower part of the reserves, and then I will make another trip towards Duncan to get the children I am now transporting.\n\nI would like to start the first week in October. So if there is anything to settle see to it. As long as I get the grant of $52.50 a month I will agree.\n\nI know that it is quite late; but I did not hear about this offer before this week. Could you ask for the answer by wire so that I can put the deal through at the end of next week.\n\nYours always,\n\n\"Father X Lauzon.\"\nS.M.M.\nExtract from Doctor Dorey's letter of July 25, 1938.\n\n\"Regarding the transfer of the school from its present location to some place near the Somenos Indian Village, we shall no doubt be advised from Mr. Hoey's office. In the meantime, we shall keep the description and the blue print in our files so that if it is needed it can be referred to. If the school remains on the present site and it is found necessary to transfer this 1.35 acres to the Government, I am quite sure that the United Church will be prepared to do so.\"\n\n(Sgd.) Geo.

At many Indian schools the older boys and girls assist with the sweeping and the boys especially can look after the fires. All such work can be done under the supervision of the teacher. Similar procedure should be followed at the Koksilah School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I would like to advise that I consider that the oil sprayer requested by Miss Perry, the teacher of Kokoilah Indian Day School should be supplied. They have been endeavoring to put the oil on the floor with a fly tox sprayer, which is much too light and will not function with the oil; so I would like to strongly recommend that a proper oil sprayer be authorized.\n\nIt is noted that you advise that it is not considered necessary to authorize the $5.00 applied to have the school cleaned and scrubbed, as janitor services are already paid for at this school. $2.50 per month is allowed to cover the janitor work, which is a nominal sum which covers the daily sweeping and dusting and tending of the fires, but could hardly be expected to cover the annual cleaning and scrubbing.\n\nAs a thorough cleaning and scrubbing is so necessary for health and sanitation which we try to stress to the Indians, I would like to strongly recommend that this expenditure be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(R.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith an application from Mr. Indian Agent Moore to expend $21.31 for the repair of the steps of the Koksilah Indian Day School, which are reported as broken and in a dangerous condition.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will please remember our recent visit to the Koksilah Indian Day School and the broken down steps which occurred the day we arrived. As instructed by you I proceeded to have the steps repaired but upon investigation I found that all the under-pinnings for the steps, including the whole frame, were so rotten that it was out of the question to try to repair the bottom step so I got a list of the necessary material required to put in new steps up to the School, which is the only way to make them safe as the whole set-up is likely to fall and hurt someone.\n\nI beg to attach hereto in duplicate a list of the materials required and would advise that I got a price on the labour from Indian Joe Elliott who says that the new steps can be built in about three days and a half, which will cost $10.00. You will, therefore, see that the total cost will amount to $21.31.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nDec 23 Material for Koksilah School steps.\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Description          | Unit | Price |\n|------------|----------|----------------------|------|-------|\n| 2 pcs      | 12       | 2 x 6 - No.1 Com, S4S|      | 24    |\n| 20 \"       |          | do                   |      | 160   |\n|            |          |                      |      | 184   |\n|            |          |                      |      | 21    |\n|            |          |                      |      | 3.86  |\n| 3 \"        | 12       | 2 x 12 - No.2 Com S4S|      | 72    |\n| 10 \"       |          | 1 x 8 - No.1 Com S4S |      | 53    |\n|            |          |                      |      | 18    |\n|            |          |                      |      | .95   |\n| 8 lin      |          | 2 x 6 - No.1 Com Ho Cedar|  | 8     |\n|            |          |                      |      | 21    |\n|            |          |                      |      | .17   |\n| 9 \"        |          | 8 x 8 - do           |      | 48    |\n|            |          |                      |      | 22    |\n|            |          |                      |      | 1.06  |\n| 120 \"      |          | No.1163 Mold         |      | 1-3/4 |\n|            |          |                      |      | 2.10  |\n| 8 #        |          | 3\u00bd Com, Nails        |      | 12    |\n|            |          |                      |      | 7     |\n|            |          |                      |      | .84   |\n| 4 #        |          | 2\u00bd do                |      | 9     |\n|            |          |                      |      | .18   |\n| 2 #        |          | 1\u00bd Fin, Nails        |      |       |\n\nHauling: $10.31\nTotal: $11.31\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. .......................\n\nOffice of the .................

The roof is leaking very badly in places and on close inspection of the cause I find that the shingles were not stained and curled so badly that the water can almost pour in, there is also a nice growth of moss on the shingles near the peak of the roof on both sides which also helps to hold the water and allow it to run down between the shingles instead of over them.\n\nThe total estimated cost of the necessary repairs to this school is as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Shingles                                  | $68.00 |\n| Staining, removing old shingles and putting on new ones, labor & stain | $75.00 |\n\n$143.00\n\n\"Please note that the labor on this job will have to be done by white carpenters as suitable Indian labor is not available.\"\n\nThis is practically the same work that was done at the Nanaimo Indian Day School and the sooner the work is authorised and taken in hand the better, otherwise the damage which will be done to the interior of the school may be considerable.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

When forwarding the voucher, you should attach receipts from the persons to whom the payments were made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith letter date the 13th instant received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore requesting authority to expend $8.00 for graveling on Cowichan Indian Reserve at the Koksilah Indian Day School, for work which has already been carried out in order to enable the school bus to turn at this point.\n\nI can verify Mr. Agent Moore's statement that the road in this vicinity is too narrow to permit the school bus to make a turn without leaving the road when, of course, it is on soft ground and liable to get into difficulties. Consequently, I would recommend consideration of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the month of December last, the condition of the Mission Yard at Koksilah was in very bad shape owing to the yard being used by the school bus to turn around in. This yard is the only place big enough to permit the bus to turn after it unloads the children going to the Koksilah School and picks them up again in the afternoon.\n\nMr Kinney asked me if the Department would arrange to have an Indian haul a few loads of gravel to dump where the actual turning round place was as it was really making a mess of the yard once it got off the actual driveway. I said that I would ask for the necessary authority and explain the situation to you and I felt that the request would be given favourable consideration.\n\nThe matter was overlooked, and the next thing I knew was that the gravel was down, Mr Kinney not having waited for the authority figuring I imagine that it would come through in due time. Then I found that he had paid the Indians himself as those who did the hauling did not want to wait, the result being that I considered the question of no immediate importance and so it got forgotten about. Now the time has come, when Mr Kinney is being moved away from the Koksilah Mission and has written me this morning asking if he could be refunded for having had the gravel hauled. The total amount involved is $5.00 which is really quite cheap when we consider that there were 13 yams of gravel actually delivered in the seven loads. If you can see your way clear to authorise this expenditure I will submit a voucher for the above amount in favour of Mr G. Kinney.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

The Chimney Cleaner cleaned up the mess on the floor etc., but the walls, windows and woodwork were so dirty that I deemed it necessary to have it attended to right away. I trust my action having this attended to will be approved.\n\n(R.H.

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $3.50 a month for the current academic year to enable you to purchase material for the hot drink for the pupils at the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOn behalf of the Koksilah Indian Day School,\nI would like to ask for authority covering an expenditure\nof $3.50 per month, for the current academic year,\ncovering purchase of materials for a hot drink for the\npupils at lunch time.\n\nAn expenditure of $2.75 per month has been in\neffect for some years past, but it is found that with\nthe increase in cost of supplies and with the number of\npupils attending, that this is not sufficient, to cover\nthe cost of supplies, and I would recommend that $3.50\nper month be authorized.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nOn a requisition forwarded to the Department last spring the teacher of the Koksilah Day School requested a teacher's desk and chair. It is regretted that you were not written about the matter at that time. However, if you consider these items of furniture necessary, you may arrange for their purchase.\n\nI may add that in forwarding the request the teacher estimated the cost of the desk at $45.00. We generally secure a teacher's desk for approximately $30.00.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File: 152-8A-5, July 15th, 1943\n\nIn your above noted letter you kindly authorised certain articles for the Koksilah Indian Day School, as requisitioned by the Teacher in April last. In that requisition a Teacher's desk and chair was asked for by so far authority has not been received for this and it was thought that the chair had been ordered direct or the authority to purchase it sent to Mr Commissioner MacKay.\n\nThe Teacher has spoken to me about this several times and I have been unable to give her any definite information.

K. R. M. Miller - Teacher\nOttawa,\nAugust 21, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 19 and also copy of a letter received by you from Mr. Indian Agent Moore sent forward therewith.\n\nIn view of the lateness of the season, immediate steps should be taken to have the repairs at these schools undertaken and completed at an early date. I agree with you, however, that the digging or deepening of a well at the Tsartlip School is a matter with respect to which we might secure more information from the Agent, which information might be sent forward to the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nMay I again express regret that these repairs were not undertaken early in the vacation period. It is exceedingly difficult for me to understand how these repairs can be undertaken without resulting in great inconvenience to both teachers and pupils, unless they can be completed before September 1.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Moore regarding repairs to certain Day Schools in his Agency, provision for which was made in the current year's estimates.\n\nIf funds have been provided, I would recommend that this work be undertaken with the exception of deepening the existing well or digging a new well at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, a project which should stand over until the matter has been investigated on the ground by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nThe Department's decision by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nMjr DeMacKay:\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., P.O.

Painting of outside of building and redecorating of inside, repairs to fencing. $350.00\n\nSonghees Indian Day School. Painting and redecorating inside and outside painting. $300.00\n\nNanaimo Indian Day School. Kalsomining and painting inside of building. $50.00\n\nTsartlip Indian Day School.

Ottawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, File No. 152-8A-5, authorising the purchase of certain supplies for the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your communication which refers to the repairs to the well at the school, I wish to explain that this well consists of a sand-point and about 10' of 1\u00bd\" galvanised pipe with a pitcher pump, all of which have been out of commission for some time. The pump was broken and it is presumed that the sand pipe has rusted away now, so that a complete new set up will be required consisting of the following:\n\none pitcher hand pump; $5.00\none sand-point 1\u00bd\" diameter 4.50\none 10' length of 1\u00bd\" galvanised pipe. 3.00\nlabor installing same. 7.50\n\nTotals $20.00\n\nIf I may have the necessary authority to have the above installation made it will be appreciated.\n\n(R.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6400, File 826-5, part 3)\nMay 5, 1944.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent,-\n\nThe enclosed Special Category Application has been received in this branch from Mrs. Ruth Myrtle Miller, Teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, Koksilah Indian Reserve, who lives at Duncan, B.C.\n\nIndian Agent Moore states in a letter to Indian Commissioner MacKay that Mrs. Miller, in the 10 months of the teaching year, travels approximately 2,775 miles in driving to and from the school. The pupils in the school are taken to and from the school in a bus, but Mrs. Miller has to be at the school when the pupils arrive and remain there until after they depart so that she cannot travel by the bus. She must, therefore, use her own car as she cannot walk.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, through whose office the application was forwarded, has stated that Indian Agent Moore's support of the application and explanation as to the necessity for a special category for Mrs. Miller should justify certification of the application.\n\nIn addition to the regular travel in the performance of her duties as teacher, Mrs. Miller has to use her car for extra and special trips to the homes of parents in regard to absenteeism and sickness.\n\nMrs. Miller was furnished last year with an A ration book, but as she travels a minimum mileage of 3,000 miles as a teacher in reaching the school and in her other duties as teacher, it is thought that she should be granted sufficient gasoline to cover the 3,000 miles of travel.\n\nI would ask that consideration be given to this application.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of April 17th, letter of April 1st from Mrs. Ruth M. Miller, teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, and application from her for a Special Gasoline Ration.\n\nThere would seem to be some correspondence regarding certification of these Application forms, as the Regional Director - Gasoline Rationing - in a letter dated April 4th, 1944 stated:\n\n\"We have received instructions that all employees of the Department of Mines and Resources must have their Special Category applications certified in Ottawa by C. W. Jackson, Chief Executive Assistant.\"\n\nMrs. Miller is definitely a Departmental employee and any certification other than that of the Chief Executive Assistant would not be acceptable to the Oil Controller.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore's support of the application and explanation of the necessity for a Special Gasoline Ration for Mrs. Miller are, in my opinion, sufficient to justify certification of the application.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nMr. P. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nShuswap B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nEnclosed I am sending you my completed application for extra gas to carry on my work as a Rural Teacher at the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nLast year I estimated my mileage on the basis of 75 miles per week, and that did not include the extra trips I must often make into the homes of the parents in regard to absentee sickness, etc. I was given last year an A Book which by being very careful I just took care I was needed as a teacher, as I stated above.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMrs. Ruth M. Miller.\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 17th, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to attach herewith a letter, and copy of same, from Mrs R.M. Miller, Teacher of the Kekkilah Indian Day School, along with her application for a Special Gasoline Category, all of which I trust you will find self-explanatory.\n\nI am at a loss to know just how to handle this request as I received a similar one from Sister Maureen Regan and sent it direct to the Department who replied under date of the 3rd. instant as follows:\n\n\"I return herewith the special category application of Sister Maureen Regan. It does not appear that this car is entitled to a special category. In any case there is no certificate on page 2 that could conscientiously be signed by any official of this Department. The only one at all applicable is No. 2, which should be signed locally by someone having personal knowledge of the facts deposed to on page 1.\"\n\nSigned: \"Harold W. McGill\"\n\nIn view of the foregoing there would not appear to be any use in sending this application to the Dept. and it would also appear as if no one in this Department should sign any such application. However, who then could sign it that would have personal knowledge of the fact that Mrs Miller teaching in one of our schools and travels, according to my reckoning, approximately 2775 miles during the 10 months of school? It is quite true that a bus takes the pupils to and from this school but the teacher has to be there before the bus arrives and after it leaves so actually she has to travel by her own car, or walk, which she cannot do. Please advise in this regard just what procedure should be followed.\n\n(R.H.

In this regard I wish to attach herewith three Vouchers covering the cost of the organ, tuning it, and having it moved to the school, amounting in all to $23.50.\n\nI was fortunate in being able to get a suitable organ from the local United Church at a cost of $15.00. It had to be cleaned and tuned as it had been stored in a dusty hall for two or three years and then it had to be taken to the school. The cleaning and tuning cost $6.00 and the moving $2.50.\n\nI thought that I made a pretty good buy when I got the instrument for $15.00 but didn't realise just how good until it was being cleaned when the tuner told the teacher that she had a good organ and that it was worth at least $40.00 or $50.00.\n\nIn conclusion permit me to express the thanks of the Teacher and pupils to the Department for making it possible for them to get this much needed instrument for their school.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Mrs. G.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-HN\nIn reply to your letter, with enclosure I wish to advise that the work has been completed on the bridge across the creek and the job appears to be quite satisfactory. Vouchers for materials and labor will go forward in due course.\n\nWhile on the question of this school, I wish to advise that I have just returned from there today and the teacher was asking about lights for the winter months. Even today, which is bright and sunny as any day in summer, it was quite dark and dull in the school building and not a bit of sunlight getting into the school room on account of the trees on the south side of the building.\n\nFrom the point of view of light and sun, I would recommend that the trees on the south side of the building for a distance of 75' or so be slashed down to allow more light and sun to get into the room. I believe that this could be done for ten or twelve dollars and I would so recommend, and request that the necessary authority for this be issued as soon as possible. I would also request authority to have ten loads of gravel dumped in the Church yard where the bus has to turn around at an approximate cost of $10.00.

Drinking water is supplied from a well nearby and kept in an uncovered pail. The children have individual drinking cups but dip these into the water pail.\n\n4. Toilets are outside and the excrement is collected in a box which is cleaned once a month. The boys' toilet was in a very uncleanly state.\n\n5. It was noted that a United Church Mission Building close by had a large water tank and pump installed. The distance from school to water tower is probably just over a hundred yards.\n\n6. It is recommended that the United Church of Canada be approached to ascertain if a water supply for the school could be made available from their source. Rev.W.P. Bunt, B.C. Superintendent of Missions, was contacted and is favourably inclined towards the suggestion.\n\n7. It is further recommended that flush toilets be installed at the school, also sinks for wash-up and taps for a drinking water supply, or better still, a drinking fountain.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To cleaning toilets at Nakakilah Indian Day School for the month of May, 1947. | $2.50 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I visited the latter when I was on Vancouver Island and I do not favour this move for the following reasons:\n\n1. The windows in the Cowichan School do not provide adequate lighting.\n\n2. A well or other water supply would have to be provided.\n\n3. The cost of renovation of the old school would be considerable. The roof requires reshingling, the entrance porch is falling down, the interior would have to be painted.\n\n4. The proximity of this school to St. Catherine might make available the vocational facilities at the latter school, but would be undesirable for other reasons. Unfortunately a comparison of the two schools is already made by the local Indians and bringing the two schools closer together would increase this tendency.\n\nR.F. Davey  \nInspector of Schools.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAs you are aware we have for some time been considering the transfer of the Koksilah Indian Day School to the old Cowichan Indian Day School building, but had left the matter in abeyance pending an inspection by the School Inspector. School Inspector Dewey's Memorandum in this connection is enclosed herewith, and, in view of the information given, I would recommend against such a transfer. It is considered that the present Koksilah Indian Day School building would best serve the needs of the Indians.\n\nIf the Department concurs in this recommendation I should appreciate being advised if the amount of $400 entered in the current Cowichan Agency estimates is available for repairs to this building. I have no detailed information with respect to the repairs necessary, but will secure quotations and tenders on receipt of advice that the required funds are available.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n-ms.\nOttawa, July 14th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant. The Department agrees with you that the present Koksilah Indian day school should continue to be used. We note that Inspector Davey does not favour the transfer of the school to the old Cowichan day school building.\n\nAn amount of $400 will be allowed for repairs and improvements to the Koksilah School.\n\nBernard F.

The items \"window blinds\" and \"ring pulls\" have been approved and arrangements have been made to secure the 10 small desks, the cost of these items to be met from the appropriations for this school, reference Mr. Neary's letter of July 14th.\n\nI would recommend approval of the folding cot and bedding asked for, for the reason that the pupils at this school are transported by bus and children taken ill during school hours must be cared for until the bus arrives. Schools where these conditions prevail are frequently supplied with equipment of this type, and it is felt that a cot and bedding should be supplied in this case.\n\nI would also like to recommend that the allowance for janitor's services for this school be increased from $5.00 to $8.00 a month, which will bring it along the lines of the amount paid elsewhere, and is thought to be quite reasonable for the amount of work involved.\n\nD.

This procedure is necessary owing to the fact that high water in the Winter prevents deliveries of any kind being made to this school.\n\nI have just received a price from Hudson's Hardware, here, for:\n\n*one Fawcett Oil Heater, Model #610 (delivered) $102.40\none pail with spout -------------------------- 1.50\none fawcett ---------------------------------- 1.75\n\nTotal --------- $105.65\n\nI would like authority to purchase it as soon as possible.\n\nR.

C.\n\nRe: Koksilah Indian Day Schools\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, in duplicate, a quotation in triplicate covering the cost of two toilets at the above school.\n\nIt is proposed to have a double toilet for the girls, one of which will be for the sole use of the teacher. The boys' toilet will have a separate compartment for a urinal which is an advantage in many ways. Then there will be a lattice work fence outside both buildings.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Lumber, nails, cement blocks and hardware as per quotation | --- | $128.15 | |\n| Paint, as per quotation | --- | --- | $34.50 |\n| Urinal, 30\" long, quoted price locally | --- | --- | $4.35 |\n| 4 toilet gallon cans, 22\" square, 15\" high, 24 gauge rod around top and two soldered handles, at $3.95 each | --- | --- | $15.80 |\n| 10 Field Tile 6\" @ 10\u00a2 | --- | --- | $1.00 |\n| 1 Field Tile elbow @ 50\u00a2 | --- | --- | $.50 |\n| Labour re building toilets | --- | --- | $70.00 |\n| Labour re painting toilets | --- | --- | $14.00 |\n\nTOTAL $266.30\n\nI would ask that the necessary authority be granted to have this work attended to. A Purchase Order in favour of Bazett & Vickers for lumber, etc., and also for paint should be issued. An accountable cheque for the labour charges should be sent to the Agency Trust Account. The other items can be paid on Voucher as they will be purchased from three different sources, locally.\n\nThis expenditure is chargeable to the four hundred dollars ($400.00) which you told me, in Vancouver, was available for repairs to this school although, to date, I have not received written authority, which I understood was being sent.\n\nR.

He was asked to ascertain if it was possible to secure a supply from the Church Mission, but it would appear from attached correspondence that this is out of the question, consequently I would request that the $30.00 item be added to the $538.20 estimate in my letter referred to, making it $568.20.\n\nD.

The well would not need to be any more than 14 or 16 feet deep.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned: \"Walter J. Challis\"\n\n(EL)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 7th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the request that you have received for increasing the allowance for purchase of materials for a hot drink for the pupils of the Koksilah Day School.\n\nOwing to the payment of Family Allowances it is reasonable to suppose that parents are in a better financial position to provide food for the children and also to give them some lunch when coming to school.\n\nThe Department has not decreased the amount previously allowed for mid day lunch purposes but it is not our present intention to increase this allowance. It is quite possible that some children will bring sufficient lunch and consequently it should not be necessary to supply all with a hot drink.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nPlease refer to your above noted letter, authorizing the amount of four dollars ($4.00) per month to Koksilah Indian Day School with which to purchase materials for a hot drink for the pupils at noon.\n\nI attach, herewith, copy of a letter received from the teacher, Mrs. R. M. Miller, in which she points out that this amount is only half enough to buy the necessary supplies to last out the month and is asking that double this sum be authorized.\n\nYour consideration to this request will be appreciated.\n\nMajor D.

Box 557,\nNovember 6, 1947.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDUNCAN, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe amount of four dollars ($4.00) allowed to us to buy ingredients for hot lunches for the children at the Koksilah Indian Day School is not sufficient. I can buy only enough milk for half the month, and now that more new pupils have enrolled I also need more cocoa and sugar. During October I had to stop making hot drinks for them at the middle of the month, when my supply of milk was exhausted. I will have to do the same this month.\n\nMay I suggest the amount of four dollars be increased to eight dollars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: \"Ruth M.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MDG\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Superintendent Moore's letter of July 3rd requesting an expenditure of approximately $40.00 for the graveling of the school yard at the Koksilah Bay School.\n\nIn view of the fact that these grounds have not been previously attended to I would recommend that the expenditure be approved.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI should like to apply for authority to expend approximately forty dollars ($40.00) in graveling the school yard at the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nIt is estimated that we will require about five loads (four yards to the load) at eight dollars ($8.00) per load, to make a reasonably good job of it.\n\nNothing has ever been done to these grounds and they are extremely wet and muddy during the Winter months.\n\nR.

Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI have had a request from Mrs. R. M. Miller, teacher of the Koksilah Indian Day School, that her school room be thoroughly cleaned from top to bottom, during the holidays. She wants the walls cleaned off, windows and woodwork washed, and the floor scrubbed.\n\nIn spite of the fact that we pay Mrs. Miller five dollars ($5.00) per month for Janitor Services at this school during the ten months it is in operation, the fact remains that it requires a thorough cleaning at least once a year, which is certainly beyond the physical capabilities of Mrs. Miller to do, herself.\n\nI realize that, if this is done at the Koksilah Indian Day School, the other teachers in our day schools are entitled to like consideration. Personally, I believe all day schools should be thoroughly cleaned during the holidays -- and not by the teachers as, in my opinion, they receive little enough now for the janitor work they do during the time school is in session.\n\nI estimate that it will cost twenty-five dollars ($25.00) to have this school thoroughly cleaned before school reopens.\n\nR.

If I had asked for authority then to have these shelves built it would have meant that the workmen would have left the job and\u2014if authority was granted\u2014would have to return again, which would have been added expense.

Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nWe have run into more expense at the above school which was not anticipated, due to the fact that the well we have at the school ran dry. The cause might be the fact that the river channel has been changed and the underground streams stopped flowing in that particular direction. Two or three wells in the same general direction have all gone dry or nearly so.\n\nI had a couple of men start digging a new well in a different location today where our chances of getting water will be much greater. It is estimated that the total cost of digging, cribbing and reinstallation of the pump from the old well will be between $75.00 and $100.00.\n\nAs this school is entirely out of water now and the mission is short, it is a case of getting a satisfactory supply in the shortest possible time. I would ask that authority be granted at the earliest possible date so that the work already commenced may be completed.\n\nR.H.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nKoksilah Indian Day School\nYour File 3-11-3 (152)\n\nThe Department approves the acceptance of the tender of Mr. A.V. Richardson of Duncan, B.C., for the repairs required and for the painting needed at the above Indian Day School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nAugust 16, 1949.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Koksilah Indian Day School\n\nYou will note from Superintendent Moore's letter of August 9 and enclosure attached, that an expenditure of $35.00 is necessary for repairs to the above-mentioned school building. Only $200.00 was specifically required in the estimates for this work, but the repairs detailed in Mr. Richardson's tender are apparently necessary, and I would recommend that Mr. Moore be authorized to have him proceed with the work.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAt the request of the Teacher at the above school I visited the building recently to check over on necessary repairs which are required before the school reopens. I was accompanied by Mr A.V. Richardson, local contractor, who went over the class room, desks, windows, doors etc., with me and finally came up with a list of necessary repairs which must be made this fall.\n\nThe attached quotation in duplicate covers the requirements and with the exception of renewing the floor in the front porch, and the damaged plaster in the school room plus a broken pane, the rest of the repairs were anticipated last year at the time the Estimates were submitted.\n\nRenewing the plaster on the ceiling of the classroom is the big job and was not anticipated, but the \"bats\" which used to occupy the attic of the building in large numbers some years ago eventually took their toll on the ceiling plaster, so that with the continual wetting it became bulged and eventually is breaking away. The fact that this building is in such a dark location, without artificial light, requires a bright interior to permit the pupils to see the black boards, as well as to have sufficient light to read by.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted for these improvements at the earliest possible date. I know that I am late in getting this application in but I was unable to get a Contractor to take time off to even look at the job until last week end, although I have tried on many occasions.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Department,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nAttention Mr R.H. Moore,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your enquiry for repairs to Indian school at Koksilah; We are pleased to quote you the price of $325.00 for the following:\n\nRenew front porch floor\nRemove damaged plaster in school room and renew.\nSupply and replace one broken pane of window glass.\nCheck all desks and tighten screws replacing those missing.\nSet all desks on new one by three (1 X 3) runners.\nRepair front door.\nPaint all woodwork in classroom and vestibule, 1 coat oil paint.\nTwo coats of water paint on all inside walls and ceilings of class room and vestibule.\n\nYours truly;\n\nA.

C.\n\nRE: Vouchers #788 and #789 - made payable to Mr. Pat Mason and Evans Lumber Co.\n\nThe above-noted vouchers amounting to $47.20 and $56.65 respectively are attached hereto and cover material and labour incurred in the rebuilding of a small bridge and approaches in order to reach the Koksilah Indian Day School.\n\nThis bridge has been a source of trouble to me and the school teacher for a number of years. The school cannot be reached without it and every year during floods, two or three days of school have been lost due to the unsafe condition of the bridge.\n\nThis year, with the exceptional high water, the bridge floated downstream, about six feet, and came to rest on a tree. When the water receded the children were able to cross at the new location and school carried on. However, last week it was necessary to have fuel oil delivered to the school and the truck could not drive across and, consequently, the bridge had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe new bridge has been raised, is well bolted down and should not, under normal conditions, give us any further trouble. The accounts are very reasonable considering the amount of work involved, and I would recommend, with your approval, that they be paid.\n\nMr. Davey is aware of the condition of this bridge and could give you first-hand information should it be required.\n\nR.H.

C., Dept. of Citizenship and Immigration, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Koksilah Indian Day School\n\nI should like to have authority to stain the outside of the above-mentioned school and renew the eavestrough and downpipes.\n\nI had not planned on any repairs for this school this year but I find the bats have been at work again and made a terrible mess of the windows and walls. To prevent a recurrence of this it will be necessary for us to put a galvanized tin shade under the eaves with a 12\" projection - something after the style of a visor on the windshield of a car - so that the droppings and liquids may be kept away from the windows and side walls.\n\nThis is really a necessity and an item of $800.00 was included in the current year's estimates for this purpose, although I was going to try and get along without doing the work this year in view of the possibility of the closing of the school next year.\n\nI had a rough estimate prepared and by keeping everything to a minimum including the use of brown stain for the walls instead of paint, I consider that we can have a satisfactory job done for $600.00.\n\nA list of materials will be submitted later if I am assured of the work being done.\n\nR.H.

Moore's letter of July 12th attached, District School Inspector Dewey is of the opinion that it will be necessary for us to use the above mentioned building for school purposes for at least two more years and consequently the repairs and improvements suggested by Mr. Moore should be carried out. I have discussed the matter with him since receipt of his letter, however, and it is considered that an amount of $400 will be sufficient to meet the cost.

G. H. BARRY,\nDISTRICT INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, VICTORIA,\nB.C., ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KOKSIHLAH INDIAN\nDAY SCHOOL ON JUNE 24th, 1937.\n\nHaving had a long talk with the teacher with\nreference to the teaching of Vocational Subjects, Arts\nand Crafts, Etc., I have to recommend that a small grant\nof not more than one hundred dollars per year be given\nto this school for the teaching of such Arts and Crafts\nas can be arranged for by the Indian Agent and teacher.\nI believe that the children could be taught to\nmake good baskets if a suitable Indian woman were\nemployed under the supervision of the teacher for one\nafternoon per week during the period October to May.\nThis Indian should be a good basket maker,\nand should if possible be also good in the making of\nsmall articles out of the raw wool, which should be\nspun, etc. in the school. Some blanket weaving should\nbe carried out.\nSuitable pay for this instruction would be a\ndollar per week, and some material would have to be\npurchased. If the boys were supplied with one set of\nsimple tools they could make the weaving frames and\nother necessary articles. With a fret saw and some three-\nply material they could start toy making which is the\nfirst step in Manual Training.\nThe girls do sew at present as previously\nreported, but I am anxious to have the children learn\nbasket making before this is a lost art here.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn Account with\nMrs. Helen Jimmy, (Indian)\n\no/o Indian Office,\nDuncan, B.
