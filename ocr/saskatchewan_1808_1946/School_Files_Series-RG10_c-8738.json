As the work progresses you will be in a position to judge whether the building can be satisfactorily completed for the sum of $1000.00 which was allowed, but if this is not found to be sufficient a larger expenditure should not be incurred without authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSECRETARY.\n\nR. W. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNazleton, B.C.\nBabine and Upper Skeena River Agency,\n\nHazelton, B.C., May 6th 1919.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No.139209/5, dated the 7th ultimo, stating that Mr. Vowell had forwarded to the Department my letter of 14th of February last, renewing the request for a day school building at Kispiax, and enclosing a sketch and detailed estimate of the amount and cost of material and furnishings, and the cost of labour. Also is it remarked that the Department had decided to authorize me to proceed with the erection of this building, but wishes certain changes made in the plan. In that in the first place it is thought that the room should be no less than twelve feet in height, and not ten as shown on my plan. Also that separate closets with screened approaches should be provided, and that they should be placed at a suitable distance from the rear of the building. And that a door should also be provided between the wood-shed and the porch. Likewise is it stated that no provision had been made in my estimates for painting, and that this should be arranged for.\n\nAlso is my attention directed to the matter of requiring a careful consideration as to the site. In that the latter be high and dry, and that there should be sufficient area to permit of gardening operations being carried on, if the soil be at all suitable, and to report on these latter conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the Department states that it has every confidence\nconfidence that the erection of this building will receive my best supervision and that, when completed, it will be satisfactory to all concerned, and a credit to the Department and the Agency, and to report when operations commence and from time to time during progress.\n\nAlso alluding to the changes referred to that they will add somewhat to the cost, but if a good job were done the Department will be satisfied, if the expenditure is kept within the sum of $1000.00. And in order that I may not be in any way handicapped by lack of funds an accountable cheque for $300.00 is sent me therewith; and that these funds should be used to pay for labour and material as required, and when Vouchers, properly certified, are received showing an expenditure to that extent a further advance would be sent.\n\nIn regard the foregoing, to report on certain conditions, I beg leave to state that the site for the school building has long ago been selected, and is on an high and dry plateau back of the village and central thereto. The soil is fair, and can easily be improved upon. The environs of the site permit of gardening being carried on.\n\nIn respect to the extra cost of the proposed changes in the plan, painting, etc., the cost will further be augmented by the difference in the price of lumber when the application for the building was made and present conditions. In the latter respect it stands:\n\n| Description          | Per M. | Present Price |\n|----------------------|--------|---------------|\n| Heretofore, Rough Lumber | $14.00 | $25.00        |\n| Rustic               | $20.00 | $30.00        |\n| Tongue and Grooved   | $20.00 | $32.00        |\n| Dressed & Shiplap    | $20.00 | $26.00        |\n\nThough, for all that, the liberal provision for the purpose may\nmay be made to meet the expenses with the exercise of great care and circumspection.\n\nIn concluding, I beg leave to add that the foundation logs for the building are already ordered, and upon the same being delivered the ground will be prepared and progress made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nMr. Vowell has forwarded to the Department your letter of the 14th of February, last, renewing the request for a day school building at Kishpias and enclosing a sketch and detailed estimate of the amount and cost of material and furnishings and the cost of labour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to authorize you to proceed with the erection of this building, but wishes certain changes made in the plan.\n\nIn the first place it is thought that the room should be not less than twelve feet in height, not ten as shown on your plan.

A door should also be provided between the wood-shed and the porch. No provision is made in your estimates for painting and this should be arranged for.\n\nAnother matter requiring careful consideration is the site. This should be high and dry and there should be sufficient area to permit of gardening operations being carried on, if the soil is at all suitable. Be good enough to report on this.\n\nThe Department has every confidence that the\n\nH.

Kindly report when operations commence and from time to time during progress.\n\nThe changes above referred to will add somewhat to the cost, but if a good job is done the Department will be satisfied if the expenditure is kept within the sum of $1000.00.\n\nIn order that you may not be in any way handicapped by lack of funds an accountable cheque for $300.00 is sent you herewith.

This accommodation would not only greatly add to their comfort and convenience but would also in case of fire provide greater safety for life and property.\n\nAs you doubtless know, water for drinking, cooking and washing now has to be carried two hundred yards or more and that task, in the winter when the river and the distant springs are frozen over with a foot or two of solid ice and snow, is no mean task.\n\nIt was thought that $100 would cover the cost of digging and cribbing the well and providing a force pump for the same and I was asked to write you in the hope that the Indian Department, being interested in the situation, would provide half that amount, on condition that our Mission Board will take care of the other half. Knowing your great interest in all efforts for the unsalvation of the Indian people I am sure you will give this proposal your unqualified support.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 819-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nre - Water Supply for the United Church Mission House on the Kispiox Reserve.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. S. S. Osterhout, D.D., Superintendent of the United Church of Canada Missions.\n\nThe letter is self explanatory and if the project can be carried through there is no doubt that it would be of great assistance to the Missionary, who is the Indian Day School Teacher.\n\nAlthough I have no data in this office I am of opinion that the buildings and the small portion of land on which they stand are the property of the United Church as long as it is carried on as a mission.\n\nEncl. Your obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from Reverend S. S. Osterhout, D.D., Superintendent of Missions, United Church of Canada, regarding the digging and cribbing of a well, for use of the Kispiox Indian Day School and mission house.\n\nIn this connection it is noted the cost of the well is estimated at, approximately, $100.00, and that it is hoped the Department would provide one-half the cost. In view of the fact that this well will be used by the workers of the school and mission, the Department will agree to provide one-half the cost of the digging and cribbing. It is hoped that the Department's share of the cost will not exceed the sum of $50.\n\nAfter the well has been completed, you may forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the entire cost of the labour and materials in digging and cribbing. Upon receipt of this voucher, the Department will provide one-half the cost. It is to be distinctly understood that the church authorities will be responsible for the balance of the expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.

Last year the Department, on the recommendation of Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer, made two grants of $20.00 and $25.00, and the United Church voted similar amounts\u2014a total of $150.00 in all\u2014to dig a well and provide a pump.\n\nI am just in receipt of the following telegram:\n\n\"BURCHILL REPORTS SIX INCHES WATER AT THIRTY-SEVEN FEET ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GRANT EXHAUSTED EXPERIMENTED MINER RECOMMENDS CONTINUANCE DEFERRED INDICATIONS OF CLAY IN GRAVEL GATE-IN BOULDER AGAIST CRIBBING MAKES READING EXCAVATION MORE EXPENSIVE.\"\n\nNow, that we have spent so much money on this project, it seems too bad not to complete it.

In this connection I would refer you to official letter dated September 4th, 1935. The Church authorities now request that the Department advance a further sum of $50.00 towards the cost of obtaining an adequate water supply, on the understanding that a similar amount is to be contributed by the United Church authorities. The Department is informing the church authorities that a further sum of $50.00 will be provided towards the cost of placing the well in a serviceable condition.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward a voucher, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the entire cost of the labour and materials, and, upon receipt of this voucher, the Department will provide payment to the amount of $50. It is understood that the church authorities will be responsible for the balance of the expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHaselton, B.

The present room has been overcrowded during the past year with a frequent attendance of 55 to 60 pupils and, on account of the expected increase in September, I do recommend a second teacher and a second room for this school - if the Department can see its way to grant same.\n\nSome new desks would be necessary together with a teacher's table, heater and other small articles. However, these may be dealt with at a later date.\n\nI may say that the suggested alterations to the wood shed were found unsatisfactory and the estimates already submitted are for a second room to be erected at the opposite end of the school and will be in alignment with the present building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Estimate of Smithers Lumber Yard, plus delivery, $293.87\n\nThis estimate is not quite complete being minus shingle nails; one extra door; hinges; material for window frames, casings and sills; door frames, casings etc.\n\n2. Estimate of R. S. Sargent, Ltd., Hazelton,\nplus delivery, $359.43\n\nIn this second estimate you will note that provision has been made for the erection of a brick chimney and appears to be very complete to cover all detail.\n\nI estimate that the cost of Indian labour would be approximately $200.00.\n\nIf the Department can favourably consider this project may I kindly ask that very early action be taken so that the work can be completed before school opens in September?\n\nI may say there is no brick chimney in the present building and the installation of one would serve both rooms.\n\nTwo further copies of R.S. Sargent's estimate will be forwarded on the next mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing correspondence that you have received in connection with the proposed addition to the Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the proposed addition would be at least $500.00. No provision for this expenditure was made in the current year's appropriation and in view of the present set up of our Vote it is not possible to provide funds for this purpose this year.\n\nA note is being made of the necessity for an addition to this school and an endeavour will be made to provide the necessary funds in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith an application received from Indian Agent Mortimer for an addition of an extra class room to Kispiox Indian Day School, together with a copy of a letter from Reverend Dr. Osterhout, Superintendent of Home and Indian Missions of the United Church of Canada, and a copy of a letter from Inspector Barry to Dr. Osterhout, regarding the matter.\n\nReplying to the application on June 6th, it was pointed out to Captain Mortimer that there was no provision made in the estimates in the present fiscal year for such an expenditure and it was therefore highly unlikely that the Department would be able to authorize the construction. In order to place the matter before the Department, Captain Mortimer was requested to supply an estimate of the cost of materials required and the approximate cost of Indian labor. This information has now been received and is being forwarded herewith. Although the estimate submitted by R.S. Sargent is greater than that submitted by the Smithers Lumber Yard, the former is more complete and provides for a brick chimney which is not included in the estimate from the Smithers Lumber Yard. It will also be observed that Captain Mortimer estimates the cost of Indian labour at $20.00 so that the total cost of the proposed addition would be at least $560.00.\nShould funds be available, I would recommend that the application be favorably considered, and I may add that Inspector Barry is of the opinion that provision of additional accommodation at this school is now definitely necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Sargent\"\nDear Sir:\n\nRe- Indian Day School, Kispiox Reserve.\n\nAs the school term is nearly over, I feel it is an opportune time to bring to your notice, the inadequate condition of the present Indian Day School buildings on the Kispiox Reserve.\n\nFrom September 1937, the number of pupils have greatly increased, and there now 60 on the roll, with an average attendance of 45 to 50, of course there several children under school age, however further children will be enrolled when the school opens in September.\n\nOn my inspection visits I found the pupils greatly cramped for room, on several single seats two children were seated, it would be impossible to put further seats in the building, however if the building was extended it would eliminate the present congested situation.\n\nThe size of the school at present is as follows 31 feet long by 24 feet wide, this length could be increased by taking in the woodshed, giving a total of 41 by 24, this could be done at a reasonable cost.\n\nShould the Department desire to enlarge this school, I could get an estimate on material required, labour could be done by efficient Indian carpenters, under my own supervision.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n\"G.S. Mortimer\"\nIndian Agent.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMay 30th, 1938\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a letter from Rev. D.W. More, B.A., of Hazelton B.C., recently nominated by our Church as Missionary-teacher for Kishpiox, and duly ratified by your Department at Ottawa. I advised him to visit Kishpiox and look over the ground and report to me his findings; consequently I have this letter from him dated May 25th in which he says that he visited the school, now conducted by Miss Bews, who seems to be doing good work there but will need to be changed because the work requires an ordained minister and she went only as supply to the end of the school term.\n\nMr. More reports that on examining the roll of the school, there were on the roll 65 pupils, with a prospect of further increase this coming term. The maximum attendance at the present time is 48 and there were about fifty days with over 40 present at the school. Mr. More comments that these are significant figures, especially in view of the fact that most of the pupils are in grades 1, 2 and 3. To quote from his letter -\n\n\"It means that the extra individual attention always necessary in those grades and especially in view of the language difficulty is impossible....It means also that the variety of presentation of lessons in the older grades that would make the work attractive to older scholars is also impossible - a further cause of many failing to continue above the primary grades. These might be attracted to school again if an additional room were provided. None of the present enrolment should leave school this year, and when there is a considerable number which should commence, the situation will be seriously aggravated next fall. Expansion of the building is at least imperative, and if the Indian Department is willing to do that, perhaps they could be induced to go the whole way and add another room. The school is very promising and it would be a shame if it should suffer a set back from overcrowding just when so many of the pupils and parents are showing a real interest.\"\nCaptain Mortimer, he says, is all in favour of two rooms there and he believes Captain Barry is also favourable. He further states:\n\n\"In my opinion this is a golden opportunity to put the school on an entirely new and higher basis in the Community.\"\n\nMr. More, I may add, was an experienced public school teacher in British Columbia before he entered the Ministry of the United Church and we are looking for excellent results from his services at Kishpox and especially so if the Department will take up the question of the necessary accommodation required for that large Indian village.\n\nThanking you for your early consideration of this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n\"S.S. Osterhout\"\nSuperintendent of Missions\n\nSSO:AM\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n6th June, 1938\n\nDear Dr. Osterhout:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 30th, addressed to the Indian Commissioner for B.C., with reference to the Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you consider that the second division should be opened at this School next September. I may say in regard to this, that I have received letters from the Indian Agent, Capt. G.G. Mortimer, recommending that the present woodshed be incorporated in the school building and certain other changes made to provide for a satisfactory two-room school.\n\nI have asked Mr. Indian Agent Mortimer for certain further particulars and estimates, as without these it is impossible to recommend the project to the Department in Ottawa. On receipt of the required information, the matter will be taken up with Mr. Hoey.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Gerald H. Barry\"\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\n\nDr. S.S.

The matter was delayed due to the fact that my first letter was in the air mail which was burned at Regina. I am now in receipt of a letter from the missionary-teacher, who thinks that the church is hardly suitable \u2014 indeed, he says it is quite unsuitable. He does, however, say that the Inspector has recommended certain accommodations as available in the village, and I presume that you have that before you. I think he is right when he says that the people would resent the church being used unnecessarily for secular purposes.\n\nI believe our missionary-teacher at Kispiox is doing a very fine piece of work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have also received recently Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of this school on October 17.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the salary of a second teacher at this school and consequently the Department is unable to favourably consider the renting of an Indian house and the employment of a second teacher from January 1, 1939.\n\nOn August 3 last Indian Commissioner MacKay wrote to the Department in connection with the proposed addition to the Kispiox School. He was advised at that time that no provision for any expenditure of this nature had been made in the current year's appropriation. However, in preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 it was found possible to include the amount that Indian Commissioner MacKay stated would be required to erect an addition. You should, therefore, write to the Department for further instructions in June next and arrangements will be made at that time for building the addition during the months of July and August.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of School Inspector G.M. Barry's report regarding conditions at the Kispiox Indian Day School during his inspection in October, 1938.\n\nI fully concur with what Inspector Barry states regarding insufficient room at this school to accommodate all the children of school age. A report was forwarded to the Department, dated July 13th last, file S-1C-56, giving an estimate of the number of school-age pupils that would be in attendance during the present academic year.\n\nSince Inspector Barry's visit I have visited the Kispiox Reserve on several occasions and the chief complaint I have received from the Indians is the lack of school accommodation. Quite a number of parents have asked to have their children sent to the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School because of this condition.\n\nMay I suggest that the Department favourably consider Inspector Barry's remarks regarding the renting of a nearby Indian house, which can be procured at $6.00 per month, and the appointment of the teacher he recommends - Miss Bews - to commence on January 1st, 1939?\n\nI would appreciate an early reply and full instructions if this matter is favourably received.\n\nGCM/SM.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJuly 4, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Departmental file 151-12-5\nand your 15/1/5458 I have as requested read a letter C-1C-88\nfrom the Acting Indian Agent at Hazelton and would report\nas follows:\n\nIn my last report on the Kispiox Indian Day\nSchool dated October 22nd 1938, I suggested on pages 2 and 3\nthat a house might be rented near the school to provide for\nthe Primary Grades. The Department did not accept this\nsuggestion. I also suggested that within a short time it\nwould be necessary to add a second classroom to the present\nKispiox Indian Day School, to accommodate the increased\nattendance at that point.\n\nThis school is not one of those to be greatly\naffected, if affected at all, by the proposed distribution\nof pupils from Coqualeetza Indian Residential School.\nThere is however a very large attendance at the present time\nand the total registration this year has been around 70, a\nnumber far too great for one teacher. To accommodate the\nchildren it has been necessary to somewhat cut short the\nusual hours for the older pupils and to permit the youngest\nchildren to attend only from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. These\ntemporary arrangements are not satisfactory to the parents,\nas was explained on page 3 of my last report.\n\nThe suggested possible extension of 16 feet\nto the present school would be more than a waste of money\nas sufficient accommodation could not be provided for the\nincreasing attendance at Kispiox. The only possible\narrangement for a permanent solution of the problem here is\nthe suggested extension of the present school by 32 feet, and\nI wish to recommend that such an extension be carried out as\nsoon as possible, provided there are any funds for such a\npurpose. I certainly agree with the Acting Indian Agent\nthat the larger room or addition be erected in preference to\nthe smaller at the cost of even a year's delay in the work.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent suggests that the sum\nof $795.30 would cover the cost of the material and that\n$875.00 would cover the labor. If such a sum of around $800.00\nwould cover the material I believe the Department would be well\nadvised to set aside at least another $400.00 to $500.00 for\nlabor and some $250.00 for desks and equipment. In my opinion\nnot less than $1,500.00 might be included in the 1940-41\nEstimates for the purpose of adding and equipping a second\nroom at the Kispiox Indian Day School. I do not see how the\nwork could be carried out this year if such a sum as I have\nsuggested has not been provided in the 1939-40 Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - New Classroom for Kispiox Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of November 26th, 1936, and your letter of August 19th, 1936, I wish to advise you that I have received estimates for the material required to build an additional classroom to the present Kispiox Indian Day School from Messrs R.J. Sargent, Ltd., Hazelton, the only local firm that supplies lumber. These estimates, which I enclose in triplicate, are for extensions of eighteen (18) and thirty-two (32) feet respectively, amounting to $494.83 and $795.30 - for material only. The approximate cost of labour on the above would be $200.00 and $275.00, respectively.\n\nI made a thorough investigation regarding this extension and, in consultation with the Rev. D. W. More and Mr. Sargent, it was found that thirty-two feet added to the present school - which is also thirty-two feet - would be of far greater advantage and more in alignment with the present building than the smaller room. At the same time the number of pupils on this reserve, which is increasing yearly, should be taken into consideration. If the larger room could be built, the windows would all be on the one long side of the old and new buildings, whereas in the smaller room the windows would have to be at the end of the building, in order to conserve floor space for the desks.\n\nWhen the Estimates for 1939-1940 were submitted, the amount entered for this addition was in connection with the alteration of a lean-to and woodshed, which would have given - at the most - an extension of twelve feet. This suggestion was not feasible and the amount inadequate for a properly built classroom. May I mention that the cost of the addition of twelve feet to the same classroom at Kitegukla was $566.30 where the width was only eighteen feet, compared to a width of twenty-five feet at Kispiox?\n\nMay I suggest that, if at all possible, the larger classroom be added to the Kispiox Day School?\n\nRegarding the present Kispiox Day School Building it was found that all the cedar posts had rotted, numbering 24. These should be replaced before the new classroom is commenced. The cost, including labour, would be approximately $20.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

As you are aware, our appropriation this year has been kept to the minimum and in preparing our estimates it was only possible to include an amount of $200.00 for repairs and painting that might be required at all the schools in the Babine agency. It is quite possible that the Kispiox School is in the worst condition, and the Department has no objection to painting the exterior of this school, provided it is distinctly understood by the Indian Agent that if a total of $200 is spent it will require the full amount that is available. In the event of your proceeding with this work you may arrange for the purchase of the paint required, as shown in the attached letter, and when forwarding the account, a copy of your purchase order should be attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n14th instant, the Department approves an expenditure\nof $44. for repairs to the bell used at the Kispiox\nDay School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of May 21st in connection with a proposed expenditure of $44.00 for repairs to the bell used at the Kispiox School and erection of a stage from which to suspend the bell. This matter was left in abeyance pending investigation by the School Inspector who now reports that the bell, although the property of the Band, was apparently broken while being used for school purposes, and that it served a very useful purpose in arousing the village and getting the pupils to school on time. Subject to the Indians agreeing to the use of the bell for school purposes for so long as it may be required it is recommended that the Department approve an expenditure of $44.00 for repairs and the erection of the staging.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBabine Agency\n\nHazelton, B.C. May 21, 1947\n\nMajor D.M. McKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nThe Reverend R. Morris has approached me regarding repairs to a large bell which was housed in the Church at Kispiox before that building burned down. It was afterwards taken and used as a school bell but was recently broken. Repairs cost $24. It is now intended to erect a staging from which to suspend the bell close to the school and it is estimated that this will cost $20. On behalf of the Kispiox Natives who own it, Mr. Morris has asked if the Department would bear the cost of repairs and of the staging. Undoubtedly, this bell serves a very useful purpose, for it is large enough to be heard from one end of the Reserve to the other and being rung sometime before school assembly, it serves to arouse parents and children from bed and an hour later summons them to school. I feel that we might reasonably pay these costs or at least a major portion of them.\n\nJ.V.

For this purpose we would require 1200 f.b.m. rough lumber at $40.00, plus two rolls roofing at $4.95 per roll.\n\nWe require a further 500 f.b.m. rough lumber to erect a new toilet at the school for girls plus a roll of roofing at $4.95. For the labour we have a balance of $73.70 on the Accountable Advance for general repairs to schools, this should probably be enough to cover it. There are other miscellaneous minor repairs around the school which can be completed at the same time, such as provision of new steps for the woodshed and repairs to several windows.\n\nYour early authorization for these repairs would be appreciated.\n\nJ.V.

In this connection I would refer you to your letter of September 18th, file 1-11-3, also to Purchase Order No. 17267.\n\nAlso, on the voucher are materials required for repairs and replacement at the Hazelton Indian Day School No. 1 (Junior). You will note purchase of 1 Camp Comfort Heater. On a cold morning early in November, Mrs. E. Dunbar, teacher, sent word to the office that the stove could no longer be used. I found that a log of wood had pushed the back completely out of this old stove. It could not be repaired until a set of new bolts was received from Vancouver. I, therefore, purchased a new stove and had it installed that day. The old stove is being put in order for use elsewhere in a similar emergency.\n\nJ. V.

And will it be paid quarterly? Miss Kilbourne commenced her duties on April 7th, I believe. When she was appointed, I informed her that the Government paid $500. for her salary and of this amount she would receive $450. the balance going to the W.M.S. for her travelling and expenses incidental to her living in the W.M.S. Home.\n\nThis was quite acceptable to Miss Kilbourne. We find it more satisfactory for all our agents on the Indian fields to receive the same salary, we therefore supplement the $400. paid by the Government for Kitamaat school teacher's salary, making it also $450.00\n\nR.J.

Kilburne.\"\n\nI am aware that Miss Kilburne has resigned, but it is not all due to the amount of work her health has been very poor for some time, her services have been very acceptable and the missionary society would be glad to retain her. She is an employee of Rev. W.M.S. and I have mailed your letter to Mrs. Kerr of Toronto asking her to write you at once in the behalf of their family.

From the date mentioned, therefore, the church will be wholly responsible for the management, financial and otherwise, of the institution and the Department cannot contribute to the salary of a nurse. From the reports received on Miss Kilbourne's work it appeared that it was very satisfactory, but the combined duties of nurse in connection with the boarding school and field matron were heavier than her strength would stand. Of course it is understood that should your church decide to appoint a nurse in connection with the staff at Kitumant that the duties will be confined to the school alone; field matron work will not be included.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Now the Council are asking in payment 25\u00a2 per pole. Next time they say it will be 6\u00a2 per pole.\n\nI should think that when said poles are used for improvements on the house grounds situated and is on the Reserve and being for the sole benefit of the Indian Club we should have the privilege of covering all that are necessary for such work.

Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Matron of the Kitamaat B. C. Home, Miss L. J. Donogh, has written to the Department that she is having a lawn levelled in front of the building, that the soil is sandy and the situation is a side hill and some poles are required for cribbing, which might be taken from a thick second growth back of the Home, which was done in the past when an occasional pole was required.\n\nThe Indians have objected to the cutting of the poles and are asking 25 cents for each and they say that in future the price will be $1.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that these poles are for improvements on the reserve, and for the sole use of the Indian children, the Department considers no charge should be made, and I have to request you to remonstrate with the Indians and endeavour to show them the unreasonableness of their claim under the circumstances, and assure them that the Department is favourably disposed to allow the Home to cut the number of poles required free of charge.\n\nWhen the matter is arranged satisfactorily, you will be good enough to advise Miss Donogh of the result.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.

He has been instructed to communicate with you later on the subject.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss L. J.

C.\nHilmaral, Oct. 20, 1911\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your of Sept. 23 addressed to the Secretary, Miss Lawson, I beg to say that Miss Lawson was suddenly called home to St. John's, N.B., by her mother's illness and untimely death, and asked me to take charge of her work until some other arrangement was made.\n\nWith regard to the reports of recent peculiar that the Dept. should be in the dark about our educational work here. However perhaps we can make it clear now. Permit me then to say that we have two Boarding Schools, both entirely by the Church, and until now maintained entirely by the Church. Also we have a Day School, the building having been built three years ago by the Indian Department of Canada. This school is a separate institution from the Church. The school is a school, i.e., in close union with the Boarding School. There is no school, i.e., in close union with the Boarding School, but the children of the latter attend the day school as do the children from the homes of the village. The Principal of the Boarding School and the Principal of the Day School are two different and independent workers, not necessarily under the same authority. Accordingly the reports are only under the same authority. Accordingly the reports you have are reports of the Day School only, and accordingly you have no report of the Boarding School. I would be glad if you would find time to send a copy to the Dept. as it may help to avoid difficulties in the future.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\nC. J. Reddick,\nSecretary of Hilmaral Mission\nOttawa, May 30, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a recent report on the Kitamaat Day School, states as follows: \"Miss Clarke is an excellent teacher. She is a good disciplinarian. She has two schools really. The 35 pupils from the Boarding school attend the same class-room as the pupils from the village. This is not an ideal condition as it is difficult to work the pupils together on account of the irregular attendance of the day school pupils\".\n\nWhen you were at Ottawa last week you suggested that the day pupils should attend school half a day and the boarding school pupils half a day. The Department approves of your suggestion being carried out and would like you to inform the school authorities to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nExtract from report of Inspector R. H. Cairns\non the Kitamaat Day School, Dated April 16, 1917. Original\non 132906/6.\n\nMiss Clarke is an excellent teacher. She is\na good disciplinarian.\n\nShe has two schools really. The 35 pupils from\nthe Boarding School attend the same class-room as the\npupils from the village. This is not an ideal condition\nas it is difficult to work the pupils together on account\nof the irregular attendance of the day school pupils.\nEXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF INSPECTOR DAIRYS ON THE KITIMAT DAY SCH.\n\nI met the people and discussed with them the poor attendance of the day school. They claimed that the teacher gave most of her attention to the boarding school pupils.\n\nIn my opinion, there is no foundation for such a charge. As the boarding school pupils attend every day, it is quite natural that their rate of progress must be much faster than the others.\n\nReport dated\u2014April 16th, 1917.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nKlinitat Day School - Methodist Church.\n\nVisited August 3rd. Miss Clark is the teacher in charge but the school was closed for the summer holidays. The building is in good condition and well equipped with the necessary furnishings. The attendance during the term has been large owing to the fact that the pupils from the boarding school attend here.\n\nA. M. Tyson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report on the schools in your agency, Inspector R. H. Cairns, states that the attendance at the Kitamaat Day School and Bella Bella Day School is very unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will point out to the Indians the value and necessity of sending their children to the school regularly and it is hoped that the attendance at these two schools will improve in the near future.\n\nThe Department is ordering from Bromley & Hegue, Winnipeg, Man., three Union Jacks for the Kitamaat, Hartley Bay and Fort Simpson Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Fouger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nBella Coola,\nB.C.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR R.H.

The class-room is sufficiently\nlarge to accommodate all new pupils.\n\nHoping this will prove satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMildred J. Armstrong.\nSIR:\n\nReferring to your letter of 6th instant No.132906/1, I have the honor to say that I have written a letter to the teacher of the Kitimat day school; upon the receipt of a reply giving the information required by the Department I shall be in position to write the report asked for in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with enclosure from the teacher of the Kitimat Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the explanation with regard to the returns is satisfactory. The Department wishes to consider the continuance of the grant to the day school. I may say that it is prepared to pay a salary to the teacher provided there are sufficient children from the village attending and providing further that there is accommodation in the school class-room for all the children from the boarding school who attend and a sufficient number of day pupils to justify the payment of the grant. I would ask you to report fully to the Department in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Poumer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the June report for Kitimat Bay school has been returned to me together with an explanatory letter; both of which are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSec., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 30, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a recent report on the Kitamaat Day school, states that the 35 pupils from the boarding school attend the same class-room as the pupils from the village and that this is not an ideal condition, as it is difficult to work the pupils together on account of the irregular attendance of the day school pupils.\n\nRev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools, who was at the Department last week, suggested that the day pupils should attend school half a day and the boarding school pupils half a day.

Ferrier\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that this office is in receipt of a letter from Miss Hazel Guild, teacher of day school at Kitimat, dated December 24th, 1930, from which I beg to quote as follows:\n\n\"I have 52 pupils enrolled with a promise of four others after vacation. The seating capacity of the room is taxed to its utmost. It seems to me that another department in the school will be a necessity here very shortly - if teacher and pupils are to have a fair chance to do their best.\"\n\nAs the Department will know there is at Kitimat, a residential school for girls of all ages, and for boys up to twelve years of age. The pupils from the residential school receive classroom instruction in buildings detached from the residential school, together with day school pupils from the village, by the same teacher, at present, Miss Hazel Guild.\n\nFifty-two pupils are too many for one teacher to handle properly, and it would be well if arrangements could be made for an assistant teacher. If the pupils from the residential school could be taught separately from those from the village, the class room would not be crowded.\n\nIn your letter of April 6th, 1930, No. 162-16-5, this school was promised a new floor, and I trust this matter will not be forgotten; the old floor is of fir, and slivery.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, January 27, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to acquaint you with the situation at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School and at the Day School there. There is a small boarding school, conducted by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church. As the pupils of this boarding school receive their classroom instruction along with day scholars from the Indian village at the day school, the classroom has become very crowded. There are 52 enrolled at the present time and there will shortly be an additional four. I believe that the privileges granted to the pupils of the boarding school will have to be discontinued, and I have to request that the boarding school management provide a classroom and teacher in residence. The usual residential school per capita grant is paid at Kitamaat, and this should include all teaching services. Will you please, therefore, ask the W.M.S. to arrange, at their earliest convenience, for a separate classroom for the boarding school pupils and for a separate teacher. This will leave the day school building for the day pupils and the Department will continue meeting the expense of this separate activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, January 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to a communication which you received from the teacher of the Kitamaat Indian Day School, in which she states the seating capacity of the classroom is taxed to its utmost. In this connection I have to say that the Department is taking up with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the residential school in this place is conducted, the question of their arranging to provide classroom accommodation and a teacher for the pupils of the residential school, separate from the present day school. If this is done, there would, no doubt, be ample accommodation at the day school for the pupils who would attend as day scholars. When the Department is informed as to the arrangements the church authorities can provide for classroom accommodation for the pupils of the residential school, you will be advised.\n\nWith reference to the installing of a new floor in the day school building, for which you submitted a detailed estimate of the materials and labour in your letter dated April 17th, 1930, I have to say that, no doubt, funds will be available for this improvement next spring. I would request that you again draw the matter to the attention of the Department at that time. It would be advisable that you give a new estimate, stating in detail the costs of the material, labour, etc. If the work is authorized, it could be carried out during the summer holiday period. It is further noted that a shed is required, in which to store the fuel. You might, at the same time, give particulars as to the size and type of shed you would recommend be erected and the cost of the material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fougnier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kitamaat Indian Day School, states that Miss H. Guild, the present teacher, is resigning at the end of the present school year. I shall, therefore, be pleased if the authorities of the United Church of Canada will nominate the services of a qualified teacher for this school, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. The Inspector recommends that only a teacher having British Columbia qualifications and special training in primary work be engaged.\n\nThe Inspector further states that this school has not been very successful during the current school year, due largely to overcrowding in the classroom. He states that if the children from the residential school continue to attend the day school, it will be necessary to provide a second classroom. In this connection I would refer you to our letter dated January 27th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMiss H. Guild. - $750 per annum.\n\nThe school is not successful. There are far too many children in the school for this teacher to handle. About 75% of the children were at their desks doing nothing. The teacher has no idea of how to handle seat work for the remainder while she teaches one class.\n\nThis teacher is resigning her position at the end of the school term.\n\nThere is little difficulty in getting the children to come to school. I was very sorry to hear that the present teacher turned away about 8 boys from the village who wished to attend school. Her reason for this was that she had no room with 59 on the roll. In addition there are other children in the village who should be at school.\n\nA second schoolroom is needed at Kitamaat to take care of the increased attendance. If the children from the Residential School did not attend the Day School there would be no need for the extra room. There is no room at the Residential School that could be used as a schoolroom. It has been suggested that the sewing room be used as a schoolroom. This is impossible as it would not accommodate the 36 children, perhaps not more than 12. In any case it is not suitable as a schoolroom. It seems possible that the Residential School may be closed. The children at the Residential School come for the most part from Kitamaat Village. If the Residential School closes we shall have these children in the Day School. The teacher of the Day School is apparently a member of the Staff of the Residential School. I fail to see why the Residential School, while in receipt of per capita grant for the children living there, does not provide for their education at the Residential School.\n\nOwing to the large number of children in attendance at this school a well trained teacher is necessary, one who has special qualifications in Primary Work.

We have communicated its contents to the Woman's Missionary Society and when we have their nomination for a successor to Miss Guild, we shall be pleased to forward it to you.\n\nWith regard to the over-crowded condition of the classroom, please refer to Mr. Beaton's letters of January 1st and April 1st (your file No. 162-1-1). The latter, containing the recommendation of the Executive Committee of the Woman's Missionary Society, was written shortly after Mr. Beaton's return from Ottawa, when he discussed this matter with officials of the Department and I believe was given to understand that the solution proposed in this letter would be satisfactory to the Department. I shall be glad to have your assurance with regard to this, as our Woman's Missionary Society is anxious to have you confirm their understanding that the arrangement proposed is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bertram, teacher of the Indian day school at Kitamaat, B.C., informs the Department that she is giving up duties as teacher.

The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be submitted for the approval of the Department.

I shall be glad to hear from you just what is wrong, so that it may be corrected.\n\nFurther, Miss Horton says that Captain Barry states that the school is not to open until 1st October. We quite understand that salary will begin on that date, but I am wondering if there is any objection to the school being used by the teacher if the salary is paid by the Woman's Missionary Society.

The teacher, however, appeared to be more irritable than usual. I understand that the principal of the boarding school is likely to be retired after June 30th. If this is correct, I believe the church would be well advised to nominate a new Day School teacher's aid.

At Kitimat Miss Nelson, the teacher, is doing a good work but I consider it is not fair to the teacher or scholars to be in an overcrowded school. There were fifty-five present on the day of my visit. At Bella Bella Miss Perry is working hard and is doing all that can be expected. On account of the lack of accommodation the children are divided into two sections. The seniors attend school in the morning and the juniors in the afternoon.

I further explained that I could not say when the Altamata school would open as were it considered a day school the date would be October 1st but were it considered the classroom of the residential school the date would be earlier.\n\nMy reference to the situation at Kitamaat as far as the day school teacher was concerned was to the effect that in the past this had not been very satisfactory the teacher failing to teach the village children for the whole day and spending too great a time with the pupils from the residential school. I explained that the boys of 15 discharged from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School who did not go to Coqualeetza failed to attend regularly the so-called day school, that the little children from the village were sent home after a short time in school morning and afternoon, and that in general not sufficient attention was given to the day school pupils. I asked Miss Horton to rectify this unsatisfactory situation.\n\nIn passing I may refer you to the Report of Indian Affairs Branch for Fiscal Year ended March 31st 1939 where on Page 266 some 42 children are shown as being educated in the Kitamaat Indian Residential School, while on Page 261 some 61 pupils are shown on the roll of the Kitamaat Indian Day School. These numbers are not correct as the pupils shown as from the residential school are again shown as in the day school. The correct number of day school pupils would be 61 less 42 or 19. These pupils only attend part of the day and the teacher, as previously reported, has not taken sufficient interest in them.\n\nI trust that Miss Horton's appointment is as stated for one year only, for if we have a new two-room day school at Kitamaat later we shall require a more successful teacher whether in charge of the senior or junior division.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H.B.,\nInspector of Indian schools, B.C.\nOttawa, July 19, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 2nd instant and official reply of the 5th instant, in connection with the appointment of Miss Ruby Horton as teacher of the Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has received a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay, in which he states that those interested have been advised that Miss Horton will be at Kitimat for the month of September.\n\nWith regard to Miss Horton's statement that the situation at Kitimat insofar as the day school is concerned is not very satisfactory, the Inspector has forwarded the following explanation:\n\n\"My reference to the situation at Kitimat as far as the day school teacher was concerned was to the effect that in the past this had not been very satisfactory, the teacher failing to teach the village children for the whole day and spending too great a time with the pupils from the residential school.

We trust that Miss Horton will rectify it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD: BJ\nI should point out, however, that there is no room in the residential school large enough to accommodate the forty children. They might possibly be educated on the half day system, the present sewing room perhaps being large enough to take twenty children. This would involve the supply of new desks, etc.\n\nAs a temporary solution for the present academic year, I would recommend that the Indian Residential School children at Kitamaat be educated on the half day system, twenty attending the Day School at the morning session and twenty at the afternoon session. As there appear to be in excess of twenty village children now available, it would be better, from an educational point of view, to have these children also divided into two groups, approximately one-half attending in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend that authority be sought from the Department to carry out the above suggested plan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nBox 444,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nOctober 31, 1940.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter 69/7131 of the 15th instant, it is noted that the attendance of children at the Kitamaat Indian Day School is considerably increased since the appointment of the new teacher, Miss Ruby J. Horton.\n\nThe unsatisfactory conditions with regard to the Kitamaat Residential and Day Schools have been mentioned in my reports on a number of occasions.\n\nMiss Ruby J. Horton was no doubt appointed teacher of the Kitamaat Indian Day School on the direct recommendation of the Woman's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada, as the Kitamaat Indian Residential School is administered by that society. In neither Miss Horton's nor Mr. Christie's letters has it been clearly stated that there are at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School some forty children whose education is carried out by Miss Horton, the Indian Day School teacher. Miss Horton is also responsible for the education of the village children, now some twenty to twenty-five in number.\n\nAs you know, the Department is erecting a new Indian Day School at Kitamaat which will later absorb both Indian Residential and Day School children. I am not aware of when the school will be ready for occupation but have understood that the Kitamaat Indian Residential School will operate as such until the end of the present academic year in June.\n\nAs the above named Residential School receives a per capita grant, the Principal, Mrs. Durman, could no doubt be called upon to arrange for the education of the children in the residential school itself. This would leave the present day school, a separate building, for the village children.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 1st instant the Department approves the adoption of the half day system for the balance of the current academic year at the Kitamaat Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Indian agent Christie has recently written this office forwarding a copy of a letter received by him from Miss Ruby J. Norton, teacher at Kitamaat, regarding overcrowding at the school.\n\nThis condition is simply due to the existing arrangement whereby the Residential and Day School pupils are taught in the one room Day School building.\n\nIn his letter to me on the subject, dated October 31st, a copy of which is attached, Inspector Barry has pointed out that this difficulty might be overcome by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada being called upon to arrange for the education of the children for whom the per capita grant is paid, in the Residential School itself. This arrangement would, of course, necessitate the appointment by the United Church of a teacher for the Residential School children, but at the same time it would leave the Day School teacher, whose full salary is paid for by the Department, free to devote her attention to the non-grant earning pupils of the village.\n\nIt might be very difficult, however, for the United Church to secure the services of an additional teacher at this time and as the term is well advanced, it is considered that the problem could best be solved by adopting the half time system for the balance of the current academic year as recommended by Inspector Barry.\n\nI should appreciate authority to put this plan into effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nApril 16th,\n1941.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe - Kitimat\n\nWhilst the decision has been made to close the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home, following the building of the two-roomed school, I think that you ought to have a copy of a Memorandum which was sent some time ago to the Woman's Missionary Society, signed by the Chief and Councillors and Mr. Caldwell, who was in charge of our mission.\n\nYou will note that this Memorandum asks for the continuation of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home. In view of the action taken by the Department, I do not think that this can be done, but, at the same time, I do think there ought to be pressure brought on the Indians to remain at home as much as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.LT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6396, File 820-1, part 1)\nWith the building of the new Indian day school, providing accommodation for all children of school age, in the village of Kitimat, and the apparent intention of the Department of Indian Affairs to substitute the day school system for the partial residential school system of education now accommodating the Indians of Kitimat, concern is felt by the Kitimat Indian Band and the educational and mission workers among the Kitimat people as to the future of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home.\n\nThe Kitimat Band and the Mission workers have greatly appreciated the privileges in education that have been extended to them by the Department of Indian Affairs through the facilities of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home and the Coqualeetza Residential School, and realise that the considerable advance made by the Kitimat Band in economic self-support, in domestic housing and appointments, and in appreciation of morality and right living has been almost entirely due to the training in these institutions.\n\nIt is respectfully submitted, however, that, if it is the intention of the Department of Indian Affairs to withdraw support from the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home, thus necessitating the closing of that institution, a complete investigation be made of the circumstances of industrial employment of the Kitimat people to determine whether:\n\n1. The seasonal migration of the Kitimat people to provide means of livelihood can be so restricted and controlled as to permit of the attendance of the Kitimat children at the new day school during a reasonable school term without causing serious depletion of the income of the Indian people.\n\n2. If it is found that migration due to seasonal occupations cannot be so restricted, the change from complete residential school facilities, provided heretofore by the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home and the Coqualeetza school, to intermittent, short-period attendance at the new day school is a change of so drastic a nature as to retard the progress of the Kitimat people.\n\nMigrations of the Kitimat Band in search of support-providing occupation in the fishing, canning, logging and trapping industries vary from year to year, depending, to a large extent, on whether the summer fishing and cannery occupation provides sufficient income for the support of families at home on the reserve during at least the earlier part of the winter. If, as the situation particularly was during the 1940 summer fishing and cannery season, sufficient income is not thus derived, then it would seem to be a necessity to family support that the winter occupations of canning, logging and trapping be engaged in, these means of employment having hitherto required the migration of families from the reserve.\n\nAttention should be drawn to the fact that there are no means of income-generating occupation to be found on, or in the immediate vicinity of the Kitimat Reserve.\nThe function of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home in taking charge of the children of parents who find it necessary to leave the reserve to engage in occupations contributing to means of support, thus ensuring the full school term education of the children, has been one of increasing necessity of recent years. During the school term beginning September 1st 1940 to the end of January 1941 the approximate average attendance of pupils at the present day school was 50. Of these, 40 were domiciled in the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home during the absence of their parents engaged in support-providing occupation away from the reserve. During this period, therefore, were it not for the services of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home, out of a total of some 70 children of school age belonging to the Kitimat reserve, the day school attendance would have been approximately 10.\n\nWhile the income from the summer fishing of 1940 was perhaps unusually poor, necessitating possibly a greater fall and winter migration than is sometimes necessary, there is, nevertheless, no indication that the summer fishing in succeeding years will provide an appreciably greater income than that of 1940, keeping in mind that one of the prime causes of the depletion of Indian income from this source is the large number of fishermen engaged in the industry on the coasts of British Columbia, there being no prospect of a change for the better in this situation.\n\nThe following sets forth the seasonal movements of the large majority of the Kitimat people during the year, March 1st 1940 to Feb. 26th, 1941, the dates given being approximate:\n\nMarch 1st - April 1st...Commercial fishing and canning workers at home at Kitimat.\nTrapping workers engaged until March 15th.\nLogging workers engaged during month.\n\nApril 1st - May 15th...Entire population engaged in codlachan fishing and the rendering of codlachan oil, also smoking and drying fish and the planting of potatoes at the Old Reserve, distant about 4 miles from Kitimat.\n\nMay 15th - June 10th...All at Kitimat.\n\nJune 10th - August 15th...Part of population fishing and canning at River's Inlet.\n\nJune 10th - Sept. 15th...Rest of population fishing and canning Bute Dale, Gardner Canal or Skeena River.\n\nAug. 15th - Sept. 15th...River's Inlet workers home at Kitimat.\n\nSept. 15th - Feb. 1st...Part population having canning at Bute Dale. (women mainly employed)\n\nSept. 15th - March 1st...Rest of population mainly engaged in trapping and logging.\n\nFeb. 1st - March 1st...Bute Dale workers expected to return to Kitimat.\n\nIt can be noted that the distances from the Kitimat Reserve to localities of occupation during the school term are approximately as follows:\nIt should also be noted that while the Indian men are engaged at the logging and trapping camps, the women are occupied at these camps cooking, providing native foods and bottling and smoking meats.\n\nShould the suggested investigation corroborate the foregoing facts, it is requested that the Department of Indian Affairs continue to support the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home in the interests of the uninterrupted continuance of the primary education of the children of the Kitimat Band, at least until such time as it may be definitely determined that a restriction of customary migration, permitting care of the children in the Indian homes and their attendance at the day school during a reasonable school term, can be resorted to without reducing the Indian income below a point necessary for home and child support.\n\nRespectfully submitted:\n\nFor the Kitimat Band;\n\nRichard Morrison \u2014 Chief\nTimothy Starr \u2014 Councillor\n\nFor the Mission Workers:\n\nA. E. Caldwell \u2014 Missionary\nCaroline O. Field \u2014 Reg. M. Field Matron.\n\nKitimat, B. C. February 1st, 1941\n\n(Mrs. E.H.) Fanny G. Burnin.\nMatron.\nMr. Wm. Christie,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Christie,\n\nI am enclosing herewith marriage certificates.\n\nI am sorry that you could not have come up here as there are a number of things I would like to discuss with you. Perhaps it is just as well you did not come for, with the Supt. of Missions aboard, and only staying here for a short time there would not have been much opportunity for you to be done.\n\nMost of the people are back on the Reserve again, still at the reduction plant at Butedale, some trapping and logging. I think the opportunity is good to institute the election in the Council that you intended last fall, and it is a question much needed. A proper organization, with an elected council, would, I am sure, do much to regulate matters on this reserve. It would also be of great advantage to the restriction of migration of the people, thus enabling the children to attend the new day school at least during the winter months.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion, for several reasons, that Butedale migration during the winter should be definitely discouraged. First, such migration is an economic loss to the Reserve. With the absence from the Reserve of the population of last year, the average cash receipts for wages by the women was about $15.00. The men will average less as few of them are employed. Much more could have been made by trapping and logging, as is admitted by the people themselves. Some of the people were trapping before they left for Butedale, and admitted that they were very well at trapping. The urge to leave the reserve is simply the old idea of congregating together, especially when there is opportunity of license. Speaking from the point of view of administration, the reports of homebrewing and gambling at Butedale, indulged in by both the women and the men, cannot be anything but a bad effect, particularly on the younger people who are permitted more license generally at the fishing camps.\n\nThis behaviour is not evident when the people are at home in Kitimat. With a strong Council and Chief the whole situation can be controlled.\nI would strongly recommend that the financing of logging equipment be arranged for the Kitimat people as it was for Bella Coola. It is true that past experience does not appear to warrant this step, but there was a conspicuous lack of organization and of authoritative Council supervision during these past operations and also there was the complication of the use of private equipment. I think that the people are ready for a reorganization of the Council and I have (in conversation) suggested that, if the people of Kitimat would lay out a definite working policy, acceptable to the Department, in a logging operation, it might be possible to get the assistance required.\n\nFurther, there is the matter of the restriction of migration from the Reserve (at least by the women) so that the children can attend the new day school. We have gone into this recently and it is a matter that should be thoroughly investigated. I see no reason why the women cannot remain home during the school term, but there must be definite restrictions placed upon them. The encouraging of the logging industry will assist in removing some of the excuse for migration. Certainly, the migration to Butedale this winter was not an economic advantage. It should be a matter of concern to the Department that, had it not been for the care of some 40 children in the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home during this school term beginning September 1st, the attendance at the day school would have averaged about 9 out of some 70 children of school age in the Band.\n\nAccording to the Indian Act, the Life Chief can retain his title during his lifetime, if the system is changed to an elective one. However, the elective chief would have the authority. Definite by-laws could and should be made on this Reserve giving the Council such control of Reserve conduct as is permitted by the Department. It should also be pointed out to the Council, in the event of the new system being established, that, in enforcing their by-laws, the Council cannot constitute itself a Court, but must look to the Indian agent or other appointed judicial authority for the levying of penalties. This is a procedure that is not at present understood by the Band.\n\nI may say that a reorganization as suggested would meet with the approval of at least two-thirds of the Band, especially the younger generation. As an instance of this, the prospective life chief, Gordon Robinson, whose marriage certificate I enclose, states that he is not in favour of the continuance of the life chief system. Gordon's recent experience has been very trying. As the prospective chief, his family, and the old \"aristocracy\" of the Band, insisted on picking his wife for him. He became engaged to another girl, and, as the family did everything they could to separate them, Gordon took the course (practically forced by circumstances into it) of co-habiting with the girl he wanted to\nforestall any attempt to separate them. I married them, but without the consent of Gordon's family. A new system would do away with the old idea that the elders have the privilege of arranging the marriage of the young people without their consent. The present system has much to do with the marriage complications now prevalent and is no incentive to morality.\n\nI think it would be to the advantage of the Kitimat people if these matters were gone into by Department authority. The younger and more progressive people cannot buck the old system successfully unless they have the strong backing of authority.\n\nI will have to get another couple of cords of wood in a day or two for the day-school. As this is necessary, I presume it will be sanctioned if you do not come up in the meantime. The wood that was originally put up was green and iced from being stacked outdoors and it has been a constant job to keep the fire going. However, the school is in good condition. I will have to leave the firing with the chief when I leave, and some arrangements will have to be made with him.\n\nI have your letter re the potato club. I think, perhaps, this had better wait until you come up. Under the present circumstances, where there is no attention given to the gardens in the summer, I don't think much could be done with a Club here. I do not, however, see any necessity for the supply of seed potatoes here yearly. The people should be instructed that the supply of seed is not now necessary, that they should pit their seed in a community pit, or keep them in their cellars during the winter. If they knew there was no prospect of obtaining further seed they would take care to keep seed out of the crop. As you know, the reserve is completely deserted from June until about the end of August, and thus the crop gets no summer care.\n\nI am busy packing and will leave on next boat. I must be in Winnipeg on March 15th to take plane for Norway House. I hope you will be able to get up before I leave so that we can talk things over. I may say that a request has gone in to the Church, which will doubtless reach the Department for an investigation of the conditions surrounding the industrial migration of the Kitimat people before the Department withdraws support from the School Home. Personally, I do not see how any appreciable attendance can be expected at the day school under the present conditions without the services of the Home. In the course of a year or so, it might be arranged that the women stay home from the trapping and logging camps so that the children can go to school. As I have said, I do not see any need for the migration to Butedale during the winter. However, this will have to be arranged by the exertion of authority by the Department, unless there is a reorganization of the Council as I have suggested, in which case the Council will\nthat the children can attend school.\n\nIt does not appear that a successor to myself will be appointed here until Conference time in May. In the meantime it is arranged that the teacher, Miss Horton, takes a service on Sunday. To do this it has been arranged that she be relieved from all her duties in the Home. Probably Mrs. Durnin will be given another staff member. Miss Field is taking over the Post Office pro-tem.\n\nIf you could come up on the Steamer to Butedale I think it would not be difficult to get a boat to bring you here and take you back. I believe Donald Grant is now at Butedale awaiting repairs to his engine so that he can come here. Once here you could get a boat to go back to Butedale. Whether the circumstances would warrant the expense involved you know best. You perhaps would find it necessary to make a report on the new school, the additional work to be done on the surroundings, and also the question of whether it should be opened before next fall. The present school is quite full now, but there will be the departure for the Old Reserve for Colachan fishing soon and the school will again have few, if any, children from the village attending.\n\nI think that is about all I have to report for the present.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"A.E.Caldwell\"\nOttawa,\nApril 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence and a memorandum relating to educational facilities at Kitimat, B.C.

I may say that a request has gone in to the Church, which will doubtless reach the Department for an investigation of the conditions surrounding the industrial migration of the Kitimat people before the Department withdraws support from the School Home. Personally, I do not see how any appreciable attendance can be expected at the day school under the present conditions without the services of the Home. In the course of a year or so, it might be arranged that the women stay home from the trapping and logging camps so that the children can go to school. As I have said, I do not see any need for the migration to Buteaud during the winter. However, this will have to be arranged by the exertion of authority by the Department, unless there is a reorganization of the Council as I have suggested, in which case the Council will have the function of regulating the movements of the people so...\nthat the children can attend school.\n\nIt does not appear that a successor to myself will be appointed here until Conference time in May. In the meantime it is arranged that the teacher, Miss Horton, takes a service on Sunday. To do this it has been arranged that she be relieved from all her duties in the Home. Probably Mrs. Durnin will be given another staff member. Miss Field is taking over the Post Office pro-tem.\n\nIf you could come up on the Steamer to Butedale I think it would not be difficult to get a boat to bring you here and take you back. I believe Donald Grant is now at Butedale awaiting repairs to his engine so that he can come here. Once here you could get a boat to go back to Butedale. Whether the circumstances would warrant the expense involved you know best. You perhaps would find it necessary to make a report on the new school, the additional work to be done on the surroundings, and also the question of whether it should be opened before next fall. The present school is quite full now, but there will be the departure for the Old Reserve for Colachan fishing soon and the school will again have few, if any, children from the village attending.\n\nI think that is about all I have to report for the present.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"A.E.Caldwell\"\nDear Sir:\n\nYour file 15/2/1743.\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of April 20, 1941, enclosing memo from Mr. A. L. Caldwell regarding the closing of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home.\n\nThere is no doubt that considerable difficulty will be experienced for a year or two before a satisfactory attendance can be obtained for the new Day School at Kitimat. The Indians have become so long accustomed to the Department looking after their children of school age, feeding and clothing them, and thus relieving them of considerable expense.\n\nThe Elizabeth Long Memorial Home has been in some ways a success for the pupils fortunate enough to be admitted. On the other hand the children who were not admitted, perhaps on medical grounds or for some other reason, have been very badly discriminated against, since the teacher and school which was rightly theirs, has been used by the Residential School pupils, who have always had a certain amount of preference. This has resulted in the disorganized state of affairs now so apparent when these children have reached manhood and womanhood, laying the foundations of different factions which have become organized into clubs. The result is that with all the advantages these children have received, educated at the Home, a large number at Coqualeetza, they are now unable to earn their own village utilities and have been involved as a community to the extent of at least $1,000.00, which they have been urged by the Agent several occasions to make some attempt to pay off and retain their good name as a whole. This statement I am making does not exactly confirm the second paragraph of Mr. Caldwell's memorandum.\n\nThe occupations which these Indians follow during the school year and as listed by Mr. Caldwell, are Logging, Trapping, Herring Canning, Oolachan fishing, and working at the Reduction Plant at Butedale. These industries will be considered in order as follows:\n\n1. TRAPPING:- Most of the Kitimat Indians have traplines but, it should be also pointed out, that all the other Bands in this Agency are trapping during the winter months and are becoming more and more in the habit of leaving their women folk and children at home during the trapping season. As a matter of opinion I see no earthly excuse for the women and school children going on the trap lines, and it should be noted that the Ulkatcho Band who are considered one of the most backward tribes in B. C. and whose women folk have been accustomed to taking an active part, managed to arrange to leave their children at home during the school term.\n\n2. LOGGING:- Had I received your letter in time I would have been able to give you a more accurate report on the number of school children affected by the logging operations.\nLast year several of the Indians worked for Lee and Simberg and Frank Hallett. The earnings at Lee and Simberg amounted to approximately $3,600.00 of which $1,164.00 was earned by Lloyd Starr. He is a single man without any children. The earnings at Hallett's camp was around $2,000.00. Possibly 12 school children would be affected by this work and here again it is difficult to see why the women can not remain at home and take care of the children.\n\n3. COLACHAN FISHING\nA.D. Gardiner:\u2014 Colachan fishing is carried on at the mouth of the Kitimat River about three miles from the village and usually lasts about two weeks during April. The gardens are situated at the old village close to the Colachan grounds. None of these occupations in my opinion constitute a valid reason why the children cannot attend school. As you suggest transportation by gas boat can easily be arranged or they can also arrange for their care at home. It might also be suggested that holidays are curtailed at Christmas by one week and at Easter and two weeks taken during this time.\n\n4. BERRING CANNING AND FORK LADY REDUCTION PLANT AT BUTE ISLE:\u2014\nThis is a new occupation at Butedale cannery during the winter months and I would direct your attention to copy of a report on Kitimat matters received from Mr. Caldwell before he left. It will be noted that the earnings from this source last winter were very small and that mostly women were employed. The living quarters for the Indians at Butedale are deplorable (at least during the winter months and the Provincial Health authorities should be asked to investigate.) In the interests of health and morality the Canneries should be asked to employ only women without children during the winter and provide a central bunkhouse for these women with a responsible matron in charge. Should the Indian Department interfere, they will probably inform them that there is plenty of Chinese and Japanese help available.\n\nThe Kitimat Band are in a similar position to the Bella Coola Band, with the exception that the Bella Coola's are not employed at the Cannery during the winter months and are developing a local logging industry.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Kitimat Village is located on its present site. There is no good reason for the present location as there is a very poor harbour and they are also three miles distant from their gardens and a considerable acreage of Agricultural land. This makes it difficult to develop any local industry.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that providing the Kitimat people have a true appreciation of the educational facilities provided for them by the Department, which they should have since a very large proportion are literate and have attended the Bone and Coqualeetza Schools, there should be no difficulty.\n\nAs Mr. Caldwell remarks most of these migrations during the winter months are simply an excuse to have a good time and the economic side is of secondary importance. Frankly I expect the attendance at the new Day School during the 1941-42 School term to be disappointing and I do not expect the Indians to be at all co-operative. That they should be encouraged in this attitude is another matter but personally I believe that nothing will eventually be gained by too much pampering and that the worthwhile Indians will make some sacrifice to ensure their\nchildren's education. Much also depends, of course, on the quality of the teachers and their ability to make village as well as school life interesting. A married couple who are both teachers and have no children, or a married missionary teacher and a woman for the primary grades is preferable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTh. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor J. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nTO: MC\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to the closing of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School on the 30th ultimo I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which was forwarded to the Department by Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nYou will note the Indian Agent's suggestion that a married couple who are both teachers would be extremely suitable for the Kitamaat Indian Day School. You will also recall my letter of April 18 with reference to having one of the teachers qualified to give instruction in elementary domestic science. I realize that under present conditions it may be difficult to follow out the suggestions that have been made in regard to the teaching services but I feel certain that you will make every endeavour to secure fully qualified teachers for this school. Salary at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month will be allowed each teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMay 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to educational facilities at Kitimat, B.C., I would advise that I wrote Mr. Indian Agent Christie on the 30th ultimo as per attached copy and enclose his reply of the 21st instant, in duplicate.\n\nFrom Mr. Christie's report, and also from the Rev. A.M. Caldwell's accompanying letter of February 6, 1941, there would not appear to be any insurmountable difficulty on the part of these Indians in ensuring reasonably regular attendance at the new Day School on the Reserve, nor any reason why the residential School there should be continued, other than their desire to have the Department provide for the care of their children, an obligation which, Mr. Christie indicates in his report, they are well able to assume themselves.\n\nUndoubtedly the school attendance will fall off considerably when the Residential School is closed and it may even become necessary to close the Day School for a term in that event, but I do not consider the Indians will make any serious endeavor to readjust themselves to new conditions unless compelled to do so by the Department taking a firm attitude in the matter.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and with the concurrence of Mr. Inspector Barry, I would recommend that the Residential School be closed at the expiry of the present term and arrangements be made to re-open the new Day School next October.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.H.

After reading the correspondence between yourself and Major Mackay, copies of which you were good enough to send, may I say that I am not interested at all in the procedure followed by the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches in British Columbia, for the simple reason that these churches are not organized in the same way as The United Church of Canada. We are a national church with a national organization. These other churches are organized on a diocesan basis.\n\nI should, however, make clear that, if it is your desire that the nominations for teachers should be sent from this office to Major Mackay rather than to you, we shall be glad to do so; but, so far as we are concerned, nominations are going to be handled from this office. We are not, however, suggesting that, so far as your Department is concerned, the procedure should continue to be what it has been in the past. That is for you to decide.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. MacKay, attached thereto.\n\nI regret to state that I can offer no explanation as to why these letters were written, and the matter becomes still more mysterious, so far as I am concerned, when I review the correspondence relating to the nomination of teachers in British Columbia, particularly a letter dated July 14, 1941, received by me from Major MacKay.\n\nI am sending forward to you two letters relating to this matter. This is the only correspondence I have had with the Commissioner in British Columbia in respect to the nomination of teachers. Both these letters, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nThere is nothing on file here in respect to Mr. Glover. The Inspector's reports on this teacher, however, have not been very satisfactory. I am communicating today with Commissioner MacKay, asking him for full information with respect to this particular case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n239 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to enclose copies of two letters which have come to my desk through the office of the Woman's Missionary Society and which are of some interest. You will note that Major MacKay is asking the Woman's Missionary Society to nominate to him various teachers. The letters were addressed to \"Rev. J. S. Mildrew,\" but I would gather that this is merely an error, as Mr. Mildrew's wife is the President of the Woman's Missionary Society in British Columbia.\n\nWhilst I have the highest regard for Major MacKay and his efficiency, I am writing to ask if your Department has inaugurated a new system of dealing with the appointment of teachers to Indian schools in British Columbia, - and particularly in relation to the Woman's Missionary Society. My understanding of the relations which we have with your Department is that all United Church appointments and nominations come through this office; and, even if you had decided to have nominations in British Columbia made through the Commissioner, my understanding would be that, instead of splitting the matter up into fragments and having the local branch of the Woman's Missionary Society handle their affairs, nominations should still come through the office here. I hope that this can be straightened up satisfactorily. I do not think that Major MacKay should write to Mrs. Mildrew or to any of the local officers. The Woman's Missionary Society is a national body and its offices are in Toronto. If your Department feels that it must correspond with the Woman's Missionary Society in connection with Indian matters, may I say that the name of the Executive Secretary is Mrs. C. M. Lovews, and her office is in this Building.\n\nMay I say that I wrote to Mr. Hunt, suggesting that it would be useful if he would from time to time, let in touch with Major MacKay, so that, if it were thought advisable to change teachers from one school to another, the Commissioner might have the opportunity of making suggestions. We have appreciated the co-operation of Major MacKay in the past, and we rather think that what has occurred is an error for which someone, who is not familiar with the methods laid down to be followed by your Department, is responsible.\nI should be glad to take up with the Woman's Missionary Society the question of nominations for the Kitimat Indian Day School, if it is desired to continue the present arrangement.\n\nWith regard to Major MacKay's letter concerning Mr. Glover: It has been customary for nominations to be made to your Department. This was done last year and Mr. Glover was nominated. I realize, of course, that all appointments are yearly, but it has been the custom of your Department to write us very definitely from time to time concerning teachers whose work was unsatisfactory, saying that you were notifying the teacher in question that his or her services were no longer required and asking either our Board or the Woman's Missionary Society to nominate a successor. So far as I know, Mr. Glover has not been notified by your Department that his services are not satisfactory. Certainly, nothing has come to this office or to that of the Woman's Missionary Society. I know that there has not been the greatest satisfaction concerning Mr. Glover, but that is altogether different from official intimation to Mr. Glover that his services were no longer required by the Department and notice to the Woman's Missionary Society through this Office that a new nomination was asked for. I think, under the circumstances, that Mr. Glover should be continued as teacher for another year, unless, of course, his services are so very unsatisfactory that you cannot continue him. Further, if this is the case, may I say we shall expect compensation for the fact that Mr. Glover was not notified sooner.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\n\nEncs.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.

I am particularly grateful for the enclosed copies of reports from Mr. Christie and Major Mackay. Mr. Christie has evidently gone to a good deal of trouble, and has, in my judgment at least, made out a very good case in justification of the action of the Department in closing the residential school and operating a day school. I think that very little needs to be added on this subject.\n\nI have asked the Woman's Missionary Society to be good enough to take into consideration the appointment of the teachers and to let us have the nominations of properly qualified teachers as soon as possible. I am afraid that it will not be possible to get a married man and his wife, but we are sending in a married missionary and I think that, with two good teachers in the school and a nurse, the work at Kitamiat should show some progress.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay advises that he has received the resignation of Miss Clare Wilson, teacher of the junior room at the Kitimat Indian Day School.

It is quite possible that due to the changed conditions regarding fishing and other causes there may be considerable shifting of the population of the reserves on the coast for the duration of the war. Under these circumstances it would be appreciated if Inspector Barry could give the matter some consideration, with a view to making a definite recommendation to the Department regarding the policy which we should follow at day schools on the coast during the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAt Kitimat very few of the Band were at home with only 21 pupils attending the Day School out of a possible attendance of nearly 30. The teachers, none of whom have taught Indian children before, seem rather dissatisfied although they made no specific complaint. The discipline seemed none too good in the junior room although the children were clean and happy. The Senior room was under good control although only eight pupils were present.\n\nAir Raid Drill has been carried out in addition to Fire Drill. This matter was taken up with the parents who agreed that the children should take to the bush behind the school, the younger children in charge of the older ones. Although there was a small attendance a test was made and all the children were out of sight in the timber within three minutes of the signal.\n\nMiss Faust complains of lack of work, which is rather unusual. She is quite willing to go to Butedale Cannery or Kitasu Reserve however, should the Department consider this to be necessary and a report and recommendation has gone forward to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nSome friction seems apparent between the Missionary or his wife, Mrs. Hartley, and the teachers, one of the sore points being that the teachers have got the piano which belonged to the Residential School.\n\nWM.

Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 9, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Buck:\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Hoey, who is on holidays, I desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant.\n\nIn cases where the monthly payment, if multiplied by 12, would mean a larger yearly sum than $1,200.00, present regulations require that we deduct National Defence Tax at the 7% rate. If the person affected does not actually earn $1,200.00 during any calendar year, such person may apply to the Income Tax Office for refund of overpayment of National Defence Tax.\n\nThe amount paid Miss Gertrude Cass, teacher of the White Bear School, is computed as follows:\n\n| Salary - $90.00 a month | $90.00 |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Cost-of-living bonus, 11% | 9.90 |\n| Deductions:             |       |\n| Retirement - 5% of basic salary of $90. | 4.50 |\n| National Defence Tax - 5% of $99.90 | 5.00 |\n\nNet amount payable - $90.40\n\nI regret that it is not possible, owing to regulations, for the Department to issue Miss Wilson's cheque in your favour. As stated in official letter of June 30, we have written Miss Wilson, advising her that we have forwarded her cheque to you and requesting her to adjust the matter with you. The last address we had for her was General Delivery, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Myrtle M.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA .................. ONTARIO.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you indeed for your prompt response to my communication of the 24th ultimo, and I write again to make further enquiries:\n\n1st - I note that a 7 per cent. National Defence Tax has been charged Miss I. Leith and Miss C. Wilson upon the salary paid from your Department. It is our understanding that this rate applies when the total income of a single person exceeds $1,200.00 per annum. When remuneration is paid at the rate of $105.45 per month for nine months only, would this not be less than $1,200.00 per annum? \n\n2nd - May we ask how the sum of $90.40 paid monthly to Miss Gertrude Cass, teacher, of White Bear Reservation (Moose Mountain) is computed \u2014 this information being requested in order that we may be assured regarding payment of National Defence Tax, etc.\n\n3rd - Thank you for the receipt of cheque for $93.32 in favour of Miss C. Wilson. Would it be possible to waive regulations in this particular instance in having the cheque made payable to the Society \u2014 as you know, Miss Wilson has now left the School at Kitamaat, and we are not aware of her present whereabouts. In these circumstances, it is impossible to do anything with the cheque now in our possession. I hold the cheque until I hear from you.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to these matters,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMyrtle M. Buck\nASSISTANT TREASURER.\n\nB/B.\nOttawa, June 30, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Buck:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the June salary cheque of Miss Clare Wilson, teacher of the junior room at the Kitamaat Indian Day School.\n\nPresent regulations will not permit our drawing this cheque in your favour. However, I enclose Miss Wilson's cheque and have advised her that it is being sent to you and that she should adjust the matter with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

In the circumstances, we would greatly appreciate it if this cheque might be remitted directly to this office and made payable to the Society in view of the fact that Miss Wilson received salary from the Society in October, 1941, in addition to the grant covering salary for that month and which was forwarded to her directly from your Department and she also retained.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of addressing you to ask some information \u2014 perhaps I should address the Treasury Officer, and, if so, I hope you will not mind passing on my requests:\n\n(1) The cheque covering the salary for May of Mrs. H. B. Griffin, nurse, working out from Alberni, B.C., was for an amount of $55.00 only. We have had no advice as to why this grant should not have been for the usual amount of $75.00. May I have an explanation as to the difference.\n\n(2) I should like to know how the amount of $33.32, and which has been the amount of the grant being paid to Misses Clare Wilson and Isabel Leith at Kitamaat Day School, is computed \u2014 what portion is salary, what is added for cost of living bonus, and what sums are deducted for National Defence Tax and superannuation, etc.\n\nAlso, I should like similar information regarding the grant to Rev. J. B. Glover, of Ahousaht, B.C.\n\nWe would like this information to complete our files and if it could be sent fairly promptly it would indeed be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you, believe me\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.B.\nOttawa,\nJune 18, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have a letter from the Indian Agent in which he quotes the following from a letter from Miss Clare Wilson, teacher of the junior room at the Kitimat School:\n\n\"In the October mail I received a cheque for $91.11 from the Women's Missionary Society which I cashed. In November I received a salary cheque from the Comptroller of Finance for $93.32, which I thought was payment of the November salary. A cheque for the same amount has come each month since. A statement sent from Ottawa for the purpose of computing income tax makes it appear that the first cheque received from Ottawa was payment of the October salary. If such is the case I have been paid twice for the month of October. I am not sure that I have interpreted the statement correctly.\"\n\nWe have also received the resignation of Miss Wilson, effective June 30. Under the circumstances I have requested the Treasury Branch not to forward her June cheque until further advised. It appears from her letter that the Women's Missionary Society sent her a cheque for October and that when she received the cheque from the Department she did not return it to them. I think this is your procedure. I should appreciate your advising what action you desire taken under the circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

She should have been here yesterday evening, but has evidently gone to Prince Rupert first, and is calling here on her south bound trip.\n\nOn arrival here found the Field Matron sick in bed, and Miss Vermilyea, has not been teaching since the 31st of the month. She is also sick, and I would say both physically and mentally, and I would say that the sooner she gets out of here the better for all concerned.\n\nShe is broke, has not the price of her fare out of here, and as I have not sufficient funds to pay her fare, I am issuing a Transport Warrant to Vancouver. Will there be any chance to stop her cheque at Vancouver, or at Ottawa, and have the amount of her fare deducted from it?\n\nI am not sure what the fare is, but they tell me that they paid $16.40 from Vancouver here, and I expect that will be the same for the return.\n\nThere are only about 20 pupils attending the school, so it will be just as well that she leaves, as there is not enough work here for two teachers.\n\nMrs Waywell seems to be a very efficient teacher, and has the best control in the class room that I have seen in any of the Indian Schools in this Agency.\n\nHave commenced work on wood shed, ground is all leveled out and a lot of the material all ready cut, and am just waiting to see if the shingles, cement and nails are arriving on the boat. It is now in sight and should be here in about twenty minutes.\n\nIt seems that there will be very few people at the village during the winter, as a large number of them are going to Butedale to work, and naturally they are taking their families with them, so that the attendance here will be very light.\n\nSaw the Manager at Butedale on north bound, but as the regular manager is off on holidays, nothing definite was arrived at, in regards to the possibility of getting a school at Butedale. I promised to get in touch with the head office in Vancouver, but thought that with the shortage of lumber etc., there was only a slight chance of getting anything going this winter. Will however see him on my south bound trip, and he may have something from the head office. Boat whistled for the dock so will have to close.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for Vancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of September 25th, file 162-15-1, advising that a letter had been received from Dr. Dorey nominating Miss Mary Vernilyea for the position of teacher of the junior room at the Kitamaat Indian Day School, I would advise that she called at this office and proceeded to Kitimaat.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Levelton's letter of the 31st ultimo, in which he states that he was at Kitimaat and found that Miss Vernilyea had not been teaching from the 21st of October as she was sick apparently both physically and mentally, and that it was necessary to provide her with a Transportation Warrant to Vancouver as she was without funds, her services evidently being terminated for health reasons. This teacher will have some salary coming to her although I am not certain of the date on which she commenced her duties, and it is suggested that the fare of \u00a318.40 be deducted from same. I have no information as to her address to which the balance could be forwarded but I am writing Mr. Levelton asking if he has any information.\n\nWhen Miss Vernilyea called at this office it was obvious that she was not the type of teacher required for our schools and had she been interviewed before representations were made to the United Church it is not likely that she would have been recommended for the position. There is a possibility that under present conditions we will receive applications from\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\np.t.o.\nteachers who, for some reason or other, are practically unemployable and I would suggest in the interest of our work that all United Church teachers engaged for this Province be interviewed by Rev. Mr. W.P. Bunt who is the Vancouver representative of the United Church Missionary work, or Mrs. Muldrew of Vancouver, who is the representative of the United Church Womens Missionary Society and a certificated teacher of considerable experience, in order to give them an opportunity of passing on their general qualifications. It would also be advantageous to give this office an opportunity of interviewing them at the same time, if at all possible, and by this means avoid considerable outlay on the part of these applicants in proceeding to distant schools only to find that they are unable to cope with the work.\n\nIt will be noted that for the time being the other teacher at Kitamaat, Mrs. Waywell, will be required to teach the present pupilage.\n\nAs most of the Indians are at Butedale, it may become necessary to make some arrangements to provide educational facilities for the children at that cannery if accommodation can be arranged. At present it is difficult to do so as the cannery Manager is absent on sick leave.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

I am today wiring the Postmaster at Kitimat to return the cheque to this office, if the letter is still at Kitimat. If he does so, we can pay the amount for her transportation and send her a cheque for the balance. In the meantime you might let me know her present address and you should also have the Acting Agent send back the account for her transportation.\n\nIt is noted that there are only 20 pupils attending the school and that it is unlikely that there will be any increase due to the fact that the Indians are working off the reserve. It, therefore, appears that it will be unnecessary to appoint a second teacher at the present time. Please let me have your opinion regarding this action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDecember 22, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 162-15-1\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant regarding salary payment to Miss Mary Vermilyea, formerly teaching at Kitimat, I would advise that the account owing to the Union Steamship Company for her transportation from Kitimat to Vancouver has now been paid by her.\n\nMiss Vermilyea called at this office and seemed to be under the impression that she had a further amount of salary due her, but I have insufficient information on file to determine whether she has any claim. As she was in Vancouver on September 14th, it would not appear that she commenced duties for some days subsequent to that date. According to Acting Indian Agent Levelton's letter of October 31st, which was forwarded to you on the 6th ultimo, she did not teach school after October 21st, leaving Kitimat by boat on October 31st. Her questionnaire, on file with the Department, will show on what date she commenced her duties from which, no doubt, the Department can ascertain whether she has any balance payable to her, including superannuation deductions. I am informed that her present address is West 14th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith Transportation Warrant No. P 2796 for $27.60, covering transportation of this case, which has been cancelled.\n\nD.M.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn a recent visit to Kitamaat, I found the Teacher of the Junior room, Kitamaat Indian Day School, sick, and she had not been teaching for some little time.\n\nShe commenced teaching on Monday, Sept. 21st, and taught to Oct. 21st, a total of twenty-two teaching days.\n\nShe had already sent in her resignation to the W.M.S., which was the logical thing to do, as her health would not permit her staying on at Kitamaat, and as there were so few children attending school, owing to the parents having moved to Buteale Cannery for the winter.\n\nThe unfortunate part was that she was financially up against it, and had not the price of her fare back to Vancouver, and as the other white workers there were pretty much in the same condition, I finally had to issue a transportation warrant for her from Kitamaat to Vancouver, on the understanding that this would have to be repaid out of her salary cheque, when received.\n\nI would strongly recommend that in the future, the churches nominating anyone for positions in these outlying schools, should be asked to have nominees have a physical examination before they are sent out, as I can recollect several instances where teachers have had to be sent out after just a few weeks work, and as in this case, a lot of them are not in a position to pay their transportation back again.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nT.A. Levelton\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNovember 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to my letter of the 6th instant with reference to the resignation of Miss M. Vermilyea as teacher of the junior room at Kitamaat Indian Day School and would advise that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Acting Indian Agent Levelton advising that the cost of the warrant given Miss Vermilyea to enable her to reach Vancouver amounted to $24.00, plus $3.60 Tax, making a total of $27.60. If a cheque is being issued to Miss Vermilyea, I would recommend that this amount be deducted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1943.\n\nDear Mrs. Waywell:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 24, in which you seek information with respect to employees of the Government who have joined or may join the Armed Forces of Canada.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to explain the laws and regulations governing this matter. However, I shall make an attempt. If the information in this letter is not satisfactory, I want you to feel free to communicate with me again.\n\nPermanent Civil Servants, who are classified as such and who join the Armed Forces, are given leave of absence without pay and certain considerations in respect to superannuation payments. They are given full assurance that their positions will be restored to them immediately following their discharge from the Army. Temporary Civil Servants, who were appointed to permanent positions but whose length of service prior to the outbreak of the war did not enable them to attain the full status of permanent Civil Servants, are also given an assurance that either the position they occupied at the time of enlistment or an equivalent position will be given them at the time of their discharge.\n\nIn addition to this all men who have served in the Armed Forces overseas or, as it is usually interpreted, in an actual theatre of war, are given a preference when applying for positions in the Civil Service. Returned soldiers have enjoyed this statutory preference since the close of the last war.\n\nMrs. Mabel K.

This teacher has previously been paid salary for the month of October but information has now been received to the effect that, acting on the instructions of the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, the school was re-opened on September 22, 1942. Consequently there is a balance of salary due Miss Vermilyea for the period September 22 to 30, both dates inclusive. It would be appreciated if you would issue cheques for the amount due her and it should be forwarded to Miss Mary Vermilyea, Chilliwack High School, Chilliwack, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 29, 1942 - file 162-15-1 - regarding payment of salary to Miss Mary Vernilyea, B.A., for the period she was teaching at Kitimat Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Acting Agent Levelton's letter of the 18th ultimo advising that she commenced her duties on September 22, 1942, consequently the Department may consider payment to her for the period September 22nd to 30th inclusive, in addition to the amount already paid her for October.

I note that she has paid the Union Steamship Company for her transportation from Kitimat to Vancouver and I, therefore, presume that she has received her salary cheque for the month of October. You will remember that we wrote to you about this matter on the 11th instant.\n\nOn the original questionnaire form received from Miss Vermilyea she stated, in answer to the question \"Date on which Duties Commenced\", \"September 15 (per Mrs. Muldrew)\". We could not understand why she made such a statement and consequently only paid her for the month of October. The letter from the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions nominating Miss Vermilyea was dated September 23 and in our reply, as well as in our letter to you of September 28, it was definitely stated that her duties would commence on October 1. We also had before us the information contained in the Acting Indian Agent's letter of October 31 and, taking everything into consideration, we felt that she was being fairly treated in paying her one month's salary.\n\nThere is, of course, a refund coming to her of $4.75 being the amount deducted from her October salary and placed in the retirement fund. I am applying to the Treasury Branch to have this amount returned to her.\n\nR.A.

Light plant was not working satisfactorily, but think it was due to a faulty spark plug, as it would run but irregularly missing quite often. Sent in two new spark plugs from Bella Bella on my return trip. The field matron told me she would be leaving in March, but did not say whether she would stay the month out or not.\n\nThere seemed to be some friction between the Missionary, and his wife on the one side and the Teacher and the Field Matron on the other, but as I understand the Missionary and his wife are leaving in the summer, it is to be hoped that the Teacher will decide to stay for another term.\n\nT.A.

The building has its own heating plant, and is electrically lit. The inspector was very much pleased with the prospect, and it is hoped that the Canadian Fishing Co. will proceed with the conversion.\n\nT.M. Levelton,\nActing Indian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1943.\n\nWe left Kitamaat at about 4.15 and arrived back at Buteadale at 11.40 P.M.\n\nSaw some of the Indian people there on various matters, and also conferred with the Manager, re the proposed school, which should be built this summer so that it can be ready for use next term.\n\nAs I understand it the Canadian Fishing Co., are willing to buy the material provided the Department can get the priority for the purchase of the lumber, and the Indians have agreed to do the work gratis. There is a change of Managers at this Cannery this spring, and it is to be hoped that the new appointee will see fit to carry on with the work which the present manager has started.\n\nT.A. Levelton,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of July 9, with reference to securing teachers for the Kitimat Day School. As you know, we require two teachers for this school, if they can be secured. I realize the difficulties that you have experienced in obtaining teachers this year, but I would appreciate your communicating again with your British Columbia representative, as it might be possible to secure teachers to re-open the school about January 1.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Evans as teacher of the Kitamaat Indian Day School and in particular to the proposed termination of Mr. Gordon Robinson's services, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of February 6th which is self-explanatory.\n\nI concur in the Agent's recommendation that Mr. Robinson's services be retained until the end of March pending receipt of a further report from Mr. Anfield. Although the monthly report referred to by Mr. Anfield indicates that Mr. Robinson is taking a genuine interest in his work, it is not considered that his period of employment has been of sufficient duration to make any further recommendation as yet.\n\nI may say that the question of the opening of an Indian Day School at Butedale is at present under discussion and if arrangements in this respect are completed and approved it is possible that Mr. Robinson's services might be useful there.\n\nD.

An interview was had with Archbishop Duke of the Vancouver Archdiocese (R.C.) relative to securing a teacher for the Ulkatcho Seasonal school. Following interviews with Rev. W.P. Hunt (U.C.) a nomination was presented to the Department, and accepted for the appointment of Gordon Robinson, a Kitamaat Indian with Grade XII standing, as pro tem teacher at the Kitamaat Indian Day School. Following discussion with Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner, it was decided to try and secure accommodation at Bella Coola to open a second classroom at that point, where overcrowding has compelled the use of a platoon system of attendance.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH SEPTEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nClassrooms at Bella Bella, 2 divisions; and Klemtu opened on September 5th with fair attendances. These schools were inspected during the month and reports rendered to the Dept. and Commissioner. An appointment at Bella Coola was made late in September, and the new teacher, Miss Laura Fleming reported on Sept. 26th, and started duty in October. No appointments were made to the school at Kitamaat, and as a large number of these people plan to spend the winter at Butezale, on the herring operations, it is doubtful if the school could support a teacher at Kitamaat.

The information we have available at the present time indicates that a number of the Indians have left the reserve and as a result the number of children has been reduced. Consequently it is possible that one teacher could handle the school for the academic year 1944-45. It would be appreciated if you would make another attempt to secure a qualified teacher for this school. Salary is provided at the rate of $95 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nThe day schools operating in the Agency are now closed for the summer vacation. Detailed reports on the progress and teaching standards have been submitted to Commissioner MacKay. From reports received to date, there are no teachers in sight for either of the two rooms at Kitamaat or for the seasonal school at Ulkatcho. In connection with the latter, this building and the teachers quarters should be insulated before a new teacher is appointed. The buildings are not well enough constructed to withstand the 30 to 40 below zero weather prevalent at Ulkatcho in winter time.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH APRIL, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nNo schools were inspected during the month as arrival times at Klemtu and Bella Bella were inconvenient or on Saturdays; there is a possibility that Bella Coola Day School may re-open shortly, as the United Church have nominated a teacher for the remaining two months of the academic year; Mrs. Anfield has consented to provide board and room for this girl who is expected May 4th. A report has been sent to the Indian Commissioner for B.C. recommending that Kitamaat, if re-opened, be confined to a one-room school, and the dispensary be moved to the Day School basement, and the nurse quartered in the teacherage. Inspector Thorstenstein expects to visit the Bella Bella and Klemtu schools, also Bella Coola if opened, in the latter part of May.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nTwo inspections of the Bella Bella Day School have been made in the month, and one at Klemtu. Improvement was noted. It is to be hoped that the nominating body will be impressed with the importance of securing teachers for the Kitamaat and Bella Coola schools, both of which have been closed during the present school year.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nDay schools at Bella Coola, Klemtu, Bella Bella (2 division) and the empty schoolhouse at Kitamaat were all carefully inspected. Attendance is not satisfactory at all; Klemtu and Bella Coola have most unsuitable persons as teachers; and the closing of the latter school has been recommended. I am afraid that the School at Bella Bella will suffer a serious attendance lapse. War services take men and women in a wholesale manner from the villages winter as well as summer, and if the war goes on much longer, the entire social economy of these Indians will require serious review. In the old days there were at least six months in which the parents would be home; today in some villages, they are home for two weeks at Xmas or for a wedding or funeral; and children by the score are not attending school at all. It is very moot point in my opinion, as to whether home life in Indian villages will ever return to its former status, and I foresee the possibility of \"ghost Villages\" not long hence. Just where Councils will fit in to the picture of the future is a baffling problem, and future objectives along these lines will need careful study.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nSchools; Day.\n\nAll schools in operation were visited and inspected. It is a shame that no teachers are available for Kitamaat and Bella Coola. Attendance at Bella Bella is fairly good, but I am afraid that after the new year, it will take a slump as many of these people are due to go to Namu Cannery for work. The school at Bella Coola is overcrowded. Repairs have been done at Klemtu and the building at least looks clean inside. It will last until better days come and a proper unit can be put up, with teachers quarters attached. It is suggested that at Kitamaat a local Indian with Grade XI standing be appointed interim teacher, to get one room going at least. He seems a fine kind of young man, and he could not be any worse than some white interim or temporary appointments at present in action.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON BELLA COOLA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nKitammat Day School. So far as it known, no teachers or field Matron are yet in residence in this village. Many of the people are home, for the first winter in several years.

We are advised that the people out in British Columbia think there is need of the appointment of one. If provision has been made, I am asked to nominate Miss Elizabeth Evans, a daughter of Mrs. Evans who is now teaching there. Miss Evans is a graduate in Arts of the University of British Columbia, and would, I think, make a good teacher, although she has had no experience.\n\nI do not know whether Mr. Bunt has been able to discuss this with Commissioner MacKay or not, but, at any rate, I am writing to clear on it from one angle. You might let us know if there is a possibility of this appointment. It would date from the 15th October.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is therefore recommended that Miss Evans' services terminate at that date.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclos.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School, Miss E. Evans, second teacher\n\nThe appointment of Miss Elizabeth Evans as teacher of the senior room expires at the end of March according to her statement to me at Kitamaat this patrol. I was under the impression that the appointment terminated April 15th but have not the file along and cannot be sure.\n\nIn view of present attendance in these two rooms and the indication for continued attendance, it is recommended that Miss Evans's appointment continue to April 30th and that the school be reduced to one room status for the following months of May and June. Mrs. Evans, the permanent teacher has been advised to put the school on a platoon basis in May if more than thirty-five pupils attend. By June the exodus to Butedale will be accomplished and the one teacher could handle the room on an all day attendance basis for that month.\n\nIn view of the short time involved, I have informed Miss Evans that unless she is notified by wire to the contrary she can consider her appointment extended to April 30th. She has done and is doing satisfactory work for an untrained teacher.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C., March 30th, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to yours of March 26th, file 8-11-2 dealing with the Kitimat Bay School teaching staff, it is recommended that this be reduced to one teacher only as from May 1st next and that Miss M. Evans' appointment terminate as at April 30th, 1946.\n\nShe will be asked to apply in writing for a refund of retirement allowance deducted from her salary cheques.\n\nThis lady has done very good work and the termination of her appointment is in no way a reflection on her efforts. The school pupilage will be May 1st be reduced to a number incompatible with a staff of two teachers. Should however, there be an influx around May 15th for a week or so, Miss Evans, the remaining teacher can teach on a platoon system.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has not been possible to secure a second teacher for Bella Coola. A new school has been established at Upper Dean River at Anahim Lake, but so far no appointment has been made. A second teacher was secured for the Kitamaat school. Attendance on the whole has improved but education in the broader sense of the word is the real weak link in the Indian programme. Right now in B.C., there is no inspector of Indian Schools, qualifications for teaching and calibre of appointments made is generally very low and most schools are seriously overcrowded. These conditions are not conducive of a good response by the pupils and a complete overhauling of the entire educational policy of the Department appears more and more urgent as time goes on. There is a great deal of criticism by the parents of the operation of the Residential Schools and some of this is undoubtedly based on real grievances, caused by unsuitable staffing of the schools in question.\n\nF. Earl Ashfield,\nIndian Agent.\nQuarterly Report Ending September 30th, 1945, of Bella Coola Agency\n\nEducation:\n\nDay Schools have re-opened at Bella Bella, 2 divisions; Klemtu, 1 division, and Kitamaat, 1 division. No teacher is yet in residence at Bella Coola, but advice has been received of the appointment of Miss Anne Wright to this post. There is a need of a second teacher at Bella Coola where some 70 children of school age are now at home. At this village, the Agent is negotiating for the rental of a nice little cottage as a teachers' residence.\n\nAttendance at the Day Schools opened to date has been very good, reflecting in some measure the value of the Family Allowance payments. A few children from the Agency were admitted to the Residential School at Alert Bay, none to Alberni.\n\nF.

She agreed to prepare material for Mr. Shaw to use and to give him detailed instructions to follow. I have interviewed Mr. Shaw and believe that he could handle the class for a period of six or seven weeks under these conditions.

It is noted that he began duties on March 13th.\n\nBernard F.

His appointment is effective from March 18th, 1947, and his name should continue on the pay list until you are further advised by this office.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire. As Mr. Shaw is an Indian teaching on his home reserve, he is, therefore, not liable for income tax.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nPP/MGD\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe - Kitamaat School\n\nI am in receipt of a telegram from Mr. Indian Agent Pruden which, although not entirely clear, indicates that Mr. Gordon Robinson, teacher of the Senior Room, did not open the school on September 2nd for the reason that there were only eleven pupils available in the village. Mr. Pruden indicates that Miss Opal Smith, teacher of the Junior Room, did not report for duty until September 20th, but his telegram in this regard is also somewhat ambiguous.\n\nIt is presumed that Mr. Robinson's salary cheque will already have been mailed to him, and possibly Miss Smith's also, but in any case adjustments can be made in October salary cheques.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, October 1st, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd of September in which you advise that Gordon Robinson did not open the Kitamaat School on the first of September. Previous to the receipt of your letter we had already forwarded to him a cheque for September.\n\nAs soon as you have the information we will be glad to know if Robinson has given up duties permanently or if he intends to return and if so, on what date. If he returns we can adjust the over-payment for September.\n\nWe have not yet issued any cheque to Miss Mary Opal Smith as we were awaiting staff questionnaire requested in our letter of September 11th.\n\nIf Mr. Robinson returns, we understand that he resides in the missionary's residence. There is accommodation for two teachers in the living quarters attached to the Kitamaat School and the Welfare and Health Services would like to have the nurse reside with the teacher. We have no objection to this arrangement and we would appreciate it if you would notify all persons concerned accordingly.\n\nBernard F.

Daugton\nfor, W. F. Padden,\nIndian Agent.\nDuring the past year our nurse at Kitamaat has used part of the basement under the day school for a dispensary and has been living with the school teacher at that point. We have been advised that you were considering a second teacher at this point. If so it would likely be necessary to enlarge the living quarters if the nurse is to be accommodated. If this is done we would like to provide a dispensary also as use of the basement of the school has not been satisfactory either to the school teacher or the nurse.\n\nWould you kindly let me know what you are planning at this point?\n\nP.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nThe above school was opened on September 26th. There were only five pupils in the village and Mrs. Morrison, who arrived in Kitamaat on Saturday September 16th, opened the school for these pupils.\n\nMr. Robinson had been waiting in Kitamaat from September 10th for the people to arrive home. He had been busy doing small repairs around the school house and his own home. As there still remained some work of that type to be done when I visited Kitamaat on September 26th I advised Mr. Robinson to continue this work for a few days until a reasonable number of pupils arrived in the village to open the second room.\n\nI recommend that Mrs. J. M. Morrison be paid commencing September 26th and that Mr. G. W. Robinson be paid commencing September 10th. As cheque for the latter has probably already gone forward, adjustment of the three days missing from September 7th when school should have opened will be expected on a later cheque. I have advised Mr. Robinson accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. W. Pruden,\nSupt. Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nI am forwarding herewith Supt. Pruden's letter of October 8th wherein he advises that the above mentioned school was opened on September 20th, and that Mrs. Morrison commenced her duties on that date. Mr. Gordon Robinson, however, has been at Kitamaat since September 10th, and while waiting for the pupils to return home, did repair work around the school building.\n\nI concur in Supt. Pruden's recommendation that Mrs. J. M. Morrison be paid commencing September 20th and that Mr. G. W. Robinson be paid from September 10th. If Mr. Robinson's September cheque has already gone forward an adjustment can be made on a later cheque.\n\nW. S.

Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, fixed the salaries to be paid to the teachers in the Methodist Indian Day Schools, and among other schools in that denomination it was arranged that a salary of $600.00 per year be paid for the teacher at the Indian school at Kitimat. This increase was to date from July 1, 1914, but, through an oversight, the salary for this school has been sent you for each quarter from that date, at the former rate, $400.00 per year.\n\nThere is therefore, a balance due for the September, December and March quarters last, and a cheque for $75.00, in payment of this balance of salary to March 31st, last, will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nT.

Gr. Salary, Kitamaat School\".\n\nIn the past we have received cheques for $150.00 quarterly, for the salary of school teacher at Kitamaat, and I am wondering if some change has been made, or what reason there is for the change?\n\nSo far as I know no notification of change in this grant has been received by any officer of our Board.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMary A. Powell,\nTreasurer, Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nP.S. I am holding the cheque until I hear from you.\nOttawa, November 24, 1923\n\nEnclosure.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the cheque forwarded you in payment of the salary of the teacher of the Kitamat Indian Day School for the September quarter.\n\nThe Department has recently decided to pay the salaries of Indian day school teachers on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year.

You were advised of Mr. Robinson's appointment in official letter of November 23, 1944.\n\nMrs. Evans has had teaching experience in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario. She also served on the staff of the Coqualeetza Residential School. We are informed that if, later on, Mrs. Evans finds that she can handle the whole school, you are of the opinion that Mr. Robinson's services might be discontinued. If this is your recommendation, we will expect to hear from you whenever you consider such action timely. We are further advised that Mrs. Evans is the wife of Mr. A.H.J.

I note that it is your wish to have Mrs. Evans considered as principal of this school, and our officials will be informed accordingly.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Robinson's appointment, we were not aware that you intended appointing a second teacher. Consequently, we informed our officials that he would be allowed salary of $100.00 a month. No doubt, they have already advised him, and under the circumstances I feel that we should let his salary stand at that rate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n239 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nOttawa, October 19, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY,\n\nRes.

I do not think it would be very expensive.\n\nHoping that this and the enclosed list of requirements will meet with your approval\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Mrs) Amy Glaspell\n\nKilatnaat\n\nB.C.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor Indian School on Kalamata\n\nReserve in Bella Coola Agency.\n\nDate Dec 16 1927\n\n| ARTICLES                        | No. on Hand | Date of last Receipt | No. Required | No. Authorized | REMARKS                                      |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 5 gal mixed Sherwin             |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| 2 gal mixed S.W.                |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| 3 pts mixed S.W.               |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Window panes 18 inches by 36in  |             |                      |              |                | 4 panes                                      |\n| Putty                          |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Clothes hooks                  |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Morticed lock for outside door |             |                      |              |                | 1 lock                                       |\n| Can opaline varnish            |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Sand paper                     |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Imperial lin oil spray         |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Paint brushes                  |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Paint brush                    |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n| Black enamel                   |             |                      |              |                |                                              |\n\nAddress to which above supplies are to be sent:\n\nName: Mrs Amy Glaspeil\nSchool: Kalamata\nPost Office (nearest): Kalamata\nExpress Office (nearest): Bella Coola\nProvince: BC\n\nNumber of Pupils on Roll:\n- do in 1st Standard\n- do in 2nd\n- do in 3rd\n- do in 4th\n- do in 5th\n- do in 6th\n\nNote: To avoid delay and inconvenience in filling Requisitions, the teacher should give full particulars regarding each article required.

In reply I beg to say that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the supply of classroom material considered necessary.\n\nRelative to the single desks asked for, it is noted that some of the desks at present in use in the school are in a dilapidated condition and that the teacher asks that 12 desks of various sizes and 2 rear seats be supplied. Full particulars should be forwarded regarding the type of desk at present in use at this school. It should also be stated whether they are double or single desks and the name of the manufacturer should, if possible, be given, as it will be necessary in ordering new desks that they be of the same type in order to have uniformity in the seating arrangement. Full shipping directions should also be given. When we have full particulars as requested, consideration will then be given to placing the order for the supplying of the desks from here or authorizing you to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was also too small to heat the room properly during cold weather, and the children had not been comfortable.\n\nI examined the stove, and decided that a new one was needed immediately.

I know that the Indians ought to be willing to help with such work, free of charge, but we cannot depend on that. I should like to get permission to pay for the work, if it cannot be done free. The work will likely be done during the next fiscal year.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nInformation regarding seating of Kitamaat Indian School.\n\nKitamaat, B.C.\n\nThere are at present in this school 26 double desks, which resemble in appearance the enclosed cut of Endurance rigid double desks. They are in sizes 3, 4 and 5. There are no redwood seats.\n\nThe name of the manufacturer is Canadian & School Furniture Co., Preston, Ont.\n\nEndurance Rigid Double Desks\n\nBuilt for two pupils but seats are not separate.\n\nThere are also 1 single desk and 1 single rear seat size 5.\n\nAges of pupils are from 6 to 17.\n\nIt will be seen that there are at present desks large enough to accommodate the larger boys and girls at present in attendance.\n\nThese are placed in four rows having larger seats at the back and making an uncomfortable combination where a small desk is placed before a larger seat.\n\nSeveral of these desks are badly delapidated.\n\nThere is a very wide aisle down centre of room.\nProposed arrangement is to have five rows of desks, one row comprising each of the following kinds:\n\nSize 1 single; size 3 double; size 4 double; size 5 double; size 5 single.\n\nThis would best utilize seats at present in the school, and allow the discarding of broken ones. Appearance of uniformity would not be spoiled by this combination of single and double desks, and some of the pupils would have the advantage of single seating.\n\nNew seats required\n\nsize 1. 7 single desks. 1 single rear seat.\n\nFor this row of senior pupils I would like Endurance Rigid lifting top desk (much superior to normal lifting type) for senior pupils.\n\nSee cut.\n\nEndurance Rigid Lifting Top Desks\nMade in single desks only, sizes 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Brynildsen Sons Ltd., Bella Coola, B.C., for Material for day school at Kitimat, B.C.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. I62-15-4 dated October 29th, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, January 27, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to acquaint you with the situation at the Kitamaat Indian Residential School and at the Day School there. There is a small boarding school, conducted by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church. As the pupils of this boarding school receive their classroom instruction along with day scholars from the Indian village at the day school, the classroom has become very crowded. There are 52 enrolled at the present time and there will shortly be an additional four. I believe that the privilege granted to the pupils of the boarding school will have to be discontinued, and I have to request that the boarding school management provide a classroom and teacher in residence. The usual residential school per capita grant is paid at Kitamaat, and this should include all teaching services. Will you please, therefore, ask the W. M. S. to arrange, at their earliest convenience, for a separate classroom for the boarding school pupils and for a separate teacher. This will leave the day school building for the day pupils and the Department will continue meeting the expense of this separate activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, January 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to a communication which you received from the teacher of the Kitimat Indian Day School, in which she states the seating capacity of the classroom is taxed to its utmost. In this connection I have to say that the Department is talking up with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices the residential school at this point is conducted, the question of their arranging to provide classroom accommodation and a teacher for the pupils of the residential school, separate from the present day school. If this is done, there would, no doubt, be ample accommodation at the day school for the pupils who would attend as day scholars. When the Department is informed as to the arrangements the church authorities can provide for classroom accommodation for the pupils of the residential school, you will be advised.\n\nWith reference to the installing of a new floor in the day school building, for which you submitted a detailed estimate of the materials and labour in your letter dated April 17th, 1930, I have to say that, no doubt, funds will be available for this improvement next spring. I would request that you again draw the matter to the attention of the Department at that time. It would be advisable that you give a new estimate, stating in detail the costs of the material, labour, etc. If the work is authorized, it could be carried out during the summer holiday period. It is further noted that a shed is required, in which to store the fuel. You might, at the same time, give particulars as to the size and type of shed you would recommend be erected and the cost of the material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI. Fougnier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Kitamaat Indian Day School, states that the schoolroom needs a new floor. He does not consider an expensive hardwood floor is required, but states that a floor of edge grain fir would be suitable or even one of ordinary flooring. He further states that there are no toilets, and he recommends that two new toilets be provided previous to the opening of the school for next year. A small woodshed is also required. There is no water in the school and, at very little cost, the pipe that passes the school could be tapped and a pipe run the necessary 20' or so to the school.\n\nOur funds this year are extremely limited and only the absolutely necessary repairs can be authorized at any of our schools. I would, however, request that you furnish a report regarding the above mentioned work. You should state the amount of the above work you consider to be absolutely necessary this year and give, in detail, the work required and the approximate cost of same. When we have full information as to the cost involved in the reflooring of the schoolroom, erection of toilets and woodshed, and extension of the water pipe to the school, consideration will then be given as to what portion of the work, if any, can be authorized this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nThe 20 double desks should be replaced as soon as possible by 40 single desks. There would, however, be no room for the single desks till such time as a second school-room is provided.\n\nThe schoolroom needs a new floor. I understand that a hard wood floor has been asked for. I do not consider that the school needs an expensive hard wood floor. One of edge grain fir would be quite suitable or even one of ordinary flooring.\n\nThere are no toilets. I would recommend that two toilets be provided previous to the opening of school for the next year. A small woodshed is also required. There is no water in the school. At very little cost, the pipe that passes the school could be tapped and a pipe run the necessary 20 feet or so to the school.\n\nIt is reported that the rain gets into the school porch. I can find no defect in the roof, and believe that the rain sometimes blows into the bell tower, and so finds its way into the porch.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 27th, No. 162-14-1 (second paragraph) I beg to say that a new floor in the Kitimat day school is absolutely required, as requested by the teacher. A detailed estimate of cost is enclosed herewith. A maple floor is asked for, costing \u00a3210.00. It is however thought that a floor of oiled grain fir would do just as well; and the cost of this would be \u00a3185.00 and this is recommended.\n\nThen we have the matter of a coal bin, and two closets. As the building is on a hill close to a creek where Indians take water we cannot well have outside closets as with other day schools. As will be seen by enclosed sketch the teacher asks for an addition 18' x 10' at the back of the building, a lean-to containing a coal bin, and two water closets, which pipe goes past the day school down to the field Matron's residence from the residential school, and, even with a stove in this room, do not think that water closets could be kept from freezing in winter time; and for this reason, aside from the cost, cannot be recommended. Instead two chemical closets might be bought, and installed for \u00a318.00 each.\n\nA detailed estimate of material needed with cost of erecting the addition, total cost, \u00a3433.96 is enclosed herewith. It is prepared by Chas. E. Moore, an experienced, and reliable carpenter.\n\nWhen replying to this letter kindly return estimates etc., enclosed, as I have no copy at this office. Captain Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools together with myself visited Kitimat last April, after these estimates had been sent. Kitimat has irregular, monthly mail service.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant - which has crossed our communication to you of the 23rd instant in the mail - regarding the providing of a new floor for the Kitamaat Indian Day School, the erection of toilets and a coal bin and the building of an addition to the school and enclosing a detailed estimate, with cost of materials, of having the above work carried out.\n\nRegarding the erection of the addition, I would point out that the Department has taken up with the authorities of the United Church of Canada the question of providing classroom accommodation for the children who attend the residential school. If this accommodation is provided, it would not be necessary to increase the classroom space for the pupils of the day school. In any event, we will have no funds this year to erect an addition.\n\nWith reference to the flooring of the classroom in the day school, it is considered that it would be satisfactory if edge grain fir was used. As you were informed in official letter of the 23rd instant, the Inspector of Schools stated that this material would be satisfactory. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the material and the labour in installing same to be $125.80. If you consider this work to be absolutely necessary this summer, you may arrange to have the new flooring installed. You should purchase the flooring as cheaply as possible, arrange for the labour and see that a satisfactory job is carried out.\n\nConcerning the erection of a lean-to addition,\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\n\n16 x 10 feet.\n18 x 10 feet, at the back of the building, to contain coal bin and two closets, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work carried out - you to purchase the material required and arrange for the labour. If you consider that it would be better to install chemical closets in the toilets, rather than using water for flushing purposes, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of two chemical closets at a cost not exceeding $18 each.\n\nOur funds this year are extremely limited, and the Department will rely on you to see that the cost of all the above work is kept to the lowest possible point, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all materials and for the labour. This work could be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\n\nI am returning herewith, as requested, the estimates of the materials and labour which you submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hence we can have no outside closets here; and chemical closets have been placed in an addition to the school building, to be used here, toilet paper and chemical powder are requested. I presume the teacher wanted a thermometer in this additional room to test the temperature, as it is not well that these closets freeze.\n\nYour letter was dated February 24th, 1933.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6397, File 820-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to inclose herewith Acquisition for School Material for the day school at Kitimat.\n\nWhen at Kitimat this month I noticed that the terra cotta chimney was badly cracked and dangerous. I gave authority to have this removed temporarily. A new brick chimney ought to be built in this school.\n\nIf this office is requested to buy some of the material kindly furnish description as on Acquisition, as I have no copy. Kitimat has steamship service from Vancouver once a month.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. Houger,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 10th instant, No. 162-15-5 I beg to say that I have now heard from Kitimat to the effect that Mr. C. Moore can build the chimney for the school. I also learn that the chimney has to rest on a cement foundation, etc. Thus I am afraid that the work will cost more than $50.00, and shall be glad if $75.00 be allowed.\n\nI have ordered 143 ft. b.m. lumber, 2 sacks cement, 1 bbl. lime, and 375 red bricks to be sent to Kitimat for the above named work.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nInd. Ag't\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, July 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of building a brick chimney at the Kitamaat Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately $50 in the purchase of the brick and other material and for the labour in erecting the chimney. You should purchase the materials and make the best arrangements you can for the labour in having the work satisfactorily carried out. All costs should be kept within your estimate.\n\nAfter this chimney has been erected to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for the labour. It should be definitely stated the number of days or hours employed in the work and the rate paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Hackenshmidt,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

There is no brick-layer at Kitimat. But here is a handy man, Mr. J. Moore, who has done similar work, principally carpenter work for the residential school. Most likely he will be able to do the work.\n\nKitimat has monthly mail service from Vancouver.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, June 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing a requisition for school material from the teacher of the Kitamaat Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following: 1 pail, 1 looking glass (inexpensive), 6 yards towelling, 2 brooms, 2 cans floor oil, 1 large coal shovel, 1 grate for McClary's stove, \"Auto\", No. 380, and 2 dozen coat hooks. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department is not prepared at the present time to supply the extra desks asked for by the teacher.\n\nRegarding the condition of the chimney, it is noted that you have authorized temporary repairs. I would request that you give an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in the erection of a brick chimney and state how you would recommend having the work carried out in the erection of same. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nI.

For your information I may say that it has been decided to communicate with the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada with a view to arranging for the closing of the Kitamaat Indian Residential School. I am inclined to feel that the United Church will approve this action, but it may not be possible to have the school formally closed until the end of June, 1941.\n\nIn the second paragraph of your letter you state that you have discussed the situation at Kitamaat with Inspector Barry, who now states there is no need for a new school at this point.\n\nMr. Barry's opinion at the present time is totally opposite to that expressed in his report to you of July 6, 1939, in which he wrote as follows:-\n\n\"The erection of a new Indian day school with a teacher's residence at Kitamaat - in the Bella Coola Agency - The present Indian day school there is the property of the United Church of Canada and is crowded with the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School so that the village children do not get the attention they certainly deserve. The present school should be used exclusively for the children from the Kitamaat Indian Residential School, of which it forms almost a part by being located on the same property -\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nproperty. The children suggested to be returned to Kitamaat from Coqualeetza make the provision of a village school at Kitamaat very necessary\".\n\nIndian Agent Christie, in forwarding his report for the month of March, wrote regarding the day schools in his agency as follows:\n\n\"Most of these schools are filled to capacity now and the Kitamaat Day School is overcrowded with 90 pupils on the register\".\n\nThe amount of $8,500 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of this school. Due to the present unsettled conditions, it is doubtful if funds can be obtained next year, if we do not build the school this year.\n\nI would therefore appreciate it if you would review the whole matter and let me have your recommendation at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith for the information of the Department a copy of a petition passed by the Kitimat Indians regarding the continuation of the Residential School at that point. No doubt the petition has already been forwarded to the United Church of Canada for consideration by the Committee of the Church administering this school.\n\nThe question of the proposed new Day School at Kitimat has been further discussed with Inspector Barry, who has informed me that there is no need for a new school this year at that point, so that if the Department requires funds, as your letter of June 12th, file 159-36-5, would indicate, the amount set aside for Kitimat could be made available for other purposes. Inspector Barry also agrees that no construction should be undertaken at Kitimat until the question of the continuation of the Residential School there has been disposed of.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJune 12th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my recent trip to Kitimat accompanied by Capt. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, a meeting was held with the Kitimat Council. Copy of the minutes is enclosed, and also a petition signed by various members of the Band. The petition requests the retention of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home at Kitimat, and states that information regarding the discontinuation of the Home was obtained from a responsible officer of the Indian Department. I could not find out the name of this officer, but I am convinced that the information was supplied by the missionary, Mr. McConnell who may possibly have heard the question discussed at the Conference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nMeeting of the Kitimat Council held on June 4th, 1940 to discuss the school situation and particularly the future disposition of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home.\n\nThe Indian agent opened the meeting at 10 A.M. The Chief and all the members of the Council were present, except Joe Gray, the Secretary.\n\nRichard Morrison, Tim Starr, Mike Shaw, James Clarkson, Ed Wesley and Don Grant present.\n\nTim Starr presented a petition from the Kitimat people asking for the continuance of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home, pointing out the nomadic habits of these people and their mode of obtaining a livelihood, necessitating them to go long distances on their trap-lines; on logging operations and oolachan fishing.\n\nThe Agent pointed out that similar difficulties are prevalent in all the villages, and that in Bella Coola, very few of the women now accompany their men folks on trap-lines, etc.\n\nTim Starr moved and Mike Shaw seconded \"That the Agent write the Department of Indian Affairs requesting their favourable consideration to the retention of the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home.\" Carried unanimously.\n\nThe question of a site for the proposed new Indian Day School was discussed and it was moved by Richard Morrison and seconded by Donald Grant:\n\n\"That the Kitimat Indian Band agree to surrender one acre of land situated on and adjacent to the site of the old Kitimat Royal Temperance Society between David Grant's residence and Red Wood's residence, to the Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources for school purposes.\" Carried Unanimously.\n\nDue to the urgency of this matter, the Council agreed to take the resolution in the form of a petition around the village for signatures by authorized voters.\n\nThe question of Indian labour on the proposed new school building was discussed and it was agreed that providing the Sockeye season is not profitable, the Indians are prepared to go to work in July, but if there is a fair price for Sockeye, they do not wish to commence working until August 1st.\n\nIt was also suggested that the work is distributed so that in the event of a poor fishing season, as many people as possible will benefit from this work.\nSome discussion took place regarding the distribution of potatoes, since the Agent had addressed four sacks direct to Herbert McKillan in addition to one sack which he had received in the Band distribution. It was pointed out by the Agent that since Herbert had over half an acre of ground ready for planting and wished to concentrate more of his activities on farming, since seed has had to be supplied to the Band for a number of years, it was desirable that this seed be produced by the Indians themselves, or at least by some member of the Band, so that seed will not be required from outside sources in future.\n\nIt is also desirable that encouragement is given to Agricultural pursuits, as the fishing industry is becoming overcrowded, and has not in late years been very profitable.\n\nMoved by Don Grant and seconded by Tim Starr, that the meeting adjourn. Carried.\n\nTm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nFor Sec. of Indian Council.\nThe people of Kitimat have heard with concern from a responsible officer of the Indian Department that there is some likelihood that the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home will be closed in the near future. Before any action is actually taken we desire to record our protest that such action be taken at all by presenting our views on the situation.\n\nIn the first place we feel that the removal of the \"Home\" from the village will be a blow to the social and moral standards to which we have so far attained. Any person with insight into the standards in Indian homes and in the social life in the villages who makes more than a casual study and comparison between villages where there has never been the direct influence of a \"Home\" within or near the village and villages where there has been this influence over a period of years can arrive at only one conclusion. The influence of the \"Home\" towards better standards of living found in those places fortunate enough to have \"Homes\" in their midst has been a large determining factor in the whole life of those villages. No person making such observations or comparisons could fail to realize how much we would lose if the Elizabeth Long Memorial home were removed from Kitimat. We could not hope to find this influence elsewhere. Nor would our children meet but little of such influence even in the best of day schools.\n\nWhile the following conditions pertain to some degree in every Indian village, we feel that Kitimat is peculiar in being forced to live a far more nomadic life than many others. There are some thirty-two trap lines owned within the Band, to the furthest of which is seventy-five miles. We estimate that the average distance for all the lines would be over thirty miles. With a four months season for marten and mink and two months trapping beaver and otter following consecutively, it can be seen that the amount of travelling that we have to do is far more than the average and that it is not possible to go out for short periods and return to the village on account of the expense of travel. Nor are we economically able to support two houses, one on the trap-line and the other in the village. Besides, in the months immediately after the New Year we get very considerable quantities of our native dried fish while trapping at the same time and our women must necessarily accompany us to take their part in its preparation. In April each year we spend three weeks at least in the preparation of our oolachan oil. We could not hope to transport the fish to the village for processing even three miles so our families have to go to the fishing grounds. While we are at oolachans we are also at our gardens which are not available in the home village. There is also a month in the fall when we have to get our dried salmon when we must go where the fish are in order to get sufficient quantity. If we could be able to make sufficient money to eliminate so much wandering in search of food then in a settled life our children would be able to take advantage of a school life which they are now able to receive through the facilities of residence in the \"Home.\"\n\nWe are very much aware of all the benefits received at the hands of the Government and the Church. We cherish the progress we have made in all the Departments of life. We humbly petition that what we now have will not be taken from us to our detriment.\nCOPY OF PETITION SIGNATURES\n\nJoe Gray\nMrs. Joe Gray\nErnest Grant\nMrs. Ernest Grant\nRufus Gray\nRichard Morrison\nSimon W.

(RG 10, Volume 6397 File 820-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nMay 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, also your letter dated \"May 28, 1940\", with reference to the proposed Indian day school at Kitamaat. I have carefully noted the contents of your letter and under the circumstances no further action will be taken until I hear further from you. Please keep the matter in mind and let me hear from you as soon as you have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with Inspector Barry. It is quite possible that in the meantime I will hear from Dr. Dorey.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letters of April 27th and May 13th regarding the proposed Indian Day School at Kitamaat, I have now received a letter from Mr. Christie to the effect that if the Department wishes construction of the school to proceed this summer that it is doubtful if suitable Indian labour could be provided, as the Indians who would ordinarily qualify for such work would not forego fishing for such employment as the returns from fishing would be considerably more than what they could earn on the proposed building. If construction of the school were delayed until the late fall we would be confronted with increased costs because of the handicap of the continuous wet weather. Mr. Christie further observes that in view of the isolated character of the Reserve that he could not give the project constant supervision.\n\nUnder these circumstances it would appear that if the Department decided to proceed with the construction of the school by day labour it would be necessary to employ possibly two or three white carpenters, one of whom would be the foreman in charge who could hire such Indians as he required from the local inhabitants available. Mr. Christie did not supply the information requested in respect to what white carpenters were available in his Agency for such work, and I am writing to him again for information on this point. When all things are considered it might be as well to build the school by contract if it could be done in this way for the amount provided.\n\nYou will recall that the question of the continuation of Kitamaat as a residential school was referred to in my report of May 1st as a result of certain observations made by you in your letter of April 12th. This matter was briefly dealt with yesterday during a short visit by Dr. Dorey to this office.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDr. . . .\nDr. Dorey promised to discuss the subject with the particular division of the United Church operating the Kitamaat School. No doubt the Department will be advised in due course of the views of the Church in the matter. It seems to me that it would be best to await the decision of the United Church authorities regarding the future of the Kitamaat Residential School before taking action with respect to the proposed Day School, as the Church's decision might have a very definite bearing on the size and type of school that we should provide at that point. It is just possible also that a new United Church school is more urgently needed on the West Coast of Vancouver Island than at Kitamaat in order to take care of surplus pupils for whom there will be no room in the new Residential School at Alberni, but this is a point that I should prefer to give more definite information on after reviewing the matter with Inspector Barry on his return from the north in mid-June.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File No. 162-15-5.\n\nReplying to your letters of the 27th ultimo and 13th instant with reference to the erection of a new day school at itimmat in the sella Coola agency, I would advise that in order to secure the information requested in your letter of the 27th ultimo it was necessary to communicate with Mr. Agent Christie at sella Coola, which has the worst mail communications of any agency in this province and to date no reply has been received.\n\nMr. Inspector Larry is at present absent on an inspection trip in northern British Columbia and not expected to return until June, but in regard to the inclusion of a teacher's residence in the school, I would quote from his \"Building Programme\" for the fiscal year 1940-41 in connection with his report of July 6, 1939 re Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as follows:\n\n\"Project A\".\n\nThe erection of a new Indian Day School with a teacher's residence at ITIMMAT in the sella Coola agency. The present Indian Day School there is the property of the United Church of Canada and is crowded with the children from the itimmat Indian residential School so that the village children do not get the attention they certainly deserve. The present school should be used exclusively for the children from the itimmat Indian residential School of which it forms almost a part by being located on the same property. The children suggested to be returned to itimmat from Coqualeetza make the provision of a village school at itimmat very necessary.\"\n\nfrom which it will be evident that the teacher's quarters are necessary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary\n\nMay 15, 1940.\n\nPending receipt of the information requested from Mr. Christie, I would express the opinion, in the absence of Mr. Commissioner MacKay, that a two room school combined with teacher's quarters could be erected within the $6,500.00 appropriation if the work is carried out in the same manner as the recently erected Boothroyd day school where a white foreman was employed, if it is found possible to secure satisfactory Indian labor available at Itamak; particularly if the Boothroyd foreman could be engaged for the job as he was found to be very competent and able to handle Indian labor quite successfully.\n\nI will advise you further immediately I hear from Mr. Christie.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.

However, in Inspector Barry's report which you forwarded with your letter of May 1 it is noted that he makes no mention of a teachers' residence but simply recommends two class rooms. Presumably other arrangements can be made for the teachers' living quarters.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate your advising if a suitable two-room day school with basement could be erected at Kitamaat for the amount of $6500.00 which is provided in this year's appropriation. I feel that it is almost unnecessary for me to state that this is the total amount that can be provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

Please let me know if there are any Indians capable of being employed for this work or will white labour have to be secured exclusively. In the latter event you should state the number of white men required and their trades. I should appreciate receiving any recommendation that you care to make with regard to the erection of this building.\n\nIn providing for the erection of this building the Department had in mind the report that we had received that its construction would obviate the necessity of pupils at Kitamaat going to the Alberni Residential School as they did in the case of the Coqualeetza Residential School. In replying you might state whether one class room or two class rooms are necessary. It must be kept in mind that $6,500.00 is all that is provided and due to present conditions it is impossible to consider expending any larger amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read Departmental letter 162-15-5 dated July 4th last with regard to the need for a new Indian day school at Kitamaat.\n\nWith special reference to Paragraph 2 of the above letter I may say that my opinion with regard to the need for a new school at Kitamaat has never varied from that quoted by Dr. McGill and expressed in my report of July 6th 1929.\n\nWhen you discussed this matter with me about June 21st I said that a new Indian day school was more needed at Ahousaht than at Kitamaat, if the residential school was to be retained there for another year. You will remember that you suggested that the available funds for one school might be transferred to the other.\n\nAs it appeared from correspondence that the Department wished me to limit my recommendations for further expenditure I agreed that should the new Ahousaht day school be erected the proposed day school at Kitamaat might well be left over for another year.\n\nIn agreeing with your suggestion to have the school at a different place erected before the new Kitamaat day school was undertaken I did not change any opinion previously expressed with regard to the eventual need for a day school at Kitamaat.\n\nThe Director states that the amount of $6,500.00 is available for a new Kitamaat school now and that it might be difficult to obtain such a sum next year. I wish also in this connection to remind you that it has recently been decided not to erect a new day school at Ahousaht this year.\n\nIn view of the above facts I would strongly advise the erection of the proposed Indian day school at Kitamaat.\n\nAs the Department has now decided to close the present Kitamaat Indian Residential School I would further recommend that the new Kitamaat Indian day school consist of at least two classrooms and accommodation for two resident teachers, manual training shop etc., in the basement, which need not be entirely cement.\n\nThe two rooms now recommended become necessary through the decision to close the present residential school.\n\nI trust that the above explanation will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry  \nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397 File 820-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 162-15-5.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 4th and subsequent correspondence regarding the proposed Indian Day School at Kitimat.\n\nAfter careful consideration of our requirements it is felt that a building similar to that at Bella Bella should be provided at Kitimat. The question of costs of such a structure has been gone into thoroughly with experienced carpenter builders, and my information is that it is extremely doubtful if such a building could be constructed by day labour under $7700 which amount includes $397 for electric wiring. It is understood that the contract price for the Bella Bella School, which was built nearly two years ago, was $7250, and when considering the increase in the cost of lumber, hardware and other building materials, which could be conservatively placed at 15%, and the heavier transportation costs involved because of the remoteness of Kitimat as compared with Bella Bella, which is on the direct steamship route, it will be seen immediately that the estimate of $7700 is not excessive, even considering slight changes intended to lessen costs. I could not give any assurance that the school could be constructed by day labour for less than this amount, and unless a very capable foreman carpenter is employed and very careful and constant supervision provided, the chances are the costs would be greater.\n\nThe services of Mr. Ira C. Jones, who built our schools at Pemberton and Shalalth, would be available for this work, but as he lives outside the Skeena constituency his employment might not be favorably considered. Mr. Jones has a reputation for good work and is thoroughly reliable. The contractors who built the Bella Bella School might also be available to undertake the work by day labour, but my opinion is that in any case the costs would not be less than $7700.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn...\nIn view of the many difficulties involved in constructing a building of this magnitude by day labour, it might be well for the Department to favorably consider the calling of tenders. Should the Department, however, decide to proceed with construction by day labour, I consider it desirable that the carpenter foreman entrusted with the task be authorized to visit the site in order to fully acquaint himself with conditions and lay his plans accordingly. In view of the approaching rainy season the work, irrespective of how it is undertaken, should be proceeded with at the earliest possible date.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply, and also the receipt of a copy of the specifications for the Bella Bella Indian Day School, which was requested but was not forwarded by the Department with the plans.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

He expressed the opinion that a building similar to the new School at Bella Bella, with teachers' quarters, would meet the requirements, if it can be constructed within the amount appropriated.

They have intimated that there are certain modifications in these plans that they would like to make but that these are minor modifications and can be adjusted in the course of a few hours. They have promised that they will send forward a statement of these modifications and the specifications of the Bella Bella School requested by you, just as soon as they can possibly do so.\n\nI have also discussed the construction of this school with the Chief Executive Assistant. You are already aware that we have only $6,500 for the construction of the building. However, we can secure an additional amount by simply refusing to undertake repairs at a number of other schools where it was our intention to do such work as painting and provide certain equipment. Mr. Jackson feels that if this school is to be constructed by day labour the best possible carpenter-foreman should be secured and that construction of the building should be given capable and constant supervision. He is rather disposed to accept your recommendation that Mr. Ira C. Jones be employed to undertake this work, despite the fact that he is not a resident of the Skeena constituency.\n\nI shall send forward to you, by Air Mail, the modified plan and specifications, just as soon as they reach me. In the meantime I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to discuss the matter with Mr. Jones and reach an understanding with him whereby he will be able to proceed with the work at the earliest possible date. I agree with Inspector Barry that the construction of this school at Kitimat and the closing of the so-called residential school now operated by the United Church will mean a substantial step forward in the education of the Indian population of that district.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, in which he states that in his judgment it would be desirable to use the plans of the Bella Bella Indian Day School for the construction of an Indian day school at Kitamaat. While no decision has been reached, it is just possible that the construction of this school may be undertaken by day labour.\n\nA copy of the plans of the Bella Bella Indian Day School were sent forward to Major MacKay a few days ago. He now asks that a copy of the specifications of the Bella Bella School be forwarded to him.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could send forward a copy of the specifications requested by Major MacKay and also any suggestions you may have to offer with respect to minor modifications that might be made in the original plan of the Bella Bella School.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 162-15-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the construction of a school on Kitimat Indian Reserve, I would advise that this matter has today been discussed at some length with Mr. I.C. Jones and he has expressed his willingness to proceed with construction immediately if authorized to do so, either by contract or by day labour as carpenter foreman.\n\nTo date the amended plans and specifications to be prepared by the Surveys & Engineering Branch have not been received.\n\nAs it is proposed to duplicate the Bella Bella Day School, I would point out that after construction it was found necessary to provide a door between the two entrance lobbies to the class rooms in order to overcome the necessity of going down stairs and through the teacher's quarters, or outside the building, to go from one class room to the other, and also to provide alternative exits in case of fire. It was also found that the joint between the plate of the wall framing and the concrete foundation was unsatisfactory and permitted water draining down the outside wall to enter the basement class rooms.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's decision and instructions re employment of Mr. Jones if day labour is decided upon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSeptember 3rd, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Plans for Bella Bella School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 27th ultimo requesting a copy of the Bella Bella School specifications and modifications of the plans for use by the Indian Affairs Branch in the erection of a day school at Kitamaat, British Columbia. I am advised that since the Bella Bella school was planned for unusual site conditions, namely, rock about two feet below the grade, it is not considered by our architects as the best plan to use under normal site conditions. As you are aware a school of similar accommodation was planned for Maria last year, and since it is considered that this plan would be more suitable, the matter was discussed with Mr. Hoey of the Indian Affairs Branch by telephone on the 28th ultimo.\n\nMr. Hoey concurred with our opinion in the matter and agreed to the use of the Maria School plans and specifications. I am therefore forwarding herewith for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch, three sets of blue prints of plan No.741 together with one copy of the specifications for these plans.\n\nWith regard to classroom accommodation, it is understood that the school should accommodate about 70 students. Since the plan No.741 was prepared for 60 students, we have indicated on the plans the manner in which the classrooms can be extended to provide the accommodation desired.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nF.T.

Indian Trust Account.\n\nInstructions for this project have been issued to me and arrangements made for the purchase of material and the payment of labor through this office.\n\nMr. Christie's Agency Trust Account happens to be in Vancouver as there is no branch of a chartered bank in Bella Coola, which is a small isolated village off the shipping routes. Considerable delay and confusion could only result from Mr. Christie's handling of the project now, after most of the arrangements have already been made by this office.\n\nEncumbrance Requisition No.1058, dated September 20th, for $6500 has been received, which amount, it is presumed, includes the $2000 which is being allowed for labor but I should like to be advised on this point.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the necessary instructions could be issued for the issue and despatch of a cheque for $2000 payable to the B.C.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the construction of a school on the Kitimat Indian Reserve.\n\nWhile the Department had intended to forward plans of the Bella Bella School the Surveys & Engineering Branch stated that in their opinion it would be preferable to build the Kitimat School on the same plan as a school built on the Maria Indian Reserve last summer. I, therefore, enclose three sets of blue prints of the plan of this school together with one copy of the specifications for these plans.\n\nThese plans were drawn for a school to accommodate 60 pupils. If accommodation for 70 pupils is required at Kitimat you will note that an indication has been made on the plans as to the manner in which the class rooms can be extended to provide for 70 instead of 60.\n\nAs you were informed in the last paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter of the 23rd ultimo the Department approves the employment of Mr. I.C. Jones to supervise the construction of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.

It is for this reason that the blue prints of the Maria School have been substituted for those of the Bella Bella School.\n\nIt will also be noted that indication has been made on the plans as to the manner in which the classrooms can be extended to provide for seventy instead of sixty students.\n\nI concur in Mr. Mills' suggestion that the Maria School plans rather than the Bella Bella School plans should be used for the Kitamaat.\n\nDirector.\nRe Kitimat School\n\nCommunioon\nIndian Affairs Branch\nB.C.\n\nVancouver\n\nSept. 23, 1940\n\nMr. Ira C.

Vancouver and fare for one man for one trip and board in the amount of $14.00 for the one man on the job. If a size smaller furnace should be used, you may deduct the sum of $3.00 (Sixty-three Dollars), but in our estimation the larger size furnace should be used.\n\nHoping we may have the pleasure of serving you,\n\nwe are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEMPIRE SHEET METAL WORKS, LTD.\n\nper Manager\n\nFJH:W\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested, we are pleased to follow tender and specification for the heating of the new school at Kitimat.\n\nSupply and install one No 54 Fawcett wood furnace, double closed in 24g galv iron and bright tin, and connected to chimney with 22g galv iron smoke pipe.\n\nThe rest of the installation to be similar in every respect to the system installed by us in February 1939 in the Bella Bella Indian School.\n\nAll cutting and making good to be done by General Contractor and a helper provided for our installing mechanic as required.

Empire Sheet Metal Works Ltd. $628.00\n2. Central Sheet Metal Works Ltd. $647.00\n\nYou will note that the Empire Sheet Metal Works tender is the lowest and includes complete installation. The cost of the furnace and materials from the Empire Sheet Metal Works is $483 and labor, $145, a total of $628 as quoted.\n\nAs it was imperative to get action immediately, owing to the difficulties in securing transportation to Kitamaat, I instructed the Empire Sheet Metal Works to proceed to get the supplies out because their tender was the lowest and the goods offered considered superior. I should appreciate covering authority for this expenditure.\n\nPurchase order in the amount of $483 could be issued here and the costs of installation, labor, etc., paid from the cash advance. Otherwise, a purchase order for $628, chargeable to E.R.1058 will be required from the Department. Please let me have a reply by airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

In my letter to the Department of August 20th, my file 15/2/7338, I estimated the costs of this construction at not less than $7,700 and observed that unless the conditions generally were very favorable the costs would be greater.\n\nI would, therefore, request that a further sum of $1,500 be encumbered for this project, divided as follows:\n\nMaterial $700.00\nLabor $800.00\n\nA copy of the encumbrance requisition should be forwarded at the earliest possible date, together with a cheque for $800 payable to the B.C. Indian Account to cover the costs of labor.\n\nThe latest reports would indicate that good progress is being made with the construction of this school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe New Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nYour File 162-15-5.\n\nI am forwarding herewith the following accounts of Vancouver firms on the approved list for materials purchased for the marginally noted construction as a charge against E.R.1058, dated September 20, 1940:\n\nEvans, Coleman & Evans\n\n| Voucher | Date       | Amount   |\n|---------|------------|----------|\n| 47A     | November 14, 1940 | $440.36 |\n| 48A     | \"          | $463.20 |\n| 49A     | \"          | $296.18 |\n| 50A     | \"          | $492.77 |\n\nAlberta Lumber Co.\n\n| Voucher | Date       | Amount   |\n|---------|------------|----------|\n| 51A     | November 14, 1940 | $494.98 |\n| 52A     | \"          | $450.10 |\n| 53A     | \"          | $459.50 |\n\nThe Alberta Lumber Co. was the only firm manufacturing lumber in this city in a position to furnish what was required in time to meet our shipping arrangements.\n\nThe firm of Evans, Coleman & Evans was the only one in the city who could provide both materials and transportation.\n\nOwing to the absence of proper wharf accommodation at Kitamaat to land heavy supplies, it was found necessary to arrange to have most of the materials required for the school shipped at one time by tug and scow. Evans, Coleman & Evans undertook to do this work for us. The materials were safely landed on the beach at Kitamaat and raised by highrigging equipment over the bluffs to a position where they could be transported by hand to the school site.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCovering purchase orders accompany each account and although in the case of the accounts of Evans, Coleman & Evans two are dated October 7th and two, October 10th, the orders were placed on the dates as per purchase orders and the goods actually shipped prior to the dates appearing on these accounts. I trust the Department will see its way clear to consider these accounts separately and the covering purchase orders sufficient to pass same for payment. In cases where firms were in a position to meet our delivery requirements, quotations were secured. It was only on condition that the scow would be loaded ready to leave Vancouver by a specified time that Evans, Coleman & Evans undertook to transport the materials to Kitamaat for us, and the placing of orders was made to meet this requirement.\n\nTo undertake any construction of importance by day labor in such a remote area as Kitamaat from this office is no easy task. However, latest reports indicate that good progress is being made with the construction of the school, despite many handicaps, not the least being continuous heavy rains during the last two weeks in October and the first week of this month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nB.M.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-HN\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your 162-15-5,\nNew Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a statement of the costs in connection with the construction of the marginally noted school together with Voucher No. 83-A for $320.84 and Credit Vouchers Nos. 82-A and 84-A for $610.00 and $3.58, respectively.\n\nThe Department authorized $8000.00 for this construction as follows:\n\nE.R. 1058, dated Sept. 20, 1940, - $6,500.00\nDept. Letter 162-15-5, dated Dec. 5, 1940. - 1,500.00\n\n(No copy of E.R. received for this authorization)\n\nThe total cost to date is $8072.57, which is $72.57 in excess of the amount authorized. Considerable local Indian labor was used by the contractor at the rate of 40\u00a2 per hour. Taking this into consideration, together with the many difficulties in connection with constructing a school in such a remote area and the increase in the price of materials, the cost is not excessive.\n\nThe school has been completed and it is not expected that there will be any further expenditures, with the possible exception of a small amount for water pipe to connect the school with the existing system. It will be necessary, however, to clear up and level the school grounds, and some fencing may also be required. The Agent is being instructed to furnish an estimate of the cost of these improvements for the information of the Department.\n\nThe school will be visited the first opportunity by Inspector Coleman or myself and a report made on the quality of the work performed and the materials used in the construction.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn order to close the account insofar as Mr. Ira C. Jones is concerned, a cheque for $320.84 covering Voucher No. 83-A should be forwarded to him at 1131 West 16th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C. Early action in this respect would be appreciated.\n\nPlease arrange to have the attached statement checked, and advise if the vouchers listed have all been received.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

(RG 10, Volume 6397 File 820-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 19th, your file 162-15-5, I beg to advise that the following equipment and furnishings, etc., will be required for the marginally-noted School and residence. The prices shown were secured from local sources of supply and represent a very close estimate in each case.\n\nSchool desks: (as per quotations attached)........... $452.30\nTeacher's desk and chair................................. $34.50\nFurnishings for residence................................. $300.00\n(This estimate based on costs of furnishings provided in similar cases, making allowance for increase in prices)\nWater pipes (to extend system into the School)...... $14.00\nSewing Machine (Singer)................................. $39.75\n\nAccommodation has been provided in the building for instruction in Vocational Training but Inspector Barry considers that the purchase of the equipment required for this purpose should be deferred until we know that an instructor is available, or until after the first inspection of the School, early in the new school year. A copy of Inspector Barry's letter to me on the subject is attached, for your information.\n\nI should appreciate being advised as to the Department's wishes with respect to the placing of orders for the above-mentioned equipment and furnishings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJune 12, 1941.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the equipment required at the new Kitamaat Indian Day School, I would refer you to my letter of May 13th last, with which was forwarded a report on the present Kitamaat Day and Residential Schools.\n\nThere are two rooms in the basement of the new school building. Floors are of cement, and during the cold part of the winter the rooms may not be suitable for classes in Manual Training and Girls' Vocational Work. Some of the girls' work could of course be carried on in the academic classrooms, sewing and knitting for instance.\n\nIf the Manual Training is to be started immediately the school is opened some four to six double benches or at least wood for their construction would be needed, as well as twelve sets of simple tools for the boys and a set of tools for the instructor. Mr. Doucet of the Department has I believe prepared a list of suitable tools but I have not as yet been supplied with a copy of this list. If it is not available later I could no doubt prepare a list of suitable tools for this particular school.\n\nA Singer sewing machine will be required at the opening of the school for the use of the older girls. Later wool carders, weaving frames, and a spinning machine similar to those used in the Cowichan Agency may be needed.\n\nIt is very difficult for me to state in a definite way just what equipment is required now for the Manual Training and Vocational Rooms, as so much depends on the staff of the school. Manuals also will lie in the hands of the United Church officials no doubt, and I have no idea whether it is their intention to nominate a married man as senior teacher and Manual Training Instructor with a girl as Primary Teacher, or whether the school will be placed in the charge of two girls. In the latter case the immediate provision of Manual Training tools would not appear to be necessary.\n\nThe teachers' residence consists of two small bedrooms, a small living room and a small kitchen. If a married man were to be appointed as Principal, I do not know whether the Primary teacher would live in the school or have to board and room in the Mission House.\n\nIn any case we should provide the minimum necessary furniture for the teachers' rooms in the new school building.\nThe furniture for the teachers' rooms might well be similar to that provided for the Boothroyd Day School, except that at Kitamaat we shall have to include a kitchen stove and some living room furniture.\n\nIn my letter of May 13th I suggested that the furniture for Kitamaat would cost about $300.00 and as prices are going up all the time I am not able to in any way reduce this provisional estimate.\n\nThe numbers of each size of desk needed for the classrooms were given in my previous letter on this subject, and I may say that it is essential that the arrangement of desks in the two rooms outlined in that letter be followed in detail so that full use can be made of the existing desks in the present Kitamaat School.\n\nIn conclusion I would suggest that for the present the necessary desks and furniture for the teacher's rooms be provided, the electric light plant taken over from the present Kitamaat Indian Residential School if it is possible to obtain possession of it, water brought into the new building from the new pipe line, and the Singer sewing machine supplied, while the provision of Shop Training tools, lumber, etc., be deferred till we know that an instructor is available, or till after the first inspection of the school, probably early in the 1942-43 Fiscal Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant I have been advised by Indian Commissioner MacKay that there are living quarters at the new Kitamaat Day School for two teachers.\n\nWe have not yet bought the furnishings for the teachers' quarters but I recently wrote to Commissioner MacKay requesting him to let me have detailed information with regard to what is required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Kitamaat Indian School\n\nI have had an enquiry concerning Kitamaat, as to whether there are quarters for the teachers in the new school and, if so, whether they are furnished. I presume that, if there are quarters, they will be sufficient to accommodate two teachers.\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society is closing the residential school and, consequently, there is a certain amount of equipment available. Further, if no living quarters are provided in the school, these could be arranged for in connection with one of our buildings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.MT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397 File 820-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Kitamaat Indian Day School I should appreciate receiving from you detailed information regarding the equipment that is required and an estimate of its probable cost. Is there a room in this building in which instruction in elementary domestic science could be given? If so, some equipment for this room should be included in your requisition for the furnishings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M.

The new day school is functioning very well and at present has about 47 children in the junior grade under Miss Wilson and about 35 in the senior grade under Miss Leith. Both of these teachers appeared competent and had their rooms under excellent control. The children appeared very happy, well dressed and nourished.\n\nThe new school appeared satisfactory in every respect, although it was observed that here, as at Bella Bella with a school of the same design, that the red roof paint had washed down with the rain over the white walls, marring the appearance. More than this, the condition suggested the necessity of some roof gutter along these sections of the eaves in order to prevent decay of that part of the building. It would not require more than about 50 feet of this gutter, the cost of which would be quite small.\n\nThere is no wood shed for the school and at present during the rainy season, it is necessary to store the wood in one of the basement class rooms. In order to construct a wood shed it would be necessary to level another piece of the school site but this should be done in order to give the fuel a chance to dry out.\n\nJas.

This is a two-roomed school with a large attendance and the Indian Agent definitely assures us that the supplies were required. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 820-76-12-489.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, the Department will endeavour to pay the amount of $106.70 covered by your voucher No. 149. However, I would point out that in your letter of July 19 you requested 12 blinds, while the account submitted shows that you purchased 18. It is impossible for the Department to control expenditures if Indian Agents purchase more supplies than authorized.\n\nWith regard to the towelling and cotton, I feel that the Kitimat School should only have the quantity which they absolutely need. You can keep the remainder in your office and dispose of it as required, either at this school or other schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. T.A.

The item for Terry Toweling has been exceeded by 18 yards, over the amount ordered, but as this was ordered from the wholesalers in Vancouver, they probably did not wish to cut the bolt; the same would apply to the Factory cotton, this bolt containing 61 yards.\n\nOf course these extra yards can always be used, but should the Department consider that this is too much, some of this material would possibly be taken over by the local dealer, through which these goods were purchased.\n\nYou will also note that there is no Dustbane on this account, and the dealer informs me that he has not been advised why this article was not shipped with the order.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nT.A.

As the material has already been ordered for the woodshed, an early reply would be appreciated. The cheque in this instance could be forwarded to Mr. Acting Indian Agent Levelton, Bella Coola, B.C.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJuly 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may authorize an expenditure of $125.00 for the construction of a woodshed at the Kitimat Indian Day School. When forwarding the account you should attach a copy of your purchase order for any material supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to your letter of May 4th, your file 162-15-5 regarding the construction of a woodshed at Kitimaat Indian Day School and, to enclose herewith letter received from Mr. Acting Indian Agent Levelton, advising that the cost of such woodshed would amount to $125.00 if the roof is of corrugated galvanized iron.\n\nIt will be noted that this would also house the electric light plant for the school.\n\nIf funds can be provided for this amount I would recommend that the application be approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor: D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of May 13th, No. 215-2-6291 re wood shed for the Kitamaat Indian Day School, would advise that I took this matter up on a recent visit to this village.\n\nThe size proposed by Mr. Christie was a shed, 18 x 24 with an 8 foot high wall, this would be enclosing the power house in one corner.\n\nThe bill for material can probably be ascertained more readily from your office, as there is no place here where it can be purchased.\n\nWould recommend putting a corrugated iron roof on this building, as it would lessen the fire hazard, and would be cheaper in the long run.\n\nThe space near the school is very limited, and a certain amount of excavation work will have to be done, as the buildings are on the side of a hill, and this will run up the labor costs, of construction. Would recommend that cement posts be put under sills, to make the job more permanent.\n\nThere is also the floor in the power house to be considered the present floor is only dirt, and this should be cemented, to prevent fire hazard. The power house is all covered in corrugated iron, with roof of same material.\n\nThe estimated cost of labor, erecting building, carrying material from dock, and putting in cement posts is $125.00.\n\nBill of material needed is enclosed, in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.A. Levelton\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA request has been received from the Acting Indian Agent at Bella Coola for fire extinguishers for the Kitimat Day School. It is not our usual practice to supply fire extinguishers to day schools, but possibly there is a need for them at Kitimat. I should, therefore, appreciate your purchasing and shipping two or three one-quart extinguishers to this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJuly 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the Kitimat Indian Day School. You may secure the asbestos sheet and reducing stove pipe.\n\nYou may also purchase the material required for the ladders. Twelve blinds may also be secured.\n\nWith reference to fire extinguishers, it is considered that the one-quart size is sufficient and two of these will be ordered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nM.F. T.A. Levelton,\nActing Indian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWhile at Kitumant recently I noticed that there were several things needing attention around the new school. First, the cook stove in the teachers' residence is set close to the wall and there is no protection over the wall board behind the stove; found that the wall board was so badly charred with the heat that it was crumbling and there is a great danger of setting the building on fire. Would suggest that a heavy asbestos sheet 54\" by 28\" by 2\" thick be fitted on the wall behind the stove and pipe.\n\nAlso needs a reducing stove-pipe 7\" to 6\".\n\nFire protection: there are no fire extinguishers in the building and while there I tried the water hydrant outside the building and found that there was insufficient pressure to bring the water to bring the water up to the school. Would suggest that two large size Tyrone fire extinguishers be purchased and installed in the school.\n\nAlso noticed there are no ladders either on the roof or on the side of the building. Would therefore suggest that material for four ladders be purchased, two for the roof and two for the side of the building.\n\nWould also suggest that roof should be painted as the first coat which was applied during the winter months when shingles were wet did not penetrate and consequently a large part of this has washed away.\n\nNoticed also that there are no blinds for the teachers' residence. Amount needed, eight blinds 36x44 inches, and four blinds 36x56 inches.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJuly 9th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of May 27th regarding supplies for the Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nThe order for these has been placed locally with instructions for the goods to be shipped about September 15th, in time for school opening.\n\nWith reference to \"Material and tools for manual training,\" I regret to say I was not able to contact the teachers before they left Kitimat, and am therefore unable to say what they had in mind when they asked for this material. We shall take the matter up with the new teachers this fall and communicate with you further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nMr. R.A.

Took up the matter of school with the manager at Butedale, but unfortunately the regular manager was away on his holidays, and the man in charge was there only temporarily, he did however get in touch with the head office in Vancouver, but upon my return from Kitamaat, he had not had any reply.\n\nMiss Vermilyea, sent to Kitamaat to teach the Junior room was sick upon my arrival, and she informed me that she had sent in her resignation to the W.M.S., and under the circumstances, it was probably just as well, as there were not enough children attending school, to warrant two teachers, Mrs Waywell seemed to be very efficient, and she had the best control in the class room, that I have seen in any Indian day school, so hope that she makes a success of her work there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.A. Leavelton,\nActing Indian Agent.\nBella Coola Agency\n\nNovember 19th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA stay of six days at Kitamaat was necessary, owing to the late arrival of the monthly boat, and as there was some material for the Kitamaat woodshed aboard, I had to await the arrival of the boat.\n\nThe ground for the woodshed was leveled out, and holes for the foundation posts were dug, and the forms for cement posts were placed, and cement poured in the corner posts before left. Cold weather set in at the time, and it is doubtful if anything could be done with the floor in the powerhouse, as there was a possibility that the cement would freeze before setting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nT.A.

According to Mr. Inspector Coleman who recently visited Kitamaat, the school site was excavated from a rather steep side hill sufficiently to erect the building and leave a few feet of level ground in front of the school but this cut and fill left a hazard for children playing around the school during the recreation period.\n\nUnfortunately, we have not succeeded in getting teachers for this school and there are none in sight. Consequently, the fencing is not urgent unless the Department would prefer to have the work carried out during the present fiscal year at a time when the Indians are mostly in the village. If funds are available, I am prepared to recommend approval of the application.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBella Coola Indian Agency,\nNovember 19th, 1943\n\nMajor D.M.

Present brush and slash would have to be cleared away, and a log crib put in, and the area fenced.\n\nFurther work would have to be undertaken in succeeding fiscal years, and eventually a very pleasant area could be created, with its consequent training values to the children.\n\nThe Council will take responsibility for supervision of this work and they will have enough nails on hand of a large size from their wharf construction to take care of the fence built this fiscal year.\n\nIf sanctioned, an accountable cheque would be appreciated, so that the men could be paid off when the village is visited by the Agent.\n\nF.

Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe attached Vouchers #268 and 271 dated Nov.3/45 for three barrels gasoline, 1 can (4 gallon) lub oil and freight charges Butedale to Kitamaat, the following explanation is given for the purchase of this fuel.\n\nThere is no regular passenger and freight service from Butedale to Kitamaat, and the Indians, who have only small gas boats, charge $5.00 to $7.50 per drum, depending on weather conditions, to freight gasoline into Kitamaat.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiations, arrangements were finally made to have a steamer take a load of lumber and freight into Kitamaat and as time did not permit applying for authority from the Department, I instructed the steamer to pick up three barrels gasoline and a tin of lub oil at Butedale and take them into Kitamaat, thus making sure of a winter's supply of fuel for the lighting plant at the School and Teacherage.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is hoped the Department will sanction the action taken.\n\nF.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $445.00 to make the necessary repairs at the Kitamaat Day School and you may proceed with the work at once.\n\nBernard F.

I have yet to secure quotations on materials, but in the meantime would appreciate being advised if the amount of $445.00, provided for in the current Bella Coola Agency estimates for repairs to the Kitamaat School is available, and if it will be in order to proceed with repairs to the extent of the funds provided.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclos.\n-ms.\nBella Coola, B. C.,\nJuly 31st, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School\nGutter flashings & down spouts\nwith drainage\n\nAt the time the above named school was built no eaves-troughing was installed, as a result the building now presents a poor appearance where the rain from the roof has beaten against the walls and run down. There are particularly bad waterfalls at both doorways owing to the construction of the roof. As I have put an item in the estimates for painting this building next year, I am of the opinion that the guttering should be installed this fall.\n\nI have been endeavoring to secure price quotations on metal guttering and down pipes but so far without success. Reliance Lumber Co., Vancouver have quoted on wooden 4 x 4 Clear Fir Gutter at $122.50 per M. There would be 280 lineal feet required which would work out at less than $50.00. It will be necessary to secure 150 lineal feet of 2\" metal down pipe with 12 elbows to complete the work and perhaps you may have more success in finding this piping than I have had. For attaching the wooden gutter, 5 lbs. of 5\" nails would be required with 1 lb. of 2\u00bd\" finishing nails for finishing corners etc.\n\nOwing to the roof construction, the greater part of the water will come off on the east side of the building at the rear against the hill side. Because of the heavy nature of the soil, drainage should be supplied and this will require 90 feet of 3\" tiling on each side of the building. That is, one drain to go on the north side running east to west, emptying through the cribbing to the west of the building and another 90 feet paralleling it on the south side of the building. I have been endeavoring to locate tiling, but that too seems scarce. T. G. McBride & Co., Main St., Vancouver have not yet answered my enquiry to them and it is possible they may be hoping to find and supply this tile.\n\n(over)\nIf this fails, we might have more success in having one large shipment sent in about October to handle as much as possible of our freight for Kitimat. However since the materials are scarce, it is not too soon to place orders now to be ready for that date.\n\nThank you for your help in this matter. Shipping instructions will go forward when further arrangements have been made at Butedale.\n\nWPP/D\n\nW. P. Pruden,\nIndian Agent.\nKitamaat, B.C.\nJune 15, 1947.\n\nI, the undersigned, undertake to attach new flashings, gutters and downpipes on to the Kitamaat Day School for the sum of $134.00.\n\nI intend to hire two men to help me and I expect to get this work done in one week.\n\n\"David Shaw\"\n\nKitamaat, B.C.\nJune 15, 1947.\n\nI, the undersigned, undertake to dig two trenches (90 ft. long and 2 ft. deep each) and lay tiles at the Kitamaat Day School.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Day School fire ladders\n\nThis building has never been supplied with fire ladders and these should be put in place without delay.\n\nWhile at Kitamaat in June I discussed the requirements with Mr. Robinson and tried to locate someone to do the work. It seems that in 1941 some ladder material was shipped in, but no one could be found to do the work and when Mr. Robinson came to the school, only one piece of ladder standard 16 feet long remained. He put this away in the wood shed, but I examined it and found it no longer suitable for building ladders and authorized Mr. Robinson to use it in constructing a door for the wood shed which he proposed to lock, as wood had been disappearing. This job was completed in June.\n\nWe now require a full set of materials to make the six sections of ladder and the catwalk required to reach the two chimney's and make all parts of the roof accessible. Following are the requirements:\n\n2 pieces 2 x 4 x 12' dressed four side\n4 \" 2 x 3 x 7\" \"\n2 \" 2 x 4 x 16\" \"\n2 \" 2 x 4 x 16\" \"\n\n100 lin. ft. 1 x 3 for rungs to cut to 18\"\nThe above all no. 1 fir clear stock.\n\n2 pieces 2 x 12 x 16' Double dressed good grade cedar or fir\n1 \" 2 x 10 x 16\" \"\n\n(The latter two items to be used for a cat walk from roof ladder on teacherage to class room roof.)\n\n(over)\nKitamaat, B.C.\nJune 15, 1947\n\nI, the undersigned, undertake to make and attach to the Kitamaat Day School fire ladders, six separate pieces. These ladders are to be properly finished and painted. I intend to hire two men to help me and I expect to finish this work in 3 days.\n\nI expect the sum of $72.00 for this work. It is understood that the Indian Department is to supply all materials.\n\n\"David Shaw\"\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Feb. | To glass for windows at the Kitamaat Indian Day School. | $9.75 |\n\nVote: 76-09-015\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The circumstances in this case are that under the original arrangement made with Miss Smith, Mr. Indian Agent Anfield was to take her from Prince Rupert to Kitamaat on the M.V. \"Naskeena\", which arrangement did not prove feasible at the last moment, the \"Naskeena\" being required elsewhere. Mr. Findlay apparently considered that as we had undertaken to provide transportation for Miss Smith on the \"Naskeena\" the Department should meet the cost of alternative transportation. Miss Smith was led to believe that transportation from Prince Rupert to Kitamaat would be provided for her without cost and under the circumstances I would recommend payment of the attached account.\n\nBella Coola Agency voucher No. 500 covering hotel accommodation for Miss Smith at Prince Rupert is also enclosed but is not recommended for payment as no arrangement was made with Miss Smith for the provision of accommodation at Prince Rupert.\n\nD.

C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nMay I refer to your 4-11-3 of July 26th, when you asked me if possible to secure a more reasonable estimate of cost of moving the boys toilet at the above named school.\n\nAll efforts since then have been unsuccessful until Mr. Robinson, finding the work must be done, engaged a man to do it and promised $20.00 for the job. From my experience I believe this is as reasonable as it would have been done could to work have waited. I quite sympathize with Mr. Robinson's action in ordering this work on his own responsibility.\n\nThis work was not included in the authority granted in Departmental letter 162-15-5 (m.1.1) of August 14th, 1947.\n\nI have written Mr. Robinson for the name of the man who did the work. May I be supplied with $20.00 to pay this account.\n\nW. P. Pruden,\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola, B. C.,\nJuly 15th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nThe boys toilet at the above named day school urgently requires moving to a new pit. As there were very few people in the village at my last visit to Kitamaat it was not possible to secure a contract for this work. However a fair price for the labor would be $30.00. The ground is of hardpan formation and very stony.\n\nMay I have your authority for the expenditure of $30.00 to complete this work.\n\nWPP/D\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of this, and in order that the teacher will not be inconvenienced any longer than necessary, I have ordered a suitable range at a cost of $125.20 to be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nI trust that my action in this instance is approved and I would recommend that the expenditure of $125.20 plus freight will be authorized by the Department as a charge against the Educational Vote.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n[Stamp]\nMr. W. S. Arnell, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Teacherage Furnishings\n\nThe cook stove at the above teacherage has given trouble for several years. On each of our trips to Kitamaat in the past year Mr. Leviton has spent an hour or more trying to adjust it to work satisfactorily. New plates and firebacks were purchased but when fitted in, on our last trip, these were found to be not quite satisfactory since the frame of the stove was warped. It was hoped however that the stove would be serviceable for a while.\n\nI now have a telegram from Mr. Robinson to report that the grates have collapsed and support for grates and oven top are burned through. The stove is therefore no longer usable. The teacher and nurse will be making shift on a small heating stove in the dispensary. This will be most inconvenient.\n\nPlease ship at once one wood and coal burning range with water reservoir and warming drawer, suggestion: Watsons Vol-6116. This should be shipped by Union Steamships and addressed to Kitamaat Indian Day School, Kitamaat, via Hatzicola, B. C. There will be a charge for transportation from Hatzicola to Kitamaat which I will pay in cash and voucher in addition to regular Union steamship freight bill.\n\nI will be in Hatzicola on my return from Kitamaat on October 14th. If arrival of stove could be prior to that date it would facilitate arrangements for early shipment to Kitamaat.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nTO The Canadian Fishing Co., Ltd., Butedale, B.C.\n\nSHIP TO\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nRECEIVED\n\nVIA\n\nINVOICE TO\n\nRENDER A SEPARATE INVOICE FOR EACH ORDER AND SEND COPIES AFTER SHIPMENT.\n\nF.O.B.

Possibly it is now finished except from awaiting the floor paint which you have shipped and a small section of the roof, which was also short of material.\n\nIf I am to verify completion of the work before vouchering the whole account the following delays will ensue at least:\n\nTwo weeks for an agency trip to Kitamaat\nOne week awaiting mail out from here\nOne week enroute to Ottawa via your office\nOne week for cheque to return to Micah Shaw at Kitamaat,\n\nbringing earliest return to Mr. Shaw to mid-November, by which time his family may be in serious need, and the weather to go out to cuticle for the cheque and supplies may cause a further considerable delay.\n\nIt would therefore be appreciated if arrangement can be made to pay this voucher on account of that part of work long since completed.\n\nShingle stain was found to be short by 5 gallons. I am looking 5 gallons from the agency residence office paint project in order to complete the Kitamaat school job this fall. If it is possible I would be grateful to have another 5 gallon can of \"British Red\" shingle paint purchased in Vancouver as a charge against the Kitamaat school and shipped by prepaid freight to the Indian agency, Bella Coola.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pruden's letter of Sept. 16th attached that the work is being proceeded with and that he is anxious to pay Mr. Shaw as soon as the contract is completed. An accountable advance of $875.00 is therefore requested. It occurs to me that as the work is not being done on a day labour basis it may not be possible to have an advance forwarded but if it is will you please have a cheque sent to Mr. Pruden at the earliest possible date or otherwise advise him accordingly.\n\nW.

Following this correspondence no agency trip was possible to Kitamaet until 30 August when the paintwork was found to be well under way. The paint materials having arrived there as late as 12 August. As stated previously it will not be possible to have this work done on a day labor basis. Mr. Shaw the contractor will be in need of funds as soon as the work is completed which I expect will be about the time of my next visit to Kitamaet. This Indian has heavy family obligations and for health reasons has not been able to engage in the normal remunerative employment available locally; hence his need of payment of the paint contract funds at once in order that he may prepare his family for the winter.\n\nIt would therefore be appreciated if an accountable advance can be provided at once in the amount of $75.00 in order that Mr. Shaw may be paid as soon as his contract is completed.\n\nMarshall-Jells have cancelled the item of 5 gallons of orange floor paint as being unobtainable. I have not been able to secure floor paint of any color locally. It would be greatly appreciated if you could order 5 gals. of floor paint of any color to be shipped to Mr. Micah Shaw, Kitamaet, via Bute Lake B.C. Shipment to go forward as soon as possible.

He and his wife were both offered highly remunerative employment at Butedale, and I rather believe it was a bit too much for him to watch the rest of the band leave the village and leave him behind. He therefore begged off the obligation when I met him at Butedale on 25th of June.\n\nI am attaching a tender from Mr. Micah Shaw who is also a member of the Kitamaat Band. I note what you have said regarding day work for this project. It will be realized that this office cannot maintain a time keeper at Kitamaat to verify labor returns. Mr. Shaw is a reliable man and I would normally accept his statement, but the matter of day work is further complicated by the fact that Mr. Shaw is under medical direction to take certain rest periods each day, hence his hours will be irregular. A number of his friends have assured me that they will be at Kitamaat frequently during the summer and will give him voluntary assistance to complete this work. He has a wife and three small children, as well as an aged father to support and is naturally concerned about next winter.\nRe. Kitamaat School Maintenance, Contd.\n\nHe had been canvassing the local logging camps for employment and it was largely to prevent him from taking more strenuous work that his friends urged me to offer him the paint work. This may also have been a factor in Mr. Wesley's relinquishing the job. I am satisfied that Mr. Shaw can complete the work with the aid of his wife, an older married daughter who will be living at his home for a time this summer and his many friends who have offered to aid. This is the only opportunity now available to have this work completed, since none of the able bodied men will stay in the village during the summer. Mr. Shaw is an intelligent man and before becoming a partial invalid was known as an efficient workman. I therefore recommend that his tender be accepted.\n\nNo doubt paint has already moved forward addressed to Mr. Wesley. This will be satisfactory since Mr. Wesley is at Butedale and has promised to look out for the shipment and have it sent up to Mr. Shaw at Kitamaat by a fish packer working that way. Mr. Malcolm, Manager at Butedale has also promised to look out for the shipment and expedite its transhipment to Kitamaat.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J. Pruden\nSupt. Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kitimat Indian Day School\nYour File No. 2-11-3 (162)\n\nWith reference to painting the interior and the exterior of the above school, we infer from the second paragraph of your letter of June 15th, that it might involve less expenditure to have the work done by day labour, and presumably the Indians might be employed. If we are correct, the Department approves doing the work on a day labour basis on the understanding that the total expenditure would not exceed $875.00. However, if it is necessary to have the work done by contract, you will have to communicate with us again because we are obliged to obtain the Minister's approval for any contract over $500.00.\n\nLocal purchase of the paint is authorized at an approximate cost of $500.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\n\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMcN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Maintenance - Kitimat Day School Building\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Pruden's letter of June 2nd and enclosures, attached, a total of \u00a31400.00 was requested in the estimates for material and labour necessary for the above-mentioned work. The paint requisitioned can be secured in Vancouver at an approximate cost of \u00a3500.00 and you will note that Mr. Pruden has secured a tender on labour in the amount of \u00a3875.00.\n\nIt occurs to me that the Department may not be able to accept a tender but would perhaps prefer to have the work done on a day labour basis, in which case I have no doubt that this could be arranged.\n\nI would recommend that \u00a31400.00 be encumbered to meet the cost of the improvements required and that I be authorized to arrange for the purchase and shipment of the paint from Vancouver.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.S.

C.\n\nRe: Kitamaat Day School, Maintenance\n\nAttached is tender in quadruplicate for the work of painting and decorating the above school building throughout, both classrooms, halls, stairs, two basement rooms and four roamed teacherage, all surfaces both inside and out.\n\nThe outside of this building is in particularly poor condition. It was originally painted in the winter and as a result the paint has checked, crumbled and washed off badly. It will have to be thoroughly wire brushed before painting. The inside has reached a condition where decorating is needed throughout.\n\nI have been endeavoring for about two years to persuade someone to take this work. Mr. Ed Wesley, a member of the Kitamaat Band, has at last agreed to forego the fishing season in order to get this work done and is now waiting at Kitamaat to receive the paint and supplies. He has done maintenance work for the Elizabeth Long Memorial Home, hence is experienced.\n\nAttached are requisitions in quadruplicate for the supplies needed which are to be furnished by the Department.\n\nWhatever can be done to authorize this work at an early date and get the paint on its way to Mr. Wesley will be appreciated. I shall be especially grateful for your help in placing the orders. None of the material is available locally.\n\nW.J. Pruden,\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nTender for labor - Painting Kitamaat Indian Day School\n\nI agree to undertake the following work:\n\n1. Wash and stain whole roof of school, teacherage, porches, one coat. Repair and paint fireladders and catwalk.\n\n2. Paint all outside walls of school and teacherage, porches, etc. - two coats, with trim of different color. Paint storm sash and screen sash.\n\n3. Replace loose putty on all windows. Replace broken window panes.\n\n4. Paint two coats interior of two classrooms, hallways and stairways, including lower floor entry hallway and basement entry. Varnish all doors, stair rails and treads. Paint two coats all north basement room and partitions. Paint one coat south basement room.\n\n5. Reset all clockroom hooks.\n\n6. Thoroughly scrub floors of classrooms, hallways and stairs. Plane down roughened sections. Apply one coat hot linseed oil and two coats good floor varnish.\n\n7. Paint two coats interior of teacherage kitchen, living room, two bedrooms, stairway, halls, two colors and cupboards third color.\n\n8.

A meeting was held with the Council on various business matters at which Inspector Coleman discussed the revival of Indian handicraft and boat building. It was noted that the new missionary at this point, Rev. Basil Hartley had been taking a class of boys in the school basement in gas engines and their operations. This kind of co-operation by the missionary will no doubt be much appreciated by the Department as other missionaries on our Reserves in Bella Coola Agency have shown a deplorable lack of interest in the young people under their care.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 15th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have noticed with interest the report of a meeting of the Council held at Bella Coola. I would be pleased if you would interview the missionary mentioned therein, Rev. Basil Hartley, and find out if he is qualified to carry out organized instruction in woodwork, combustion engines and light metal work.\n\nIf this man were qualified to carry on instruction, I would be pleased to furnish directions and a course of study and, possibly, slight remuneration for his trouble. On receiving your report, I will give this matter further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Wm. Christie,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 162-15-11\n\nLetter Dated Feb. 15, 1942.\n\nIt has not been possible to visit Kitimat during the past two months as the Departmental Launch is not in first class shape and the weather is often very stormy at this time of year.\n\nMr. Hartley, however, was written regarding his qualifications to carry out instructions in woodwork, combustion engines, and light metal work.\n\nThe following is his reply quoted from a letter dated January 3, 1942:\n\n\"Many thanks for your letter of December 30, which had a perilous trip up here, but came in yesterday, after David Duncan's boat had opened a couple of seams in the pounding seas just below Coste Island.\n\nRegarding the courses you speak of, I think that I could handle any of them. The time element plays its part - the boys are keen as anything, and most enjoyable to work with; but yours truly has precious little spare time. We are in the throes of negotiations with a view to getting the original status of our Post Office restored, whereby we should be freed from the tiresome and time-consuming business of issuing money orders, but that may take some time yet. However, we might be able to work out something, I think that for the time being, while our time is so very limited, that we might accomplish most if we began with the older lads, who would be most likely to find immediate application for their 'newly-acquired' knowledge.\n\nI have taken the Diesel Course offered by Hemphills, some years back when they were first opening up in Vancouver, and...\"\nJanuary 25, 1943.\n\nWhile there I put in some time teaching acetylene welding, which would be my choice of a trade. I don't suppose the Department will be able to see its way to equipping us along that line, at least until after the war, but for practical usefulness there would be few trades that we could introduce that would be better. Of course, there would be no object in making a community of welders, but it would offer a very useful trade to a few, for the days when the fishing isn't so good, and we will be hard put to it to help the people adapt themselves to changing conditions.\n\nI will try to find out how many we could line up for a course - the boys are all pretty fair at operating gas engines, but could stand some help on repairs and maintenance, and might be encouraged to advance to diesel work.\"\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Hartley's letter that he is well qualified to follow a course of study in the subjects you mentioned and I think the Department will do well to avail themselves of Mr. Hartley's ability in this line of work which is of the greatest importance to the Coast Indians, operating, as all of them do, their own gas boats, and also in view of the increased demands for men with such training in War Industries.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that a course of study is sent immediately. Mr. Hartley does not mention what remuneration he wishes but perhaps the Department has a standard rate by the day or hour for such instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTO: MO\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the work being done by Mr. Hartley at Kitimat. While there is no doubt that Mr. Hartley is making a real attempt to benefit the Indian boys, at the same time I feel it advisable to postpone any definite action until you have had an opportunity of visiting Kitimat. At the time of your next inspection there you should carefully study Mr. Hartley's work and write to me again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Wm.

We could not get a building built as we have so much as we can buy our church and things about the village. Therefore we ask have mercy upon us, build a school.

Mr. Bougner, the Agent, is being advised accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. P. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Galedonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a meeting of our Mission Board held Sept. 28, 1915 I brought before the members your letter requesting me to aid in securing a suitable teacher for the Indian Bay School at Kitkatla.\n\nThe Board decided to request Mr. and Mrs. Maynard Mustard to go to Kitkatla, and live in our Mission house for the two school quarters ending Dec. and March. Mr. Mustard has had a College training and Mrs. Mustard has been trained as a nurse, and is good at teaching calisthenics.\n\nThe Board decided to ask the Department to make a grant of $75. a month for the two quarters. We had to offer them $100. a month with the use of our Mission house and pay for their transportation with supplies to Kitkatla. They went the early part of this week. Rev. R.W. Gurd went with them to introduce them. As Mr. Gurd assured the Board that from March to October the village is practically deserted we only engaged Mr. & Mrs. Mustard for the two quarters.\n\nIt appears that the Conservative Association had recommended the teacher for the Massett school, but when we arranged with them we understood that the teacher of last year had returned, which is correct, though since we have heard that he may be leaving.\n\nIn order to save time I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Iver Fouger, Indian Agent, hoping that he will concur in our action as it is extremely difficult to get teachers to go to such out-of-the-way Indian villages.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H.

Mr. Gurd, formerly missionary at Kitkatla, giving the reasons for closing the school at that village.\n\nHe states that he arranged in the fall with the Indians to cut ten cords of wood for his house and the school, but when he arrived from the Skeena at the beginning of winter, found they had not done so, but still promised to get it. A succession of petlatches prevented them however. Then the whole village left for a large petlatch at Bella Bella, not returning till middle of December. Steamer did not call, and all the Indians being away (with the exception of a few sick ones) there was no one to send for wood supplies. For seven weeks Mr. Gurd got wood himself, then the teacher Miss. Gore, and Miss. Gurd being sick, he found it impossible to remain longer. They left the village on December 15th., 1913.\n\nHe is now living at Claxton, Skeena River, and does not state if they intend to reopen the school.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 6th, 1913.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, in which you recommend that the teacher of the Kitkatla School, Miss Gurd, be paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum, and in reply, I beg to say, pending receipt of further reports from this school, the Department will pay Miss Gurd from the 1st of the current quarter at the rate of $450.00 per annum, and you will be good enough to advise her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that a request has come from Rev. R.W. Gurd of Kitkatla, that the salary of the teacher be raised. I beg to recommend that it be raised to $500.00 per year.\n\nIt will then be equal to the salaries paid to the Indian teachers at Bella Coola and Bella Bella though yet way below what is paid to teachers of White country schools in this Province; in the Bella Coola valley these are paid $900.00 per annum.\n\nKitkatla is very isolated and is the only Church of England mission in this Agency; all the other schools are on Methodist mission stations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSec., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, September 2nd, 1897.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith the Report of the Kitkatla Indian Day School for the Quarter ended the 30th of June 1897, together with Requisition, in duplicate, for teacher's salary ($75.00) for the period mentioned.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

(RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\n\nIndian Affairs Dept. B.C.\nTo the Minister of Education\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter which was written by a native of this village regarding the subject of education. The letter is singularly worded, but perhaps will explain itself. I am sending it just as it was handed to me. I was not present at the meeting; it was held on a Saturday. I was too busy.\n\nBut I attach supreme importance to the subject of which it treats. Nothing in my estimation will be of such permanent value to Indians as teaching.\n\nIn fact, I see no hope for them outside the sphere of education. What is required is a school conducted similarly to one at Metlakatla, only on a smaller scale.\n\nTo me it is decidedly unreasonable as well as undesirable to compel children to go out of their own village to be taught.\n\nCould you not erect a Boarding School here, where a dozen of the brightest, most promising youths of both sexes might be boarded, taught & disciplined?\n\nThe Kitkatlas are a fine race of Indians, an sometimes called 'the Kaffirs of the Coast'. Exceedingly energetic, bright & loyal. The number of residents is about 250.\n\nThe multiplication of schools of instruction is one of the most most praiseworthy efforts put forth by the Department for the benefit of the rising generation of Indians.\n\nAnd when the Indians meet together as a body, they the Department to lift them up out...\nOf their ignorance, is a clear sign that they mean what they say that the appeal when Daniel wrote be much appreciated.\n\nThere are three things which entitle them to your kindly consideration:\n\n1. The Kitkatlas are essentially a hunting tribe. They are away for the purpose seven months out of twelve. They leave early in February for their different hunting grounds. They return for a week or two in April then leave in large numbers to hunt for seal off Bonilla Island. After which they go to the west coast of Vancouver Island for sea otter, returning to their village in September where they remain until July to see year after year.\n\nIt is obvious that most of the instruction imparted is lost on account of their being away so much from their village.\n\n2. The Kitkatlas are an exclusive tribe. They have little in common with the Indians of which family they are a branch, a chief branch.\n\nThey object to the placing of their children in schools away from their homes. In some cases, children in these schools have died there buried before their parents heard anything about them. The school nearest here viz. Metlakatla will never be any great benefit to the children of this place.\n\nI might have prevailed upon me or even to send their children at Metlakatla School, but that institution was too far to receive any more.\n\n3. The Kitkatlas are a progressive tribe. They have made considerable material progress all their old dirty narrow uncomfortable huts have been exchanged for wide spacious ones all their old dwellings associated as they were.\nOttawa, May 28, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Kitkantla Indian Day School for the month of February last, in which you state that the teacher, Henry Haldane, is not making a success of this school I beg to say that the Department has decided to dispense with his services at the end of the current quarter and you will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nThe question of continuing this school should be taken up with the Church of England authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nExtract from the Teacher's Quarterly Return of the Kitkahtla Day School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1915. Original on File 116967-2.\n\nRemarks.\n\nIn consequence of an ex-chief of the Kitkahtla tribe using his influence against the teacher, the school was closed on Friday March 26. The attendance had dwindled down to four pupils, the parents having been led to assume that the teacher was of no use to the village. The ex-chief's name is Edward Gamble. He is not residing on the reserve but in Prince Rupert where he is working.\n\nSgd. Henry Haldane,\n\nTeacher\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Kitkahtla Indian Day School for the month of February, 1915.\n\nOriginal on File 116967-7\n\nThe teacher of this school is a full blooded Indian and I was not favourably impressed with him as a teacher or with the atmosphere of the school room. I examined the children in reading and simple arithmetic and did not find them far advanced, of course this is more or less true of all Indian schools, most pupils are in the first standard. The village is very isolated and there is no missionary at present.\n\nSgd. Iver Fougnier.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 19, 1915.\n\nWith Cheque.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. Gurd, the resident missionary at Kitkatla, and one from Miss Smiley, who complains that owing to her not being able to assume her duties as teacher of the Kitkatla Day School on account of a previous appointment having been made she has suffered a loss and inconvenience and states that she considers herself entitled to remuneration for the inconvenience she has been put to.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department recognizes the justness of her claim to the extent of $75.00, a cheque for which amount is enclosed herewith and you will be good enough to forward the same to Miss Smiley.\n\nI may add that the Rev. Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, has been written to in regard to her appointment and instructed in future to consult the local agent before making any such appointments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nOn the 14th of November, last, Mr. Agent Fougner forwarded a letter from the Rev. Mr. Gurd, Church of England Missionary at Kitkatla, B.C., in which he stated that he had appointed an Indian named Henry Haldane as teacher of the day school at that place. Mr. Fougner recommended that this appointment be confirmed and that he be paid at the rate of $75.00 a month for six months. On the 26th of November, last, Mr. Fougner was informed that the Department approved of his sending Mr. Haldane to take charge of this school, but that, as he had no special qualifications, he would only be allowed a salary of $60.00 a month for six months.\n\nAfter confirming Mr. Haldane's appointment a letter was received from Mr. Inspector Tyson informing the Department that in company with Mr. Agent Perry he had interviewed Mr. School Inspector Cairns and discussed the question of the appointment of a teacher for this school and that he had instructed Miss Smiley, formerly of the Fort Simpson Boys' Boarding School, to take charge of the school at Kitkatla. Mr. Tyson was informed that the Depart-\nment had already approved of the appointment of Mr. Haldane and he was requested to communicate with Mr. Agent Fouger and, if Mr. Haldane had not gone there, the Department would approve of the appointment of Miss Smiley at the same salary as was offered Mr. Haldane.\n\nMr. Fouger writes under date of the 24th ultimo that Mr. Haldane had accepted the position and encloses a letter from Mr. Gurd, in which that gentleman states that he is more than surprised at two inspectors appointing a single lady for an isolated place like Kitkatla, where her nearest white neighbour is thirty miles away. Mr. Gurd says that he lived there twenty years himself and he considers that it would be madness to place a lady there all alone and is glad for her sake that she did not so.\n\nMr. Fouger also encloses a letter he has received from Miss Smiley, who says that she has been put to loss and inconvenience through not receiving the appointment to this school and she thinks that she is justly entitled to full salary at the rate she was promised. She says that Mr. Agent Perry thinks she should have at least a month's salary or $75.00, as she was engaged at that rate.\n\nAs the matter now stands we have in charge of the\nthe school whose appointment was authorized by the Department and one appointed by Inspectors Cairns and Tyson, whose appointment was not authorized by the Department and who never had charge of the school and who claims to be justly entitled to remuneration for services she was prevented from rendering. If the Inspectors had consulted with Mr. Fouger, in whose agency this school is situated, this difficulty would have been avoided and I think it would be well that notice should be given to missionaries, agents and inspectors that the final appointment of teachers rests with the Department. Within the last week three cases have come under my notice where these hasty appointments without reference to the Department have caused trouble and expense.\n\nThe Department cannot well avoid paying Miss Smiley something for her loss of time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jan 5th 1914\n\nSir:-\n\nRe Henry Haldane- Your letter 116967/1 Dec. 1/14.\n\nMr. Fougner informs me that Mr. Haldane has reported for duty at the Kitkatla School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nT/B\nSir:\n\nReferring to Departmental letter of 26 ultimo, I have the honor to state that, after having written to Rev. Mr. Gurd to ask Mr. Haldane to go as teacher to Kitkatla, and after having notified the Department of the same, I was informed by Inspector Cairns that Miss Ada Smiley of Fort Simpson had been appointed and asked to go as teacher to Kitkatla, by himself and Inspector Tyson. Mr. Cairns said that he simply acted on the advice of Mr. Tyson, who assumed the responsibility.\n\nOwing to poor mailservice etc., it took a long time before we could find out whether Mr. Haldane had accepted the position on conditions offered. In the mean time Miss Smiley was kept in suspense.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letters from Mr. Gurd and Miss Smiley, which make the situation clear. Miss Smiley maintains that the matter has caused her inconvenience, expense and a month's delay. She thinks she is at least entitled to a month's salary on terms agreed upon, namely $75.00.\n\nI do not know how the Department looks upon a matter of this kind; but it seems to me that her claim for a month's salary is reasonable and just.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\nMetlakatla\n\nB. 6.\n\n9th Dec 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Taqner,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 15th inst. I am more than surprised at two inspectors appointing a single lady to an isolated settlement like Metlakatla. Her nearest white neighbors would be 30 miles away. What would she do in case of personal illness? What furniture would she have? The house is absolutely empty. Who would provide her with fuel etc.? Having lived there 20 years myself, I consider it madness to place a lady there all alone. I am glad for her sake that she did not go. Henry Haldane is there & I hear it doing well. And should I hear...\nIf anything to unfit him as a teacher,\nI will communicate with you at once &\nyou may decide upon his dismissal.\n\nI have known him for 30 years &\nno doubt he has moral delinquencies, the\nsame as Mr. Sloan may have had, but so\nfar as I know lately, he has conducted\nhimself uprightly.\n\nI quite agree with you that the ap-\npointment of teachers should be in the hands\nof Agents not in Inspectors.\n\nHoping you are quite well.\n\nBelieve me\n\nDear Mr. Tougher\n\nYours faithfully\n\nP. W. Sand\nPort Simpson, Dec. 4th.\n\nMr. John Brown,\n\nBella Coola.\n\nTaylor,\n\nYour letter of Nov. 1st hand saying that Mr. Haldane's appointment had been sanctioned by the Department of Indian Affairs and as Mr. Terry is in Simpson and called today to see me, he informed me that Mr. Haldane is already there. Mr. Perry advised me to write you again and fully explain matters to you also giving me liberty to have his name written you to him when necessary. Mr. Taylor & Mr. Brown, as you already know, engaged me over the phone for the Nootka School. Mr. Davis told me by letter that he just simply asked for Mr. Taylor who had had some years of experience. I know perfectly well that both of these...\nthen acted with my best interest at least, but for all this, it has caused me inconvenience and expense and a month's delay. Mr. Carson acted me in the worst he sent me No. 20 from Bella Coola to wait here until I heard from him by letter which was not for nearly two weeks. Yours send you the wire but I could not Mr. Dyson, & explain matters to him. Of course, I took no steps during that time to secure any location, nor even after learning by letter from Mr. Carson or Mr. Dyson either, for neither of them definitely told me if he settled whether Mr. Wildman or I should go to Fort Nelson, and today is the first attempt we have had. I think that under the circumstances I am entitled to pay at the rate I was promised, and I think that Mr. Dyson should take steps to secure it. Mr. Perry thinks I should have a month's salary at the very least.\nyou care to have a copy of the work Mr. Povesh sent, you can get one from the station at Bella Coola, or may be able to get one from Mr. Povesh himself if he is within range. It is not only losing a month's salary, but also offered a good position inside of a week after accepting the school, but refused it as subjected to Bella Coola. I do not quite know how the steps should be taken to secure this, but think\n\nMr. Povesh should take the initiative, but as it is in your district, I thought it better, as Mr. Perry advised it, to write to you.\n\nIf you can help me in this difficulty, I shall be much indebted to you.\n\nLooking to hear from you and thanking you in anticipation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. W. Gurd, an Indian Henry Haldane by name was being sent to take charge of this school. The Agent was advised that the Department approved of the appointment of Mr. Haldane at a salary of $60.00 per month for six months. If, therefore, Mr. Haldane has begun teaching at Kitkatla there will be no need for the services of Miss Smiley there and suitable arrangements might be made to utilize her services at one of the day schools where a teacher is needed in the Nass Agency. You will be good enough to communicate with Mr. Agent Fouger regarding this matter and inform the Department as to which of the above named parties is teaching at this school. If Mr. Haldane has not gone to this place the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Smiley at the same salary as was offered the former.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. M. Tyson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nThe schools of the Nass Agency, in some instances, are in a very unsatisfactory condition, owing to the fact that the Anglican Church appears to have considerable difficulty in supplying teachers. On Thursday the 12th inst., accompanied by Mr. Perry, I interviewed Inspector Cairns and we discussed this question thoroughly. He accordingly instructed Miss Smiley who has been engaged at the Port Simpson Boys' Boarding School, but which is now closed, to take charge of the school at Kitkatla as the people there have neither Missionary or Teacher. Miss Smiley will be there alone, at present, with the Indians. Mr. Cairns will be in Vancouver shortly when we will again go into this question and see, if possible, that some solution of this problem of keeping the schools supplied with teachers, is arrived at.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 26, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing a communication from the Rev. Mr. Gurd, in which he states that he has secured the services of Henry Haldane as teacher of the day school at Kitkatla.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your sending Dr. Haldane to take charge of this school. As he has no qualifications, the Department can only allow him a salary of $60.00 per month for six months, the period which this school will likely be open during the year. You will be good enough to inform the Department as to the date on which Mr. Haldane began his duties at this point and you should advise him of his appointment and the amount of salary which he will receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Fouger forwards a letter from the Church of England Missionary at Kitkatla, B.C., in which he states that he has appointed an Indian, Henry Haldane by name, as teacher of the day school at that place.\n\nThis school is only open six months each year, as the Indians move away to the fisheries. The Agent recommends that the teacher be paid salary at the rate of $75.00 per month for six months on account of the heavy living expenses in an isolated village like Kitkatla. Last year the Department engaged the services of Mr. and Mrs. Maynard Mustard and paid them $75.00 a month as a combined salary. Mr. Haldance has no qualifications, but the missionary states that he is well informed and gifted with teaching ability. The highest salary paid to other teachers in this agency is at the rate of $50.00 per month.\n\nIn view of the difficulty in obtaining a teacher for this out of the way place and the cost of living there I would\nwould recommend that Mr. Haldane be allowed $60.00 per month for six months. I shall be pleased if you will inform me as to whether this meets with your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ford, formerly of Attawas.\n\nIn my reply I say that they had best go out there and open the school at once; and that I can recommend to the Department that he be paid at the rate of $75.00 for six months; but that it may not be allowed.\n\nMr. Ford has been informed that the highest salary paid teachers in this agency is $60.00 per month. Mr. Masters received $75.00 at Attawas for three months last year. I can say that living expenses at this isolated place are above the average.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBut of course you must pay him sufficient to meet rather heavy expenses in an isolated village like Kitkarlo.

Long residence on Board, have acted as layman under Bishop of Quebec & would be glad to undertake similar duties again if required.\n\nShould you desire any interview my wife & I would take a trip to see you.\n\nI believe Mr. Perry is also writing you on this subject.\nI trust I may receive a favourable reply from you & that we shall be able to come to an arrangement to our mutual advantage.\n\nYours very truly,\nGeo Geiser.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith an application from Mr. George Oliver for an Indian school. I have replied that the Kitkatla school is vacant, and that he may go out there to teach, when the Indians return from fishing. Mr. Oliver is a member of the Anglican Church, and I have advised him to see the bishop before he enters upon his duties. Kitkatla is under the supervision of this church.\n\nAs the applicant is a medical man, and Kitkatla is very isolated and an expensive place, I hope the Department will confirm the appointment, and fix the salary at no less than $75.00 per month.\n\nI have received a telegram from the applicant dated 16th instant from which I learn that he will accept the Kitkatla school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 22, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rupert Marine Ironworks and Supply Co., Limited, Prince Rupert, B.C., in which they state that they have an account against you for $166.10 for work done on your gasoline launch during September and October of last year and that they have written you repeatedly about this account, but can obtain no reply.\n\nThe Department would like you to make arrangements to settle this account as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Since that time we have heard nothing from him.\n\nThe bill is for work done on his gasoline launch during September and October last for the specific purpose of enabling him to get back to Kitkatlah to open school. Owing to the urgency he obtained a special concession on the distinct understanding that he would pay us One Hundred dollars within thirty days after the completion of the work.\n\nWe are well aware that your Department does not wish to be made use of as a collection agency but feel that you do not wish to see Government employees taking advantage of their immunity from garnishments.\n\nWe shall much appreciate anything you may do to protect us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRUPERT MARINE IRONWORKS AND SUPPLY CO., LTD.\n\nH.

It was on that understanding I accepted the position.\n\nI fear that unless you can get the Department to reconsider their decision I shall not feel myself able to remain here after the Indians go away to their fishing, for two reasons.\nFirstly everything in the Northern Country is very expensive & has to be freighted either from Rupert or Dawson. There are no other white people nearer than Rupert & consequently unless I am able to slightly save over & above what I could put away in town I see no advantage to be derived from burying myself & wife away so far from Society.\n\nSecondly I might say that I can go to any city of importance & get a position which would net me considerably over my present offer.\n\nSo far as the work & people are concerned we are contented & happy & so long as the Powers that be are satisfied with my services so long shall I remain here, provided the remuneration of $900 holds good.\n\nI have practically all the children of school age on the Register & now they are all back I am averaging an attendance of 90%.\n\nI would be glad to get a definite answer to this letter at your earliest convenience, as I am only awaiting\na favourable reply before getting the house fixed inside & out & before putting up wire fencing & preparing the grounds for spring.\n\nYours very Sincerely\n\nGeo Oliver\n\nGeo Taunger Esq,\nBella Coola\n13-6\nExtract from letter from Agent Fougner in reference to the Kitkatla School dated October 21, 1915.

Mr. Beam Beep\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe 116964/1\n\nAmount of $225.00 to hand today.\n\nI beg to say that when I received my cheque on May 20th, I mailed one to the Rupert Marine Co., covering most of the account spoken of.\n\nThe Co.'s complaint was that they had written me twice & never got any reply, but as I explained to them, it is not advisable to give letters to the natives for delivery as\nThey are liable to be lost or forgotten, and in their case neither of the communications had been received by me.\n\nYours truly,\nGeo Oliver\nOttawa, June 19, 1917.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Mr. Oliver, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day school, for an increase in salary I beg to say that he is now paid at the rate of $75.00 a month for the actual time he is engaged in teaching. Judging from reports received on his work I consider that he is well entitled to be paid an annual salary of $900.00.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, who visited this school in April last, says that he has an excellent education, is managing to interest the parents and pupils in the school and there is evident progress along all lines. The pupils are learning the English language rapidly and are making a marked progress in number work. Mr. Cairns also states that Mr. Oliver is a remarkably practical and efficient, that he works for results and attains what he works for, that he is needed in the village and he hopes that his services may be retained.\n\nThe Department is furnishing a house and fuel.\nfuel for a number of teachers who are not half as efficient as Mr. Oliver.\n\nMartin Benson\nJune 15th, 1914.\n\nDuncan Scott Esq.,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have taken the liberty of writing to you personally rather than through the usual channels, which I employed on two other occasions, in order to put my application before you.\n\nI have been teacher at this village for 2 years and am receiving remuneration at the rate of $75 per month for the period of the actual teaching months, namely 9 or 10 as the case may be.\nThe object of this letter is to ask you to increase my salary to \u00a3900 per annum.\n\nI base my request on the following facts:\n\nI believe the Dept. to be satisfied with my work as Teacher, judging by Mr. Carson's attitude. The Natives themselves are also very pleased with the progress made.\n\nI have not only the children of School Age on my register but am teaching a class of infants numbering 13 or so.\n\nBishop du Vernet, for whom I do the missionary work gratis, has on several occasions expressed himself very pleased with the social...\nand religious progress made during my residence.\n\nOver and above the school work I do the dispensing & medical work, which has greatly reduced the number of really serious cases of illness.\n\nI have set the example of garden culture & poultry keeping which influenced the natives to take up these pursuits last year on a small scale. This year they are going in more heavily.\n\nMrs Oliver & myself have a very personal influence over the natives as we have made it our business to ingratiate ourselves with them.\nSo much for the work, the quality of which I will let you judge for yourself sir, or reference can be made to Mr. Touguer, Mr. Gairns, Bishop du Vernet, and a number of people in Prince Rupert.\n\nI wish to point out to you sir, that this place is 50 miles from our Post Office + Stores at Prince Rupert, without any communication from or to the outside except by our own Gasoline Launches. Thus the cost of living here is far greater than elsewhere. We have to pay Prince Rupert prices which are about 25% higher than Vancouver or Victoria and over and above\n5. This figure the freight to Kitamaat costs approximately $16.00 per trip if I use my own launch or 50\u00a2 per parcel if goods are delivered by the natives.\n\nThere is no house provided consequently I have to pay rent, neither is fuel provided for my own use, this item costs me about $60.00 p.a.\n\nThus you will see that as a married man it is a real struggle to get along on the present basis.\n\nWe have no white residents nearer than Prince Rupert.\nI have tried to augment my salary by getting work for myself on my boat during July Aug & Sept but have met with no success as no one seems to require a man for so limited a period. The companies require one to start in May & continue till October.\n\nI notice that at Masset (where the school is larger) that the Dept pay $900 p.a., plus house and fuel and an assistant part of time.\n\nThereafter paying rent $120, fuel $60 it only leaves a net income of about $540 or $44 per month.\nMay I ask you, Sir,\nto consider the above statement & if you are satisfied that the nature or the work & the circumstances contained herein warrant the increasing of the remuneration, I dare hope that you will see your way to advising the Department to make the adjustment.\n\nI am aware that you are an exceedingly busy man and I have endeavoured to make this as brief as possible but at the same time to lay all the facts before you, therefore I must ask you to overlook the fact that I have been unable to keep\nThis letter under seven pages.\n\nI wish to thank you for any effort which you may make on our behalf.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nGeo Oliver\nRupert Marine Ironworks and Supply Co., Ltd.\n\nEngineers, Machinists and Machinery Contractors\n\nWorks, Office and Warehouse on own wharf.\n\nP.O.

General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am desirous of leaving this Northern country for reasons enumerated below and as Mr Oliver and myself both wish to remain servants of your Department I thought it best to put the matter before you and to ask for your kind consideration of the case which I will state as briefly as I can.\n\nAs Agent Touques jurisdiction is only over this Northern part of B.C., I conclude that it is in order to write to you direct instead of putting the correspondence through his office.\n\nI am expecting him to visit here shortly, however, I will then tell him that I have written to you.\n\nThis particular Reserve, as you no doubt know, is by its geographical position without any protection from the fearful storms which are peculiar to this locality during the winter months, added to which the rainfall locally is extremely\nheavy and these two climatic con-\nditions have seriously affected my\nhealth.\n\nI have been suffering this last\neighteen months or so from Bronchial\nCatarrh and last December I was\nextremely ill with Bronchitis + but\nfor my wife's splendid nursing\nI should not have recovered.\n\nI have however entirely got\nover this sickness but have no wish\nto repeat the experience.\n\nWe shall have four or three\nyears here this coming September\nand we are beginning to feel the\neffects of the isolation very much.\n\nThere are no whites nearer than\n45 miles (Prince Rupert), no mail\nservice + no communication with\ncivilization except by our own\ngasoline launch which we are\nunable to use during the winter\non account of the storms.\n\nWe have had no visit from\nanyone either missionary boat or\notherwise since the Agent and\nSchool Inspector paid us a\nvisit last April (11 months ago).\n\nIn the Summer we are of\ncourse entirely alone from June to\nSep or Oct; but even then we are\nnot able to go away visiting because\nonce before the house was entered\n+ things stolen.\nThis isolation has affected us both so that we have become cranky; as the saying is, from the want of having some of our own kind to visit occasionally.\n\nWe like the work we are engaged in & would be sorry to leave the Service, for this reason I ask you if you could possibly transfer us further South, into the interior, or back East.\n\nDuring my residence in Canada I have never been troubled with any throat, chest or lung complaint until living in Southern B.C.\n\nShould you not have a vacancy for Scholastic work you may have some other position at Ottawa or elsewhere which I could satisfactorily fill as I am fairly versatile on the part with statistical, accountancy & executive work.\n\nI have not yet mentioned to his Lordship the Bishop my wish to leave here and shall not do so until I have a reply from you.\n\nI am acting for him in the capacity of Lay Reader & have charge of this Village.\n\nShould you desire to have an interview with me in respect to this appeal it would give me\nmuch pleasure to come to Ottawa and call on you at your office, at the end of the School Term, or at your instructions I could leave the School in Mr. Oliver's charge (seeing that the attendance is light, many pupils now being absent with their parents at the hunting camps) and visit you at an earlier date.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of a favorable consideration\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Sir,\nYour obedient servant\nGeo Oliver\n(Teacher & Dispenser)\nOttawa, January 22, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to request that you will be good enough to instruct Mr. George Oliver, teacher of the Kitkahtla Indian Day School, to forward his quarterly return for the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st, last, as soon as possible.\n\nThis teacher has given the Bank of Montreal, Prince Rupert, a power of attorney covering his salary and the manager of that bank has made enquiries as to when he can expect to receive a cheque for the amount of salary due.\n\nAs salaries of teachers of day schools cannot be paid until their quarterly returns have been received, you should see that the returns from this school for the two above named quarters are forwarded at once, in order that a cheque for the amount of salary due can be sent the bank.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nMr Benson\n\nWill you please let me have some particulars regarding the man-age-salary qualification sheets?\n\nA.M.\nMEMORANDUM, Mr. Scott,-\n\nIn regard to the application made by Mr. George Oliver, teacher of the Kitkatla School, for a transfer to some less isolated locality I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Cairns' reports on Mr. Oliver's work while in charge of this school since September 1st, 1915, are most favourable. He states that Mr. Oliver is a born teacher, is remarkably practical and efficient and that he works for results and attains what he works for.\n\nMr. Oliver is a married man, about forty years of age, with an excellent education and was formerly a medical student. I might mention that Kitkatla is fifty miles from the nearest post office.\n\nIn one of Mr. Cairns' reports, made a year after Mr. Oliver took charge of the school, Mr. Oliver was said to be in good health vigorous and active.\n\nMr. Oliver has been in receipt of $900.00 from the first of March of last year, his salary having then been raised\nfrom $750.00.\n\nIf a place could be found for Mr. Oliver I think he would an acquisition to any school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Oliver states that the climate at Kitkatla has seriously affected his health.\n\nIt has been informed that the Department would be prepared to grant his request, if a vacancy arises at any school to which he could be transferred and he has been instructed to communicate with you in regard to the matter.

Mr. Inspector Cairns is being written to and asked if he knows of any such school and you might communicate with him in regard to the matter. It will not be necessary for you to come to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeorge Oliver, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nKitkatla Indian Day School,\nKitkatla,\nVia Prince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, June 20, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 12th of April, last, in which you were informed that the Department would accept the services of Mr. and Mrs. Gray as teacher and field matron for the Lakalsap Indian School after the return of the Indians to the reserve in September, next, I beg to say that since then the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, who were teacher and matron respectively at Kitkatla, has been received, and Mr. Agent Fougner now recommends that the Rev. Walter A. Gray and his wife should be sent there to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Oliver. It is presumed that this is the Mr. Gray referred to in your letter of the 28th of March, last, and who was recommended by Bishop DuVernet for the Lakalsap school.\n\nAs it is not the wish of the Department to dispense with the services of Miss Sturges and Miss Capper, who hold the positions of teacher and field matron at Aiyansh, where there is at present no building available for school purposes, owing to the owner having decided to remove it, the Department agrees with you that it would be well to transfer them to Lakalsap, where there will be vacancies if the Grays are sent to Kitkatla, and Mr. Agent Fougner is being informed that the Grays may be placed in charge at Kitkatla, where they are anxious to go. He is being requested to advise you of their acceptance of these positions, at the same rate of salary as was paid the Olivers.\n\nC. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nAs soon as you receive word from Mr. Fougner that the Grey's have accepted this offer you can notify Miss Sturges and Miss Capper of their transfer to Lekalsap. You should advise the Department of the date of their transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the teacher at Kitkatla has resigned his position; this means that the field matron (his wife) will also leave the place.\n\nI have received inquiries about these positions from Rev. Walter A. Gray B.A., a returned soldier who served two years in the Ambulance Unit. He is recommended by Bishop De Vernet and is no doubt well fitted to serve as teacher.\n\nHis wife has had some nursery training and holds first aid and nursing certificates. She has no children and would no doubt be qualified to serve as field matron.\n\nThe field nurse has been paid at the rate of $35.00 per month at Kitkatla, for six months of the year. The applicant inquires if this salary could not be increased to come up to what field matrons are paid at other places.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nI have the honor to report that lately there has been a most regretful misunderstanding existing between the natives at Kitkatla and Mr. & Mrs. G. Oliver, teacher and field nurse, respectively.\n\nMr. Oliver has resigned and will leave the place. It was his intention that his resignation take effect at the end of present quarter. He had to close school April 18th, for lack of attendance. Now he asks me in the letter enclosed whether he ought not have the resignation take place on May 1st. This I desire that the Department decides; it is simply a question of paying or not paying him salary for the balance of the term.\n\nMr. Oliver's letter together with his report for quarter ended June 30th, are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nKuttnarka\nPrince Rupert\nMay 6th 1918\nB.C.\n\nJver Haupner Esq.\nIndian agent,\nBella Coola.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn 19th & 22nd past month the was not school attendance everyone away gathering food.\n\nThey are back now but some are away hunting.\n\nOwing to the fact that whooping cough is very prevalent in the village & that anyhow the attendance would be small I think that it would not\n2. We propose to reopen school this month. I trust this suggestion will meet with your approval.\n\nPerhaps under the above conditions it would be advisable to have my resignation date from May 1st but that is of course for you to decide.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have delayed somewhat in replying as I expected to hear from Mr. Oliver regarding his desire to change to a drier climate.\n\nAt present I know of no vacancy in the dry belt. After the holidays there may be a position that would be suitable. If there should be, I shall notify him.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Gains,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nReferring to your letter of 5th instant, I have the honor to report that I have just received a letter from Bishop Du Vernet of Prince Rupert, in which he states that Mr. & Mrs. Johnson arrived at Prince Rupert on Oct. 30. The influenza was then so violent at Kitkatla that they could not go out there to open the school.\n\nThe next day Mr. Johnson was down with the disease, and then Mrs. Johnson became ill. As she was nursing a small baby, and there was no room in the hospitals, she was in a very sad plight.\n\nThe bishop states that the Johnsons were also worrying about their hotel bills and hopes that the Department will pay these. Under the circumstances I trust the Department will give earnest consideration to the sad plight of this yeoher and family. I have written the bishop accordingly. Kitkatla is 250 miles from Bella Coola, and communication is difficult.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 27, 1918.\n\n168-E\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you state that from information received by you that Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, who were offered the positions of teacher and matron, respectively, at the Kitkahtla Indian Day School had not left Vancouver to take up their duties at this point.\n\nIn reply I have to ask you to inform the Department, as soon as possible, thereafter, of the date on which they begin work at Kitkahtla. It is hoped that they have accepted the offer made and have begun their work before this date. If not, and you are aware of their address, you might correspond with them and ascertain whether they intend to accept and the date on which they will arrive at Kitkahtla.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB.

From Inspector Cairns I hear that the Johnsons had not left Vancouver October 28. They have been informed as to the living house, and in reference to boats they have also been informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Dep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa November 13, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in regard to the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson as teacher and field matron at Kitkatla I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Cairns in which he states that he made no arrangements with them in regard to salaries nor fares, but he now recommends that Mr. Johnson receive the sum of $900.00 per annum \u2014 teacher and that Mrs. Johnson receive the sum of $210.00 for her services as field matron from November 1st to May 1st.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to inform Mr. Johnson that he will be paid at the rate of $900.00 per annum for his services as teacher of this school and that Mrs. Johnson will be allowed $210.00 for her services as field matron for the six months from November 1st to May 1st.\n\nMr. Cairns also recommends that their transportation from Vancouver to Kitkatla be paid, on condition that they remain two years in this work. The Department has decided, however, that, if they remain at this school for one year, at the end of that time one-half of the amount they expended for their transportation between these two points will be refunded to them. When they have completed a year's work at this point you will be good enough to forward a voucher in the usual way for half the amount of these charges, when the same will be paid. If they remain there for another year the balance of the amount they expended for their transportation will be refunded to them. Kindly inform them accordingly.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Inspector that the Department supply the teacher of this school with wood. You are hereby authorized to purchase the necessary wood for the teacher's use for the coming winter.

Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson as teacher and field matron at Kitkatla and making certain recommendations in regard to the salary to be paid them, etc.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 17th ultimo Mr. Agent Fouger wrote the Department stating that he had received a telegram from Mr. Johnson, dated the 16th ultimo, saying that he would leave for Kitkatla early the next week.\n\nThe Department has decided to carry out your recommendation in regard to the salaries to be allowed and Mr. Fouger is being informed that Mr. Johnson will be paid at the rate of $900.00 per annum for his services as teacher and that Mrs. Johnson will be allowed $210.00 for her services as field matron for the six months from November 1st to May 1st.\n\nIn regard to your recommendation that their transportation from Vancouver to Kitkatla be paid, on condition that they remain two years in this work, I beg to say that, if they remain at this school for one year, at the end of that time one-half of the amount they expended for their transportation will be refunded to them and, if they stay there for another year, the balance of the amount they expended for this purpose will be sent. Mr. Fouger is being instructed to advise them accordingly.\n\nThe Agent is also being authorized to purchase the necessary wood for the teacher's use for the coming winter.\n\nRev. R. H.

Stewart,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nYour letter of Oct. 25 re the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson to the positions of teacher and field matron at Kitkatla came to hand in due time.\n\nI may say that I had nothing to do with the appointment of these two to the village of Kitkatla. I met Mr. Johnson in Vancouver. He asked me about the positions. I told him that Mr. Agent Feugner had the matter in hand and that I was leaving the city for some weeks.\n\nWhen I returned Mr. Johnson phoned me that he was going to Kitkatla, having been appointed by Mr. Feugner. I made no recommendation nor had I anything to do with the appointment. You will therefore see I made no arrangements concerning the salaries nor the fares.\n\nMr. Johnson called at my Office on Monday Oct. 28 to say that they were leaving that night by the Grand Trunk Pacific boat. They went and I presume they are in Kitkatla, ready to open school today. I think that was their intention when they left Vancouver.\n\nRegarding salaries and fares, I thought that would be arranged between Mr. Agent Feugner and Mr. Johnson. However, I could judge from your letter that has not been done. I would therefore make the following recommendations:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\n(1) That Mr. Johnson receive the sum of $900.00 per annum as teacher.\n\n(2) That Mrs. Johnson receive the sum of $210.00 for her services as Field Matron from Nov. 1st to May 1st, being six months.\n\n(3) That the transportation from Vancouver to Kitkatla be paid on condition that they remain two years in this work. Should they wish to leave at the end of one year then one-half the expenses be paid.\n\n(4) That the teacher be supplied with wood by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

A letter has also been sent to Bishop Du Vernet of Prince Rupert. I can recommend the applicants, and as Inspector Cairns has done the same I take it for granted that the Department will confirm the appointments. I shall ask Mr. Johnson to go to Kitkatla and open the school there. No doubt the Indians have now returned from fishing, and are waiting for the opening of the school. It will be noted that Inspector Cairns says that travelling expenses will be paid by the Department, as Mr. Johnson states in the letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n1336 - 10th Ave East\nVancouver BC\nOct 1st 191\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nBella Coola\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, I have heard that the positions of teacher and field matron to the Indians at Kitkatla are vacant, and as Mr. Douglas informed me that he has recommended my wife and myself for the respective positions, I wish to make formal application to you for same.\n\nMr. Cairns informs me that Mr. Matthews who applied for the position some time ago, has since accepted a school in the Fraser Valley. On that account I advised him to write to you in connection with the positions.\n\nI am a trained teacher and have had a good deal of experience both in the old country and here, although at the present time I am superintending the Mail Order Dept. & the Woodward Dept. Store, of this city. My wife and myself both prefer\nan outdoor life and as teaching is more to my liking than Commercial work, I should be glad if you will give us the opportunity of filling the positions at Kilkatta. We are both musical and have one boy, a few months old.\n\nMr. Burns mentioned also that the Dept. would pay our fares & transportation charges. However, as he has gone to arrange for a boat for a trip we could arrange for that. Is the house at Kilkatta furnished? And do the boats call every month or is there any set service to the island? Mr. Douglas has written at your suggestion to Bishop Du Vernet and we await his letter.\n\nIf you find everything satisfactory and can arrange to have us go little, I would be obliged if you would wire me collect. Yours truly,\n\nR.R. Johnson\nAugust 26, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that you have heard nothing of Mr. and Mrs. Gray, who were applicants for the Kitkahtla school, since July 8th.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Fougner advised the Department on the 5th instant that he had had a conversation with Mr. Gray at Ocean Falls and that he declares that he has been stationed at Ocean Falls and cannot accept any position with the Department at present.\n\nMr. Fougner was asked to communicate with the church authorities with a view to obtaining the services of a teacher for this school.\n\nThe Department would be glad if you would also try and obtain a teacher for this school.\n\nRev.

I may say that I have heard nothing of Mr. and Mrs. Gray who were applicants for the Kitkahtla School since July 8th.\n\nAt that time Mr. Iver Pounger, Indian Agent for the Bella Coola District, wrote me as follows: \"The Reverend Mr. Gray inquired about the Kitkahtla positions for himself and wife. He is not likely to accept as there is a better opening for a Field Matron at Lakalasp, better from a financial point of view.\"\n\nAs the Agent had the matter in hand I did nothing further. However, if it is the wish of the Department, I shall be pleased to make an effort to fill these positions by suitable persons. Whoever is sent to this village should be Protestants and if possible English Church adherents.\n\nIn my opinion it will not be possible to get a man and his wife who will render efficient service for less than $900.00 and $300.00 per annum. Besides this they should have free fuel and a free house provided.\n\nThere is a vacant Mission House that could be gotten for a nominal rental from the Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

W. A. Gray and that he cannot accept any position with the Department at present. Mr. Fougner is, therefore, being instructed to communicate with the church authorities with a view to obtaining a teacher for the Kitkatla School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C.

Walter A. Gray, B.A., who is recommended by Bishop DuVernet.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the wish expressed by the Grays to go to Kitkatla, the Department will accept their services on the same terms as were paid the Olivers, viz.: $900.00 per annum for Mr. Gray and $35.00 a month for six months for Mrs. Gray. Kindly advise the Department as to whether Mr. and Mrs. Gray accept this offer or not.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough also to inform Mr. Agent Perry of their acceptance of this offer, as it had been decided to place the Grays in charge at Lakalsap, and, if they go to Kitkatla, Miss Sturges and Miss Gapper, who are at present at Aliyansh, will be transferred to Lakalsap.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

You will, therefore, be good enough to forward vouchers, properly certified, and upon receipt of the same the question of making some arrangement for the settling of their hotel bill will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nIver Founger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB.

O.

R. Johnson, the teacher, dated May 17th, last, to take effect from that date. It is regretted that Mr. Johnson could not remain at least until the end of the present school year, namely, June 30th, next.\n\nAs you point out in your letter of the 17th of May that, owing to the nomadic habits of the Indians of this village, as well as those of Kitselas and Hartley Bay, there is very little likelihood of there being any attendance of the Indian children worth reporting about until the first of October, next; and it would hardly be advisable to re-open this school until that time, when it is hoped that the services of another teacher can be secured.\n\nYou should bring the matter of securing a qualified teacher for the Kitkatla School to the attention of the Inspector and the church authorities, and it is hoped that a teacher can be obtained, to begin duties when the Indians return to the village, about the first of October, next. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicants should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nA return should be forwarded from Mr. Johnson, showing the attendance and days taught during the current quarter, in order that the amount of salary due him can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nExtract from Agent's report on the Kitkatla School for months of March and April, 1920. Original on 116967-7\n\nThe resignation of Mr. Johnson has been received dated May 17th, but to take effect at once without the customary notice. Mr. Johnson gives as his reason the indisposition of his wife who does not appear to be able to get used to the isolation of reserve life.\n\nChas. C. Perry\nAgent\nSir,\n\nIn my report on the Kitkatla Indian Day School for the month of May last, I gave the Department the names of Neera Kent and Giggle, two likely applicants for the position of teacher for this school. The names were suggested by His Grace the Archbishop of Caledonia. As I have heard nothing as to this recommendation, I would like to be informed as to whether the Department is able to consider the suggestions offered by the Archbishop.\n\nI have written to the Inspector of Schools for British Columbia with a view to obtaining from him any further suggestions for this school, in connection with which a matron is also required.\n\nThe difficulty attending the appointments for Kitkatla is that there is only active work for a teacher and matron for five months out of the year. Both His Grace Archbishop Du Vernet and Rural Dean T.W. Rushbrook are on the lookout for suitable persons for this village, but up to the present they have not been able to find them.\n\nUnder the circumstances mentioned, would you be kind enough to let me know what the Department considers\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nconsidered it would be able to offer in the way of salary for the period mentioned, duties to commence October 1st next, and to terminate March 31st 1920 and each season onward. It does not seem reasonable to me to have the Department pay two salaries at the usual monthly rate for the whole year when only five months' work is done by the appointees.\n\nI would suggest that the Department offer $100.00 per month and bonus of $20.00 for a teacher, and $50.00 per month and bonus of $20.00 for a matron, both to engage for five months in each year. This would save the expense of fuel for the whole year, and workers thus appointed would be free to engage in work at the canneries as book-keepers etc. during the summer months. The Kitkatla Indians are scattered during this period, and it would be difficult to have a matron and teacher follow these Indians to the canneries.\n\nI will await your further instructions before making any offer to prospective applicants.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nSkeena River Agency, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, September 26, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the questionnaire forwarded by you regarding George Oliver.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is unable to furnish answers to the questions asked.\n\nI may say, however, that Mr. Oliver was appointed teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School in the province of British Columbia on September 1st, 1915, and remained in that position until he resigned on April 30th, 1918. The reports received on his work were satisfactory. For information regarding his character I would refer you to Mr. Iver Founger, Indian Agent, Bella Coola, B.C., who recommended his appointment to the Department and who had oversight of his work during the time he was a teacher in the Indian school service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kent and Giggle, the husband to act as teacher and his wife to perform the duties of matron, or, if it is impossible at this date to secure the services of either of the above, you should endeavour, after consultation with the church authorities, to obtain the services of a man and his wife who would be suitable to carry on the work.\n\nIn view of your report that there is only active work for a teacher and matron for five or six months, namely, from October 1st till the following March 31st in each year, as the Indians are away from the reserve, the Department agrees with you that expense would be saved in salaries, fuel, etc., if the school were closed for the balance of the year.\n\nA salary at the rate of $100.00 per month will be paid for the services of a qualified teacher, together with a bonus at the rate of $12.50 per month during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools, and for the matron a salary at the rate of $80.00 per month and bonus of $12.50 per month, both teacher and matron to be on duty six months in each school year between the above mentioned dates.\n\nIt is hoped that the services of a qualified teacher and his wife, who will be able to perform the duties of matron, will be secured in time to re-open this school on October 1st next. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nsecured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. You should give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nOn August 28th last, you wrote me by letter No.11667/7 to the effect that the Department could approve of either of the two nominees of His Grace the Archbishop of Caledonia for the then vacant position of Indian day school teacher at Kitkatla. These were Messrs. Giggle and Kemp. Upon receipt of your communication, I got into touch with the Archbishop and also with the nominees of His Grace referred to, with the result that I found Mr. Giggle had gone to England, and Mr. Kemp was not able, through sickness, to accept the vacant position.\n\nSince that time I have been in touch with the Church authorities and also with Mr. Calhoun, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, hoping that suitable persons may be found to take charge at Kitkatla. The Misses Cooper and Turner, who were formerly at Lillooet, Skeena River, would have been willing to go to Kitkatla, but they would not accept the terms as outlined in your letter above referred to.\n\nRev. Dr. Rushbrooke, representing His Grace Archbishop In Vernet in the latter's absence in the Diocese, has nominated and recommended Mr. W.J. Convery for the vacant position of Indian Day School Teacher at Kitkatla. Mr. Convery taught at Skidegate Indian Day School some time ago and was well recommended by Mr. Indian Agent T. Leary of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Mr. Convery has a High School Certificate. As he is the best and only man that has up to the present been found for this village, I have asked Mr. Convery to Kitkatla to teach, subject to the Secretary's approval. This man has some knowledge of simple medicines and first aid work and will be willing to do this kind of work after school hours for a small consideration.\n\nThe Department has offered a salary of $100.00 per month, plus $12.50 house, for a teacher, and $40.00 per month, plus $12.50, for a matron. It was thought that a married couple could be secured for this work. I would recommend that since suitable persons cannot be obtained married, as desired, Mr. Convery be appointed on trial at $125.00 per month. He should be provided with fuel and light. He would be expected to pay his own rent for the use of the Mission House, which would be very small.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department cannot allow any salary in excess of $100.00 per month, with bonus additional, but will also provide fuel. Payment at the above rate is the highest amount of salary granted to teachers in Indian schools. I would point out that Mr. Connery has no professional qualifications.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase the fuel required for the school and teacher.

Mr. and Mrs. Daimpre left for Kitkatla on the 25th of October and will commence their new duties on the 1st of November.\n\nArrangements were made with Archbishop DuVernet for the use of the mission house at Kitkatla in return for Mr. Daimpre's help in looking after the church services in the village. He will also look after the sick and dispense simple medicines, a supply of which will be given to last during the winter.\n\nMrs. Daimpre holds several American certificates for teaching and taught school at Harrop, B.C., from October 1921 to April 1922 at a salary of $108 per month.

He informs me that he is at present negotiating with a man who will be acceptable to the Department as well as to the Church authorities. As it is desired that a married man should be appointed, whose wife can carry on field matron's work among the Indians, I should be in favor of deferring the appointment, if necessary, until the right man can be found, as a single man is not desirable for this place.

Arrangements are being made with the Church authorities for the selection of a teacher to succeed Mr. Coffin and I will write further as soon as a suitable teacher has been found to take up the work.

If the services of such are secured, possibly his wife would be prepared to do work along field matron lines, or, at least, assist her husband in dispensing medicines when required. As there is no missionary resident at this point, and no one capable of dispensing medicines, the appointment of a teacher who would take an active interest in the welfare of the Indians would be very helpful to them in a general way.\n\nIf the services of a properly qualified married teacher are secured, whose wife would do work along field matron lines, salary will be allowed at the rate of $1000 per annum for this service, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. You should take this matter up with the church authorities under whose auspices the school is conducted with a view to obtaining a married man as suggested above. Early action should be taken, in order that the appointment can be made in time for the teacher to take up duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. L. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

It appears that there is no missionary resident amongst them; there is no one to dispense medicines to them, and they are far from a doctor.\n\nIf the new teacher is a married man, possibly his wife would be prepared to work along field mission lines or at least assist her husband in dispensing medicines when required.

Royce\nAccountant.\nThe Kitikmeut Indians, being anxious that I should visit their village before the spring season of people for hunting and trapping, I was able to make the trip on the 4th. This village is very much out of the way, being situated on a remote island about fifty miles north of Prince Rupert. The people depend almost entirely upon hunting in the winter and salmon fishing in the summer, for their living. They are not as progressive as other Indians in the Agency, in fact - this being my first visit - I was struck by the neglected appearance of the place. There being no resident Missionary, the people have no leader to encourage them along progressive lines. I found a few cases of sickness, especially among the children, without medical aid beyond what the people are able to do for themselves. The School Teacher does not understand the dispensing of medicines, and is, therefore, not supplied with any.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Sgd.) W.H.

Mr. George Coffin, the Teacher of this School has informed me that he does not intend to take up the work again. I should, therefore, be glad to hear from the Department with regard to the appointment of a new teacher for this village.

You might inform the Church authorities under whose auspices the school is conducted accordingly.\n\nWe hope that it will be possible to secure a married man who would be qualified to carry on the classroom work, and that, in view of a higher salary being paid him than has been previously allowed, his wife would undertake to perform, to some extent at least, the duties of field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This may be due to the fact that Mr. Hooper, being an elderly man, is not up-to-date with regard to his methods of teaching, with the result that there has been a falling off in the attendance.\"\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of January 12th, 1926, and the Department's reply thereto of the 19th of the same month, relative to the temporary appointment of Mr. Hooper as teacher. I should be pleased to have a recommendation from you as to whether you would advise that the services of Mr. Hooper be continued after the end of the present school year or not. This information should be forwarded at an early date, as, if it is decided to dispense with Mr. Hooper's services, due notice should be given him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Cairns, Esq.,\nNo. 5 Winch Rd.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Cairns:\n\nI have to thank you for your very kind, and encouraging letter of Nov. 26th/26; I did not tell you in my last, that I am working here under an handicap; as several Indians showed their surprise at my being here, on their return from the Canneries; as they were expecting to find the old teacher here, (Mrs. Dampre). This month they have had a meeting in one of their houses, and made a cash collection, and will try to get her to come back; the Parents have never really stood behind me, in sending the children.\n\nThe Indian Agent was here January 20th, and spoke to them about the poor attendance; and told the newly elected Police, they should make that one of their duties, to look after truants; so that this week, there has been a better attendance; So one day, when every seat is full, & was occupied, so that I cannot have more than that number; my daughter in Vancouver, is sending me the regulation Corrective Strip, and I think I shall have to use it, as some of the older ones, are getting unruly; and if I speak to them, and then talk down the room, they make ugly faces behind my back.\n\nI have already been asked by more than one, how much longer, I am going to stay on the Island; and I just simply say, I do not expect to be in Rupert before next June, and then they go away.\n\nThe Summary for October to December 1926 is as follows:-\n\nOctober 30 on Register, 51 on Ave., 8.275. 4.25 - 6.15 on only Ave., 2.15.\nNovember 20 on Ave., 12 on Register, 2.25 - 4.15 on Ave., 2.15.\nDecember 30 on Ave., 15 on Register, 2.15 - 4.15 on Ave., 2.15.\n\nOn Ave., 2.15 On Register 10. 45 School Days, Attendance, 100%.\nI boy up in 2 days in Oct. 1st, 3 days in Oct. 1st, children may since Oct. 1st. Several did not return until December - so you know how that pulls down the average attendance. I gave 6 Rewards for best attendance; 1 Girl 2s Bible; 2 Boys 2s Pennies, 3 Juvenile Picture Books sent Church in Vancouver, sent me 3s Miss socks, which I, at Fr. Rupert Dec. 23 till Jan. 16th. - but I gave them to the children on Jan. 2lst; they seemed pleased.\n\nMrs. Dampre stays at the Ivanhoe Hotel; her husband is at the Anglican Theological College, Hard Rd.; you might be able to find out their plans, for after Easter 1927; as he may be ordained then.\n\nI have no wish to quit a month's notice; and God helping me I will hold it down as long as my health does not fail.\n\nYou can see from above the Islanders, are looking for something else; and speak of me as the Old Man, not as Teacher; hence the children do not show very great respect.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n\"Roger Hooper.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\n205 Winch Building,\nVancouver B.C., March 28, 1927.\n\nJ. D. Holman, M.C.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nThis acknowledges the receipt of your letter of March 14th, 1927, No. 168-18-1, having reference to the Kitimat Indian Day School.\n\nThe following are the facts of the case:\n\n1. It is evident from the letters on my file that Mr. Edgar Hooper's appointment was not permanent.\n2. The report of Mr. Agent Collison would seem to indicate that the Indians are losing interest in their school.\n3. You will perceive from the enclosed copy of a letter sent me by Mr. Hooper that he also is somewhat discouraged and seems to have lost the confidence of both the parents and pupils.\n\nHaving in mind the welfare of the pupils of this Indian village, I would respectfully recommend that Mr. Hooper be asked for his resignation. This resignation to take effect on or before June 30th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. H. Cairns,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of British Columbia.\nJuly 23, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nI understand that there is in the establishment a position of Field Matron in the Skeena agency. I have examined this file, and I find that, during the last few years, there have reached the Department recommendations concerning field matrons at Kitkatla and Fort Essington. The Fort Essington situation is being relieved, apparently, by appointing the school teacher as dispenser at $50 per annum.\n\nI shall be glad to learn if the wife of the Kitkatla Indian Day School teacher could be appointed field matron, at a salary of $25 per month - the salary, of course, to be paid from B. C. Vote. Mr. Indian Agent Collison has recommended that a Mrs. B. Shearman be appointed. Her husband is the new day school teacher at Kitkatla.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 5-E-822 of the 15th instant, with reference to the Kitkatla Indian Day School. In reply I telegraphed you today as follows:\n\n\"Reference your letter fifteenth Department approves appointment Mr. B. Shearman teacher Kitkatla School $90 per teaching month. Mrs. Shearman appointed field matron salary $300 per year.\"\n\nI may add that there will be the usual allowances of fuel and light. Please give Mr. Shearman every assistance as he commences his new duties. You will receive a separate communication regarding the field matron's activities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Shearman teacher\nKitkatla School Ninety Dollars per teaching month STOP\nMrs. Shearman appointed Field Matron salary Three Hundred\nDollars per year.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\n\nChg. Dept.\nI have received an application from Mr. Shearman for the position of teacher at the Kitkatla Indian Day School. His references, copy of which is enclosed, seem to be satisfactory, and are endorsed by the Bishop of the Diocese. Mrs. Shearman is prepared to do field matron's work, and as I am anxious to have the position filled being in such an isolated place and difficult to fill, I would recommend that the application be approved.\n\nAs Mr. Shearman is also undertaking Sunday church work for which he will receive a small remuneration from the Anglican Church authorities I would suggest that in view of his teaching experience that he receive a salary of $800.00 per annum (for the ten teaching months) and his wife $25.00 per month for field matron's services, making a total of $1200.00 per annum with the usual allowances of fuel and light.\n\nMr. Shearman is at present residing at Nelson B.C. and as travelling expenses for himself, wife and two children will be heavy, he has asked for a grant towards transportation. If his application is endorsed and this can be done, I shall be glad if you will reply by wire as I am anxious to secure Mr. Shearman's services without delay.\n\nReferring to your letter of March 13th (168-18-8) I am forwarding under separate cover, a plan for the proposed teacher's residence at Kitkatla.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nW.E.C.

Your recommendation that the salary of James Maguire, who was appointed temporarily as teacher, be paid at the rate of $80 per month, as he is not a qualified teacher, is approved. It is further noted that Mr. Maguire began duties on December 3rd last. A cheque to the amount of $80, in payment of one month's services, will be sent him in your care under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith quarterly report on the Kitkatla Indian Day School ending December 31st.\n\nOn account of the difficulty of finding a suitable teacher in time school was opened during the month of December only. Mr. Maguire arrived at Kitkatla on November 28th and opened school on December 3rd. Not being a certificated teacher I would recommend that his salary be paid at the rate of $80.00 per month instead of $90. as approved in official letter 108-18-1, dated Dec.17/28.\n\nI visited Kitkatla on January 15th and inspected the school on the 16th and 17th. The attendance was fairly good and progress made by the pupils satisfactory considering the comparatively short time they attend school in the year.\n\nI have already written regarding school matters at this village with certain recommendations which, if they can be carried out, will I think improve conditions as far as school and field matroncy work are concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is approving of the temporary appointment of Mr. J. Maguire as teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School. Mr. Maguire has no professional qualifications, but the Agent states he has had some experience in teaching in mission schools and that his services would be satisfactory for the winter months. The Department is allowing him salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Clines, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n205 Winch Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, December 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your report for the months of October and November, last, relating to obtaining the services of a teacher for the Kitkatla Indian Day School, it is noted that Mr. J. Maguire has been appointed to take charge for the winter months. It is also noted that he has had some previous experience. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining a teacher for this school, the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Mr. Maguire, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. It is hoped that he will meet with reasonable success in the work, and I have to request that you will give him any assistance you can. Please inform the Department of the date on which he began duties.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Cairns of the approval granted for the temporary appointment of Mr. Maguire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Maguire who has had some experience in mission schools has been appointed, subject to the Department's approval, to take charge for the winter months. As before stated, this is a most difficult place to fill owing to its isolation and other drawbacks.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 8, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your report for the month of June last, on the Kitkatla Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. F. C. Freeman, the teacher, has resigned. It will, therefore, be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher for this school for the next school year, and I shall be pleased if you will endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher. If the Church authorities are still interested in the work at this school, you should consult them with a view to obtaining a qualified teacher. If you are unable to secure a teacher through them, it might be well to consult Mr. Inspector Cairns. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher recommended should be forwarded for the approval of the department.\n\nYou should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that, if possible, a teacher can be obtained to begin duties on or about September 4th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Owing to the difficulty in obtaining a teacher for this school, the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Mr. Freeman, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, from the 1st instant. It is hoped that Mr. Freeman will meet with success in the work, and I shall be pleased if you will give him any assistance you can.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Cairns of approval having been granted for the temporary appointment of Mr. Freeman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In reply I beg to say it is noted that Mr. Price-Green has no professional qualifications, and we could not approve of his appointment unless it is found impossible to obtain a teacher having the necessary professional qualifications.\n\nYou should take up with the Church authorities the question of obtaining a qualified teacher who could also carry on missionary duties if same would be required by the Church. The Department would be prepared to pay a reasonable portion of the salary allowed provided a qualified teacher is obtained. Please take this matter up as soon as possible and endeavour to have the Church authorities nominate a suitable incumbent for the position at Kitkatla. You should inform the Department as soon as possible of the arrangements you have been able to make with the Church authorities for the obtaining of a teacher and full particulars should be given regarding the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by them.\n\nIf a qualified teacher is secured, could not arrangements be made with the Church authorities for the use of the mission house for a residence for the teacher?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W.F. Rushbrook who has the oversight of the church work at Kitkatla, and Mr. Green would, no doubt, receive a nominal salary from the church authorities for carrying on the church services, and would have the use of the mission house to reside in.\n\nThe Kitkatla Indians are demanding a properly trained teacher, but unfortunately, the Department has no teacher's residence at this place, and up to the present time, the teacher has had the use of the mission house which is the only available residence at Kitkatla.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC JJ.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As a first-class teacher certificate, I further understand that this\nis the only form upon which an objection is likely to be raised. I would greatly appreciate it if you could use your influence in any way to help me get further work.\n\nI am a schoolteacher now, having served overseas with the Red Cross Women's Service, and am fairly in tune now.\n\nMy future wife does not have a teacher certificate, but I understand she was always one of the classes in the school in my town, and she assists me.

I consider that for the amount of school work carried on by him Mr. Shearman's salary is adequate, and would rather suggest that a further sum of $5.00 per month be given for his work in connection with dispensing drugs and looking after the sick which duties are rather exacting at times.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.C.

Ramden, Revelstoke, B.C., making a claim against you for payment of a balance due him to the amount of $31.15. The Department hopes that you will give this matter your early attention and make payment of the amount mentioned from your salary as teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School for the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sherman, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, while the Department has no authority to enforce settlement of your claim, we are writing Mr. Sherman and requesting him to arrange settlement of his indebtedness to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. H. Ramsden, Esq.,\nBox 29, Revelstoke,\nB.C.\nThe Department of Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. B.L. Shearman is at present teaching at Indian Day School at Kitkatla, Nr. Prince Rupert. When he was resident in Nelson, B.C., he was in financial difficulties and to help him out I guaranteed payment at the Bank of a note. This is over a year ago, and I have long ago paid same for him.\n\nHe has been promising to pay this, but have only been able to get one or two small payments from him, and this still leaves him owing me $31.75.\n\nThere is no way of attaching the salary of a government employee for some ridiculous reason, and as this man appears to be taking advantage of his position, I would kindly ask you to either have this amount deducted from his salary or at least give him notice that he has to pay his just debts.\n\nAs I am in need of this cash, I would appreciate any action you take on my behalf.\n\nMight say that the last payment I received from Shearman was in February last for $3.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File S21-1, part 1)\nDear Dr. Scott:\u2014\n\nI received your letter with regard to the balance of account owing by Mr. Bert Sherman, teacher at Kitkatla, to Mr. Stork. The man has been very hard pressed for money having literally nothing of either money or furniture when he arrived. I took the matter up with Mr. Sherman and he has promised to pay the $40.00 owing as soon as possible.\n\nWith regard to the weather at Ottawa, we are also having it cold here and as we had little or no summer last year we are looking forward to a better season this year. With kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6397, File 821-1, part 1)\nApril 29, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Collison,\n\nMr. Fred Stork has just called upon me and informed me that Mr. Bert Shearman, the School Teacher at Kitkatla, owes him $40.00. Mr. Stork stated that you were kind enough to say that you would endeavour to have this paid. I wish you would tell Mr. Shearman that we expect him to pay these personal accounts and that I would be glad if he would send you the money. When you receive it you can pay it over to Mr. McClymont, who is Mr. Stork's agent in Prince Rupert.\n\nI hope you have had a good winter. We are very glad to have some likelihood of good spring weather, as the month of April has been very backward.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, November 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Mr. Bert Shearman, teacher and missionary on the Kitkatla Indian Reserve, submitting the resignation of Mrs. Shearman, the matron, on account of the living accommodation provided.\n\nIn connection with the accommodation, I would refer you to your letter of July 27th, last, and the Department's reply of August 12th. The Department regrets that there are no funds available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year to erect a residence, but it is hoped that funds can be provided in our Estimates for the next fiscal year, and I shall be pleased if you will draw this matter to the attention of the Department in April, next. The question of obtaining an adequate water supply should be reported on by you at the same time.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the appointment of Mr. Shearman as dispenser of drugs and first aid work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. F. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith, Mrs. Shearman's field matron's report for the month of September.\n\nOwing to unsatisfactory conditions in the mission house at Kitkatla, Mrs. Shearman found it impossible to remain and her husband submitted her resignation\u2014which is enclosed.\n\nWith regard to the water supply, I would state that a water tank is provided at the mission and same had been emptied on the departure of the previous teacher, hence the Shearmans were obliged to obtain water from the village well until a supply of rainwater was available. As previously stated, until better accommodation can be provided it will always be difficult to obtain the services of a competent teacher for this place.\n\nMr. Shearman is remaining in charge of the school. As he has a knowledge of first aid work and the dispensing of drugs and is prepared to carry on this work, I would recommend that his salary be supplemented by \u00a320.00 per month. The people being entirely cut off from medical aid, I would urge that this assistance be given.

Please consider my application for the school in exchange with the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nI attended the Fairrose Normal School in 1918-20 and hold an Alberta Second Class Certificate. In addition to the above certificate I received two certificates for attendance at the B.C. Provincial Summer School at Victoria - \"Teaching Primary Grades\" and \"Aural and Indian Schools\".\n\nI had six and a half years' experience in public schools on the prairies, part of that time being spent in the St. Paul's Indian School, Cardston, Alberta, and I taught one year at Hazelton Indian Day School, B.C.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.H.

Shearman, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School and Mr. M. H. Lawrence, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, exchanging schools.\n\nSince writing you on the 6th instant, the Department is in receipt of a letter from Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, in which he states that this exchange of schools meets with the approval of Mr. Mortimer and yourself.\n\nThe Department has no objection to these teachers exchanging places but I would point out that the salary provided for the teacher at the Kitkatla Day School is at the rate of $900 a year and, at Hazelton, the salary rate is $850 a year.\n\nIf Mr. Shearman goes to Hazelton, he can only be allowed salary at the rate of $850 a year, while Mr. Lawrence will be allowed salary at the rate of $900 a year if he takes charge of the Kitkatla School.\n\nAs both these schools should open on the 4th proximo, the matter of exchanging places is left to the decision of Mr. Mortimer and yourself. Please advise the Department before September 10th if the teachers mentioned exchange schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

Lawrence (Hazelton School) exchanging places.\n\nI would point out, however, that the salary provided for the teacher at Kitkatla is at the rate of $900 a year and at Hazelton the salary rate is $850 a year.\n\nThe Representative of the Treasury states that, in order to comply with present regulations, it is not possible to increase the paylist. Consequently, if the Honourable the Superintendent General approves of the exchange of schools, two courses are open:\n\n1. Mr. Shearman can be allowed $900 at Hazelton and Mr. Lawrence, $850 at Kitkatla.\n\n2. Mr. Lawrence can be allowed the $900 salary for Kitkatla and Mr. Shearman reduced to $850 for Hazelton.\n\nI may add that the higher salary has been paid in the past at Kitkatla, due to the fact that it is a larger school than Hazelton and is situated in a more remote place.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, August 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. B. Shearman, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School, in which he states that, with the approval of His Lordship Bishop Rix and yourself, he is being transferred to Hazelton.\n\nThe Department has received no correspondence regarding this transfer. Please let me know at once if you recommend Mr. Shearman's transfer to Hazelton, and, if so, you should at the same time forward the name and qualifications of the teacher whom Bishop Rix desires to nominate for appointment at Kitkatla.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lottin, Esq., Indian Agent, Skeena River Agency, also with Bishop Ric. I handed my resignation (to the Indian Agent) as Teacher at Kitkatla Indian Day School. I was sorry to understand that Bishop Ric has communicated with you, also with Capt. Horning, Indian Agent at Hazelton B.C., re my transfer to the Indian Day School at Hazelton B.C., duties to commence 1st of September. I am thankful for the change. Kitkatla is so isolated, and I have worked successfully & unsatisfactorily there alone for 5 years, that the return to family life with educational facilities for my two girls is most welcome. I shall endeavor to do my best for the natives generally & raise their status in any way I can, as I believe I have done good work at Kitkatla. Any details of my work & results I am sure will gladly be given by.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you are not satisfied that a decided improvement has been made, you should draw the matter to the attention of His Lordship Bishop Rix towards the end of the present school year, with a view to the nomination, by His Lordship, of a fully qualified teacher to replace Mr. Lawrence at the beginning of the next academic year.

M.H. Lawrence's transfer from Hazelton in the Babine Agency, I would state that the school is not up to its former standard of efficiency. Whilst Mr. Shearman, the former teacher, was particularly well adapted for teaching a school of this kind, this should not account for such a poor showing as I found. Mr. Lawrence does not appear to have control over the children with the result that things are not entirely satisfactory. I advised Mr. Lawrence that better results would be necessary should he wish to retain his position as teacher of the school.\n\nW.

B. Shearman from Kitkatla to Hazelton.\n\nThe Bishop of Caledonia had arranged to transfer the Hazelton missionary, who also teaches school at that place, to Kitkatla. On approaching me on the matter, I informed him that upon receipt of Mr. Shearman's resignation, the position at Kitkatla would become automatically vacant, and the missionary at Hazelton could apply in the usual way. If his qualifications were satisfactory, I would recommend the appointment to the Department.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Shearman's resignation to take effect on August 31st.

This report shows that very little progress is being made and it is felt that it would be in the best interests of the work to secure the services of a fully qualified teacher.\n\nThe Department would, therefore, appreciate your giving this matter your kind consideration and nominate a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school on September 1st, 1936.

I regret that Mr. Lawrence is reported as an unsatisfactory teacher. It was my impression that he had been doing good work.\n\nI shall send him a copy of your letter and put it up to him to make a better showing. He has taken summer school work at Victoria under the Inspector of Indian schools for the last two years, which should have been valuable to him. If the Inspector, upon his next visit, does not find sufficient improvement to recommend his retention, I shall make an effort to replace him.\n\nI may as well be frank and say that the report of the Inspector who sees a school for a few hours once a year, and not always that often, should hardly carry the same weight as the opinion of one who is personally and intimately acquainted with the work being done, and who is intensely interested in the welfare of these people.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

INSPECTOR BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KITKATLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL. DATE OF INSPECTION MAY 13, 1936.\n\nName of teacher: Rev. M. H. Lawrence.\n\nThe Rev. M. H. Lawrence was trained at Camrose Normal School, and holds an Alberta Second Class Interim Certificate. He states that he has had some six years experience in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. He was at the Hazelton Indian Day School for a year, and was moved to his present position in September 1934 on the nomination of the Right Reverend Bishop Rix of Prince Rupert.\n\nMr. Lawrence attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria in 1934 taking courses in Primary Work and Indian & Rural Problems. In 1935 he took a course in singing at the same summer school.\n\nA very complete report was made on this teacher last September. He does not appear to have improved in any respect. I do not consider that he will ever make a successful teacher. He simply does not know how to teach or control a school, and nothing that I have been able to do has made any difference. Mr. Lawrence would not appear to be in possession of any permanent standing as a teacher in any Province after some eight years experience in four Provinces. I understand that this man is being removed from his present position at the end of June, and it is, therefore, useless to make any further remarks with regard to his lack of professional knowledge. I do not consider him a good influence in the village and would ask that he be excluded from residence in an Indian village in B.C., after he gives up his present appointment at the end of June. It is very difficult to understand why Mr. Lawrence was ever permitted to take charge of an Indian school in B.C.\n\n* * *\n\nDuring my inspection of the work, Doctor McQuarrie carried out a medical inspection of the children. He asked me if I minded him sending home a number of the children who were very dirty. I considered that as Medical Officer he might do as he wished. The teacher afterwards said that the Doctor had sent home THE BEST READERS. Some of the children left in the Intermediate Grades made me feel quite ill with dirty habits, a girl blowing her nose in her dirty dress, ETC.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Collison was also present for part of the inspection.\n\nThe school itself was in a satisfactory state, floor having been recently washed I believe, but the pupils were anything but clean. To make it possible to have the children clean at least their hands and faces, I have recommended the teacher requisition a wash basin, two towels, a bucket for water, and a drinking cup.\n\nI drew Mr. Indian Agent's attention to the fact that the fine set of Hiproads Readers supplied to the school last September were in a terrible state, just falling to pieces with pages all out of order, Etc. Little or no care has been taken of the material supplied.\n\nPossibly as the teacher is leaving it will be sufficient to state that the present standing of this school is \"Very Poor\". The teacher's control is nearly hopeless.\nCOPY SENT TO MR. COLLISON.\n\nOttawa, May 30, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of November 8th, 1935, and official reply of November 21st, with reference to the teaching services at the Kitkatla Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your nominating as soon as possible a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on September first, next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Goodreid, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian day school, has submitted his resignation effective June 30, 1939.

At the same time, you might also discuss with the Agent the desirability of obtaining the supplies necessary to proceed with an elementary course in manual training for boys and a course of instruction in knitting, sewing and crochet work for girls. If you do this, the whole matter will be very carefully and sympathetically reviewed when the Agent's report reaches the Department.\n\nI note, also, your reference to literature on the subject of vocational training. I may state that it is my intention to investigate this matter more fully, in an attempt to obtain elementary textbooks, if such textbooks are available.\n\nI desire to thank you for your letter and for the information contained therein.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

It stands on one of the poorest sites in the village, but the site is surrounded by houses and is within a few yards of high water mark. The school is too small, so far that the foundations are gone and its last coat of paint only barely remains.\n\nWith regard to vocational and manual training, the girls should be taught sewing and knitting, and the boys wood work. This can be started as soon as a grant is given, or arrangements made for special instructions.\n\nIt would possibly be of real assistance to teachers in isolated places like this if some literature on this work was more available. If there are no elementary textbooks, reports or suggestions for teachers will, I think, be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Barry, to Kitkatla. An inspection of the Day School was carried out and other matters attended to. The Rev. G. H. Goodreid and his wife have been appointed to this village. Mr. Goodreid takes charge of the school, and it is hoped, Mrs. Goodreid, who is a trained nurse, will be appointed Field Matron. This matter was referred to the Department in previous correspondence. There were few people in the village at the time of our visit, most of the Indians being still away putting up their winter supplies of dried salmon. It is a matter of regret that Mr. Goodreid holds no Canadian certificate.\n\nW. E.

The children were slow and not up to standard. There are too many double desks, which are a detriment. However, I think that possibly the fault lies with the teacher. A certified married teacher is required there.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nPrince Rupert, B.

Mr. Goodreid is approved, and he will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nEnclosed is Staff Questionnaire, which you should have him complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYou should make arrangements with Rev.

C.\nSir:\n\nIn compliance with the Department's request dated June 22nd, 168-1-G-1, for information regarding the qualifications of the teacher nominated by the Bishop of Caledonia, for the Kitkatla Indian Day School, I quote as follows from the Bishop's letter received today at this office.\n\n\"The Rev. Geo. H. Goodreid had a teacher training in Bradford, England, and was employed as a teacher in the government schools there. Since coming to Canada he has, along with his theological training, taken a partial course at the University of Saskatchewan. He is recommended as a man of more than average ability. He is 28 years of age.\n\nAs a field matron, Mrs. Goodreid has the qualification of being a graduate nurse from the City Hospital, Saskatoon, Sask. She is 24 years old.\"\n\nThe Bishop has requested the appointment of Mrs. Goodreid as field matron. In view of the fact that Kitkatla is more or less isolated, being 45 miles from Prince Rupert, the nearest place where medical assistance could be obtained, I would endorse the application, and recommend Mrs. Goodreid's appointment at a salary to be approved by the Department.\n\nIf the appointments are satisfactory to the Department, I shall be glad to be advised at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nReid Lake, B.C.\nAug 5, 1947.\n\nMr. J Earl Anfield\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield,\n\nMr. Cecil Caster passed me your recent letter last evening. Mr. Campbell and I have been looking over the places in need of teachers and are unable to decide just where we would be of the most service.\n\nMr. Campbell has had no teacher training and only a grade school education; however he has traveled a great deal and read extensively. He has homesteaded in Saskatchewan and here in British Columbia. The past three years we have been out together carrying on Vacation Bible Schools in isolated districts. He enjoys the work with the children and is a great help to me.\n\nWe are not sure just what his duties would be at Hartley Bay and whether he has had sufficient education for the duties required.\n\nI graduated from Deering High School Portland, Maine in 1910 and from the Portland Training School for Teachers in 1911.\n\nThat fall I accepted a position as Primary\nteacher in Yarmouth, Maine and remained there for four and a half years when I resigned to accept a position in the city of Everett, Massachusetts. I held this position for five years until my marriage when I again resigned.\n\nDuring the time of my teaching, I took summer courses at Gorham Normal School, Gorham, Maine, and at the State Normal at Hyannis, Massachusetts, also a course offered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Board of Education, Dept. of University Extension, on Methods of Teaching English to Immigrants.\n\nI hold a Life Certificate for Maine issued at Augusta, Maine Aug. 1918 and was on leave of office in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter my marriage I taught for four years in rural schools in Saskatchewan and for one term on a Temporary Certificate here in British Columbia, until the Board could find a permanent teacher.\n\nI am enclosing copies of letters written by members of the School Board in Yarmouth, Maine to Mr. Whitney, Superintendent of Schools in Everett, Massachusetts, and a letter from Mr. Whitney written at the time I left Everett.\n\nWith the exception of my work in the rural schools in Saskatchewan, I have taught lower grades entirely and for that reason the school in Ajannah appeals strongly to me as I much prefer the\nwork in the Primary Grade.\n\nMr. Campbell would like to be of real service to the community to which he goes to the position at Hartley Bay. Appeals to him if you feel that his many years of experience in farming on the prairies and working in the lumber and trapping in the north country would be sufficient for the work required of him.\n\nSeveral years ago Miss Margaret Fraser wrote me asking if we would be at all interested in coming to Kitkatla. Of course Mr. Campbell would be unable to take the upper grade work there, and I am really a Primary teacher. We have heard of Jane Victoria and her work and it would be nice to work with her.\n\nWe both feel that knowing our training and experience and the needs of the different places there that you will be far more able to decide just where we could be of the most service. We are both willing to go wherever you think best if you still need our service.\n\nI suppose it would be necessary for me to write to Victoria at once for a Temporary Certificate.\n\nWe will greatly appreciate it if you can let us know definitely, at an early date, just what your decisions are as this move necessitates closing our home and disposing of some stock and it will soon be Sept.\n\nHoping that we may hear from you as soon as possible, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNellie Campbell\n\nMrs. George H.

She has the unqualified love and respect of both parents and pupils and her classes are always above the other grades when they enter grammar school.\n\nShe has a special knack in making the work interesting to the pupils and the extra work she does in this direction is considerable.

Lauchlan\nActing Chief Treasury Officer.\nEducation: In common with other isolated areas, this Agency is facing a serious problem in staffing the day schools this coming fall. The Anglican nominating body has stated they are unable to do anything about securing teachers for the Sitlakdumix (2) Greenville (1) Kincolith (1) and Kitkatla (2) Day Schools this fall. In addition there are vacancies at the Hartley Bay (1) and Port Simpson (2) schools under United Church auspices. Port Essington is also vacant, but negotiations are proceeding with a view to having these pupils attend the white school on a contract basis. Metlakatla, Port Edward (2) and Gwaiihaa (1) Day Schools have teachers returning this fall. (retiring or returning)\n\nF. E. Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nThe Director, Indian Health Services, Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: H. A. Procter, M.D.\n\nFurther to our conversation regarding medical matters in this Agency, it is recommended that a full-time Field Matron be established at Kitkatla Indian Reserve located some 42 miles south west of Prince Rupert. The population of this village according to our latest figures is 336. This village is fairly isolated during the stormy winter months when a large percentage of the people are usually in residence. It is estimated that 80% of the population are in residence for seven to eight months each year. There is a complete exodus of the population to the canneries for the summer months and the village is deserted. The physical plant at this village consists of a 40 year old one-room day school and an ancient mission house, the ownership of which has never been completely clarified as between the Church and the Department. There is an urgent need for a new two-room school and teacherage at this village and it is suggested that when these plans are drawn the new plant should include a dispensary and nurse's quarters.\n\nIf two unmarried teachers are secured for this school this coming fall, it is possible that a Field Matron could be accommodated for this winter though it would make for cramped quarters in the present teacherage (Mission House). Rather than have your Branch build a separate dispensary and nurse's quarters, it is recommended that conference ensue between your Branch and the Indian Affairs Branch as to the aforementioned combination unit which should adequately serve the needs of this village for many years. It is also of importance that communications be made available from this village to the Medical Officer, Dr. Macdonald, and this can best, in my opinion, be brought about by the installation of a radiophone on a rental basis similar to that now projected for Port Simpson and the Nass River.\nThis village has been neglected in the past from a medical point of view and the tuberculosis incidence is, in my opinion, higher than in almost any other village of comparable size in the Agency.\n\ncc. Dr. J. A. Macdonald.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 6th, 1947.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the Kitkatla Indian day school. No provision was made in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school at this point.\n\nYou realize when preparing our appropriation we had a very large number of applications for new schools and it was simply impossible to consider all of them. We are building several schools this year and have given priority to places where there are no school facilities at all.\n\nWe hope to be able to continue our programme in subsequent years and we are noting for the year 1948-49 the necessity for a new two room school at Kitkatla.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttached please find a couple of snaps taken at Kitkatla on my last patrol to that village. I went there to install a new Council and was met by the entire juvenile population of the village bearing banners as shown in the snaps. There were 63 children in the group, only 40 of whom have been able to go to school in a 50 year old building with one teacher who is also field matron. Forty-three of these children have not seen the inside of a school this academic year.

The situation at the Crosby Girls Home at Port Simpson is difficult but it is recommended that the school be re-opened next term, and a new staff appointed.

It is understood, also, that Mr. B. Shearman will again be in charge of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. R. Shearman, teacher of the Kitkatla Indian Day School, in which he strongly protests against the decision of the Department to only operate the Indian day schools for a nine-month period during the academic year 1940-41.\n\nDue to conditions at present confronting us it was found necessary to make a drastic reduction in our appropriation for Indian education for the current fiscal year. As a result it was only found possible to provide salary for teachers of Indian day schools for a nine-month period. In circular letter issued to you some months ago we suggested that the day schools be closed for the month of September. However, we have no objection if the day schools are kept open during that month but closed for another month between September 1, 1940, and March 31, 1941. Our reason for making this statement is that, as you are aware, the fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 and as the day schools have now been open for three months of the current fiscal year, namely, April, May and June, there remains in our appropriation only sufficient funds to pay for six months' salary between September 1 and March 31.\n\nWhile it is regretted that this decision involves a loss of salary to Mr. Shearman you should point out to him that all Indian day school teachers in Canada will be affected in a similar manner. You might advise me later whether the Kitkatla School will be closed for September or for some other month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFrom Rev. J. Shearman\nKitkatla Reserve\nvia Prince Rupert B.C.\n\nApril 28th, 1940\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment for Indian Affairs\nOttawa. (The Kitkatla School)\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed by the Indian Agent for this Skeena Agency, that schools will be closed until Oct 1st. On this Reserve it is a grave injustice. On May 9th, 1940 Captain Barry, the Indian School Inspector on his visit here, took this matter up with me. We went through figures together and he said that he should not report that this School be closed. I had 23 at School last September, & doubtless this Sep shall have more. My heart & interest is centred upon helping all Indians in any way I can from day to day. For many years, and even before Captain Barry was appointed Inspector, I have always had worthy reports on my work, and kindly cooperation with the natives.\n\nFurther I have had schools with over 60 children & worked them satisfactorily since founded on the one salary of $90. There are schools\nwith not so many children, where there are two teachers, and cases where teachers with far less experience than I have, getting $120 monthly.\n\nIt would be a precious loss to me if the months salary of $90. Were I away, an isolated island Reserve in the Pacific, and have two grown girls, one just starting her career as nurse & the other finishing Grade XII at High School, Vancouver. This is of great moment, for I have to sacrifice much as it is for them; what I would do, at the loss of a month's salary I do not know.\n\nI trust you will kindly give consideration to my school to be kept open to Sep; years ago I have opened as early as Sep 6th, with a satisfactory attendance.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for a reply,\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nB. Shearman\nDear Sir,\n\nNow my wife and I are transferred from Kitwanga (Baltin Agency) to Kiskatla (Steena Agency) to take over. Sep. 2, 1924, I beg to ask of you a favour. We have no mail service at the isolated place of Kiskatla, and must depend upon natives getting mail on an order from me, when they go in to Rupert. The same thing applied when we were there from 1924 to 1934.\n\nTo save unnecessary delay and loss, will you kindly forward all cheques - due from Kitwanga and onward from Kiskatla, to the Manager of the Bank of Commerce\n\nPRINCE RUPERT B.C.\n\nThanking you in anticipation\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nB.

Shearman has been transferred to the Kitkatla Indian day school at a salary of $900.00 a year.\n\nIn writing to the Department on June 28 recommending this transfer His Lordship, Right Reverend Bishop Rix, stated that he was endeavouring to obtain a suitable teacher for the Kitwanga school.\n\nI have not heard from him in the meantime and I am, therefore, writing to him again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Cases Humane, B.C. Certificate, also a list. Cases Manitoba Humane. I attended summer school in Victoria in 1927 and in 1928.\n\nIf I took charge of one of your schools, it would be necessary that I accept one where a residence is available, as my position as a teacher involves the responsibility of taking care of my two-year-old daughter \"home-schooled\" for my first year old daughter over 3 years old.\n\nThis is a little of curiosity rather than one of application, until I know more of conditions in any of the districts where a school might be available. Could I have particulars regarding wages, fuel available, etc. of any nearby situations you may have?\n\nThank you for any information you may give.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Mrs) Mary Anna Hutchinson\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6397)\n\nFile 820-5, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1912 - 1938\n\nFile 820-5, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1942\n\nFile 820-5, part 3\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1943 - 1949\n\nFile 820-11, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitamaat School -\nVocational Training. 1941 - 1950\n\nFile 821-1, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nGeneral Administration. 1889 - 1935\n\nFile 821-1, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nGeneral Administration. 1936 - 1949\n\nFile 821-3, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1912 - 1947\n\nFile 821-5, part 1\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1926 - 1935\n\nFile 821-5, part 2\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1936 - 1948\n\nFile 821-5, part 3\nBella Coola Agency - Kitkatla School -\nBuilding Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1948 - 1950\nProvince of B.C.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED Sept. 30th 1912\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Miss M.J.

Report dated\nFebruary 20th, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 168-18-7.\n\n\"The average Indian parent, not being\npossessed of a timepiece, absentee pupils often\nexcuse themselves by saying that they do not know\nthe time. To remedy this, I would recommend that\na good bell be supplied for the school as, at\npresent, there is none.\"\nOttawa, March 14th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the month of January, last, on your inspection of the Kitkatla Indian Day School, in which you recommend that a bell be supplied in order that the Indian parents, who do not possess timepieces, can have their children in school on time, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the supplying of a suitable bell for the purpose. You should obtain prices from several dealers for the supplying of a school tower bell of approximately 22\" in diameter, with the necessary bell rope, etc. We are not aware as to the names of the firms in British Columbia from which a bell of this type can be obtained, but, no doubt, any school supply house will keep same in stock. When this bell arrives, you should have a suitable stand erected near the school on which to place the bell. The cost of the bell and the erection of a stand for same should be kept down to the lowest possible point. Please forward properly certified, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should give the matter of the purchase of this bell and its installation your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 14, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe understand that you have on hand a school bell ordered by Mr. C. A. Arthur, Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta., which order he subsequently cancelled. I have to request that you will arrange to ship this bell to Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C., for the use of the Kitkatla Indian Day School. Please prepay freight charges, and forward your account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the bell, with receipt for freight charges attached, to Mr. Collison. We are informing Mr. Collison of the order having been placed with you to ship this bell, and requesting him, upon receipt of the bell, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have an acknowledgment of this order, stating date when shipment of the bell goes forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. J. H. Ashdown Co. Ltd.,\nCalgary,\nAlta.\nOttawa, March 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to our letter to you of today's date, authorizing you to purchase a bell for the use of the Kitkatla Indian Day School, I now have to request that you will cancel this order. We find that a duplicate order was placed for a bell for another school and there is consequently a bell on hand at Calgary which can be forwarded to Kitkatla. We are, therefore, giving the necessary instructions to have this bell shipped addressed to you at Prince Rupert, and when it arrives, you should arrange to have it taken to the school and a suitable stand erected near the school on which it could be placed. You should forward properly receipted vouchers for any expenditure incurred in freighting this bell to the school and in the erection of the stand for same.\n\nWe are ordering this bell from the J. H. Ashdown Co., Ltd., Calgary, and the account covering the cost of same will be sent to you. Upon receipt of the bell, you will be good enough to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E.

(RG. 10, Volume 6397, File 821-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, December 3rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your reports for the months of September and October, last, on the Kitkatla Indian Day School relative to the condition of the present school building and the need of new desks, I have to say with reference to the providing of a new school building that the Department is not making provision in its Estimates for the next fiscal year for the funds required for this purpose. We are, however, providing an amount to erect a teacher's residence.\n\nRelative to the supplying of the new desks required, I have to say that you may place an order with the Tait Pipe & Foundry Co., Ltd., Vancouver, to supply the sizes and number of each size of single school desks and front and rear seats required. For your information I may say that this firm manufactures desks in the following sizes:\n\n| Size No. | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| No. 1    | Adults      |\n| No. 2    | Pupils 15 to 16 Years |\n| No. 3    | 12 to 16   |\n| No. 4    | 9 to 13    |\n| No. 5    | 6 to 10    |\n| No. 6    | 4 to 7     |\n\nIt would be well to consult the teacher and ascertain the number of desks of each size that would be satisfactory to accommodate the pupils. If the desks are arranged in rows, there should be a row of the same size desks with a front and rear seat. You should arrange for the purchase and delivery of the number of single desks required at an early date.\n\nThe price charged by the above firm should be F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school, and you should request them, in forwarding their account to you, which should be in duplicate, to include the freight charges and sales tax in the cost of the desks. When the desks have been delivered, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. B. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB.C.\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INDIAN AGENT W.E.
