After a few months the teacher, a certain Mr. Nicholas transferred the Sonomas School to the Shuswap Indians Reservation, abandoning it after a few weeks' trial, not, I understand, for want of children of school-age, but because the Cowichan Christian Indians being Roman Catholics absolutely refused to send their children to a school taught by a teacher of the Methodist persuasion.\n\nW.H.

Clifford Lipton,\nMinister of Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nSome time ago there was an Indian school at Somers conducted by Methodists. This school received government aid. The Indians of this locality are largely Catholic, & understand for this reason that the Methodist school was not a success & was closed. The Catholics have had a school among the Indians there since last October & have secured an average attendance of 20 pupils.\n\nI beg to recommend\nRanaimo, B.C.,\n\nthat this school be assisted by the Government by allowing a teacher its usual amount.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 11th January, 1900.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letters of the 23rd ultimo I would say that I have looked into the question of the day school upon the Semenos Reserve. I find that the Department has estimated contribution of the usual amount to a day school upon the Reserve, and I have directed that the amount be paid to the school which is being conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, as the papers show this to be in accordance with the desire of the Indian Band.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.V.B.

R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nOttawa, February 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th ultimo, referring to the education of the Indian children on the Cowichan reserve. I have noted that there are 60 children of school age in the Quamichan, Comoxen, Kaneson, Clamslalute, Semence and Kokeliah bands.\n\nAs you may know, at one time there were two day schools for the Quamichan band, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic and Methodist churches. These were closed in 1917 and 1918, respectively, because of poor attendance. There was a Roman Catholic school for the Semence band which met a similar fate in 1910. There remains now the one Kokeliah Indian Day School, with an average attendance of about 10.\n\nI have noted that you have made a careful study of the educational needs on the Cowichan, and the Department is giving earnest consideration to your suggestions. As soon as funds can be provided, we will endeavor to build a day school on the north of the river, between the Quamichan and Comoxen bands. You might inform the Department if we own any school buildings in the vicinity and if any school equipment, such as desks and blackboards, is available. The Department's policy is to allow a church to have the supervision over these day schools, and it is thought that this school to the north of the river should be conducted under the Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nFor the requirements of the children to the south of the river, you have recommended the moving of the Kokeliah Indian Day School. In reply I wish to state that we have taken up with the Methodist Church authorities the advisability of moving their school to a point near the Kokeliah railway station. I believe it would be advisable to have it continue under their auspices. Would you give an estimate of the cost of moving this building and intimate to the Department if its condition would permit of such moving. I understand that it was erected in 1918 and is the property of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlfred H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nSOMENOS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school has been closed for sometime, but it might be re-opened under R.C. auspices as from the 1st of April, 1923, upon the recommendation of the Agent. The equipment at the old Glenclermaluts school could be used. Seven hundred and fifty was suggested as a salary.\n\nR.J.F.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER SIGNED BY REV. FRANCIS BOSHOUWERS,\nOF DUNCAN, B.C., AND ENDORSED BY HIS LORDSHIP\nTHE BISHOP OF VICTORIA, B.C., DATED SEPT. 1922.\nADDRESSED TO DEPUTY SUPT. GENERAL.\n\nOriginal on File 295667-1.\n\nMay I ask the Department that a school under Catholic auspices be built next spring on the Somenos Reserve, near Duncan. On that reserve there are today 21 (twenty-one) children of school age, all Catholic children, of those only five or six attend at times the Kokeliah school. Again, these same children are continually exposed to danger: for to reach the school they are forced to climb over half a dozen fences, cross the railway track and the railway bridge. In case of accident, who will be held responsible?\n\n(Sgd.) Rev. Francis Boshouwers,\n\nI endorse the foregoing application.\n\n(Sgd.)

Victoria, B.C., 1st May, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nThere are also some children on the Tsachteen and the Yuk-kwe-kwi-oose reserve who might be able to attend the school, though these two reserves are about two miles distant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. E. Ditchburn.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nI beg to inform you that during the present month when visiting the Indians at Chilliwack in company with the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs the Indians of Skulkayn, Yakweakwicose, Tseachten and Scowahlie Reserves requested that they should be supplied with Indian day schools.\n\nIn dealing with this matter I may say that when at Chilliwack on the 24th April, 1913, when looking into the necessity for the establishment of the day school on the Skwah Reserve, the Indians from the reserves before mentioned informed me that they also would like to have a school built for them. I informed them at the time that the establishment of more day schools in that section would depend entirely upon the success had with the school then under consideration and that if I found that a good average attendance was kept up in this school and it was impossible for the children of their reserves to attend the one on the Skwah Reserve I would consider the advisability of recommending one for them.\n\nA glance at the plan of the Chilliwack Reserves will show that Skulkayn Nos. 10 and 11, Yakweakwicose No. 12 and Tseachten No. 13 are at least three and one half miles from the Skwah village where the new day school is situated, serving as it does the Skwah, Skway, Squiala and Kwawkwawapilt villages. This school has proved so satisfactory that I am now prepared to recommend the establishment of another day school for the Skulkayn, Yakweakwicose and Tseachten Reserves.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Indians have supplied me with a list of the available pupils who are at present getting no school. This list shows that there are 28 children who should be at school of ages ranging from six to fourteen years. These children are of mixed religion, there being 17 Catholics and 12 Protestants and I would say that if a school should be established it should be an undenominational one. The Indians have promised to set aside sufficient land on one of the reserves for school grounds and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Soowahlie or Cultus Lake Reserve is still another four miles further on and on this reserve there are 14 Protestant children and one Catholic, their ages being from six to sixteen years. On this reserve the Indians also wish to have a school but the number of pupils available is not sufficient to warrant the building of a new school and teacher's residence as well. There is, however, a small Methodist church building on the reserve which might, with a small outlay, be made suitable for school purposes. The difficulty here would be to find a place for a teacher to reside in though this might be overcome by the building of a small house if a suitable place could not be found amongst the white settlers where the teacher could board.\n\nIf you are disposed to giving my recommendations favorable consideration the matter can be taken up further with the Indians and the details worked out. The Indians guarantee that if schools are established they will see that the children go to school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nReport of Inspector Ditchburn for the month of January, 1915.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report\u2014\n\nAt the Chilliwack Indian Day School on the Skwah Reserve I found a fine attendance and the register showed that the average for the last quarter had been an excellent one. Mr. Grimshaw, the teacher, is making very good progress with the pupils and I am of the opinion that the establishment of this school will be of great benefit to the Indians of the Skwah, Squiala, Skway and Kwawkwa\u0331pit bands. The Indians of the Skulkaym, Tscheachten and Yakweakwiioose, which are four miles distant from the present school are now desirous of having a day school. This matter will be dealt with in a separate report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn reports that when visiting Chilliwack in company with the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs the Indians of the Skulkayn, Yakweakwioose, Tzeachten and Soowahlie Reserves requested that they be furnished with day schools. He states that the school established at Skwah village on the Chilliwack Reserve serves the Skwah, Skway, Squiala and Kwawkwawapilt villages, but that the four reserves previously mentioned are too far away from the school for the Indians to attend. He says that there are 25 children of school age and they are about equally divided between the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches and if the Department decides to establish a school it would have to be conducted as an undenominational one. The Indians will set aside sufficient land on the most suitable reserve for school grounds and a teacher's residence. The school on the Skway Reserve is well attended and the pupils are making good progress and Mr. Ditchburn gives it as his opinion that the establishment of another school for the four northern reserves would be of great benefit.\n2.\n\nbenefit to them. In case the Department decided to give them a school a building and teacher's residence would have to be erected. Attached you will find a blue print showing the location of the reserves referred to.\n\nMr. Ditchburn also states that there is another reserve at Cultus Lake, which is too far from any school facilities and that there are fourteen Protestant children and one Roman Catholic child of school age and that the Indians have also asked for a school there. He states that he does not think the attendance would be sufficiently large at present to warrant the Department in going to the expense of erecting a building, but that there is a Methodist Church on the reserve, which might, with a small outlay, be made suitable for school purposes. The difficulty would be to find a place for the teacher to reside.\n\nI think if the Department is in favour of Mr. Ditchburn's recommendations the preference should be given to the four northern reserves and the Cultus Lake Reserve might stand for a time until it is seen what progress is made at the other school.\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 1st, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn -\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the establishment of a day school for the Indians on the Shulkayn Reserve No. 10 and No. 11, Yakweakwicose Reserve No. 12 and Tsawchton Reserve No. 13, has been referred to me. There would appear to be necessity for a day school to serve these reserves, and there are sufficient children of school age, if the mixed religion of the Indians would not interfere.\n\nI am aware that there are no separate schools in the Province of British Columbia, but notwithstanding this, I would like to have more definite information before undertaking the expenditure called for. If we established a non-denominational school in which no religious instruction would be given, would it meet with the approval of those in charge of the mission work on these reserves?\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nI would like you to look more fully into this phase of the matter before we take further action. In any event I am not aware as yet what appropriations we will get during the coming year for building purposes, and there will be time to give the matter more consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nVancouver\nTeacher's Residence\nSliammon School\n153-51\n\nclosed\n\nfrom 1/5/13\nto 1/3/15\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6037)\n\nFile 151-14-1, part 1\nBabine Agency - Old Kitzegucla School - General Administration. 1912 - 1915\n\nFile 151-20-1, part 1\nBabine Agency - Meanskinisht School - General Administration. 1906 - 1907, 1912 - 1924\n\nFile 151-20-5, part 1\nBabine Agency - Meanskinisht School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1907 - 1926\n\nFile 152-7-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Comox School - General Administration. 1896 - 1905\n\nFile 152-8E-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Quamichan Methodist School - General Administration - Plan of the Quamichan Reserves. 1895 - 1922\n\nFile 152-8C-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Somenos Methodist School - General Administration. 1897 - 1899\n\nFile 152-8D-1, part 1\nCowichan Agency - Somenos Roman Catholic School - General Administration. 1899 - 1900, 1910, 1922\n\nFile 153-5-1, part 1\nNew Westminster - Skulkayn School - General Administration - Plan of the Chilliwack Reserves. 1913 - 1915\n\nFile 153-6-1, part 1\nNew Westminster - Tzeachten School - Administration School Establishment. 1913 - 1915, 1922\n\nFile 153-7-1, part 1\nNew Westminster - Soowaklie School - Administration School Establishment. 1915\n\nFile 153-24-1, part 1\nNew Westminster - Tsawwassen School - General Administration. 1913 - 1915, 1937\n\nFile 153-24-5, part 1\nNew Westminster - Tsawwassen School - Accounts. 1913 - 1914\n\nFile 153-24-8, part 1\nNew Westminster - Tsawwassen School - Teacher's Residence. 1915\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nNew Westminster\n\nGeneral Correspondence\n\nSeachten School\nReport of Inspector Ditchburn for the month of January, 1915.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Indians of the Skulkaym, Tschaoten, and Yakweakwioose, which are four miled distant from the present school are now desirous of having a day school.

I informed them at the time that the establishment of more day schools in that section would depend entirely upon the success had with the school then under consideration and that if I found that a good average attendance was kept up in this school and it was impossible for the children of their reserves to attend the one on the Skwah Reserve I would consider the advisability of recommending one for them.\n\nA glance at the plan of the Chilliwack Reserves will show that Skulkayn Nos. 10 and 11, Yakweakwioose No. 12 and Tzeachten No. 13 are at least three and one half miles from the Skwah village where the new day school is situated, serving as it does the Skwah, Squiala and Kwawkawapilt villages. This school has proved so satisfactory that I am now prepared to recommend the\nestablishment of another day school for the Skulkayn, Yakweakwioose and Tseachten Reserves. The Indians have supplied me with a list of the available pupils who are at present getting no school. This list shows that there are 28 children who should be at school of ages ranging from six to fourteen years. These children are of mixed religion, there being 17 Catholics and 12 Protestants and I would say that if a school should be established it should be an undenominational one. The Indians have promised to set aside sufficient land on one of the reserves for school grounds and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Soowahlie or Cultus Lake Reserve is still another four miles further on and on this reserve there are 14 Protestant children and one Catholic, their ages being from six to sixteen years. On this reserve the Indians also wish to have a school but the number of pupils available is not sufficient to warrant the building of a new school and teacher's residence as well. There is, however, a small Methodist church building on the reserve which might, with a small outlay, be made suitable for school purposes. The difficulty here would be to find a place for a teacher to reside in though this might be overcome by the building of a small house if a suitable place could not be found amongst the white settlers where the teacher could board.\n\nIf you are disposed to giving my recommendations favourable consideration the matter can be taken up further with the Indians and the details worked out. The Indians guarantee that if schools are established they will see that the children go to school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. E. Ditchburn.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMarch 1st, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn -\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the establishment of a day school for the Indians on the Skulkayn Reserve No. 10 and No. 11, Yakweakwioose Reserve No. 12 and Tzeachten Reserve No. 13, has been referred to me. There would appear to be a necessity for a day school to serve these reserves, and there are sufficient children of school age, if the mixed religion of the Indians would not interfere.\n\nI am aware that there are no separate schools in the Province of British Columbia, but notwithstanding this, I would like to have more definite information before undertaking the expenditure called for. If we established a non-denominational school in which no religious instruction would be given, would it meet with the approval of those in charge of the mission work on these reserves?\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nI would like you to look more fully into this phase of the matter before we take further action. In any event I am not aware as yet what appropriations we will get during the coming year for building purposes, and there will be time to give the matter more consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Duncan C. Scott.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 30th inst., No. 153-6-1, I hasten to thank the Department for granting a salary of $600 per annum to the teacher in charge of the day pupils at Squamish Mission Boarding School.\n\nI need not tell you how grateful the Sister Superior is. It will surely tend to lighten the heavy burden which has been carried in the management of this school.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJ.

The Reverend William Chaput, Missionary to the Indians, who resides in the vicinity, informs me that he will teach the pupils if the school is established.\n\nThe Tsawassen Indians are an industrious hard-working people, and very anxious to have their children educated; they almost continually reside on the reserve and cultivate the soil. The Chief carried off the first prize for district exhibits at the Agricultural Exhibition held in this City the first of the month. In view of the foregoing facts, I would respectfully recommend to the Department that school supplies be furnished, and a teacher engaged in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant forwarding a petition from the members of the Tsawassen Band of Indians for the establishment of a day school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to grant their request. As soon as the Indians provide a suitable building you may engage Rev. Mr. Chaput as teacher at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum and the Department will furnish the necessary supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, November 21, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter of the 16th ultimo in which you were informed that as soon as the Indians provide a suitable building you may engage the Rev. Mr. Chaput as teacher for the proposed school on the Tsawassen Reserve.\n\nNo reply has been received to this letter, but a requisition for school material has been forwarded by you. As it is presumed that the school is in operation a limited supply of material will be sent, but before the Department can furnish all the articles asked for it will be necessary for you to state the number of pupils enrolled and their classification by standards. You may purchase two dozen slates.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to this school at your earliest convenience. It would be well for you in future when communicating with the Department to give full particulars, as your omission to do so causes unnecessary delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nThe Indians on this reserve make their living solely by agricultural pursuits, hence, their children do not leave the reserve at fishing and hop-picking seasons, and will have a splendid opportunity to advance in their studies.\n\nThe day on which I visited this reserve, I was very agreeably surprised, on my arrival about 9 a.m., to find the children all lined up ready for school, in which there was a fire, making the place look warm and comfortable. In conclusion I may add that the Rev. Wm. Chaput is of course a highly educated man, and taking a great interest in the advancement of the Indians, and I believe that his daily presence at the school on the reserve will have a very beneficial effect on both the children and parents.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFor the information of the Department,\n\nI beg to report that I visited the school recently opened on the Tsawassen Indian reserve, by the Rev. Wm. Chaput as teacher, and found nineteen children present classified as follows:\n\nOne in the third standard, two in the second standard, three in the first standard, and the remaining twelve are just beginners.\n\nThe children in the advanced grades formerly attended the public school in the vicinity, but lately sufficient white pupils have been secured to make up the requisite number and of course the Indian children are in attendance no longer. I may add that this school is now closed and a new one opened a much greater distance from the Reserve.\n\nThe building in which the Indian school is being carried on was erected some three years ago for a church, but not finished, lately the Indians have put in the windows and doors, also ceiled and partitioned off a room 20 X 25 ft., which is quite large enough for the number of pupils attending. The furniture consists of four or five seats, each long enough to accommodate five or six children, a table about 14 feet long, with seats, at which the children do their writing, also a small table and chair for the teacher. Besides these articles I may say that the teacher has furnished some books, slates, pencils, chalk and blackboards at his own expense. The Indians are now arranging to have proper desks put in the school.\nLadner, B.C., Mar 18 1914\n\nP.

Mr. Chaput, was absent in Victoria and the school had not been opened after the Christmas holidays. The school-room is reported to be dirty and the Chief complained that the school was not opened punctually in the mornings.\n\nThe Department would like you to report on these complaints.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLennan\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSir,\n\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report that the Day School on Tsawassen Indian Reserve (Rev. Wm. Chaput, teacher) has been closed since the first of the year. I regret to state that the closing of this school was caused in the first instance by sickness among the pupils which rendered the attendance low and irregular; and later the extraordinary heavy rains which made the road in such an impassible condition that the teacher could not reach the school.\n\nI do not think it will be possible to reopen this school during the present quarter as some of the children are absent from the Reserve, and the Rev. Wm. Chaput has been promoted to another parish. I visited the school and stored everything away carefully, and will advise the Department when I secure the services of a competent teacher to take charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant stating that the Tsawassen Indian School has been closed since the first of the year and that you do not think that it will be possible to re-open it during the present quarter, as some of the children are absent from the reserve and Rev. Wm. Chaput, the teacher, has been promoted to another parish.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of this school being closed for this quarter and you will be good enough to report when you can secure the services of a competent teacher to take charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

In this connection I would refer the Department to my report on the above school dated the 13th inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nEnclosed is the letter from Most Reverend W. M. Duke, Archbishop of Vancouver, forwarded to me under cover of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 28th.\n\nBoth the Pemberton Meadows and the Tsawwassen Reserves are in the New Westminster Agency. Indian Agent Daunt suggested the establishment of a day school on the Pemberton Meadows Reserve in the year 1934, but, in order to start a school, a building would be required and, as no funds were provided for the purpose, no action was taken at that time. There are, approximately, 320 Indians in this Band and there are 78 children of school age, of whom 34 are attending the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School. This leaves 44 on the reserve without educational facilities.\n\nA day school was conducted on the Tsawwassen Reserve from 1913 to 1915, but was closed in the latter year owing to the small attendance. This Band has a membership of only 47 and the last census shows only eight or nine children of school age.\n\nInspector Barry is on holidays at the present time but he will return to duty about August 1st. A letter is being directed to Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, requesting him to have Mr. Barry visit these reserves early in August and make a survey and report to the Department regarding the feasibility of establishing day schools.\n\nActing Director.\nTsawwassen Indian Reserve Survey\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nIt is my opinion that as the Indian children are doing very well in their respective Provincial Day Schools any change at the present time would cause considerable opposition among the Indian parents.\n\nThe cost of operation of an Indian Day School on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve would be considerable. In addition to the capital outlay for a suitable building, which would be between two and three thousand dollars at least, the salary of a teacher and her transportation would come to some twelve hundred dollars yearly.\n\nThe few available children are receiving an excellent education at not more than twenty dollars per year each. We are very fortunate here that the children are permitted to attend the Provincial Day Schools and any change would not be for the advantage of the pupils.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI have gone into the whole of the matters reported above with some care, and would recommend that no Indian Day School be established on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve till conditions have very greatly changed in this locality.\n\nFurther I would strongly recommend that the present system of sending the children as far as possible to the local Provincial Schools be continued, and if possible extended, till such time as the Provincial Educational Authorities object. I do not believe that any objection will be made at present as the Tsawwassen children are of a very good type and the custom of their attending Provincial Schools has been in force for a number of years.\n\nI have seen some correspondence in the Indian Agent's office at New Westminster, and from this am under the impression that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, who was not present during my visit to the Tsawwassen Reserve, has reached much the same conclusion as that expressed above.\n\nOn C.P. Princess Marguerite. Gerald H. Barry,\nAugust 20, 1937. Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSCHOOL SURVEY REPORT TSAAWWASSEN INDIAN RESERVE\n\nRoman Catholic Church New Westminster Agency.\n\nDate of Survey: The Tsawwassen Indian Reserve was visited on August 16th in company with Miss Dynes of the New Westminster Agency, who was kind enough to drive me to the above Reserve from the Indian Agent's Office in New Westminster and later to accompany me around the Reserve, where she introduced me to the Indians who were there at the time.\n\nPurpose of Survey: The survey of this Indian Reserve was carried out on instructions from Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Departmental letter 153-28-1 of June 29th 1937. The special question to be reported on was the necessity or otherwise of further educational facilities for the Indian children living on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, and particularly the matter of the establishment of an Indian Day School on this Reserve.\n\nMethod followed: With the help of Miss Dynes a complete list of children of school age and under was made from the official records. This list which is given on the next page shows all children living on or belonging to the Tsawwassen Band. As those children living on the Reserve, but far under school age, are shown, this survey report may be considered to cover the question of the need for an Indian Day School for a number of years to come.\n\nOn my visit to the Reserve I spoke to a number of the children who were there at the time. It is true that a number were away fishing or on other seasonal work, but I am satisfied that the children seen were a fair sample of the whole group.\n\nAppearance and Attitude of Children:\n\nIn general the children appeared very clean and neatly dressed compared with the usual Indian of the Coast. They were bright and answered questions quickly and with care. I may say that I was very well pleased with the response received to questions.\n\nSome of the children, two at least in one group of six, appear to have highly developed mental powers for their age. They would no doubt be classed as students with high IQs. One said that she was leading her Grade Five Class and being promoted to Grade 6 in September, while the other was among the first few in her Grade. All the children seen appear to be well up in their respective Grades.\n\nThe children for the most part attend the Provincial Rural Schools. Those in Grades 1 to 6 inclusive attend the one room ungraded day schools of the Ladner Municipality, and upon promotion to Grade 7 transfer to the Ladner School which is organized to take the Junior High School Grades as well as the lower Grades. The children have attended the Provincial Schools for a number of years, and the Indian Affairs Branch pays for them at the usual rate of two dollars per month. They appear to be doing as well if not better than the \"white\" children, and are receiving a better education than they would get in an ungraded Indian Day School.\nLIST OF NAMES OF CHILDREN LIVING OR REGISTERED ON THE TSAWWASSEN INDIAN RESERVE.\n\nSimon Joe (Father)\nElmer Joe........... 10 years.

Those attending the Provincial Rural Schools do not receive religious teaching at such schools, and it is perhaps for this reason that the establishment of an Indian Day School on the Tsawassen Indian Reserve has been suggested.\n\nA Sunday School in connection with the local Roman Catholic Church would appear to me to be all that is required here.\n\nBuildings available:\n\nI was not able to discover any building on the Tsawassen Reserve that could possibly be turned into an Indian Day School. The village extends over a large area along the coast some three to five miles south of Ladner. The Indians have quite extensive farms which they work with \"white\" men on share basis. In addition to the Ladner School the children attend at least two other Provincial Schools depending on their home location. The average distance the children walk to these small schools is about two miles each way. Those attending at Ladner cycle the four or five miles to school and home again in the evening.\n\nIf a school were erected on the Reserve the teacher would have to live in Ladner, and provision would have to be made for her transportation daily to the Reserve. A school with teacher's residence would not be suitable as the village is rather out of the way and no teacher should be forced to live at such a distance from other \"white\" people.\nTsawwassen Indian Reserve Survey:\n\nGeneral Remarks:\n\nIt is my opinion that as the Indian children are doing very well in their respective Provincial Day Schools any change at the present time would cause considerable opposition among the Indian parents.\n\nThe cost of operation of an Indian Day School on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve would be considerable. In addition to the capital outlay for a suitable building, which would be between two and three thousand dollars at least, the salary of a teacher and her transportation would come to some twelve hundred dollars yearly.\n\nThe few available children are receiving an excellent education at not more than twenty dollars per year each. We are very fortunate here that the children are permitted to attend the Provincial Day Schools, and any change would not be for the advantage of the pupils.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI have gone into the whole of the matters reported above with some care, and would recommend that no Indian Day School be established on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve till conditions have very greatly changed in this locality.\n\nFurther I would strongly recommend that the present system of sending the children as far as possible to the local Provincial Schools be continued, and if possible extended, till such time as the Provincial Educational Authorities object. I do not believe that any objection will be made at present as the Indian children are of a very good type and the custom of their attending the Provincial Schools has been in force for a number of years.\n\nI have seen some correspondence in the Indian Agent's office at New Westminster, and from this am under the impression that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt, who was not present during my visit to the Tsawwassen Reserve, has reached much the same conclusion as that expressed above.\n\nOn C.P.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, and in accordance with the provisions of Departmental letter 153-28-1 of June 29th 1937.\n\nThe special question to be reported on was the necessity or otherwise of further educational facilities for the Indian children living on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, and particularly the matter of the establishment of an Indian Day School on this Reserve.\n\nMethod followed: With the help of Miss Dynes a complete list of children of school age and under was made from the official records. This list which is given on the next page shows all children living on or belonging to the Tsawwassen Band.\n\nAs those children living on the Reserve, but far under school age, are shown, this survey report may be considered to cover the question of the need for an Indian Day School for a number of years to come.\n\nOn my visit to the Reserve I spoke to a number of the children who were there at the time. It is true that a number were away fishing or on other seasonal work, but I am satisfied that the children seen were a fair sample of the whole group.\n\nAppearance and Attitude of Children:\n\nIn general the children appeared very clean and neatly dressed compared with the usual Indian of the Coast. They were bright and answered questions quickly and with care. I may say that I was very well pleased with the response received to questions.\n\nSome of the children, two at least in one group of six, appear to have highly developed mental powers for their age. They would no doubt be classed as students with high I.Q.'s. One said that she was leading her Grade Five Class and being promoted to Grade 6 in September, while the other was among the first few in her Grade. All the children seen appear to be well up in their respective Grades.\n\nThe children for the most part attend the Provincial Rural Schools. Those in Grades 1 to 6 inclusive attend the one room ungraded day schools of the Ladner Municipality, and upon promotion to Grade 7 transfer to the Ladner School which is organized to take the Junior High School Grades as well as the lower Grades. The children have attended the Provincial Schools for a number of years, and the Indian Affairs Branch pays for them at the usual rate of two dollars per month. They appear to be doing as well if not better than the \"white\" children, and are receiving a better education than they would get in an ungraded Indian Day School.\nTsawwassen Indian Reserve Survey:\n\nLIST OF NAMES OF CHILDREN LIVING OR REGISTERED ON THE TSAWWASSEN INDIAN RESERVE.\n\nSimon Joe (Father)\nElmer Joe............. 10 years.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions and with reference to Departmental letter 153-28-1 from the Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa dated June 29th 1937, I have made an educational survey of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency.\n\nThough Mr. Indian Agent Daunt was away on vacation, his stenographer, Miss Dynes did everything possible to help me.\n\nIt is a pleasure to visit an Indian reserve where the children are making such good use of the educational facilities available. From an educational point of view it would be a very great mistake to make any change in the present arrangements for the children on the Tsawwassen Reserve.\n\nThe erection of an Indian Day School on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve could not possibly be justified. There are not sufficient Indian children available of school age and very few of under school age. It is difficult for me to understand why even the possibility of an Indian Day School here should have been considered by the Catholic Church authorities, unless it may have been to make it possible for the children to receive daily religious instruction.\n\nThere are many places in British Columbia where Indian Day Schools are required as soon as there are funds for such a purpose, but the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve is not one of such places.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith report by Capt. Barry on the educational survey carried out by him of the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve, New Westminster Agency, carried out in accordance with Departmental instructions.\n\nInspector Barry very definitely recommends against the establishment of an Indian Day School at Tsawwassen Reserve and in this I concur.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

I may add that there is a competent man, who with his wife are willing to live on the reserve and take charge of this school, if the quarters suggested be provided.

Some of the children were drafted to the Industrial school at Kamloops, but, as you will have noted, the desire of Bazile the chief is to have a day school on the Reserve.\n\nXXX XXX XXX\nRe Education\u2014 I found in the Kamloops and Okanagan Agency two boarding or industrial schools, one at Kamloops and the other at or near Lytton, these being full to their utmost capacity, yet falling far short of the needs of the people. The Indians themselves brought this matter to me and repeatedly importuned for schools. \"Day schools, on or near the Reserve\" \"Secular Day Schools\" these were what they asked for, and after going over the Districts I would recommend that day schools with competent teachers be established at Enderby and at the head of the Okanagan Lake, and also in the Lower Similkameen Country, also at Bonaparte near Ashcroft, and also at Spencer's Bridge, further down the Thompson. This would give this District five day schools, which in my judgment, are very much needed and for which, as above stated, the Indians have most earnestly asked for.\n\n(Signed) John McDougall.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 190\u2014\n\nMr. Agent Irwin written to in regard to this matter, February 7th, 1910. File 354351.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. M.\nBonaparte.\n\nThe school population of this reserve is set down as 24. There is a principal village on the Ne.I. reserve, Cariboo wagon road, where practically all of the Indians congregate in winter, but during summer they disperse, some to their holdings and others to various occupations as occasion offers, and it is the exception to find other than a few aged Indians left at the village. So that I am of opinion school could be kept open but a portion of each year.\n\nThere is no school building available or suitable. There is a spring of water adjacent to village, but no land suitable for garden purposes.\n\nLumber would be the material most available for school building, which I estimate to cost $700.00, and it could be most satisfactorily built by contract. I would not look for any assistance from these Indians.\n\nA. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 2nd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the application for the establishment of a school on the Bonaparte Reserve, British Columbia.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the information contained therein, the Department is not disposed to establish a school at present. The question of establishing further day schools at a later date in your Agency will depend very much upon the success met with at the Okanagan school, provided one is started at that point, as is intended now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

General Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMay 4th, 1908.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that, having received letters and a petition from the chiefs and Indians of the \"Gouteau\" or Thompson River Tribes requesting that I should meet them at Spence's Bridge on April 17th, in council, to consider the matter concerning the education of their children; after consulting with Mr. Superintendent Vowell, I arranged to Meet Mr. Indian Agent Irwin at that point.\n\nAnd on the 17th ultimo we met some seventy-five Indians at 1 P.M. in council which continued till 6 P.M. Six chiefs were present and made very reasonable speeches, the point of all being that they wished their children to be taught like the children of the white people, instead of growing up in ignorance.\n\nWe found there were twenty-eight children of school age belonging to the Indians present, but only seven of these of Cook's Ferry Band live at Spence's Bridge. Seven live at \"Pamyncoos\" nine miles from Spence's Bridge; five live near Ashcroft twenty-five miles away; and nine live at \"Potato Gardens\" sixteen miles distant. Hence I explained to them the difficulty of a Day School as the children were so widely scattered. They then proposed that they would bring all of the children to Spence's Bridge and the Chiefs there would take charge of and look after them in the Indians' Houses, so that they could attend a Day School, but that proposition would not work out satisfactorily.\n\nThe seven children at Spence's Bridge live within a quarter of a mile of a Provincial School for white children, where some eighteen are in attendance.\nIt appears to me that if some satisfactory arrangement could be made by the Department with this School, by which these seven Indian children would be permitted to attend the White Bay School it would meet the case, and satisfy the Indians who live at Cook's Ferry. The Chief claimed ten children of School age at this place, but as three are half-breeds and the Indian Mother is married to a white man I did not count those.\n\nRegarding the other places; \"Potato Gardens\" has nine children whom they wish to attend School, but this is too small a number to insure the success of a Day School on their Reserve.\n\nThey all spoke well of the Lytton Day School and desired a similar one in each village.\n\nI advised those, who with their children, live where it is impossible to have Day Schools at present, to send the children to one of the existing Boarding or Industrial Schools.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\nMay 14th, 1909.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter dated the 4th inst. received from Mr. School Inspector Green reporting having received letters and a petition from the Chiefs and Indians of the Coteau or Thomson River tribes requesting a meeting at Spences bridge on the 17th ultimo. Mr. Green states, as will be seen, that the meeting was held on the date named and that 75 Indians were present.\n\nI would suggest that the arrangement named by Mr. Green be given effect if possible as it seems the best way out of the difficulty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 5, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ult., inclosing a report from Mr. Inspector Green upon the educational needs of the Thomson River Indians.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Green's suggestion that it might be possible to arrange for the education of the seven children at Spence's Bridge at the white school in the neighborhood, you will be good enough to make enquires and ascertain upon what terms the Trustees of that school would be willing to allow the Indian children to attend and report to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nThe Department also concurs with Mr. Green, that owing to the scattered locations of these Indians, it would be impossible to provide them with day schools at present and that the existing boarding and industrial schools offer the best solution of the problem. The Department would be pleased to see the Indians carry out Mr. Green's advice to them.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.W.

S., and previous correspondence on the subject of the educational needs of the Thompson River Indians, and requiring to know what steps had been taken to have those in the vicinity of Spence's Bridge admitted to the white school there. When I visited Spence's Bridge about 13th October last, I had an interview with Mr. Clines, Secretary of the Board of Trustees there. He informed me there was at the time a vacancy on the Board; that a meeting would shortly be called to fill the vacancy, and the admission of Indian pupils would be discussed, and the result made known to me. Personally Mr. Clines was disposed to allow Indian children to attend on the basis of payment proposed by Department, viz:\u2014$1.00 per month per pupil. I have not since seen or heard from Mr. Clines on the subject, but shall write him and let Department know.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

The Indians themselves brought this matter to me and repeatedly importuned for schools. \"Day schools, on or near the Reserve\" \"Secular Day Schools\" these were what they asked for, and after going over the Districts I would recommend that Day schools with competent teachers be established at Enderby and at the head of the Okanagan Lake, and also in the Lower Similkameen Country, also at Bonaparte near Ashcroft, and also at Spencer's Bridge, further down the Thompson. This would give this District five day schools, which in my judgment, are very much needed and for which, as above stated, the Indians have most earnestly asked for.\n\n(Signed) John McDougall.\nIndian Office,\nKamloops, B.C., Janry. 20th, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to my letter of 17th Dec. past, dealing with the question of education of Indians, I have the honor to further inform you that I have today received a letter from the Secretary of the Board of School Trustees at Spence's Bridge, stating that he had at length succeeded in having the matter of admitting Indian children placed before the people, and that they were mostly agreeable.

I enclose a duplicate copy of Mr. Secretary Clem's letter to me granting permission for Indian children to attend. The terms agreed upon at the time I personally interviewed Mr. Clem were the same as those allowed the trustees of Penticton public school, viz.: $1.00 per month for each pupil, which was quite satisfactory. Some time ago I wrote Indians of Spence's Bridge that arrangements had been made with trustees of white school to the effect that Indian children could attend such school. I am not informed whether any are attending.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.W.

Some quarterly return forms are being sent you under separate cover and you will be good enough to give the necessary instructions as to filling them out. These returns should be forwarded to the Department through your office and payment will be made from the 1st of January, last, if the children have been in attendance, as it is stated they have.\n\nYou will be good enough to impress upon the Indians the necessity for taking advantage of this privilege which has been secured for them to have their children educated, and it is to be hoped that the enrolment will be large and the attendance regular.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Irwin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nSecretary.\nSpencer Bridge, B.C.\n30th March 1910\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe received your communication some time ago and have since explained same to our people, and to some of the chiefs of other bands. We are very glad to hear a doctor will be given to us very soon, and the many sick among us will at last be able to receive proper medical treatment. We have required the aid of a doctor for a long time. We are also glad to hear the school question is receiving your earnest attention. We are anxious to have our children schooled and the great majority of us favor day schools. There is difficulty in some places owing to an insufficiency in the number of children. For instance on the Thompson River between Ashcroft and Spencer Bridge there is not sufficient children at any one point for a school, but we think a day school might be started at Spencer Bridge and the people from up the river would send their children by making arrangements with friends at Spencer Bridge to board them. It is not our fault there are so few children in most places, all along many children have been born amongst us, but they mostly die in infancy or early childhood. Some women have had nine and ten children and none remain alive. This calamity has largely been brought on us by the whites, and right along we have had no proper medical attendance nor any instruction regarding these matters. The Indian agent has been here with a proposition that as there are so few children for the people should send their children to the white school, but we do not favor this. An odd one of us has been able to secure\nSome education in this way before, but as a rule this system does not work. It was once tried here at Spence Bridge years ago through the efforts of Mr Murray and possibly also the late Indian agent. Neither the whites nor the Indians care to have their children mixed up when still young and foolish. Each claims it is injurious to the other. As a rule white girls do not care to associate with Indian girls, and white boys are too rough and often nasty in their treatment of both Indian boys and girls. When Indian parents see their children are not treated well at school by the whites, they take their children away. Also on the other hand white parents take their children from school when they see Indian children attending the same school. They do not wish their children to associate with Indians. Knowing these things we have no desire to send our children to the white school at Spence Bridge. Thanking you for your interest and help in our affair, we beg to remain\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nJohn Whiteman (Chief)\n(Chief of Spence Bridge Band)\n\nJohn Holman (Chief)\n(Chief of Pekanit Band)\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 11, 1910.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo signed by yourself and Chief John Tedianitsa of the Pekaiat Band in reference to the establishment of a school at Spence's Bridge.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter has received careful consideration and the action taken to obtain the privilege of attendance at the public school by the Indian children was deemed the best solution of a difficult problem. As you are aware there is not a sufficient number of children at Spence's Bridge to warrant the establishment of a school and it is not thought that the arrangement suggested in regard to the boarding of children resident at other places by the Indian families at Spence's Bridge is practicable.\n\nAt a number of points throughout the Dominion Indian children attend the white schools and the troubles referred to by you are not in evidence. The Department would like to have the arrangement offered at Spence's Bridge given a fair trial and would ask for the co-operation of yourself and the other Chiefs as well as members of the Band.\n\nMutually satisfactory terms have been agreed upon, and all that now remains is for the Indians to send their\n\nChief John Whistamnitsa,\nSpences Bridge Band,\nSpences Bridge, B.C.\nchildren, if they are not already doing so, and give them the advantages of an education.\n\nThe Department would be glad to hear from you again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n154-26-1\n\nClosed\n\nfrom 4/5/09\nto 11/4/10\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6038)\n\nFile 154-17-1, part 1\nKamloops - Bonaparte School Establishment. 1910\n\nFile 154-26-1, part 1\nKamloops - Spence's Bridge School Establishment. 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 154-42-1, part 1\nKamloops - Upper Nicola - Douglas Lake School Establishment. 1919\n\nFile 154-45-1, part 1\nKamloops - Upper Nicola - Coldwater School Establishment. 1919\n\nFile 155-6-1, part 1\nKootenay - Creston School Establishment. 1910\n\nFile 156-6A-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Cape Mudge Boarding School Establishment. 1919 - 1920\n\nFile 156-20-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Blunden Harbour School Establishment. 1911 - 1915\n\nFile 156-31-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Fort Rupert School - General Administration. 1904, 1920, 1927, 1935\n\nFile 156-31-5, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Fort Rupert School - Supplies. 1931\n\nFile 157-1-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Boarding School Establishment. 1911 - 1921\n\nFile 157-7-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Naden Harbour School Establishment. 1912, 1939\n\nFile 157-10-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - North Island School Establishment. 1910 - 1911\n\nFile 158-1-1, part 1\nStikine Agency - Stikine Summer Day School - General Correspondence. 1925 - 1942\n\nFile 158-3-1, part 1\nStikine Agency - McDame Day School - General Administration. 1930 - 1948\n\nFile 158-3-2, part 1\nStikine Agency - McDame Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1940 - 1944\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nKamloops\n\nGeneral Correspondence\n\nDouglas Lake School\nOttawa, June 13, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a complaint regarding the lack of educational facilities for the Indian children on the Upper and Lower Nicola group of reserves. It would appear that there is some foundation for this complaint. The last census returns show that there are 467 Anglican and 26 Roman Catholic Indians with about 60 or 65 children of school age on the Lower Nicola Reserves and on the Upper Nicola there are 180 Indians all of whom are Roman Catholic with about 35 children of school age.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of these children there is only a day school under the auspices of the Anglican Church in the Lower Nicola group at Sholus and there are several children in both the Lytton and Kamloops Industrial Schools. These two residential schools are the only schools of this class to which children from these reserves could be sent. The majority of the children are receiving no education.\n\nThe last returns received show that the Kamloops Industrial School has an enrolment of 61 children and the per capita grant only provides for 60. The Lytton school has a grant for 100 pupils with an enrolment of 90. The Sholus day school had an enrolment during the past year of from 10 to 16 children.\n\nThe Department would like you to look into this question of providing educational facilities for the Indian children on the Upper and Lower Nicola Reserves and forward a full report giving your views as to the best means of providing these facilities. It would, no doubt, be found impossible to build day schools, suitably located,\n\nA. Macrae, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nto provide for the attendance of all these children within a reasonable distance of their homes. It might be possible to arrange for the Indian children living near white schools to attend such schools. You will be good enough to state whether arrangements could be made to have this done. The Department has no information regarding the number of children of school age on each of the various reserves in the Upper and Lower Nicola groups. This information should be given if possible.\n\nMr. Bent Smith, of the Kemloons' band, is also being written to regarding this matter and you might after consultation with him, be able to recommend to the Department a feasible scheme whereby reasonable provision could be made for the education of the Indian children on these reserves.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to look into this question at an early date and forward to the Department a report containing your views and suggestions regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. F. MacKenzie.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOffice of Inspector of Indian Agencies\nBritish Columbia.\n\nFile 523999\n\nVernon, B.C.\nAug. 6th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that in obedience to instructions contained in the Department's letter of June 13th, concerning complaint in reference to lack of educational facilities for Indian children in the Upper and Lower Nicola:\n\nI went into the Nicola on July 2nd, accompanied by Mr. J. F. Smith, Indian Agent, and Dominion Constable Dallin.\n\nTo determine whether the complaint was well-founded it was obvious that the first thing to be got at was to ascertain accurately the number of Indian children of school age in the Upper and Lower Nicola.\n\nThe Indian Agent told me that he had always found it very difficult to obtain this information owing to the reticence of the Indians and the air of suspicion with which they often regarded any inquiries of that kind. For that reason he was not satisfied that previous enumerations could be depended upon. I therefore decided to go to representative Indians as well as to others who might be in a position to give accurate information and had the Indian Agent accompany me. Many of the Indians were away from home and had their children with them; but in every case where I could I went to the Chief and had him get his head men to assist him in taking the\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nOttawa.\nfamilies one by one and giving an enumeration of the children with the ages as accurately stated as could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, and the result showed how little ground there was for the complaint after all.\n\nLOWER NICOLA.\n\nPetit Creek, was the first visited and the first enumeration was obtained from Mrs. Fraser, wife of the local store-keeper. The Indians all trade at the store and she knows each Indian family and could judge fairly well as to their ages. Her estimate of the number of Indian children between 6 and 16 was five. There is a white school at Canford, a mile distant, and no reason to believe that either the trustees or the parents in the school section would offer any objection to attendance of any of the Indian children of this band.\n\nA meeting of the Indians of the band was arranged for next day, when the Chief and principal Indians of the band were present and again the various families were counted over and the number of Indian children of school age counted and they could only make it six, which shows how accurate the first estimate made by Mrs. Fraser really was, for one of the children counted by the Indians was a visitor from another band, and was counted because there was reason to believe that this child is likely to remain at Petit Creek.\n\nTo obvious and only reasonable solution in this instance would be for the Indian children of this band to attend the white school at Canford.\n\nAt Potato Illahie the Chief, Billy Nakalst and his captain, John Henry, with the assistance of the Chief's wife made the enumeration and all the Indian children of school age left in the band totalled 4. A year ago there were possibly more than twice than number, but this band\nsuffered heavily from the \"Flu\" and many of the victims were children. The nearest white school is at Spencer's Bridge 15 miles north or at Canford about the same distance south. With so few children it would be unreasonable to expect that a school should be established and a teacher maintained. The only course therefore in this instance would be to send the children from this band to the Industrial school at Lytton, for these Indians are Anglican.\n\nAt Shulus there is a day school established in connection with the Anglican Mission and the Indian Department pays the teacher, furnishes school supplies etc. There is on the roll 12 pupils of school age with an average attendance for the last term of 5 and there are only 5 other children of school age in the band who are not on the roll. The trouble here is the lack of interest in the school on the part of Indian parents and also the inherent selfishness of these same parents in putting their own convenience first and making the education of their children a secondary consideration. The teacher showed me a memorandum he had kept of the reasons why children had been kept out of school and they were most trivial in the majority of instances. Rigorous enforcement of compulsory education would seem to be the only solution here.\n\nUPPER NICOLA.\n\nColdwater possibly should not be classed with Upper Nicola insomuch as the Coldwater River upon which the Reserve is situated comes in from the south and empties into the Nicola River at a point which might rather be considered as a part of Lower Nicola; but the Coldwater Indians have more in common with the Upper Nicola Indians of Douglas Lake and Quilchena. At the Coldwater reserve we had the assistance of Chief George Sandy and his principal Councillor, Nicola Captain. These men went\ncarefully over the members of the Coldwater Band family by family, and gave as a result of their count, a total of ten children of school age. The nearest white school is at Olean, 6 miles distant. These Indians are Roman Catholic, but none of their children are attending the Industrial School at Kamloops. There was one attended last year but took sick and had to be brought home. The Chief was of opinion that a day school would be of benefit to them and the Indians would like to have it. There is no building available on the reserve at present and as the nearest white settler is about three miles distant, which would make it difficult for a white teacher to obtain boarding accommodation, the better plan would be to make provision for living quarters for the teacher in a portion of the school building as had been done so successfully at Boothroyd in the Lytton Agency. The reserve is in a lumber region with mills and logging operations in comparatively close proximity and the Merritt branch of the Kettle Valley Railway passing through the reserve, so that it would be easy to obtain lumber; and if the Indians will give their labor a suitable building for school with teacher's living quarters might be secured for about $400.00 or $500.00. With ten children of school age for whom educational facilities could thus be obtained such expenditure would be justified and I am of the opinion that the Indians of this band would show their appreciation by taking an interest in the school.\n\nAt Douglas Lake the Chief was away and the census figures in the agent's office had to be relied upon. These showed the number of children of school age to be 32, with 14 at Quilchena. There are four Douglas Lake children attending the Industrial school at Kamloops. Deducting these it is seen that there are at Quilchena and Douglas Lake 42 children who are receiving no education but these two reserves are 11 miles apart and two schools\nwould be necessary to accommodate them. There is no white school in the vicinity, but no difficulty would be experienced in obtaining boarding accommodation for a teacher, if a white teacher were employed.\n\nThe two greatest drawbacks to Indian day schools are irregularity in attendance and the difficulty experienced where the teacher has no knowledge of the Indian language of that particular tribe. The remedy for the former would be to create a greater interest in education on the part of Indian parents, and for the latter would be to have the Industrial School train some of the larger Indian girls as teachers. This latter should be taken up with the principals of these Industrial Schools, but as very few of them are in favor of Indian day schools at all, they may not be disposed to grant very cordial support to that idea.\n\nTo summarise, there are therefore only three cases in the Nicola Valley where the number of school children who are receiving no education, would warrant the expense of opening up day schools, and these are at Coldwater, Douglas Lake and Quilchena.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

It would appear that there is some foundation for this complaint. The last census returns show that there are 467 Anglican and 26 Roman Catholic Indians with about 60 or 55 children of school age on the Lower Nicola Reserves and on the Upper Nicola there are 180 Indians all of whom are Roman Catholic with about 35 children of school age.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of these children there is only a day school under the auspices of the Anglican Church in the Lower Nicola group at Sholus and there are several children in both the Lytton and Kamloops Industrial Schools. These two residential schools are the only schools of this class to which children from these reserves could be sent. The majority of the children are receiving no education.\n\nThe last returns received show that the Kamloops Industrial School has an enrolment of 61 children and the per capita grant only provides for 60. The Lytton school has a grant for 100 pupils with an enrolment of 90. The Sholus day school had an enrolment during the past year of from 10 to 16 children.\n\nThe Department would like you to look into this question of providing educational facilities for the Indian children on the Upper and Lower Nicola Reserves and forward a full report giving your views as to the best means of providing these facilities. It would, no doubt, be found impossible to build day schools, suitably located.\n\nA. Mcgraw, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVernon, B.C.\nto provide for the attendance of all these children within a reasonable distance of their homes. It might be possible to arrange for the Indian children living near white schools to attend such schools. You will be good enough to state whether arrangements could be made to have this done. The Department has no information regarding the number of children of school age on each of the various reserves in the Upper and Lower Nicola groups. This information should be given if possible.\n\nMr. [name] Smith, of the Kamloops agency, is also being written to regarding this matter and you might after consultation with him, be able to recommend to the Department a feasible scheme whereby reasonable provision could be made for the education of the Indian children on these reserves.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to look into this question at an early date and forward to the Department a report containing your views and suggestions regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. F. MacKenzie.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that in obedience to instructions contained in the Department's letter of June 13th, concerning complaint in reference to lack of educational facilities for Indian children in the Upper and Lower Nicola:\n\nI went into the Nicola on July 28nd, accompanied by Mr. J. F. Smith, Indian Agent, and Dominion Constable Dallin.\n\nTo determine whether the complaint was well-founded it was obvious that the first thing to be set at was to ascertain accurately the number of Indian children of school age in the Upper and Lower Nicols.\n\nThe Indian Agent told me that he had always found it very difficult to obtain this information owing to the reticence of the Indians and the air of suspicion with which they often regarded any inquiries of that kind. For that reason he was not satisfied that previous enumerations could be depended upon. I therefore decided to go to representative Indians as well as to others who might be in a position to give accurate information and had the Indian Agent accompany me. Many of the Indians were away from home and had their children with them; but in every case where I could I went to the Chief and had him get his head men to assist him in taking the\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nOttawa.\nfamilies one by one and giving an enumeration of the children with the ages as accurately stated as could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, and the result showed how little ground there was for the complaint after all.\n\nLOWER NICOLA.\n\nPetit Creek, was the first visited and the first enumeration was obtained from Mrs. Fraser, wife of the local store-keeper. The Indians all trade at the store and she knows each Indian family and could judge fairly well as to their ages. Her estimate of the number of Indian children between 6 and 16 was five. There is a white school at Canford, a mile distant, and no reason to believe that either the trustees or the parents in the school section would offer any objection to attendance of any of the Indian children of this band.\n\nA meeting of the Indians of the band was arranged for next day, when the Chief and principal Indians of the band were present and again the various families were counted over and the number of Indian children of school age counted and they could only make it six, which shows how accurate the first estimate made by Mrs. Fraser really was, for one of the children counted by the Indians was a visitor from another band, and was counted because there was reason to believe that this child is likely to remain at Petit Creek.\n\nTo obvious and only reasonable solution in this instance would be for the Indian children of this band to attend the white school at Canford.\n\nAt Potato Illahie the Chief, Billy Nakalst and his captain, John Henry, with the assistance of the Chief's wife made the enumeration and all the Indian children of school age left in the band totalled 4. A year ago there were possibly more than twice than number, but this band\nsuffered heavily from the \"Flu\" and many of the victims were children. The nearest white school is at Spencer's Bridge 15 miles north or at Canford about the same distance south. With so few children it would be unreasonable to expect that a school should be established and a teacher maintained. The only course therefore in this instance would be to send the children from this band to the Industrial school at Lytton, for these Indians are Anglican.\n\nAt Shulus there is a day school established in connection with the Anglican Mission and the Indian Department pays the teacher, furnishes school supplies etc. There is on the roll 12 pupils of school age with an average attendance for the last term of 5 and there are only 5 other children of school age in the band who are not on the roll. The trouble here is the lack of interest in the school on the part of Indian parents and also the inherent selfishness of these same parents in putting their own convenience first and making the education of their children a secondary consideration. The teacher showed me a memorandum he had kept of the reasons why children had been kept out of school and they were most trivial in the majority of instances. Rigorous enforcement of compulsory education would seem to be the only solution here.\n\nUPPER NICOLA.\n\nColdwater possibly should not be classed with Upper Nicola insomuch as the Coldwater River upon which the Reserve is situated comes in from the south and empties into the Nicola River at a point which might rather be considered as a part of Lower Nicola; but the Coldwater Indians have more in common with the Upper Nicola Indians of Douglas Lake and Quilchena. At the Coldwater reserve we had the assistance of Chief George Sandy and his principal Councillor, Nicola Captain. These men went\ncarefully over the members of the Coldwater band, family by family, and gave as a result of their count, a total of ten children of school age. The nearest white school is at Olsen, 6 miles distant. These Indians are Roman Catholic, but none of their children are attending the Industrial School at Kamloops. There was one attended last year but took sick and had to be brought home. The chief was of opinion that a day school would be of benefit to them and the Indians would like to have it. There is no building available on the reserve at present and as the nearest white settler is about three miles distant, which would make it difficult for a white teacher to obtain boarding accommodation, the better plan would be to make provision for living quarters for the teacher in a portion of the School building as had been done so successfully at Boothroyd in the Lytton Agency. The reserve is in a lumber region with mills and logging operations in comparatively close proximity and the Merritt branch of the Kettle Valley Railway passing through the reserve, so that it would be easy to obtain lumber; and if the Indians will give their labor a suitable building for school with teacher's living quarters might be secured for about $400.00 or $500.00. With ten children of school age for whom educational facilities could thus be obtained such expenditure would be justified and I am of the opinion that the Indians of this band would show their appreciation by taking an interest in the school.\n\nAt Douglas Lake the Chief was away and the census figures in the Agent's office had to be relied upon. These showed the number of children of school age to be 32, with 14 at Quilchena. There are four Douglas Lake children attending the Industrial school at Kamloops. Deducting these it is seen that there are at Quilchena and Douglas Lake 42 children who are receiving no education but these two reserves are 11 miles apart and two schools\nwould be necessary to accommodate them. There is no white school in the vicinity, but no difficulty would be experienced in obtaining boarding accommodation for a teacher, if a white teacher were employed.\n\nThe two greatest drawbacks to Indian day schools are irregularity in attendance and the difficulty experienced where the teacher has no knowledge of the Indian language of that particular tribe.

Maclellan of Cranbrook, who usually supply the Department.\n\nI would suggest a frame building upon a foundation of cement as it is the cheapest, sand and gravel can be got about a mile from the village, the walls should be stained (stucco), slated and plastered.\n\nThe basement could be used as a toilet, heating and dressing room, as I believe that it will be necessary to give (at least for a time) some good meat a day, as the Indians on the Reserve are moving towards hunting and fishing.\n\nThe best way to heat is by a furnace in the basement, which will make the building clean and comfortable.\n\nIn selecting a site care must be taken that there is near (within from a spring or well) a good supply of pure water.\n\nI would strongly advocate that the building be erected by contract, as they labor is sometimes\nnot satisfactory. The contract should be made short\nup to the terms of the Agreement.\n\nI ought also suggest that when the School\nis opened for the reception of pupils, that it be placed\nunder the care of the Sisters of Charity, who have\ndone such successful work at the Pointe-aux-\nSaumons School for the last thirty years.\n\nThis would make a residence for the Sisters\nnear the School, or in the Village, where their influence\namongst the Indians would do great\ngood.\n\nShould the Department wish further advice\nwanted, I will be pleased to give it,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

You might also communicate with the Sisters to ascertain whether they would be willing to undertake this work.\n\nYou should also state how many children will have to be accommodated in the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR.

H. McMillan,\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant and previous correspondence in reference to the construction of the proposed new school building at Cawston I beg to say that the Department will await the result of your inquiry as to the Sisters of Charity undertaking the management of this school, if established.\n\nPlans and specifications of a building that it is thought would be suitable for this location are now completed and the Department would like you, when forwarding the other information, to state in the papers of what towns you think tenders should be called for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. L. T. Galbraith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Steele, B.C.\nReferring to your letter of the 24th instant No. 36733, re\nnew school building at Briston, I beg to say, that I had a\nlong interview with the Sister Superior on her return from\nPortland, Oregon, and learned from her, that she had talked\nthe matter of taking charge of the School, with the Mother\nProvincial, who promised to refer it to the Superior General\nof the Order in Montreal.\n\nI also gathered from the Sister, that the Order always\nhad a Hotel who acted as Captain at certain places where they\nundertook Mission, Hospital or Teaching Work, and as\nthere was none at Briston at present, this might be an\nobjection to their taking over the School; she also pointed\nout, that it would be necessary to have the approval of the\nnew Bishop (Dr. St. John) who is expected from the East\nshortly.\n\nDuring the course of conversation, I learned, that the\nSociety was much disappointed, that no decision had been\narrived at by the Department about a new building for\nthe Root Lake Industrial School, and that owing to the dis-\nsipated condition of two of the buildings, it made even be\nimpossible to go on with the work, and if they had no assurance\nthat something would be done in the very near future,\nthey might withdraw their staff elsewhere, and take up\nHospital Work, as there were requests for institutions\nof that character throughout the North. I should deeply\nregret if they decide to do so, as the work done at the\nIndustrial School has helped greatly to change the habits\nfor the better, and has aided in making them law-abiding\nand self-supporting.\nI wrote suggest, that newspapers in which the advertisement for tenders for School should be inserted are the Granbrook Herald and the Victoria Times.\n\nThere is a paper published at Guelph called the \"Herald,\" which I believe has a fairly good local circulation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.J. [Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in further reference to the erection of a school building at Creston, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that unless the Department is assured that the services of a suitable teacher, preferably a member of the Order of the Sisters of Charity, will be available it is not considered advisable to take steps to erect the building. This matter will no doubt be taken up on the arrival of the new Bishop and further information will be awaited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. L. T.

Vowell about a day school for the reserve, and appeared most anxious that one should be built, which would assist greatly in improving their condition.\nOttawa, July 12, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the month of May in which you deal with the establishment of a day school at Creston, B.C., I beg to say that in view of the fact that it has been finally decided to erect a commodious boarding school at Kootenay the Department is not at present prepared to establish a day school at Creston, as it is thought that the new boarding school will provide ample accommodation for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

In speaking of the matter to Mr. Halliday, the Indian Agent for this District, he asked me to write you for particulars as to the steps necessary to bring such an institution about, and added that I might say to you that he recommended its Establishment.\n\nI shall be indebted if you will let me have a copy of the Act Respecting Indian Education, and if you will advise me as to what steps should be taken to further the founding of the school. I believe the Indians will assist financially and with a grant of land, subject to your approval. The Church will also help in the undertaking.\n\nAwaiting your esteemed reply, and thanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary of the Methodist Church.\nDecember 11, 1919.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the establishment of a boarding school for the Indians of the Cape Mudge band.\n\nIn reply I beg to express regret that it is not possible for the Department to consider the establishment of such an institution at the present time owing to lack of funds. As requested, I am sending you herewith a copy of \"Regulations Relating to the Education of Indian Children\".\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott,\nMissionary of the Methodist Church,\nQuathiaski Cove, B.C.\nVancouver, B. C.\nSept. 29th 1920.\n\nRev. A. Barner,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Bro. Barner:\n\nAs directed by the Conference Standing Missionary Committee I beg to bring the following particulars regarding our Cape Mudge work before you, for presentation to the General Board, as it would seem that the time is ripe for a declaration of policy, and the undertaking of what may seem in the best interests of the people.\n\nAs I was given to understand, the recommendation of the Committee appointed to investigate the Cape Mudge situation, was that a sum of money be spent for plant, consisting of boarding school, church and mission house, of which the Indians were to provide one-third. Several times they have approached me on the matter and I have not been able to give them a decided answer as to what the Church was going to do. As you can understand, this is unsatisfactory both for them and myself. Just after the rise of District Meeting, I received a letter from Miss Wright, saying that Chief Assu had been to see her and had asked her to write and say that his people would give $10,000 from their capital account for the building of a boarding school, their previous offer was ten acres of land (which I expect holds good still) and one-third the cost financially; the Church and the government to share equally the remaining two-thirds. Just what hope there may be of the government's taking its share, you and Dr. Ferrier may know best, but the number of new schools built for the Roman Catholic Church would seem to show that the Church which pushes her case at Ottawa, dictates the action of the government.\nAs I see it, the situation is this. We have 90 people at Cape Mudge and over 60 at Campbell River, which with a few at the Salmon River and Philips Arm Indians brings the total number to 175. We have 14 pupils on the day school roll and about as many more ready to attend in a year's time, with the same number still younger, or about 60 in all, over and above those attending at Alert Bay and Coqualeetza. Then there are Indians to the south of us on Vancouver Island who would be available and our own Bella Bella, Bella Coola and Rivers Inlet, Indians, and others to the north, so that with the Anglican School at Alert Bay full, and our own Coqualeetza Institute over-crowded, it would seem that there is a field for us, without in the least encroaching on the territory of any school established or proposed. Then the $10,000.00 from our own people is a telling argument. Our Indian Agent recommends it and Mr. Cairns informs me that if we had a boarding school established we would have every chance of getting the government per capita grant for maintenance. I believe the Presbyterian Church has such a school operating at Ahousat with great success. They have also a government paid nurse whom they furnish with room and board. She takes care of the children at the school and acts as a District Nurse. It would be our aim to secure such a person at Cape Mudge, and the benefit to the district would be incalculable.\n\nFurther, our Indians at Campbell River are too few in number to expect a day school started among them, and what are their children to do? The best of them try to gain access to the public school at Campbell River, but were refused. They cannot attend our Cape Mudge day school either. We tried that last fall by having their children stay with our Indians during the week, but it was a failure. I do not see why, if our Cape Mudge Indians put up the\nMoney for the building, the government should object to pay the per capita grant, and the Church to furnish the staff at least.\n\nAgain, our Cape Mudge Indians are beginning to scatter and locate on various parts of the Reserve, so that for them a day school may not be so satisfactory in the near future as it is now. However, we have a splendid development in the matter of better homes among some of the younger people, and I cannot say just to what extent the tendency to scatter may go.\n\nNow as to a Church. We have never had during all the years of missionary work at Cape Mudge, a building set apart for the worship of God, and it does seem that a Church dedicated to that end would be a most necessary and effective step in the spiritual development of our people. I would suggest a building of say 30 x 40 ft. with a full sized basement which could be used for community purposes, recreation and night school activities among them. It would be magnificent if the Church should supercede the Potlatch House as the clearing station for the life of the people. I trust that some pronouncement may be made as to the policy of the Board toward Indian Missions in general, and to our own Cape Mudge people in particular. You can understand how unsatisfactory the situation is. Our teacher wants a home of her own but we cannot press the government to that end if we are looking toward a boarding school. Then again, we must meet the offer of the Indians fairly, and really unless we can induce the Campbell River people to unite at Cape Mudge, a boarding school with accommodation for say 40 pupils would be the better. If the two bands can be united and a permanent village established, aside from the migratory habits of the Indians a day school might carry on. I am most hopeful of our Cape Mudge people; they are regular and faithful in their attendance at the services and the younger people are trying to break away from\nthe bondage, financial and spiritual, of the Potlatch system. Two of\nthe younger men have built splendid homes this last year, one or them\nbetter than the Mission House, as it is now, and another house is in\nthe process of erection. They mean business and I am anxious that the\nChurch which has done so much for them already, and to which they now\nlook for help, should not disappoint them, as they take the first\nsteps toward the new and larger life. The materialistic socialist of\nthe logging camps is demanding a place for his doctrines as our boys\njoin the lumber workers union of the O.B.U. in order to obtain em-\nployment. I am trying by word and deed to show them the better way\nbut so long as the loggers can point to better wages through their\njoining the union, and I can point to no corresponding gain through\nthe avenues of the Church in their midst, the mind of the average\nIndian will not be convinced, either of the worth of our ideals or\nthe unselfishness of our example. We certainly need a Church that\nwill stand for Jesus Christ in all their life - individual and social,\nand I think we should have a boarding school; it will meet our local\nneed better than any other type of school and there is room for service\nto Indians farther away who are not attending a school of any kind, so\nI am informed.\n\nI am praying for guidance for all concerned and trust that\nyour decision may point the leading of God's hand in the matter.\n\nWith kind regards, and best wishes for a profitable session\nof the General Board, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.S. \n\nThe above will explain itself. I send it to\nyou for information, and trust you will be\nguided in connection with your fellow officials\nin the way, but for myself yours\u2014P.B.\nOctober 13th, 1920.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter that is written by Mr. Scott our missionary at Cape Mudge, B.C. It deals with the need of a boarding school at that point and an offer of $10,000 from the funds standing to the credit of the Indians at that place. I would like very much if a deliverance of the Department could be given on this communication as it involves a very important element in the policy which we pursue in regard to the erection of schools. In other words, if we have from a Methodist point of view a large Industrial School at Coqualeetza and another at Port Simpson which is already before the Department in the form of a petition signed by the Indians at Port Simpson, the question then is as to the wisdom of building smaller schools at other points where those that are interested locally desire it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTF/GR.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nNovember 6, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have had before me your letter of the 13th ultimo, wherewith you enclosed a copy of a letter from Mr. Scott, at Cape Mudge, B. C., with regard to the need of a boarding school at that point. I am giving careful consideration to this application. I would point out, however, that it hardly seems possible to erect a number of small schools, but that on the other hand, we rather look forward to the development and enlargement of the institutions we have. We can draft the children into these, as we are now empowered to take such action by the recent amendments to the Indian act.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nT.

They have twenty children of school age, and others that will soon be old enough.\n\nThis band has long been noted for being wild, and the majority of them great thieves, and have not had the advantage of any missionary or teacher, but the Methodist Mission boat \"Homespun\" has visited them three or four times during the past two years. Captain Oliver of the boat called to see me a few days ago, and confirms the Indian's report that a school is greatly needed.\n\nNone of these Indians have any education, but are very anxious that their children should be taught. They state that they live ten months of the year at Blunden Harbour, only going to Rivers Inlet for the months of June and July. Chief Charles says his people wish to abandon their old wild ways and become civilized, and in order that their children may be taught they ask for a day school, and declare that they will see that the children attend.\n\nBlunden Harbour is about twenty-five or thirty miles north of Alert Bay, and being isolated this tribe only mingle with other Indians when at the Rivers Inlet Fisheries, a couple of months each year.\n\nI consider this is a strong plea for a school, and many are surprised that these wild Indians should ask for one. I would recommend that a school be granted opened, and that an Indian house in the village be secured for a time for school purposes. I think a suitable male teacher could be secured for six hundred\ndollars a year.\n\nI have not visited the village myself. If the Department think it best I could do so.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 21, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the establishment of a school for the Nakwakh Indians, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is a matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. F. Green,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n1076 Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, November 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools, in which he states that the Indians of the Nakwakh tribe, Kwawkewlth Agency have waited upon him and asked that a day school be established in their village at Blunden Harbour. He states that there are twenty children of school age and that there are others that will soon be old enough.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you on the suggestion with any recommendations that you may wish to make. The Inspector recommends that the request of the Indians be granted and a house in the village be secured for school purposes for a time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, November 21, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Nakwak Indians of the Kwawkewlth Agency have applied to the Department for the establishment of a school on the reserve in their village at Blunden Harbour. These Indians are said to be pagans, but the Department is informed that Mission boat \"Homespun\" of the Methodist Church visited the reserve three or four times during the past two years and Captain Oliver went to Mr. Green, Inspector of Schools, and confirms the report that a school is greatly needed. In view of the visit of this boat the Department would like to know whether there is any prospect of your Church establishing a mission at this point. If a teacher and missionary could be sent to these Indians for a time the Department would be prepared to allow a fair grant for the services of a teacher. It is not known whether you have any personal knowledge of the conditions, but, if so, I should be glad to have a report from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 21st Nov., File 398665 with reference to the establishment of a day school at Blunden Harbor for the Nakwakto Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that while at all times I do what I can to encourage the Indians to send their children to school, in so far as this agency is concerned, the day schools have been almost a failure. There are several reasons for this. One reason is the apathy of the Indians towards the education of their children. When a school is first established there has always been a good attendance of children but as soon as the novelty wears off it is almost impossible to get an attendance.\n\nThe second reason is the fact of the nomadic habits of the Indians, who do not live any length of time at one place. This is particularly true of the Nakwakto Band. Their chief village is at Blunden Harbor where they spend probably 4 months of the year altogether. They all move to this reserve when they get their winter fish cured which is generally about the first week in December. In March they scatter, some going to the Storm Islands, some to Deserter's Islands and some to Seymour Inlet. They gather again for a week or two in the beginning of June and then go off to the salmon fishing at Rivers Inlet getting home about August 10 to 15.\n\nJ.D. Mclean Esq.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nThis year there was a new cannery built at Seymour Inlet and the fishing does not begin there until about the end of August and lasts until the end of October. Then the Indians scatter again to different places, curing and smoking salmon for their own use.\n\nA third reason for the failure of day schools is the fact that the pay is so small that teachers of any ability can do much better teaching in the public schools where the minimum salary is about $60.00 per month. It is difficult enough to obtain the services of a good teacher even at that salary, and it requires a particularly good teacher to keep Indian children at school.\n\nNative teachers have so far not had force of character enough to keep up the average at the schools.\n\nNo one would be more pleased that I, if any system could be devised to bring the children regularly to school, but under the circumstances I have not arrived at any satisfactory conclusion as to the method of procedure.\n\nI have no doubt that a building could be obtained temporarily at Blunden Harbor and the school would be intermittently attended during the four months or thereabouts when the children are in the village. I will be visiting this village, all being well, shortly after the new year and will take the matter up with them in public meeting and will advise the Department after my return. I fear however that the school would end in failure.\n\nMy last census returns show 14 children of school age with 20 under that age several of whom however might attend. There are no industries of any kind near them to induce them to remain at home any longer than the winter months, and the nearest settlement is at Hardy Bay about 16 miles across the gulf.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the establishment of a day school at Blunden Harbour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks have been noted and the Department will await a further report from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of December 5th No 249/8 in reply to your of November 31st File 388665 regarding the request of the Indians at Blunden Harbor that a day school should be established there for the benefit of the Nakwakto Indians I have the honor to state that I visited the Indians there on 10th instant and held a meeting in regard to this question. There are upwards of 20 children who should attend school and the Indians promised that if there was a school established that they would send them for six months in the year. They leave Blunden Harbor and scatter out to various fishing stations about the 10th of April and do not get back until about the middle of October. There would be no use trying to get any children to school during the months they were away as they are too badly scattered but it might be possible to get a teacher for the winter months.\n\nMy past experience does not warrant much reliance being placed in the promise of any Indians to send their children to day school as they are as a rule very negligent in doing so. A small school house could be erected with two rooms for the teacher at the rear for about $700.00 if it were done during the summer months, but if left until the winter it would cost much more on account of the towing on the lumber as Blunden Harbor is situated on an open stretch of water that gets very rough during the winter.\n\nI would not recommend any elaborate building at any rate for the present, and the school furniture, desks etc would be extra.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in further reference to the establishment of a day school for the Indians at Blunden Harbor.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the fact that these Indians are only on the reserve for about six months in the year the Department is not prepared at the present time to incur the expenditure necessary to provide them with buildings, etc. It is thought that these Indians should take advantage of some of the boarding or industrial schools and have their children sent there where they can be properly looked after and receive an education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nW.

Mar. 1st 1915\n\nTo the Honourable Minister for Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to bring to your notice the condition of the Indians in Blunden Harbour B.C.\n\nChief George informs me that there are 29 Indian children here, & he & all the parents are most anxious that their children should learn to read & write. There are quite a number of white homesteaders here & we have found the Indians are very honest & industrious & good neighbours, quite above the average & would like to see their very reasonable work gratified, I would esteem it a favour if you would inform us what your department is prepared to do in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\nR.O.

In reply I beg to say that in 1911 this matter was brought to the attention of the Department and enquiries were made. It was reported that there were some twenty children who should attend school, but that in April of each year the Indians dispersed to the various fishing stations and would not return until the middle of October, and that, therefore, a school could only be successfully conducted during the winter months. In view of this report the Department decided that it would be better for the Indians to take advantage of the boarding and industrial schools for the education of their children.\n\nI am pleased to note your complimentary remarks with reference to the character of these particular Indians, and I should like to obtain information\n\nR. O. Clark, Esq.,\nChairman, Port Progress Conservative Association,\nBlunden Harbour, B.C.\nVia Port Hardy.\ninformation from you as to their religion; the number of children of school age, that is between six and fifteen years; whether the Indians are now more stationary than was reported to the Department in 1911; and also whether there is any building available in which a school might be given a trial temporarily; whether board and lodging could be obtained among the white people for a teacher and any other information that you consider might be helpful to the Department in giving consideration to this request.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 12th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier -\n\nIn 1911 the Department had an application for the establishment of a school in the Indian village at Blunden Harbour, Kwawkewlth Agency. On November 24th of that year I wrote stating that these Indians were said to be Pagans but that we were informed that the mission boat, \"Homespun,\" had visited the Reserves three or four times during the two years previous, and the captain of the boat had told the late Inspector of Schools, Mr. Green, that a school was greatly needed. The letter further stated that in view of the above mentioned facts the Department would like to know whether there was any prospect of the Methodist Church establishing a mission at that point, as if a teacher and a missionary could be sent to these Indians for a time the Department would be prepared to allow a fair grant for the services as teacher.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal, Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nApparently no reply was received to this letter, and I should be glad to know if you have knowledge of conditions at this point, and if not, whether you would be disposed to make enquiries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of March 12th re the Indian Village at Blunder Harbour, B.C., the Rev. Mr. Raley, Chairman of the Port Simpson District was of the opinion that this place should be supplied with a Missionary Teacher. I am not familiar with the conditions nor the people there, but I will make enquiries and let you know.\n\nYour letter also of March 31st te hand today, I quite agree with your decision. Mr. Clement wanted me to make application to supply a hot meal at noon, and I wrote him to the effect that the Department would not entertain such a proposition among such a small number of people. I will write him and let him know the decision of the Department.\n\nSince writing you the other day re visiting Ottawa, I have been arranging my program to be there on the 22nd and 23rd of this month if these dates are suitable to you.\n\nI have noted carefully what you say about Nut Lake and will govern myself accordingly.

Also, I might mention for your guidance that as the Indians here make their living fishing, which fish they at present have to sell to Blushardie Bay Vancouver Island, it is our intention next season to employ them fishing for us & handle the fish from Blunden Harbour.\n\nIn any event it will be towards fall when they return now, & if your department would be ready to move by appointing a teacher, I will try to arrange for a temporary building.\n\nAs regards sending their children to the Indian boarding school at Alert Bay, I admit that would not be the case for some time if the Indians would do so. But the past has amply proved that they will not, & never will, as it is too much against their native temperament, to trust anything they value out of their sight; they will not part with their children. The Indians here have been sadly neglected, & can speak very little English, & as to religion, I cannot find out that they have any.\nBoard & lodging could be obtained amongst the white settlers, & I think that it is quite possible that if your debt. suitably a teacher to teach the Indians, who was also capable of teaching a small class of white children, the settlers might agree to put the necessary permanent buildings up themselves.\n\nThis latter is merely a suggestion & has not been discussed by my association as yet, & it would probably be a good idea until a Provincial school is established.\n\nWhen I tell you that the Indians here have not a single animal outside of cats & dogs, & do not grow a single vegetable of any kind, not even a wild berry patch, you will readily see that they require some general instruction from the first along these lines as well as ordinary school subjects.\n\nApologizing for delay in writing, but I was waiting to get photos developed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. W. Blatch\nOttawa, June 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been asked to establish a school for the Indians at Blunden Harbour in the Kwawkewlth Agency. There are said to be about thirty children of school age whose parents make their headquarters there and it is claimed that if a school were started there the children and older Indians would remain at Blunden Harbour the whole year round. These Indians make their living by fishing and the Department is informed that it is the intention of a fishing company to employ the Indians to fish for them and handle the fish for them at Blunden Harbour. The fishing company, of which Mr. R. O. Clark, is the manager, has made the offer of a temporary building and has asked for the appointment of a teacher and the necessary equipment.\n\nBefore granting their request the Department would be pleased if you would visit this locality and make a full report in regard to this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There is absolutely no business of any kind there nor does any steamboat call. I understand that Mr. Clarke proposes, at some future date, to establish a fishing industry and sawmill at Blunden Harbour but at the present time nothing definite has been done.\n\nI would suggest that this matter be allowed to rest in abeyance for the present until it is seen whether the industries, which Mr. Clarke hopes to start, assume proportions sufficient to provide employment for the Indians at Blunden Harbour in order that they may stay at home during the whole of the year. At present they do not reside at their village for more than six months out of the twelve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 19, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June 12th and Departmental reply of June 25th, with regard to establishing a day school at Blunden Harbour, I beg to say that the Department has enquired fully into this matter and it is regretted that owing to present conditions, no action can be taken now.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR.

For several years this school has been closed; but knowing there would be a large assembly of Indians at this village during the winter of 1903-1904, I wrote an official letter to our Indian Agent last September informing him that Mr. Wilson had been appointed by myself to teach in this school commencing Oct. 1st 1903. Twice during the winter the Agent visited this school and reported to me that the teacher was doing all that could be expected of him. I also visited this school and am satisfied Mr. Wilson is a very efficient teacher.\n\nThe school returns for the two quarters have been sent into the Department. You yourself, Sir, know so well how migratory are the habits of these Indians and how we are compelled to teach them when and where we can find them, gathered together.\n\nI cannot get certificated teachers for the salary the Department pay their teachers, and I consider myself fortunate in securing Mr. Wilson's services for the small stipend of $400. per annum. There is an excellent school building at Fort Rupert which the Mission erected ten years ago, and I now beg to ask the Department that in future they will be ready to pay the Teacher's salary whenever there are sufficient pupils at this village to warrant the opening of this school.\n\nI\nI have already paid Mr. Wilson the sum of $200.00 for the six months work he did at Fort Rupert and I respectfully ask your Department to pay the usual grant, viz., $75.00 per quarter for the teaching given in the Day School at Fort Rupert for the two quarters ending March 31st 1904.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) Alfred J.

Hall of Alert Bay, B.C. representative of the Church Missionary Society, for a grant for the payment of a salary of a day school teacher at Fort Rupert, Kwawkewlth Agency, I have the honor to enclose herewith for the consideration of the Department, a copy of a letter, of the 29th instant, today received from the Reverend gentleman requesting that for the reasons therein given the Department make payment for the services rendered by Mr. Daniel Wilson, school teacher at that point for December quarter 1903 and March quarter 1904.\n\nAs in Mr. Agent DeBeck's report relating to this school, transmitted to Department under cover of letter from this office of the 27th instant, No. M-4,35, he expresses doubt as to the likelihood of the Society being able to secure the attendance of a sufficient number of children at the school were it recognized by a grant, by the Department. I have informed the Reverend Mr. Hall that I fear in view of recent events which have transpired, that it is too late for him to expect compliance with his request but that the application would be submitted to the Department for its consideration; and I also informed Mr. Hall that his letter should have, according to regulations, been sent through the local Indian Agent.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

A.J. Hall of Alert Bay B.C., representative of the Church Missionary Society, for a grant to meet the salary of the teacher at the Day School carried on under the Society's auspices at Fort Rupert in the Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nOn the 25th instant a letter was received from Mr. Agent DeBeck, Kwawkewlth Agency, reporting respecting the attendance at Gwayasdums school for March quarter last as required by your letter of 25th of April last, File No. 117860/3. A duplicate of Mr. DeBeck's letter is being sent to the Department under cover of letter of even date No. 3/M-4, in answer to communication of the date and file number just quoted, from which it will be perceived that, for the reasons therein stated, the Agent cannot see why the Department should pay the salary of a teacher at Fort Rupert.\n\nIn view, therefore, of Mr. DeBeck's report I would recommend that the sum available be applied for the payment of the grant for the teacher's salary at Yuquot, in the West Coast Agency, where for some time past school has been conducted, while the Indians were at home, by the Roman Catholic priest of the locality.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\nH. S. Clements M.D.\nVancouver P.C.\n\nHarley Bay\n3rd Jan 1920\n\nDear Sir,\n\nActing on your suggestion, I have collected the necessary data regarding the opening up of an Indian school at Fort Rupert. You will easily understand after seeing the enclosed list how necessary it is that a school should be started at Fort Rupert; that place being much more convenient for the Indians that live on the north end of the island than Alert Bay, where there only means of going to and from their respective homes is by boat. This trip can often be attended with no little risk owing to weather conditions. Not only is it only more convenient but if the information that I have gathered is correct there is not enough room for any more scholars there, as you undoubtedly know. I believe you to be thoroughly conversant with conditions up here so will not trouble you with details. Therefore will leave the matter in your hands knowing it will receive your\nfullest consideration. If I can gather any more information regarding this matter I will only be glad to do so. The Indians there me to thank you for the interest you have always taken in their behalf. I wish you were only here to see as I see their enthusiasm and appreciation you would feel well rewarded for the valuable time you have spent and I hope will continue to spend in their cause.\n\nWishing you and yours a happy new year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWalter Tead\nFort Rupert\n\nS.

I am enclosing the letter from Mr. Read who I asked to give me the information and the actual number of children eligible for schooling.\n\nMy sympathy is with the request as I feel that these children should be given every possible opportunity for an education. I wish you would give it your attention.\n\nWith very best wishes for the New Year,\n\nI am,\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHSC/W\n\nEnc.\nOttawa Jan 12 1912\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the request for the establishment of a day school for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the reserves in the vicinity of Fort Rupert in the Kwakwala Agency, I beg to say that the Fort Rupert group consists of six small reserves, as follows\u2014Tsa-kis, Kippase, Shell Island, Tsulquate, Thomas Point and Kaogh.\n\nFrom the analysis of evidence taken before the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs for the Province of British Columbia it is stated that there are 118 Indians residing on these reserves. Their chief occupations are fishing, trapping, boat building and working for wages. There was a general complaint made by these Indians of inadequate educational, hospital and medical facilities. The Indians claim that the Alert Bay Schools are crowded and ask for the establishment of a day school with an experienced teacher at No. 1 Reserve (Tsa-kis), and promise a regular attendance of all children of school age, if such a school is established.\n\nThe number of children of school age, as shown by the attached lists, is 14 at Fort Rupert and 17 at Blunden Harbour. It is requested that a school be started at Fort Rupert, as that place is much more convenient for the Indians. The nearest schools are at Alert Bay, a distance of about 27 miles southeast.\n\nI can find in the Records Branch no previous request for the establishment of a school for these Indians.\n\nIt would, no doubt, be necessary to have a suitable building erected for school purposes and, possibly, quarters for a teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, January 12, 1920.\nOttawa, January 14th, 1920\n\nDear Mr. Clements,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with enclosure regarding the establishment of a day school for the Indians of the Fort Rupert group of reserves. I shall give this matter my sympathetic attention and shall at once ask for a comprehensive report from our local agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. S. Clements, Esq., M.P.,\n535 Pender Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, January 27, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received for the establishment of a day school for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the reserves in the vicinity of Fort Rupert in the Kwakwakawlk Agency.\n\nThe Department is informed that there are 14 children of school age at Fort Rupert and 17 at Blunden Harbour. It is requested that the school be started at Fort Rupert as that place is the most convenient for all the Indian children residing on the Fort Rupert group of reserves.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a full report concerning this request. You should state the number of Indian children who would be likely to attend and point out where you suggest the school should be located. You should also state whether a suitable building for school purposes can be obtained and the cost of renting the same. It may be that there is a church building that would serve the purpose and which can be obtained. If a new building is required to be erected for the purpose you should give a careful estimate of the size and cost of building the same.\n\nIt is hoped that you will give your views fully in this matter and furnish full particulars in order to enable the Department to deal intelligently with the request of these Indians for the providing of school facilities for their children.\n\nIf a suitable building can be obtained without the need of erecting one, you should state what will need to be supplied in order to fit it up for school purposes. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention and inform the Department at an early date as fully as you can regarding this request.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nIn answer to your letter of January 27th regarding a request for the establishment of a Day School for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the reserves in the vicinity of Fort Rupert in this agency, I beg to inform you that yesterday I visited Fort Rupert and went thoroughly into this matter.\n\nI found after careful investigation that there were in all twelve children of school age belonging to the Indians who are resident more or less in the vicinity of Fort Rupert. Of these children the parents of two of them are living at Hardy Bay on Tsulquate Reserve and they are attending the public school at Hardy Bay. Of the ten remaining ones one is almost the full age of eighteen while another one has only just turned five.\n\nWith regard to the Indians from Blunden Harbor uniting with those of Fort Rupert to form a joint school I would inform you that Blunden Harbor is about eighteen miles in a direct line from Fort Rupert and that the two points are separated by the lower end of Queen Charlotte Sound which in stormy weather is a very dangerous piece of water and could not be traversed in bad weather so that a union of the two villages to form one school would be absolutely out of the question.\n\nOf the children residing at Fort Rupert I find that there are only resident at Fort Rupert about seven months in each year. There is one white family by the name of Cadwallader living at Fort Rupert who operate a store there and Mrs. Cadwallader is a blood relation of three of the parents of the\nIndian Children who are eligible for the school. Mrs. Cadwallader has six children of school age and two under school age, and while I could not recommend that an Indian Day School should be established at Fort Rupert I would recommend that the matter be taken up with the Provincial Educational Authorities in the person of the Superintendent of Education at Victoria and see if an arrangement could not be made by which a joint school could be opened and maintained at Fort Rupert. There are no other children either white or Indian within distance to supplement the attendance so that they would be entirely dependent for attendance on the children already mentioned. I think if the matter was taken up with the Provincial Authorities they would be ready to meet us halfway, and an average attendance of at least ten children combined white and Indians could be expected.\n\nThere are no school buildings of any kind at Skutz Fort Rupert, but there are two Indian houses which are at present empty which could be rented at a very reasonable figure for a school room, and Mr. Cadwallader informed me that if any such arrangement could be made he would become responsible for the supplying of a building for the school. The only expense in fitting either of these buildings for a schoolroom would be the desks and a stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 23, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a request for the establishment of a day school for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the reserves in the vicinity of Fort Rupert in the Kwawkweith Agency.\n\nThis matter was taken up with Mr. Agent Halliday, who now states that, after careful investigation, he finds that there are twelve children of school age belonging to the Indians who reside more or less in the vicinity of Fort Rupert. He states that these children with their parents are only resident at this point about seven months in the year, and besides there are six or seven white children of school age who could attend, if a school were established.\n\nMr. Agent Halliday recommends that this matter be taken up with the provincial educational authorities in the person of the Superintendent of Education at Victoria with a view to arranging for a joint school for the Indian and white children.\n\nThere are no school buildings of any kind at Fort Rupert, but there are two Indian houses, at present empty, which could be rented at a very reasonable figure for school use and which would be very suitable for the purpose. The only expense in fitting up either of these buildings for a school-room would be the supplying of the desks required and a stove.\n\nThe Department would like you to take this matter up with the Department of Education for the Province of British Columbia and ascertain from them whether they would be prepared to establish a school at Fort Rupert, provided this Department contributed its share of the cost of teacher's salary and maintenance. An arrangement of this kind has been made with the Department of Education for the province of Manitoba in the case of several combined white and Indian schools and is meeting with success. The Department will be pleased if you will, at your earliest convenience, ascertain from the Provincial Department of Education whether they would be prepared to carry out the establishment of a combined school for the Indians and whites at Fort Rupert. They could appoint the teacher, fit up a school-room and this Department would pay a proportionate share of the cost quarterly upon receipt of a statement showing the cost involved each quarter.\n\nIf you desire any further information it might be well for you to communicate with Mr. Agent Halliday.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nI may say that the Department is anxious to comply with the request of the Indian parents for the provision of educational facilities for their children, but it would hardly be justified in conducting a school for the number of Indian children who would likely attend, and, therefore, if the Department of Education for the Province would combine with this Department, provision could be made for the education of both the Indian and white children and the cost thereof would not bear unduly on either department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the establishment of a day school for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the reserves in the vicinity of Fort Rupert.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Bitchburn is being requested to take this matter up with the Department of Education for the Province of British Columbia and ascertain from them whether they will be prepared to establish a combined white and Indian school at Fort Rupert, provided this Department contributes its share of the cost of teacher's salary and maintenance.\n\nI may say that, while the Department is anxious to comply with the request of the Indian parents for the provision of educational facilities for their children, it would hardly be justified in conducting a school for the number of Indian children who would likely attend and therefore, if the Department of Education for the province, as suggested by you, would combine with this Department, provision could be made for the education of both the white and Indian children and the cost thereof would not bear unduly on either Department.\n\nThe Inspector is being asked to communicate with you, should he require any further information.\n\nWith reference to a school for the Indian children at Blunden Harbor I have to request that you will furnish a report concerning the situation at this point. You should state the number of children who would likely attend and whether a suitable building could be secured, and furnish as complete a report as you did in the case of Fort Rupert. You should also state fully your views as to the best means to be adopted to provide educational facilities for the Indian children at Blunden Harbor and vicinity. This information you should furnish after your next visit to that locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nI am in receipt of your letter of February 24th, dealing with my report regarding the establishment of a school at Fort Rupert.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to report that yesterday before receipt of your letter I returned from Blunden Harbor from a visit to the Indians there. I found only a few of them at home amongst them being two children of school age. The difficulty with establishing a school of any kind at Blunden Harbor, is, that the Indians are only there from about the middle of November until sometime in February or March according to weather conditions. During the rest of the year they are scattered and could not attend at any school. I have told them several times that their best plan is to send their children to the Industrial school and Girls Home respectively where they will receive proper care and attention. Another difficulty arises in connection with these schools owing to the fact that the Industrial School is full and a number of applicants have to be refused admission. A number of the pupils in both these schools come from other agencies and I have tried to impress on the principal of the school the fact that these schools were built primarily for the Indians of this agency and that their needs must receive the first consideration with which view he fully concurs. Each year he has held vacancies open to allow children from this\nAgency to be placed on the membership roll, but they have not come and not wanting to allow any vacancies in the school he has afterwards allowed other children who were on the spot to be placed in the school. In some instances three months after the school has resumed operations after the holidays some of these who wanted to attend have come along but found there was no room. Under present conditions I could not recommend any Day School at Blunden Harbor, but I will take every opportunity to impress on them the necessity of being in time so that the children can be placed in the Industrial schools.\n\nAt the present time there are no industries of any kind at Blunden Harbor to give employment to the Indians at or near home, but, it is quite possible that in a few years time that industries will be established there such as saw mills and shingle mills and when the Indians can get employment they may remain at the village for a greater length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 17, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you furnish a report regarding the establishment of a school for the Indian children at Blunden Harbour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of your report it would be useless to open a school for the Indian children at this point. The Department agrees with you that the best solution as regards their education, would be to have them placed in the schools at Alert Bay and you should endeavour to have as many as possible of the children who are of school age and in good health, sent there upon the re-opening of these schools after the summer holidays. No doubt, a number of the children at present in attendance at both the day and Girls' Home will be receiving their discharge at that time and you should arrange with the principal to reserve accommodation for a certain number of the children from Blunden Harbour. It is hoped that the parents will consent to allow their children to go to Alert Bay.\n\nThe Department has not as yet received any communication as to the action to be taken by the Department of Education for the Province of British Columbia regarding the proposal made to them by Mr. Inspector Ditchburn for the establishment of a combined white and Indian day school at Fort Rupert.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the establishment of a school at Fort Rupert for the joint education of Indian and white children, and in reply I beg to say that I wrote to the Superintendent of Education on the 16th instant and am today in receipt of a reply from him in which he states that it will be impossible to establish such a school unless there are at least ten children of school age (between six and sixteen years), other than those residing on the Indian reserve, available for attendance. He further informs me that the School Law makes no provision for the establishment of schools which may be partly supported and maintained by the Provincial Government and partly by the Federal Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nMarch 31, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Clements:\n\nReferring to your recent interview with me regarding the establishment of a Day School for the Indians in the vicinity of Fort Rupert, B.C., I have just received a communication from Mr. Ditchburn, who, you will recollect, was asked to interview the Provincial authorities with a view to establishing a joint school. In his letter Mr. Ditchburn states that the Superintendent of Education has informed him that it will be impossible to establish such a school unless there are at least ten children of school age (whites). He further states that the school law makes no provision for the establishment of schools which may be partly supported and maintained by the Provincial Government and partly by the Federal Government.\n\nOf course we are aware of this but nevertheless mutually satisfactory arrangements have been made in other Provinces. It seems to me, therefore, that the next advisable step would be to ascertain definitely how many white children of school age there are in that vicinity. If there is a sufficient number to justify the establishment of a school by the Provincial authorities, we would be pleased to co-operate in the cost of maintenance.\n\nYou might consider the matter further and see me at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH.S. Clements, Esq.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOctober 12, 1927.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRev. John Antle, Superintendent of Columbia Coast Missions, who called at the Department today, requested that assistance be given towards the salary of a teacher at Fort Rupert, which is situated on Vancouver Island, about 20 miles northwest of Alert Bay. He states there are approximately 20 children of school age at this point. He has a lady teacher in view and is arranging to send her to start a school. It will be conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church. In conversation with Dr. Scott, Rev. Mr. Antle was promised that the Department would provide salary at the rate of $50 per teaching month and would also supply the necessary classroom material, including tooth brushes. Mr. Antle will write the Department officially, giving a list of the material required. The Department should then inform Mr. Agent Halliday.\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.\nROOM 603 - 198 HASTINGS ST. W.\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nOct. 19th 1927.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nSupt Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nReferring to our conversation of last week, I am writing to make application for a grant of money to pay the salary of a teacher at the Indian Village of Fort Rupert British Columbia, and also for school supplies for 30 children ranging from 6 to 16 years. The tooth brushes you mentioned would be most useful and also anything else the Department may have on hand which would help to equip a small school at its starting point.\n\nI have in view a woman teacher, Miss Gray, of Winnipeg, about 28 years of age, of good physique and with a sound outlook on life. I have offered her a salary of $50. per teaching month, and hope to supplement it by board and lodging which I think will be supplied by a white family there for tuition of their children.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval,\n\nI am Yours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. John Antle\nOttawa, October 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of today's date to the Rev. John Antle, Superintendent of the Columbia Coast Mission. I may say that Mr. Antle visited Ottawa some days ago and his representations were such that the Department decided to give a trial to the Fort Rupert Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOctober 19, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Antle:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, concerning the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. The appointment of Miss Gray at a salary of $50 per month is approved. If you will let me have shipping directions, I shall be glad to see that classroom supplies, toothbrushes, etc., are forwarded without delay. When the teacher is at the school, she should write to Mr. Indian Agent W. M. Halliday, at Alert Bay, concerning any other equipment that she requires for the satisfactory conduct of the work. You might let me know Miss Gray's initials at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Columbia Coast Mission, Inc.\nNovember 2, 1927.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have just arrived in Vancouver, and find your letter of October 19th, for which thanks very much.\n\nI was able to see Miss Gray at Winnipeg on my way through, and find that she is waiting the consent of her people who are now in England, and it looks to me as if nothing much will be done before the first of the year.\n\nI also find that she is a Public School teacher with the usual diploma and that she also has a V.A.D. certificate and some knowledge of maternity nursing. This, in my opinion makes her a valuable woman if we can get her, and she seems very anxious indeed to take up the work. Her full name is Miss C.M. Gray, of 530 Banning Street, Winnipeg.\n\nI would suggest that the material for school equipment etc. be held until we know something of the probably date of starting the school. I would suggest, as in my former letter, that the material be shipped to our office at the above address in Vancouver, from whence it can be taken by our Hospital Vessel to Port Rupert.\n\nYou were kind enough to give me a blue book containing the Act in relation to the Indians, but I must have left it on your table or in one of the other offices, as I had not it in my possession when I arrived home. Will you be kind enough to send me a copy by mail as I am anxious to have the facts of the legislation concerning the Indians.\n\nI am very pleased with my trip East where I was able to interest a number of the leading business men in Eastern Canada.\nOttawa, November 10, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the obtaining of the services of a teacher for the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. It is noted that Miss Gray, the teacher whom you have engaged, will be unable to take up duties before the beginning of the new year. The qualifications which she possesses have been noted and are satisfactory.\n\nThe supplying of the school material will be held over until we hear from you as to when this will be required. It will be sent at that time to the address given by you. A copy of the Indian Act is being sent under separate cover.\n\nI am pleased to note that your recent trip East has been successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Columbia Coast Mission, Inc.\nRoom 603 - 196 Hastings St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nClassroom material\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation with the Deputy Superintendent General, I have to inform you that the Department will allow a salary of $40 per month for the winter months for the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. It is understood that you will secure the services of a local young lady for this work. Please let the Department know her name and the post office address for the school. Mr. Indian Agent Halliday has been authorised to forward, not only the quarterly returns from this school - upon receipt of which salary will be paid, but he will also give favourable consideration to requisitions for classroom material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\n603 Province Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of October 19th, 1927, concerning the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. The Department has repeated its offer to Rev. John Antle, Superintendent of the Columbia Coast Mission. He will arrange for the engagement of a local young lady, who will teach during the winter for a salary of $40 per month. Salary will be allowed upon receipt of quarterly returns. You will please forward any requisition for classroom material for this school for the Department's consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nOttawa, December 21, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that you have secured the services of Miss Eva L. Dyer, a qualified teacher, for the Indian Day School at Kingsome Inlet also that Miss M. Nixon will continue the work at Namalilikukla. It is hoped that both these ladies will meet with every success at their respective schools.\n\nIt is noted that arrangements have not yet been completed for a teacher at Fort Rupert but that, likely, Miss Cadwallader will take up teaching duties at this school. We note that she has no professional qualifications but has an intimate knowledge of the Indians at this point and has also the ability to speak their language. Her services will, no doubt, prove satisfactory.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed definitely as to whether Miss Cadwallader takes charge at Fort Rupert and, if so, the date when this school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nRoom 603,\n198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B. C.\nCOLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.\nROOM 603 - 198 HASTINGS ST. WEST\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJan. 22, 1929.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nThank you for your prompt reply to my telegram for school supplies. They will be forwarded promptly from this office as soon as they arrive.\n\nWe started Miss Cadwallader at the school at the beginning of the year. The school will be small to start with as it takes time for the Indians to settle down to it. We got a few home-made desks and other supplies for her from the other Indian Village Schools, so that she was able to start.\n\nI am hoping that one good result from this school will be to encourage the Indian women to stay at home during the fishing season, and look after their children. The custom of the whole population of a village leaving home and camping in hovels near the canneries is, perhaps, one of the greatest detriments to the advancement of the Indian, morally and in every other way. Children are left, whose mothers are working in the cannery, unfed and unattended, with the result that the mortality amongst them in summer, chiefly from mal-nutrition and its effects, is appalling.\n\nIf the schools in years, can manage to help the women at home in their villages, they will do a great thing for the Indian. I am more and more confirmed in my conviction that this effort of developing the Indian by Primary Schools in their own villages, combining medical attention, nursing and social work generally, is going to have more effect than any other movement now on foot for the welfare of the Indian.\n\nThanking you for your very kind interest, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJA/FE\n\nSupt. C. C. M.\nFebruary 16, 1929.\n\nI visited the following schools on the above date:\n\nFORT RUPERT SCHOOL\n\nA start has been made on the Fort Rupert School, where Miss Cadwallader is teaching under grant from the Department a small school of children, averaging about ten through the winter season. Not much is expected of this school this year, but next year should see a great improvement, when the Indians find out that their children can be taught in this village.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nThe work done in these schools has been under the supervision of the Anglican Church in co-operation with the Indian Department. This work is greatly appreciated by the Department of Indian Affairs, as these children are receiving religious training from the Columbian Mission.\n\nT.H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. JOHN ANTLE,\nSUPERINTENDENT, COLUMBIA COAST MISSION, INC.,\ndated Sept. 27, 1929.\n\nOriginal on 156-17-1.\n\nLast year, you were kind enough to help us start the school at Fort Rupert by a grant of $40.00 per month. We obtained a teacher who knew the language and who did very good and important work in starting the school, but $40.00 a month is not quite enough when she is supplying the school house as well, and I would like you, if you can possibly do it, to add to that salary. I think that it is quite as well worth $75.00 as either of the other two schools, and you will see by reports that, for a start, she has made a good record.\nOctober 9, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Antle:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I am pleased to learn that the Fort Rupert Indian Day School has had a promising opening. The March and June quarter returns have been received by the Department and indicate that the work may be worth while. The Department approves of a salary of $75 per teaching month for Miss Cadwallader, the teacher. Salary at this rate will be paid for the September quarter, as soon as the return is received.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 602 - 198 Hastings St. West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 18, 1930\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing the quarterly report from Miss V. Cadwalladar, teacher of the Fort Rupert Indian Day School for the quarter ending June 30th.\n\nI am beginning to question the wisdom of continuing this school, as the pupilage is very small and the attendance very irregular, and there should be room at the Residential School for all these pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMiss Victoria Alexandra Cadwallader. Age 24. $750 per annum.\n\nQualifications:- No Certificate; states she has one year High School (By correspondence). I am unable to verify this, though I have tried to do so.\n\nSuccess:- This school is in a most unsatisfactory condition.\n\nOn April 20th, when Mr. Indian Agent Halliday and I visited the school, there were no children present. The teacher was behind the counter in the store. We told her that we must have some of the children at school in the afternoon. There were, I understand, only four children then in the village. Of these, three came to school in the afternoon.\n\nThe school is so unattractive that I can see no reason why children should want to attend.\n\nThe only furniture consisted of four new single desks and five old home made desks of no value. The four single desks seem to be the four missing from Mamallililikulla. I am informed that Mr. Antle of the Columbia Coast Mission moved these desks to Fort Rupert. No permission for their movement was given by the Indian Agent.\n\nThe schoolroom is the back room of a store. The store is owned, I understand, by the teacher's brother. The schoolroom is about 14 ft. by 16 ft. with a stairs up to an attic. It is quite unsuitable for school purposes. The room is half-filled with all sorts of store goods, old clothes, mattresses, hardware, etc. Light is from two windows. There is a woodburning stove.\n\nGeneral Remarks:- I do not consider that Miss Cadwallader has any qualification of any sort which would make her retention as a teacher under the Department of Indian Affairs desirable.\n\nShe is partly Indian, has no professional training whatever, and her non-professional standing, if we are to take her own statement, of only one year at high school quite inadequate.\n\nThere are far too few children in this village to make up a fair average attendance for a day school.\n\nI beg to strongly recommend that, after the end of the present school year, no further grant be made for a teacher's salary at Fort Rupert.\n\nThe four new desks in this school should be returned to Mamallilikulla Indian Day School to which they appear to belong.\nOttawa, May 16, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, who recently visited the Indian day school which is being conducted at Fort Rupert, states that this school is in a most unsatisfactory condition. He also states that on the day he visited the school there were no children present, and that he was informed there were only four children then in the village. He further stated that the classroom is so unattractive that he could see no reason why children should want to attend. He did not consider that Miss Cadwallader, the teacher, has any qualifications of any sort which would make her retention as a teacher desirable.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report, and also owing to the fact that there are too few children in this village to make up a fair average attendance for a day school, the Department has decided to discontinue the grant allowed for the teacher's salary as from the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next.\n\nWe are requesting the local Indian Agent to have the four new desks at this school which were transferred from the Mamalilikulla Indian School returned to that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent, Columbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 603 - 198 Hastings St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, May 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, in a report from Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, he states the work being performed at the Indian day school at Fort Rupert is unsatisfactory and that there are too few children in this village to make up a fair average attendance for a day school. He also states that the classroom in which the school is conducted is unsuitable.\n\nThe Department is informing Rev. John Antle, Superintendent of Columbia Coast Mission, Vancouver, under whose auspices the school is conducted, that the Department has decided to discontinue the grant allowed for the teacher's salary at the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the returning of the four desks to the Mamalilikulla Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 16th ultimo, regarding conditions at the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. We have discussed this matter with Rev. John Antle, Superintendent, Columbia Coast Mission, who recently visited the Department, and have decided to allow this school to continue in operation during the coming school year. Mr. Antle has pointed out that, although Miss Cadwallader, the teacher, has no professional qualifications, she is performing good service, not only with the Indian children in the classroom but also among the Indian families at Fort Rupert. Mr. Antle will, in due course, visit this point and endeavour to arrange more attractive quarters for the classes, with a view to improving conditions. I have to request that you will give any assistance you can in the work at this school and endeavour to encourage the Indian families in seeing that the children attend regularly while they are at home from the Fisheries.\n\nWe will continue salary for the teacher at the same rate as previously paid, viz., $75 per teaching month.\n\nRegarding the instructions which you received to return the four desks from this school to the Mamalilikulla Day School, I have to say that, if you have not already carried out these instructions, the desks are to remain at Fort Rupert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 16th ultimo and also to conversation with you while in the Department yesterday, relative to continuing the Indian day school at Fort Rupert, I have to say that, as you were informed in our conversation, the Department will be pleased to approve of the continuing of this school activity for the coming school year. The Department also approves of Miss Cadwallader continuing teaching duties, with salary at the same rate as previously paid, viz., $75 per teaching month, payment of same being made direct to the Columbia Coast Mission at the end of each quarter, upon receipt of the usual returns showing attendance, days' taught, etc. Mr. Agent Halliday is being informed accordingly, and requested to give any assistance he can in the work at this school.\n\nThe Department would be pleased if arrangements could be made to improve the condition of the room in which the classes are conducted, with a view to making it as attractive as possible for the children who attend. It is hoped that there will be a good attendance of the Indian children during the period the Indians will reside at Fort Rupert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

WEST\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJuly 21st 1931.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Office,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nI was sorry not to have met you while in Ottawa in May, but I want to say that I appreciate very much the reception I received at the hands of your staff, especially in the matter of the school at Fort Rupert; which had been reported adversely by the inspector. I have not been able to see the inspector yet but have no doubt that he will understand, as your staff did, the answer to his objections. The two points made by him were the unsuitability of the room and the lack of qualification of the teacher.\n\nMy answer to the first is that the Cadwallader living room while it lacks much that might be desirable in the way of a school, is a large and airy room with fireplace and good ventilation, and above all being the big house of the village, (Mrs Cadwallader is an Indian Princess the halfbreed, is well educated and highly respected) the children look upon it as a privilege to be able to go to the house. At Kingcome Inlet before the new school was built, an old ramshackle deserted house was used, far inferior to that now used at Fort Rupert. But it was a beginning and resulted as I hope this beginning at Fort Rupert will result.\n\nWith regard to the teacher's qualification, Victoria Cadwallader has received a good common school education quite sufficient for the work she has to do, which is entirely primary and chiefly preparation for the big school at Alert Bay. Her great qualification is that she speaks the language, which is a great help in preparing the children for the big school. Before these day schools were established the pupils went up to the big school without knowing a word of English which made it difficult for the teachers to grade them. Now they can be graded as soon as they arrive. In my opinion this qualification is more important for this work than any other qualification. I would hesitate to put a girl graduate of the normal school in a position of this kind. The shortness of the teaching season would make it impossible to get qualified teacher to accept such a position anyway.\nSome good has come out of the report. I have visited the village, and have spoken to the chiefs, and they are very much concerned. I am hoping it will mean the building of a small school room and in a special effort being made to keep the women and children away from the canneries. This year's pilgrimage of women and children to the canneries, in my opinion, is an obstruction to Indian progress both educationally and morally, and I am doing what I can to combat it. If one only had the backing of the Indian Agent instead of the opposition, this condition might be soon eliminated.\n\nThe Department has in the past paid fuel bills for the school at Kingcome River. This year the Indians helped with wood, but wood is so difficult to get in that district that we were compelled to send them coal. I am enclosing bills in duplicate.\n\nWith apologies for so long a letter,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.: C.C.M., In c.\n\nJA/BD\nOttawa, July 29th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on your inspection of the Fort Rupert Indian Day School in April last, regarding the services being performed by Miss Victoria Cadwallader, the teacher, I have to inform you that the Department has had an opportunity of discussing Miss Cadwallader's services with Rev. John Antle, Superintendent, Columbia Coast Mission.\n\nMr. Antle states that Miss Cadwallader has received a good common school education quite sufficient for the work she has to do, which is entirely primary and chiefly preparation for the big school at Alert Bay. Her great qualification is that she speaks the language, which is a great help in preparing the children for the big school. Before these day schools were established, the pupils went up to the big school without knowing a word of English, which made it difficult for the teachers to grade them. Now they can be graded as soon as they arrive. In my opinion, this qualification is more important for this work than any other qualification. I would hesitate to put a girl graduate of the normal school in a position of this kind. The shortness of the teaching season would make it impossible to get a qualified teacher to accept such a position anyway.\n\nThe Department, in view of Mr. Antle's report, is approving of the re-appointment of Miss Cadwallader for the coming school year and Mr. Agent Halliday has been informed accordingly. It is hoped that there will be better progress made during the next school year.\n\nRegarding the accommodation provided for classroom purposes, Mr. Antle has discussed this matter with the Indians and he states that, while the room in which the class is conducted lacks much that might be desirable, it is a large and airy room with fireplace and good ventilation and that, above all, being the big house of the village, the children look upon it as a privilege to be able to go to the house.\n\nThe Department cannot insist on fully qualified teachers being obtained for outlying and isolated schools such as at Fort Rupert and, in making our inspection, you should take into account all circumstances regarding each of these isolated schools visited by you. The teachers, while not fully qualified, may, from their familiarity with the Indians, be doing special work other than teaching duties which is of real value in the welfare of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGerald H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, July 29th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the teaching and classroom conditions at the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. It is noted that an improvement will be made in the classroom facilities.\n\nWe are communicating with Mr. Inspector Barry relative to the services of Miss Cadwallader and informing him that the Department has approved of her re-engagement for the coming school year and, in this connection, I beg to refer you to official letter dated June 5th, last.\n\nA cheque will be sent you in due course in payment for the coal and wood supplied for use at the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School and for the freight and cartage on same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At this inspection I was accompanied by Mr. Indian Agent Halliday, who informed me that he would also report on the school. As suggested in the last paragraph of your letter, all circumstances regarding the school and its teacher were taken into account by the Indian Agent and myself. My report was made in accordance with the instructions contained in and attached to Departmental letter 4-210 dated January 14, 1931. I had previously inspected the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, and was aware of the poor preparation being given by the small Indian Day Schools to the children going on to the Residential School.\n\nAs stated in my report on the Fort Rupert Indian Day School, I consider this school to be in a most unsatisfactory condition. I regret that I am quite unable to agree with the statements of the Reverend Mr. Antle, quoted in paragraph two of your letter.\n\nRegarding the accommodation provided for the School, do not understand what the Reverend Mr. Antle means by \"The big house of the village\". The School was at first carried on in a private house, owned I believe by Mr. Cadwalader, but as stated in my report the back room or store is now being used. This room, in its present condition, is quite unsuitable for school purposes as it is half filled with all sorts of surplus goods, old clothes, groceries, hardware, etc.\n\nI much regret that the Department has seen fit to accept the Reverend Mr. Antle's report as against those of his own Agent and Inspector. This letter, as well as my previous report on Fort Rupert Indian Day School will place on record my carefully considered and professional opinion on the subject.\n\nThe Departmental letters above quoted have been before Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, through whom reply is being forwarded, in order that he may be made aware of its contents, the matter of Fort Rupert Indian School having come up during a conference between the Right Reverend Bishop Schofield, and myself on a recent occasion.\n\nAll the above is most respectfully submitted for information of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, with respect to the Indian Day School at Fort Rupert in the Kwakwakwah Agency. This is being referred to you personally at your request, this being the matter which we discussed with Captain Barry when you were in Victoria.\n\nIt is understood from Inspector Barry that in a recent conversation had between himself and Rev. Mr. Antle, the latter, after being in accord with the Inspector's representations, would communicate with the Department pointing out that his (Mr. Antle's) representations to the Department were made without a knowledge of the conditions as complained of by Inspector Barry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Bitchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nColumbia Coast Mission, Inc.\nROOM 603 - 19B HASTINGS ST. WEST\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJanuary 18th 1932\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI intended writing to you earlier on the matter of Fort Rupert School, but was waiting to see what the Indians could do in the way of a building at Fort Rupert. They promised to be responsible for half the cost of a small building plans of which were provided by the school inspector, costing a total of about $1000.00.\n\nYou remember last Spring the inspector reported against the school, for two reasons, the qualifications of the teacher, and the building. In the first case I still maintain that a girl of Victoria Cadwallader's education being able to talk the language will do better work than a regular teacher just finished training, which is all we can expect to get.\n\nIn regard to the latter, the condition of the room; I found on investigation, that the inspector was right, and told him so. Without my knowledge they had moved the school from the comfortable living room in which it was started to a room off the store, and the inspector was quite right in condemning it.\n\nAs soon as I had knowledge of this, I cancelled the teachers appointment and did not open the school. I also held a meeting with the Indians and find them very keen to have a school for the younger children in order to be able to keep them at home when very young and in the meanwhile to have them instructed and prepared for the big school at Alert Bay. They offered, as I said to raise half the cost of the building.\n\nAs the salary of the teacher was granted but not used, would it be possible to have the amount diverted to the building of the school? There are 14 children there of primary school age and the Indians have promised more regular attendance in future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission Inc.\n\nP.S. So far we have not had salaries for Kingcome or Valley. The regular reports have been sent in through W. Walliday. We have been paying the teachers monthly out of C.M. funds, but I presume the salaries will be forthcoming in due time.\nOttawa, January 20, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. Before the Department considers an expenditure of $500 towards the cost of providing a proper classroom, I think it advisable for you to satisfy either Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn or Mr. Inspector Barry that there will be a worthwhile attendance of our wards if a school is conducted at this point. During the next few weeks, when you are in Victoria or when either of our officers is in Vancouver, you might arrange for an interview. I am writing to the Commissioner, asking him to let the Department have a recommendation pursuant to your talk with him or with Mr. Barry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. John Antle,\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission,\nRoom 603 - 198 Hastings St. W.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, January 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 15/6/22363 of September 10th, last, concerning the Fort Rupert Indian Day School. The Reverend Mr. Antle has recently written the Department, and he states that Inspector Barry was right. He cancelled the teacher's appointment and did not open the school. His letter reads in part as follows: \"I also held a meeting with the Indians and find them very keen to have a school for the younger children, so that they will be instructed and prepared for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The Indians offered to raise one-half the cost of the building. As the salary of the teacher was granted but not used, would it be possible to have the amount devoted to the building of the school? There are 14 children there of primary school age. The Indians have promised more regular attendance in future.\"\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of official reply to Mr. Antle. When you or Inspector Barry have had an opportunity of discussing this situation with him, will you please make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Halliday at Alert Bay.\n\nThe Indian Agent explained each case as shown in the \"Band Book\". In my report I have shown the name of the father, the sex of the child, the age, where the family lives, and where the child attends school.\n\nI am unable to recommend the establishment of any sort of Indian School at Fort Rupert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

Halliday. We went over the Band Book of the Fort Rupert Indians with very great care. Each child of school age was separately considered.\n\nThe main object in this investigation was to satisfy the Department as to the need for an Indian Day School at Fort Rupert.\n\nWe found that the following children of school age belong to the Fort Rupert Band:\n\n| Name       | Sex | Age | Lives at: | Attends school: |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----------|-----------------|\n| Wilson     | Boy | 7   | Fort Rupert (Part time) | No.             |\n| J.

From this it will be perfectly clear that the necessary attendance, to warrant the establishment of an Indian Day School, is impossible.\n\nThe statement that there are 14 children of primary school age at Fort Rupert, made to the Department, and quoted in Departmental letter 156-31-1 dated January 20, 1932, if intended to mean that the children live there is not in accordance with the facts.\n\nGerald H.

Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of January 12th, last, requesting a grant towards the cost of providing a proper classroom for the Indian children at Fort Rupert, I have to say that Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, who recently visited this locality in company with Mr. Agent Halliday, states that there are not sufficient children residing at this point to carry on school activity.\n\nInspector Barry reports as follows:\n\n\"The only children of school age who would be available for an Indian day school at Fort Rupert are Wilson's boy (part time), the boy and girl of J. Hunt, two girls of J. Knox (part time), and possibly J. Wallace's boy for one month per year.

H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, with regard to the situation at Fort Rupert, insofar as it pertains to the establishment of a day school at that point.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that Rev. John Antle, Superintendent of the Columbia Coast Mission, who requested a grant for the erection of a classroom, is being informed that no useful purpose would be served by the establishment of a day school at this point, as there are not sufficient children residing there to warrant the expenditure in erecting a building and conducting a school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria,\nB.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of March 22nd, No. 156-31-1, regarding the proposed school at Fort Rupert.\n\nI got my information from a meeting of the Indians at Fort Rupert, presided over by old chief O, as he is called, an Indian of great integrity and very much respected by the whole tribe. Mr. Halliday has been opposed to the idea of schools outside of Alert Bay and brings the inspector to Rupert at times when the Indians are away, and I was informed by the Indians that he had not visited the village for three years till he brought the inspector. However, that is neither here nor there. The Department has the right to refuse to help this project, and I am much too busy to spend time with the Indians unless there is cooperation from those in authority, and I must confess there has been very little cooperation from the local authorities.\n\nI do not mean by this that I have not received the greatest help and consideration from headquarters in Ottawa, a fact which I appreciate very much.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent,\nColumbia Coast Mission Inc.\nOffice of Inspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nApril 12, 1935.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAssistant/Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a report on the present situation at Fort Rupert, Kwawkewlth Agency. Mr. Indian Agent Todd and I went into the matter with very great care. No doubt you will remember that on March 15th 1932 a similar report was forwarded to you after my conference with Mr. W.M. Helliday, who was at that time Indian Agent at Alert Bay.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has not been put to any expense in the matter, as I took advantage of the fact that I was in Alert Bay on other Departmental business. I am glad to have had the opportunity of going into the whole matter of the educational needs of the Fort Rupert Band of Indians with Mr. Indian Agent Todd, with whose ideas in respect to this subject I am in entire sympathy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nREPORT ON INVESTIGATION INTO THE NECESSITY FOR AN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL AT FORT RUPERT.\n\nReason for Investigation:\n\nSince making a survey report on the need for an Indian Day School at Fort Rupert, which report was dated March 15th 1932, I have been requested again and again by Anglican Ministers to reconsider my recommendation that there was no need for an Indian Day School at Fort Rupert.\n\nThis matter has again been brought up by a suggestion from the local Anglican Minister at Alert Bay, the Reverend O. Hodgson, made to me verbally, that an Indian Day School was required for the children at Fort Rupert. A small Anglican Church has lately been erected at this point. The Reverend Mr. Hodgson informs me that he is paying out of his own pocket the salary of a local girl, apparently unqualified as a teacher, to teach two or three Indian children at this place.\n\nAs I am certain a request will sooner or later be made to the Department of Indian Affairs to either re-establish the Indian Day School at Fort Rupert, or to give a grant towards the salary of a girl or Missionary employed by the Anglican Church, I wish to lay the facts of the case before the Department.\n\nProcedure:\n\nI took the opportunity while in Alert Bay recently to discuss the matter with the Indian Agent, Mr. M.S. Todd. On March 8th last Mr. Todd and I went through the whole roll of the Fort Rupert Band, as given in the 'Band Book'. Each child of school age, or near school age, was separately considered by the Indian Agent and myself. We had the help of two local Indians who were well acquainted with the families in this Fort Rupert Band and with the present location of each Indian and child. I also had a roll of the St. Michael's Indian Residential School showing names of children in that school, with the name of the Band or location from which the child had come.\n\nThe Department was not put to any cost whatever by my carrying out this investigation in this way. It also aided the Indian Agent to have my views, and I was glad to hear his on the matter.\n\nI also was able to speak to Mr. F.E. Anfield about some of the children, and to obtain his CONFIDENTIAL views on the establishment of such a school as has been requested by Church authorities in the past.\n\nInvestigation:\n\nThe result of our work appears on the next page, and will make my recommendation clear to the Department.\n| Band: | Name of Father: | Boy or Girl: | Name of Child: | Age: | Father of Child attends School: | Mother Lives: | Child lives at Fort Rupert School: |\n|------|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|\n| FORT RUPERT | R.

I am not certain that this boy has been finally discharged from St. Michael's Indian Residential School.\n\nEDWIN HUNT; 2. This boy may or may not be accepted at St. Michael's School for the next School Year.\n\nPAUL JOHNSON; 17. I do not know the history of this boy. If there is no medical reason why he should remain out it might be possible to place him in the St. Michael's Residential School next term.\n\nMARGARET KNOX; 12. I understand that this girl was discharged because she was so unhappy at St. Michael's. Possibly she will want to return there later.\n\nEMILY HUNT; 15. The three children of K. Hunt are only living at Fort Rupert for the time. EMILY & PERCY used to attend the Alert Bay Day School and will no doubt do so again. SIMPSON was too young but I see no reason why he should not also attend the Day School at a later date when these children return to Alert Bay.\n\nLILY SCOW; 8. These Scow children have no school at present but it would appear to me that they might be admitted to St. Michael's Residential School if there is no disability of a physical nature.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nI am quite unable to see the need for an Indian Day School at Fort Rupert. It is obvious that the attendance would be very small. I could not possibly recommend that a qualified girl should be appointed to such a school if it were established, as I am not satisfied that she would have a proper place to live or enough protection.\n\nAn Anglican might be appointed as a MISSIONARY TEACHER. We would no doubt attempt to carry on a small school in the new Anglican Church. The Anglican Church would like to have the money from the Department no doubt, but I could not possibly recommend the establishment of a small school at Port Rupert. The available children for such a school should in my opinion be provided for at St. Michael's Indian Residential School. Unless an average attendance of ten children could be guaranteed, and it is quite impossible to do this at Port Rupert, I do not believe that an Indian Day School should be started. I should not care to recommend a Day School with a lower average than fifteen, which would mean about twenty local children not otherwise provided for available to start with.\n\nThe whole of the above is submitted with respect in the hope that it may be of help to the Department of Indian Affairs should they be requested to open an Indian Day School at Fort Rupert.\n\nGerald H.

Our missionary Rev. Wm. Hogan also favors this.\n\nSince the closing of the Metlakatla Industrial School and the correspondence I had at that time with the Department of Indian Affairs, I have understood that the present policy of the Department was in favor of the Improved Day School and against the establishing of any new Boarding Schools. I have endeavored to loyally support the Department in this matter.\n\nI understand that Skidegate is applying for a Boarding School. The arguments used by the Wossset Council against sending their children away would apply equally to Skidegate which is bordering on both Prince Rupert & Metlakatla.\nBoarding School to be established Graham Island it should certainly be at the larger village, Massett rather than at Skidegate.\n\nIt is simply loyalty to the Government's policy that prevents my pressing for a Boarding School combined with past experience of the difficulty of financing a Boarding School on a per capita basis unless there is a large attendance of children.\n\nWhile I feel deeply the force of the arguments used in favour of a Boarding School I am still of the opinion if it were possible to house and feed the children during the period the parents are away fishing the problem would be solved.\n\nTo take say 30 children in a village away from their parents and put them in a Boarding School in the same village, free the parents for eight years from all responsibility as to clothing feeding training may have been a wise policy in the days of degraded heathenism but it cannot be a wise policy now when many of the parents are intelligent well-behaved good living people.\n\nIf the Government has changed its policy think it is due to me to be informed and that do my utmost to make a Boarding School at Massett a success.\n\nF.H. DuVernet Bishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, March 30, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 13th instant in reference to the erection of a boarding school at Massett.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there is no change in the policy of the Department and notwithstanding that requests have been made by Indians of this band, as well as by those of Skidegate, there is no intention to erect a boarding school building at the present time. Sometime ago Your Lordship made a suggestion that some means might be taken to provide temporary accommodation for the children of these Indians during the time that they are absent at the fishing grounds. The Department would be quite prepared to undertake a reasonable expenditure to provide temporary quarters for this purpose, provided the Church could see its way clear to undertake the management. The Department will write at once to Mr. Denny, the local Indian Agent, and I would request Your Lordship to take the matter up with him in order that some definite recommendation may be made.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Okiedonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 30, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your communication of January 13th last, with enclosure from the Massett Indian Council in reference to the erection of a boarding school in the village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a boarding school for the Indians of this village. They are only away for a few weeks each season and the circumstances are such that it is not considered necessary to provide for the maintenance of the children during the whole year. Some two years ago His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia made a suggestion that temporary provision should be made to keep the children during the absence of their parents. The Department is prepared to consider some such arrangement as this if it can be carried out for a reasonable expenditure. His Lordship is being written to and so advised and asked to communicate with you with a view to a definite recommendation being made. It is thought that a building for this temporary purpose could be erected at a very reasonable cost, as it would only be occupied during the summer season and, if so, the Department will undertake to erect the building, provided the church can make arrangements for the management of the children during the time that the parents are absent. The Department will also assist the Indian parents in the maintenance of the children while they are absent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nCopy.\n\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., Jan 21st, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Dec. 4th ultimo, respecting Boarding and Industrial Schools, and, in reply, would state:\n\n\"In the Queen Charlotte Agency, we have no Boarding or Industrial Schools. The nearest institutions of the kind, to which a number of the boys might go, would be Coqualeetza Industrial School, at Chilliwack, The St. George's Industrial School, at Lytton and the Alert Bay School. We have a few, at the Coqualeetza School, which, like the Lytton School, is on the Fraser River, many hundreds of miles from these islands. The Indian parents are averse to sending their children so far from home. During the Winter months, we have communication with the outer world, but twice a month. Telegrams and letters only reach us on a steamer, from the mainland, and, should the children become ill, or die, the parents would know little or nothing about it, for many weeks. We have two Bands, of very intelligent Indians, and the Day Schools are well attended, during the Winter months; but the children are taken to the fishing grounds, and the canneries, during the Summer, and we cannot reach them. Last year, the Teachers followed the Indians to Naden Harbour, and Aliford Bay. We induced the cannery owners, at Naden Harbour, to give us a good schoolhouse; but the attendance fell off, as usual.\n\nIf we had a Summer Boarding School, on the Queen Charlotte Islands, at a central point, the children of the Massett and Skidegate Bands would attend it. In the Winter, the Teachers\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncould open day schools, on the two reserves, where all of the Indians have their homes, to which they return, after the fishing season.\n\nThis would keep the children away from the canneries and they would be learning to take up some other occupation.\n\nThe exodus, to the canneries, means now, all of the Indians men, women and children. The cannery towns ruin all alike. The men obtain whiskey; the women are debauched, and the children are put to work and they learn nothing good, when at the age to understand and when they should be in the schoolroom. I do not state, or desire to be understood, as meaning that all of the Indians are immoral; but the life in the cannery towns of the West is doing more to keep back our Indians than anything else. On their reserves, we have them under control. We keep trespassers away from them, and the last year, under police supervision, has shown us that we can handle them as never before. Mixing with Whites and Chinese, in the same camps, the Indian learns and practises things that does not contaminate them, when at home.\n\nWe have a problem, in the Indian, that requires a great deal of judgment to solve. I have been among them for over half-a-century, in the cannery towns and on their reserves; also in the cities, from here to the confines of the Province.\n\nIt is asserted, and I believe, with good reason, that we have, in this Agency, the most enlightened Indians in the Dominion. The best of them were educated in the Industrial School, and they came home, with ideas and ideals that were perfect. They stood high, among the Indians of their Bands; but it was when they were isolated and before numberless Chinese, Whites, Japanese and others brought with them that which goes to kill off the Indian.\n\nWhen...\nWhen we preach, and teach, morality and sobriety, the Indian now points to the issuing of liquor licenses and the immorality surrounding them. They speak of their grievances and the restrictions placed on them. They go and come; some live with the Whites, and women bring their half-breed children home, when the White man deserts them. They marry Whites, and, when the husband dies, back they come to the reserve life.\n\nOn these isolated islands, the Indians have no opportunity of marrying, only among themselves, and there is a relationship among them that has a deterring effect. The older, uneducated Indians, consider the ways of the past generations, and we often hear them wondering whether the inroads of the Whites brought advantages. In many ways, they try to keep up the old tribal customs, and the height of their ambition is lower than that of any class, although it appeared good enough when the survival of the fittest, among their thousands of inhabitants, was the main consideration.\n\nIn this Western country, where there are so many Indians, and where the carrying out of the law is so difficult, there are Whites and Indians who go to the limit of the law, and many go further, when under the effect of intoxicants. Add this to the innate suspicion, inborn in both Whites and Indians, of each other, and the difficulties encountered by the Indian Agents will be understood.\n\nWill education eliminate the disadvantages under which the Indians suffer? I feel sure it will, if the Indian is taken from his environment and is handled by those who are working for the uplifting of the natives; this can only be done, in our case, by erecting Industrial Schools, and keeping the Indian children away from the home of the cannery towns, and neighboring towns and cities.\n\nWe\nWe know that the Indian Day School is not a success, for the reason that Indians are nomadic. There is no Industrial School in this Agency, and I feel that one is required. The Indians of this Agency are not dying off, as in other places, and are more than holding their own. One industrial school will do for both of the large Bands, the Massetts and the Skidegates. The members of the Dominion House, who take an interest in the Indians, know that there is but one hope for the Indian. The member for this District, H.S. Clements, M.P., visited the islands, and was impressed with the necessity for a Boarding School.\n\nWith the Day Schools, the best is being accomplished that is possible; but we feel sure that the Boarding School would turn out pupils that would astonish the most skeptical, even as the Indians of this Agency do at the present writing.\n\nIn music, business ability, workmanship and sobriety, they have been examples for the other Indians of the Pacific Coast.\n\nWhen I visit the Massett School, and find over fifty children in attendance, it shows that there are influences at work for their betterment; but the Indians must work, to live, and, when Summer comes, and on finds the schools almost deserted, it means that there is but one way, to advance the children, and that is for the Department to take full control of them, for a period, until they are fitted to take a place with others on the same footing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent.\nVancouver March 27 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Queen Charlotte Agency.\n\nAt 8 P.M. a meeting of the Council was held in the Agency Building which all the Councillors attended. After a general discussion, Chief Councillor Adams brought to my notice the questions of providing the Queen Charlotte Islands with an Industrial School.\n\nAt Skidegate we held a meeting of the Councillors. The question of an Industrial School was also brought up here and it was suggested that same should be located halfway between Massett and Skidegate or at some suitable place near there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.M.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.M. Tyson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Rev. A.E. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools, per P.A.G., on the Massett Indian Day School.\nJune 30, 1913. Original on File 122723-6.\n\nThe Indians waited on me expressing their wish for a boarding school for their children on Graham Island. They stated that formerly they were only away from their villages from two to three months in the summer, living home most of the rest of the year. But now with a whaling station a cannery and a white settlement they were away so much that the children had a poor chance to learn. They also spoke of their desire to have the children taught to cultivate the soil. I told them that I would make no promises, but would report their wish to the Department. If a boarding school were established where both the Massett and Skidegate children could attend it would accomplish a great deal more good than the two day schools do at present.\n\n(Sgd.) A.E. Green\nInspector,\nper P.A.G.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of August, 1914:\n\nIn my opinion the summer vacation of the Boarding Schools, in other places, is at the wrong time. The children leaving the boarding schools, for their vacation, do not go to their homes; but to the canneries, where some of them are employed, and the smaller children learn nothing good. If we had a Boarding School, in this Agency, at the time the parents are away from home, the children would be kept at the school. During the winter, when the Indians are all at home, and the Day Schools well attended, those on vacation could still continue their studies, would be on the reserves, and outside the evil influence of cannery towns, and with their parents. With the male parents fishing, on the rivers, and the women working in the canneries, the children cannot receive the care that would be given in the home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 9, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of August, last, I beg to say that your remarks in regard to the vacation of the pupils at boarding schools are noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGwaham Island, B.C.\nMassey Reserve, B.C., January 20th, 1914.\n\nThomas Deasy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe, the Council of the Massett Band, on behalf of the Indians of the Queen Charlotte Agency, hereby place before you our humble petition, with the faith in our endeavors to advance our Indians, especially the generation now growing up among us.\n\nAlmost fifty years ago, when the Dominion Government took over the management of Indian Affairs in our Province, we were uncultured and only starting on the road to progress.\n\nAbout the same time, the negroes of the United States were given their freedom, and they now form a part of that great nation, with all the rights and privileges of free men. They had been slaves, up to that time, and were bought and sold, like any chattels.\n\nUnlike them, we always were free to roam over the lands of this country; but were considered wards of the government, like unto children, although taking the part of men and women, in earning our living and abiding by the laws of the land.\n\nFifty years makes a difference to the Indian, as well as to other human beings, and you have given us the free schools and other agencies, to advance us in the path of civilization.\n\nThe Missionary and the School Teacher, with the Indian Agent and the White settler has been among us for many years. They knew, and you know, whether we have taken advantage of the programs of the west, and kept pace with\nyour teaching.\n\nOur Bands, on the Queen Charlotte Islands, have thanks to give for the progress we have made; but we look for results.\n\nWe are ambitious, as all men should be. We have our well built towns; our young men studying music; our wives and children growing up among us, learning also to be good subjects, and we are all ambitious to be something more than the ordinary Indian is looked upon to be. Otherwise, what use in endeavouring to advance?\n\nOther Indians, who are not shewing advancement have their Boarding Schools. We have none. From the scattered Bands of Indians, over the Province, Indians are taken to fill up the Boarding schools on the mainland of British Columbia, hundreds of miles away from our homes. We have, among our people, over one hundred children of school age, and we desire to have them taught in a way that will be creditable to us and to the young under our care.\n\nIf we remained at home, during the Summer, we could take advantage of Day Schools; but we fish for our living and must take the children to our scattered camps. If we had a Boarding School, on Queen Charlotte Islands, we would leave our children there for the whole year, and we would soon have them learned in bettering their condition.\n\nWe are willing to give any part of our reserves, for a school. We are willing to do anything to have a school, and we find it difficult to induce our people to send their children so far away from home, to the mainland schools, although we sent a large number, last year, to Sequalletza Industrial Institute. We, sometimes, want to see our children, and the expense of sending them to outside schools is great.\nIt must be further remembered that our Haida Nation is not a part of the Indian tribes of other portions. In the days of old, we lived a race apart from the other Indians. We claim to be progressive, and our young men are doing all they can to prove our contention.\n\nIn all work, whether of Church or State, we endeavour to be examples of what can be done with a class that will help to build up a country.\n\nThe Port Simpson Indians have an appropriation for a Schoolhouse. On the mainland and at Alert Bay are Boarding Schools. Would it not be possible to give us a Boarding School, this year, we have asked you again and again for this favour, for the good of our children.\n\nWill you please bring it before the Indian Department once more and we will ever pray.\n\nChief Councillor \u2014 Alfred Adams\nCouncillor \u2014 Pete Hill\nCouncillor \u2014 Robert Bennett\nCouncillor \u2014 Matthew Johnson\nCouncillor \u2014 Joshua Collins\nCouncillor \u2014 William Matthews\n\nOn behalf of the Indians of the Queen Charlotte Agency.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a Petition from the Massett Indian Council, with reference to the large number of Haida children, of the Queen Charlotte Islands that would attend a local Boarding School. The new Skidegate Council also requested me to ask for a Boarding School, on the island. They promise to send over seventy-five children, from the two Bands, to such a school.\n\nRecently, they sent fifteen pupils away to Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, on the Fraser River, and were informed that no more could be taken, at present, there. This leaves no place open to attend school, without going to Lytten, many hundreds of miles further away, and the Indians object to paying fares and sending children so far from home, where they might become ill, die, and be buried, without their knowing anything about it.\n\nThe Haidas are an intelligent class of Indians, and all they lack is a local Boarding School, to which every child, of school age, would be sent.\n\nI have written on this matter before, and will not make any further comments; but, considering that the Indians have again brought this matter up, I enclose their request.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nMarch 4th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Denasy -\n\nI have your communication of the 20th ultimo, enclosing a petition from the Massett Indian Council, in which they ask for the establishment of a boarding school for the bands on the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\nI am quite in sympathy with the petition from these Indians, but owing to existing conditions, of which no doubt they are aware, it is impossible to undertake the erection of a boarding school building at the present. When conditions again become normal it may be possible for us to do something in the way of establishing a boarding school for these Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nThomas Denasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nExtract from letter received from Indian Agent Thos. Deasy, in reply to Circular Letter re Annual Report on Boarding and Industrial Schools. Dated March 3, 1915.\n\nOriginal on File 424926\n\n================== 477188\n\nIt is very unfortunate that we have no boarding school any nearer than Coqualeetza Industrial Institute open to the children of our agency. I could guarantee nearly one hundred children for a boarding school on the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Indians are eager to have one established between Massett and Skidegate. The two Indian Councils have passed resolutions asking for a boarding school and such an institution is the only hope for the Indians of this agency. In a short time the day schools will close through lack of pupils or the attendance will be so small that the day schools will be of little use to the large majority of children. Until November of this year this is likely to be the case, while the children will be taken from camp to camp and will learn nothing useful to them.\n\nThe Regulations are what we require and we are endeavouring to carry them out. With Indians willing to have their children educated it is a great drawback that they cannot have an institution where we could give them the education they desire.\n\nSgd. Thos. Deasy,\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nA meeting of the Indians was held at which they impressed on me the desirability of the Department establishing an Industrial School for this Agency. With the number of children at Masset and Skidgate it would be very easy to have from forty to sixty pupils in attendance at such an institution. The Indians do not like to send their children out to the other Industrial schools as they are so far away from home. If the Department can see its way clear to establish such a school, the exact number of pupils, together with other data required, can be furnished by Mr. Deasy.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Tyson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 12, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 31st ultimo in which you recommend the establishment of an industrial school in the Queen Charlotte Agency I beg to say that the Department regrets that under existing conditions it is impossible to comply with the request of the Indians of Massett and Skidegate that the establishment of a school be discussed at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Tyson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVancouver, B.C.\nA FURTHER EXTRACT FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT ON EDUCATION OF AGENT BEASY,\u2014\u2014\u2014 QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY.\n\nEleven of the day school pupils were transferred to Soqualeetza Industrial Institute during the past year three months and there are a number more ready and willing to go when there is room for them. I have been informed that no more pupils can be accommodated at present and it will be some time before more can be admitted. The only other open institution of this kind available is near Lytton and it is so far away that the Indians will not send their children there. This shows the necessity for a boarding school on the island.\nThe Indians are taking very great interest in music, and should be taught in that branch at the boarding schools. At both reserves we have permanent Missionaries, to aid in bringing the children up in a proper way, and they take a very great interest in their work. A teacher of an Indian Day School holds a very difficult position, especially where the parents of pupils are so lax in punishing the young for any offence. If the Indians showed the same aptitude to learn English as even the Japanese and Chinese, there would be a possibility of turning out educated Indians from a Day School. Even the educated men and women revert to Haida, in their homes and at meetings. They also have the \"Chinook\" jargon, to converse with outside Indians. It is up-hill work, and the only means of reaching them, and bringing them to a higher standard, is to continue in doing the best we can with the material being moulded into followers of our race, both from a religious and a social standpoint.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nbringing a large majority up, in the Day School, makes a difference that cannot be bridged over. It is like putting a college graduate in a colony of Chinese.\n\nThe question has been raised that a boarding school, on the Queen Charlotte Islands, could not be placed under the direction of any particular Church, for the reason that we have two separate religions among the Haidas. I feel sure that this would not interfere with the advancement of the Indians, in the way of education. The two reserves are one hundred miles apart, by land. The boarding school could be erected midway, between the reserves, and could be under teachers appointed by the Government. At the present time, the children of the Massetts, attending the boarding schools, are under the charge of Methodist teachers, and in a school conducted by the Methodist Church. The Massetts are Anglicans, and no trouble originates from such a course. The Indians do not wish to send their children hundreds of miles away, and there is not room in the boarding schools for the number they can send. With seventy-five children ready and willing to enter a boarding school, in this Agency, the Indians consider that they are entitled to one. They all see the necessity for educating all of their children, and they are constantly calling on me on this subject.\n\nThe two Indian Day Schools are doing as well as can be expected, under the circumstances, and the teachers are taking a lively interest in their work. On account of the isolation, on the island, constant changing of teachers takes place.\nSir,\n\ntown halls, councils, one and two-storey residences, row boats and gasoline launches, cattle and poultry, kitchen gardens and playgrounds and numerous other modern improvements. This can all be credited to the work of those interested in advancing the Indian, and, principally, to the Indians who attended the boarding schools. In the past there has been the danger of girls drifting away, after attending boarding schools, for the reason that the environment of the Indian home is not conducive to health, to the manner of life enjoyed in the school, and because the language and life is not any longer attractive. We take the girl, at eighteen years of age, and bring her to the home of the older Indian parents, who had no opportunity to understand that cleanliness, morality, dress and custom must be different from what they have given in the past. How can a young woman be expected to settle down in bare rooms, and to be taken to fishing camps and cannery towns, to fit her for the duties of married life? In some cases, the girls marry White men, or drift away to the cities, where they endeavour to live like we do. In order to keep them at home, it is necessary to have the whole of the children brought up on a common level. Sending ten, or fifteen, children to the boarding school, each year, and\nSir,\n\nthing, and the remaining seven months they are away in camps, and at canneries, learning from the older Indians the customs and ways of the long-ago, with the environment that we desire to do away with.\n\nThe Haidas have been progressive, more from the reason that they have been isolated, during a portion of the year, than through any other means, excepting that their missionaries, and those interested in their welfare, watch over them. It has been stated that the education of the Indian tends to make him troublesome, and that the Indian girls do not take kindly to life on the reserves, after being in the boarding schools. The reason for these arguments is plain. The few that go to the distant boarding schools can be spared, by the parents. If an equal number of the best of the boys and girls attended the boarding school, and they returned, fitted to marry in their own class, there would be a difference. Unfortunately, the Indians have not dispensed with their old customs, and marriages are arranged by the parents and relatives, without giving a great deal of consideration to the feelings of the contracting parties to a wedding. Education would bring independence on the part of young men and women. At the boarding school, the Indians would become acquainted, and the young men and women of one Band would marry, without considering any tribal custom. We often hear the saying that \"once an Indian always an Indian.\" A visit to the two reserves of this Agency would disabuse the minds of many who are always quoting the Indian as non-progressive. They have well-built towns, brass bands, surpised choirs,\nPORTION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF AGENCY THOS. BEASY ON THE EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY.\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH 31ST, 1915.\n\nThe Indian Day School may be a success, in some portions of the Province; but it will never obtain the object sought, in this Agency, under present conditions. We are endeavouring to fit the Indian for the walks of life of the White man. In religion, sanitary conditions, mode of living, language, dress, and in every other way, we desire to teach him and his children to advance, and the school room is the place where we endeavour to instil that advancement. For a few hours, daily, during five months of the year, the Indian children learn some-\nOttawa, June 19, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your annual report on the educational work in your agency for the year ending March 31st, last, in regard to the establishment of a boarding school in the agency I beg to say that the Department has no funds available for this purpose at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Desy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to the closing of the Day Schools, in this Agency, during several months of each year, and the necessity for a Boarding School, I beg to ask whether some arrangement could be made with some person or persons to keep the children on the reserves\u2014Massett and Skidegate\u2014during the Summer months, when the parents go to the canneries and fishing camps, so that the Day Schools would be kept open the year round.\n\nWith over one hundred children, of school age, and the Coolaetza Institute filled with pupils, it is of little use to have the Day Schools open for a few months. Fishing begins in May of each year. The Indians are still away from the reserves, scattered on the island and at Skeena river. When the parents return, probably this month, they will again leave, to obtain their Winter fish, and vegetables, returning, to permanently live on the reserves, in October, or November. Each year this continues and we have no advanced pupils. If arrangements could be made with Teachers, or some of the Indians, to board and lodge the children, it would be preferable to the present way of closing the schools for months. The only hope of the Indian, in this Agency, is to educate the young. The Haidas are a bright lot of Indians, considered the most advanced on this Coast\u2014as a whole; but the younger generation are not on a par with those who studied in the Metlakatla and Port Simpson Boarding\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nschools, which are now closed. With canneries opened on\nthe Queen Charlotte islands, and the Indians fishing for\nthemselves, off Langara island, the school term becomes\nshorter and shorter, through taking the children away from\nMassett and Skidegate.\n\nI could guarantee seventy-five children, for a Board-\ning School, if we had one on the island. It would mean\nimproving the coming generation, and advancing those we now\nhave. The Indian parents are objecting to the sending of\ntheir children so far away as Chilliwack, where they cannot\nbe visited, and where it costs quite a sum for passage to\nand fro. It is said that the children are brought up in\nthe environment of the Indian home and the canneries. They\nmust be taken away from old Indian customs and habits, and\nthe evil influence of men of all nations, around cannery\ntowns. The morals of a majority of Indians require more\nattention than anything else. Despite the work of those\nconnected with the Churches, the Indians will not conform\nto the law with regard to marriage-in a number of cases.\nThe children grow up with little if any restraint from\ntheir parents, and the only remedy is educating them to\nknow and act better than other Indians. Rev. Mr. Raley,\nPrincipal of Cagualeetza Industrial Institute, informs me\nthat he has room for four more Massett Indian children. We\nhave twenty on the waiting list. Rev. Mr. Raley states\nthat he has eighty children seeking admission, and that\nit is impossible to take all in. The Indians cannot allow\ntheir children to remain on our reserves, when they go away,\nto the canneries and fishing camps, which means the closing\nof the schools, for the Summer months, and opening them for\na few months, in the Winter. The children learn little, in\nthis way, and, if some arrangement could be made, to board\nand lodge them, the pupils could be prepared for openings\nin boarding schools, and sent there when required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant asking whether some arrangement could be made with some person or persons to keep the children on the Massett and Skidegate Reserves during the summer months when the parents go to the canneries and fishing camps, so that the day schools would be kept open the year round.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any arrangements of this nature at the present time, as, owing to the war, the appropriation for school purposes has been considerably reduced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Minister of the Interior,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir;\u2014 We, the undersigned, send you the following petition.\n\nWe beg your influence in assisting us in obtaining a boarding school on Massett Reserve. Our Church (Anglican) is prepared to take up this work, and the matter is now under the consideration of the official heads of our Church. We are afraid that one large home will be built on the mainland. This would not help our children.\n\nIn the first place, any point on the mainland would be one hundred miles from Massett, which entails expenses in travelling, going, coming, and holiday time.\n\nSecondly, the Haidas (Massett) are a separate tribe, having nothing in common with mainland natives, either in language or customs. Our experience in the past is that deceases are caught by intermingling.\n\nThirdly, very few people would care to send a child so far from home, whereas, if a boarding school were built on the Island, every child of the proper age would attend.\n\nThere are a hundred children on the roll at day school, but under the existing conditions, apart from the school not being able to open more than eight months of the year, comparatively few get more than a month's or two's schooling. It means that the children go wherever the parents go, fishing, canneries, sawmills, etc. Whereas, if there were a home in Massett, the children could be placed there and their studies be uninterrupted.\n\nWe are anxious that our children be given a chance to prepare themselves to compete with others in earning a livelihood. Education is the one great factor that is lacking among our people, and we feel that something must be done more than the present school system.\n\nWe trust therefore that this will appeal to your department, and that something will be done this year.\n\nWe beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nRoger Wint\nHenry Edenshaw (Lay-reader)\nJoseph Amos\nHenry Weak\nReuben Harris\nJames Jones\nFred Jones\nEdward Jones\nJohn Edgar\nAugustus Wilson\nRuben Quilltaz\nJoshua Collison\nIsaac Farnell\nJoseph Parnell\nFrank George\nGeorge Alexander\nJohn Smith\n\nA.S.

Affairs to be held officially.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI have gone into this matter very fully, to show the absolute necessity for an Indian Boarding School, in this Northern country. Last year, we had over one hundred children attending the Massett Indian Day School. Today, forty are in attendance. The Skidgate Indian Day School has an attendance of thirty.\n\nChilliwack is some six hundred miles away, from these islands, and is the only Boarding School available for the children of this Agency.\n\nThe Massetts attend the Anglican Church. The Skidgates, in this Agency, attend the Methodist Church. The Massetts must, necessarily, attend the Boarding School, supervised and controlled by the Methodist Church.\n\nWe guarantee that at least one hundred children would attend a Boarding School, within a short distance of this Agency. The Indians are eager that their children should be educated; but they object to sending their children to school, so far removed from their homes. The children of the Haidas are taking a great deal of interest and are also eager to learn.\n\nThe majority of those returning from Chilliwack, have not proved worthy, and the report of the Medical Officer of the Band will show that several of the returned boys are suffering from a disease that is dangerous and shows their unworthiness. The children now sent, are of parents who desire to get rid of them, for the reason that it is difficult for them to provide a living for them. In sending the children to Chilliwack, it means expense, to the parents, which they cannot afford. Meanwhile, the children are taken to canneries and camps, where they learn nothing useful, and the Day Schools remain closed, for many months in the year.\n\nIf, as we believe, education is the salvation of the Indian, such a large number require a Boarding School, in this Northern country. When children are, for eight or ten years removed from their parents, and away from intercourse with their own people, they have little in common with them, when they return.\n\nThe \"Haidas\" are considered the most advanced of the Indians of the North. In my opinion they are; but I am also of the opinion that they are retrograding. The younger people are not what they ought to be, and the fault is they are not receiving the education they should have for the reason that the Indians move from place to place and take their children with them.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nMasset, B.C. January 18, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nDuring the Spring and Summer months, the children forget a great deal of what they learn during the few winter months. Parents, and children talk the \"fields\" language, in their homes, and when outside the schoolhouse. What is needed, is a Boarding school, for the large number of children of both the Masset and Skidegate Bands, increasing in numbers, and without a Boarding school, in the whole of this great Northern country. We send a number to Chilliwack to the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, hundreds of miles away; but, where we guarantee an attendance of over one hundred pupils, in a Boarding School, in this neighbourhood, of children, eager to learn the English language, the need of such a school is apparent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. Thomas Denby,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF THOS. DEASY, INDIAN AGENT,\nDATED JAN. 18, 1923, ON THE SKIDEGATE INDIAN DAY\nSCHOOL.\n\nDuring the spring and summer months they (the children) forget a great deal of what they learn during the few winter months.

We have over one hundred children, able and willing to enter a Boarding School, without considering the fact that the best represented tribe, at the Chilliwack Industrial School, is there from this agency. There is little use in educating a few of our Indians, and letting the remainder have a few months of schooling each year. The Haidas are eager to learn; they are progressive - far above the average Indian, and the wonder is, that they are at a disadvantage, which the mainland Indian does not suffer from. It is unnecessary for me to dilate on this matter; but the attendance, even at Coqualeetza Institute, is limited, and they have no other educational boarding school to enter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Since a Boarding school is erected, the\nnumber of Day Schools will have to be increased. The \"Clam\nCanneries\" will employ a large number of old women and young\nmen and women. The logging camps, sawmills and canneries\nwill require the services of the Indians. They must necessarily,\ntake the children with them from the reserves, and\ntheir education should not be neglected. Under present\nconditions, the Day Schools are not well attended, during\na greater part of the year, and the children are only\nreceiving a \"smattering\" of education.\n\nIf the Haida Indians are expected to advance\nfurther, and not to \"retrograde,\" the education of the\nchildren will be the means of perpetuating and advancing\nthem. In my opinion the \"Haidas\" have reached the \"limit\"\nof advancement under present conditions, and their future\nwelfare depends on the education of their young, and this\ncan only be accomplished by the introduction of a Boarding\nschool on these islands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Thomas Deasy.\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indians themselves have promised help, and I have asked them to pledge themselves for every man and woman to contribute a dollar each; and I am sure of receiving donations and contributions from different white people.\n\nImmediately on receipt of a reply from you, I shall have a Board of Management elected with a Secretary-Treasurer, and also an Auditor. All money is to be paid to the Treasurer of the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nThe Massett Indians are very keen on education. This is proved by the fact that a number of them send their children away to school at Sardis (a Methodist boarding school, over 500 miles away). There are sufficient Indians of the Haida tribe, both at Massett and Skidegate, to keep the school fully supplied with scholars.\n\nMy suggestion has been enthusiastically received locally, by both white people and Indians, as they all know how urgent the need is.\n\nTrusting to receive a favourable wire,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Bellott\nMASSETT.\nB.C.\n12th December 1924\n\nThe Rev. Canon Gould,\nSecretary. M.S.C.C.\nTORONTO.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince I first came to Massett, I have seen the need of a Boarding school for the Indians. To-day the necessity is greater than ever, for the Natives have to be away from the village more now than in the past. To gain a livelihood, they have to go to logging camps, saw-mills, and canneries; and wherever they go, the whole family goes with them!\n\nFrom an educational point of view, the native is making no progress. Two years ago, the day school was burned down and has not yet been rebuilt. School is now being held in the old Church building, by a native teacher, who is doing very well so far as he can go, but he has never been qualified as a teacher, and his education is limited.\n\nThere are eighty children of school age in the village. Something should be done. This is my plan:\n\nI understand that the government is sending a white teacher here about the first of the year. The best plan would be to take twenty of the best scholars from the school and put them in a home, with the promised white teacher to instruct them. At New Massett - three miles distant from the village - there are two residences which can be obtained, as well as a building suitable for a school. The three buildings can be obtained for fifty dollars a month. The two residences are close to one another, being on the lots adjoining our own. (We bought a home of our own two years ago, and have been living here (New Massett), ever since. The Parsonage, which was built in 1919 at Old Massett is, therefore, empty. I would suggest that this be moved to New Massett in the vicinity of the home, thus accommodating more scholars. However, we can take up this matter later. Just at present, I should like to have your approval of the general scheme to enable us to make a start.\nFor the five months of next year, beginning with February, we could carry on in the three buildings above mentioned, the two residences and a school house. I have a fully qualified nurse who has had years of experience in school nursing, who is willing to act as Matron. She and her husband have agreed to come for fifty dollars a month each in order to enable us to get a foundation for our boarding school. I propose calling the building the \"Collison Memorial\" in memory of the late Archdeacon Collison, first missionary to the Massett Indians.\n\nThis will be the approximate amount of funds required for five months beginning February 1925:\n\nRent for 3 buildings .. .. .. $250.00\nCost of equipment .. .. .. $1,500.00\nMatron's salary and help .. .. 500.00\n\nMaking a total of .. .. .. .. .. .. $2,250.00 Total\n\nexpecting, of course, that the Government will pay the teacher's salary.\n\nI understand that the Government grant for each child is $12 (Twelve dollars) a month. This, with donations, will be sufficient to maintain the running expenses of the home.\n\nCan we expect a grant from the Indian and Eskimo Endowment Fund? If this meets with your approval, and a grant is available, please wire the amount appropriated, so that we can get things arranged to open the building by the 1st February.\n\nI am writing the Indian Department asking them for a grant, and feel sure that they will give one, for the previous Indian Agent (Mr. Deasy), stated that the Department was willing to assist boarding schools as soon as someone would take it up.\n\nI may say that the above buildings can be purchased, and I am taking them so that the rent can go as part payment if we decide to have a permanent boarding school in this locality. At present, we propose to use one for the boys and one for girls.\n\nThe Indians themselves have promised help, and I have asked them to pledge themselves for every man and woman to contribute a dollar each; and I am sure of receiving donations and contributions from different white people.\nThe Indians themselves have promised help, and I have asked them to pledge themselves for every man and woman to contribute a dollar each; and I am sure of receiving donations and contributions from different white people.\n\nImmediately on receipt of a reply from you, I shall have a Board of Management elected with a Secretary-Treasurer, and also an Auditor. All money is to be paid to the Treasurer of the Diocese of Cassonia.\n\nThe Massett Indians are very keen on education. This is proved by the fact that a number of them send their children away to school at Sardis (a Methodist boarding school, over 500 miles away). There are sufficient Indians of the Haida tribe, both at Massett and Skidegate, to keep the school fully supplied with scholars.\n\nMy suggestion has been enthusiastically received locally, by both white people and Indians, as they all know how urgent the need is.\n\nTrusting to receive a favourable wire,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

And, if anything, the need is even more urgent since Mr. Deasy has gone, and I think it would be money spent in the right direction (now that they have no Agent) to give them a chance to help themselves and look after their own affairs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Row) Hallett\n\nEnc. copy of letter.\nOttawa, January 20, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 12th ultimo, in which you outline a programme in connection with a small Indian residential school at Massett. The Department is well aware of the real need at this point; but the establishment of a residential school can be undertaken only after considerable preparation, including an appropriation for the purpose.\n\nThe general officers of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada are in conference with the Department from time to time and the need at Massett will not be overlooked when we are preparing plans and estimates for the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nMasset,\nB. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Massett are very keen on having their children educated. There are at present on the roll at Massett School, one hundred and six, and the average attendance is higher, I think, than ever before. The great drawback is that around March the parents will be scattering to different places, and taking their children. Recently, a number of them waited on the agent and asked if it would be a help to send in a petition to the Department, asking for a Boarding School. After listening to them express their ideas on the subject, I drew up the following for them, and it was taken around the village and signed by everyone.\n\n\"We notice in the recommendations of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons, that the sum of one hundred thousand dollars be voted annually for the purpose of technical education etc. We appreciate this, and beg to petition as follows,\n\nThat the Department put a Residential School on the Queen Charlotte Islands. We believe that Massett would be the most suitable site, as there is already a large new day school here with over one hundred on the roll. With the addition of another room, it would accommodate one hundred and fifty children. This would take care of all the suitable children from both the Reserves on the Islands.\"\n\nI also received a communication from Rev. Westgate of the Anglican Canadian Church Missionary Society, wanting my views regarding a Boarding School in Northern B.C. I suggested to him that as I understood the United Church contemplated putting one at Port Simpson, I would recommend that the Anglicans be responsible for one at Massett, as I thought the school at Port Simpson would need all the villages in that vicinity to recruit from.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's views regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett\nOttawa, January 30, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the request of the Massett Indians for a residential school. I regret there are no funds for this purpose at the present time. Only a portion of the special appropriation for B.C. Indians is to be used for technical education and the Department is now considering a scheme for manual and vocational training at our existing residential schools. If you believe this special activity could be undertaken with reasonable promise of success at the Massett Day School, you should make a recommendation to Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

C.\nJan. 21st, 1929.\n\nRe-Boarding School, Nassett.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a conversation with the Commissioner while I was in Victoria, regarding a boarding school, it was suggested that I make a report in this matter giving my ideas.\n\nMy firm belief is that the Indians can best be advanced by educating them the same as white children. This can be seen by observation of those who have already had some education. They are the best behaved people in the village, and it is possible to reason with them, not only because they understand English, but because their minds are more developed. Under the present system their opportunity for schooling is limited on account of the life they live, having to move away from the villages at different seasons to gain a livelihood. Their custom is to take the whole family. The Boarding Schools of the Province have helped considerably, but to my mind, judging from results among the children on the Queen Charlotte Islands, the time spent at the School has not given them the amount of education they should have. This is on account of so much time being given to instruction in farming, etc., which is of no practical use to the people of these Islands.\n\nMy suggestion is that there be a semi-boarding school, that is a place where the parents could leave their children when they leave for the fishing season, etc., particularly to take care of the children between the ages of six and twelve. If this were carried out, I see no reason why they could not pass their Entrance at the usual age for white children. If any wanted to go further than this, encouragement could be given. As an illustration of how the children can advance when given the opportunity, I would refer to Miss Shopland's class in the Nassett school. The children who began in 1927, and attended regularly showed remarkable improvement, and compare favorably with the white children in the same grade at New Nassett. These children are between six and eight years.\n\nI would suggest that the semi-boarding school be built at Nassett where there already is a three-room day school. With the addition of another room to take some children from Skidegate, this would then be sufficient for teaching purposes. I would think the residence would need to be large enough to accommodate one hundred children. At present there are one hundred and three on the roll at Nassett and forty at Skidegate. The apartment already has sufficient land around the school, the old Hudson Bay land and part of the Mission property. The three teachers at Nassett live in the Mission house which is rented from the Church, and it is just possible that this could be purchased or rented indefinitely for the staff. Only one more teacher and a Matron would be needed; as kitchen help, etc., can be secured in the village. Some of the girls have had good training at Coqualeetza and could help with the domestic work in connection with the residence, and they could be hired when needed.\n\nI would suggest that the school be undenominational,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVictoria, B. C.\nand qualified teachers chosen irrespective of Denomination as long as they were Protestant, but preferring those with a Missionary spirit.\n\nThe Queen Charlotte Indians have the name of being the most progressive of those on the Pacific Coast. The people are certainly keen on education, and I feel sure they would support a Boarding School when erected, by helping to supply such food as they could to the children when at the home. The people begin to scatter here in March, and the full number are never in the school before about November.\n\nI would like to have the Commissioner's opinion on these ideas, and if favorable steps taken to have the building erected by September 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"J. Gillett\"\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nP. O. BOX 668\nVICTORIA, B.C., March 7, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short time ago I had a visit from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, of Massett, Queen Charlotte Islands, and he verbally took up the subject of the education of the Indian children of his Agency and stated while there was a very good attendance at the day schools during part of the year it was necessary for a number of the pupils to go away with their parents when they went out fishing, and his suggestion was that an enlargement to the present school building should be erected in order that the children who ordinarily go away with their parents, could reside on the reserve and carry on their education; something in the way of a semi-boarding school. I asked Mr. Agent Gillett to write to me fully on the subject after he had returned to Massett and I am now in receipt of a letter from him in which he puts forth his ideas. A copy of this letter is attached hereto for your information and consideration. I may say, however, that the scheme seems feasible and if adopted would prove less expensive than the building of a residential school which has been spoken of in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 18, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/11/13914 of the 7th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, which has reference to boarding accommodation for the Massett children of school age from March to November.\n\nThe Department would like to have a more detailed estimate of the cost of this proposal before giving it serious consideration. I believe an inexpensive type of residence would meet the needs here. If the parents were made responsible for all the clothing and at least some of the food supplies, the chief current expenses would be the staff and the heating costs. If this scheme were tried, it would be better to change the holiday months to December and January or January and February. If the Department, in cooperation with the parents, were boarding the children during the summer, the school should be continuous at that time. You might consider this further, have Mr. Gillett go into the details of the proposal and submit a further recommendation, with estimate, if possible. The Department believes that the needs of the Massett children only should be considered at the present time, as there might be difficulties attendant upon including those from Skidegate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVICTORIA, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen Bishop Rix was here I mentioned the matter of the possible purchase of the Mission House. He was himself favorably disposed towards this, as it is not likely to be needed for a Clergyman, as the Church has practically given up the idea of having a man stationed in the village. New Massett, three miles away, is now the headquarters. They have been offered a house at New Massett for twelve hundred dollars. They said if he had the same offer for the Mission House in the village, he would put it before the Executive.\n\nI consider the house a good buy at twelve hundred dollars. I had the house built for my own use as clergyman, in 1919. It has seven rooms conveniently arranged, and has brick chimneys, with an open fire place in the sitting room. The walls need re-papering, kalsomining etc., and a bath would be needed with water connections. This should not cost more than one hundred and fifty dollars.\n\nI wrote Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn some time ago re a semi-boarding school. The Mission house, in this case, could be used for the staff of the boarding school. The latter could be built adjoining, as there is a good site there. I explained the whole situation to the Commissioner re the semi-boarding school, that a place was needed to take care of the children whose parents were obliged to leave the village to gain a livelihood. As an illustration, just recently we had a good school for January and February. This week practically the whole village has gone to Tow Hill clam cannery. While there is a school at Tow Hill, still it means that from now until June, the school is broken up. Could something be done before next year this time, so that the children can be kept continually at school, particularly those between the ages of six and twelve. I could submit plans and approximate cost, if there is any prospect of having it built by March 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\nOttawa, March 28, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your No. B of the 5th instant, with reference to the possibility of using the mission house at Massett as a staff residence in connection with an Indian residential school which has been proposed for this Reserve.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in connection with the scheme of boarding the children, but, as there are no funds at present available for the purpose of building a dormitory, there will be opportunity to consider the proposal with deliberation and to arrive at a definite programme, with estimate of the cost. Mr. Ditchburn has been requested to correspond with you in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Ghillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you herewith a sketch of proposed hostel suitable for housing about fifty people, which will I believe explain itself. This is a suggestion only, and from it you may find out what you do not want, and consider only that which is necessary, for the proposal you have in mind.\n\nThe cost of this would run somewhere around $2500.00, for the plumbing, and hot air heating are carried out. The plumbing with cistern tank and completely installed, providing water is available at the site, will be $1500.00, including the coils in furnace heater for the hot water.\n\nIf hot air heating is not used this would eliminate a further $1000.00, in installing the furnace and heating plant, and in the basement that would be necessary for the housing of the furnace, and its operation, and the stairway to basement.\n\nThis would reduce the cost of the building then to about say $1900.00. The sketch shows a fairly well constructed building, that would allow of expansion at the attic for taking care of maybe another dozen people at small added expenditure, either now or at some other time, that is after the building had been built.\n\nThe construction calls for posts or piles, about eight feet centers, sills say five runs, and general construction as is usual, with both floors in living quarters of 9'6\" ceiling. The exterior walls and roofs are covered with shingles, and below the sitting stonewall, boards and battens vertically set up. The windows were set 6 lights about 13\" x 16\", or 18\", throughout, showing ordinary style double doors are shown but further savings could be effected by using single doors if they would be acceptable. The rooms now marked as lavs and bath rooms, would perhaps serve that purpose under any circumstances, or be used as linen rooms or storage. The interior of the building throughout could be finished in plaster, plaster board, or V-joint, according to choice, without much change to the cost. All floors #1 L&G fir, Doors to design with glass in all doors on corridors, lamplights to all corridor doors, for ventilation. Lobby doors at entrance could be of glass upper panels to facilitate lighting. Eliminating hot air heating would mean additional chimneys, which could be arranged, allowing corridor heating in recesses for the stoves.\n\nIn the dining rooms and kitchen part the ceiling is twelve feet, allowing the room to be used for any purpose, if the posts are an objection they may be removed by breaking the rafters, which would entail a small further expense. The frigid section is provided only provision for installing these systems were it intended storage space or rooms fitted with shelving for storage purposes is provided for as is the office. The kitchen is fitted up with work boards and sink, and cooler with vents, and shelving, with doors etc.\n\nIn the near future you will be able to go into this and any changes can be made to suit the conditions under which you are operating.\n\nWhen you have made this decision, it would then be possible to go more closely into this matter, and will be pleased to go further into it at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10), Volume 6098, File 167-1-1, Part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending under separate cover a rough sketch of a plan by Mr. Mitchell of Prince Rupert, of a building which would be suitable for a semi-boarding school. The cost as estimated by Mr. Mitchell is much higher than I had thought. However, a smaller building would be suitable, say to accommodate about forty children, using the little bit needed for others. As this building will be for the Indians only forty would be all that we could count on as the bigger ones twelve to fourteen, would be going away digging claims etc., as the Nelson comes. I would think then that the cost could be kept down within fifteen thousand dollars.\n\nRegarding the change of holidays, as proposed in the Department's letter to the Col. Inspector, I think the Department must have misunderstood my letter. I did not mean to have the holidays changed as I think it better for the children to be away in the open with their parents in the summer months July and August. I would suggest that the children be taken into the Boarding School for September, October and November, and the responsible be responsible for their care. In December, January and February when the people are in the village, the children should go to their homes. Then in March April May and June, when the parents scatter, the children should be taken into the Boarding School again. I mean of course, that the children should still attend the Day School when they are living in their own homes, so that altogether they would get the two months of schooling and have the two months of July and August for holidays. The parents would be responsible for clothing at all times, and food during the months they are at home. I think the better plan would be for the Department to be responsible for the entire food supply during the months above mentioned when the children are in the building.\n\nIt will be a satisfactory as far as not having the children be concerned as the latter do not scatter as much as the Cassette Co.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., June 19, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Boarding School at Massett.\n\nReferring to your letter of March 18th dealing with the suggestion of Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, of the Queen Charlotte Agency, in his letter of the 21st of January, that a semi-boarding school be established on the Massett Reserve, I beg to say that I am now in receipt of a further communication from the Agent together with a sketch showing the style of building he has in mind. This sketch was gotten up by Mr. Mitchell. It apparently was at first intended to provide accommodation for the children of both the Massett and Skidegate Reserves, but the Agent now states that it will not be necessary to provide space for the Skidegate children and a much smaller building, which he estimates would cost $15,000.00, would answer his purpose.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of Agent Gillett's letter as well as the sketch and description gotten up by Jno. R. Mitchell.\n\nRecently I had a visit from Reverend Mr. Barnet, the field man of the United Church of Canada, and he gave me to understand that the Department had promised to establish a residential school on the Queen Charlotte Islands. If this is the case, there would be no necessity for the building of the semi-boarding school suggested by Agent Gillett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/11/14762 of the 19th instant, with reference to a residential school at Massett. It is true that the Department is considering the erection of a residential school on Queen Charlotte Islands. In view of this, the Department is not prepared to consider, at the present time, a semi-boarding school arrangement for this reserve. As soon as it is determined which church will be asked to cooperate with the Department in the management of the new residential school, I will initiate correspondence concerning the best location.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSeptember 27, 1929.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nWhen forwarding requests for Indian Education Estimates, you have represented that there was need of a residential school for Anglican Indian children somewhere in the neighbourhood of Prince Rupert. I recently learned that, on the 30th instant, there will meet in Vancouver representatives of the Church of England and of the United Church, for the purpose of discussing the education of Protestant Indians in northern British Columbia. I feel you will be glad to have an expression from the Department concerning the possibility of securing funds for the establishment by the Government of such schools in this locality.\n\nI believe that only two new residential schools should be considered during the next few years, one on the mainland and one on Queen Charlotte Islands. As the United Church is pressing for a residential school in northern British Columbia, it is probable that we will offer each of the churches mentioned one school when funds can be provided.\n\nOur latest census of the Indian population shows 400 Church of England and 245 United Church adherents on the Queen Charlotte Islands. In the vicinity of the Nass and Skeena rivers, there are 1,064 adherents of the Church of England and 1,365 of the United Church. The United Church conducts a small boarding school for girls (22 pupils) at Fort Simpson. It was erected by the church authorities.\n\nI am not at all satisfied that Queen Charlotte Indians should be educated on the mainland or that mainland children should be sent to a school on the Islands. The\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\npeople are very different and their early relations cannot be called cordial. It is my opinion that one residential school should serve the Queen Charlotte Island children. No doubt, separate instruction in religion could be arranged. Such a school could be offered to one of the churches. The other church could be offered a large institution on the mainland, provided that Protestant Indians generally on the mainland would be recruited.\n\nIn this way, the establishment of two schools would solve the problem for some years to come. The erection of four schools would mean much greater capital expenditure, which cannot be favourably considered by the Department, and, secondly, the pupilage at each would be comparatively small and the costs of maintenance, correspondingly high.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nOttawa, September 29, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nChief Henry Edenshaw, of Massett, visited the Department on the 26th instant and urged the establishment of an Indian residential school for the Queen Charlotte Indians. He was of the opinion that such an institution should be established between Skidegate and Massett and should draw pupils from both. He felt that the proposal to establish a boarding house for Indian children during those months of the school year which were in the fishing season was but a temporary measure and that when the Department is planning for the future we should not stop short of a regular residential school, with good vocational training.\nSlave-Hunting Indians Yield to Christianity\n\nIndian Missionary Recalls Days of Piracy on Pacific Coast\n\nThe conquest of Christianity over slave hunting and piratical Indians on the Pacific coast was the theme for a Tribune on Sunday by Henry Edensaw, chief of the Haida Indians on Queen Charlotte Island, and a missionary to the Anglican Church of England recently held in Toronto. Mr. Edensaw spoke the day in Windsor, where he was born at Massett, on the island, after the first trip he had ever made east of the Rockies.\n\nIn the first half of last century, the island, which is about 150 miles long by 50 broad, was inhabited solely by Indians who raided the mainland for slaves and plunder. In the year 1823 the schoolmaster Thomas Roney, Captain Roney, was captured by the natives and killed. Mr. Roney's father, afterwards named Albert Edward Edensaw, one of the leaders of the Haida tribe, returned back to the cabin in which the captain had been killed and rescued and saved their lives, though the schoolmaster's wife and child were taken prisoners.\n\nProcured Release\n\nLater he procured their release and was given a certificate of his bravery and generosity by Captain Roney's widow. Mr. Edensaw became a faithful friend to all captains trading on the coast.\n\nIn the year 1833 the island was visited by Her Majesty's ship \"Volunteer,\" under Captain Pr\u00e9vost, afterwards Admiral Pr\u00e9vost. Captain Pr\u00e9vost engaged Mr. Edensaw as his pilot and used him in that capacity during the whole of the expedition. On his return to England he recommended Mr. Edensaw to the mission of the Church of England authorities, who called for a volunteer to go to the island.\n\nThe volunteer chosen was a young man named Henry, who had experienced a promising career in England and was eager to serve the Indians. He first established a church on the island at Massett, where he lived and taught for nine years. Then came the end of the era of the traders of selling liquor to the Indians. Mr. Edensaw, known as Methilakta, followed by the greatest of the traders, built a sawmill and built a town, and later, when he moved north to New Brunswick, he took with him once more. That was the beginning of civilization among the Indians on the Pacific coast.\n\nContinued Study\n\nThe elder Edensaw was a man of property at the time of his death, but, by the custom of his tribe, his estate property and his rank descended to his nephew in the same manner as to his son Henry, in turn, got his rank from his uncle.\n\nAt the age of 18 he entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company as a lad in their store on Queen Charlotte Island, scarcely able to read or write. For 14 years he stayed in the store, educating himself by constant reading.\n\nHENRY EDENSAW\n\nAfter leaving school with the company he offered himself to the church as a teacher, and three students went with him during the week while he accompanied the minister on Sundays, actually preaching his sermons to the natives. Mr. Edensaw has now bought a few acres on Saturday afternoons.\n\nAt the same time he was acquiring property, though the same was small. With the civilization of the west came the opening of training schools for Indians on the mainland, and Mr. Edensaw's family and other young Indians from the island went there to get an education.\n\nTrips To Get School\n\nAt the end of 18 years Mr. Edensaw gave up teaching, having been licensed in the diocese of Caledonia. As he realized that he could not make a living on the mainland, he decided to try and make a living on the island. He went to Ottawa to try and secure a position as a missionary on Queen Charlotte Island, and he has hopes that this will be successful.\n\nThe chief occupation of the natives on the island, formerly engaged in trapping for furs have made trapping not worth while, there being plenty of seal, sea lion, and other animals on or near the island. The land is beautiful, with woods of hemlock and jackpine, and it has many rivers and streams. The climate is fine, with a mild winter and warm summer. Mr. Edensaw has mail at Massett once a week in the summer and twice a month in the winter. Mr. Edensaw, a strongly built man of excellent appearance, was delighted with his trip to the east, where he met the people of Ottawa, and especially with the kindness and hospitality shown him everywhere.\nOttawa, December 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 910 of the 24th ultimo, enclosing copy of the resolutions passed by the Massett and Skidegate Indian Councils. In reply I have to inform you that the Department, in conjunction with the churches interested, has given the question of a residential school on Queen Charlotte Islands some consideration. At the present time, the Appropriation for Indian Education is extremely limited and it is not the intention to establish such an institution in the immediate future.\n\nWith reference to the second request of the Councils, I may say that the practice is to ask parents to pay for the transportation of their children to and from Indian residential schools whenever they are able to meet the costs. Even when distances are great, this policy obtains, and I regret that I cannot authorize any departure from the general rule.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The Skidegate Indians would not be too seriously opposed to Anglican control, provided the United Church adherents could have a visit from one of their missionaries at irregular intervals.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: \"File\"]\n\n[Handwritten note: \"Prox copy\"]\nAt a joint meeting of the Massett and Skidegate Indian Councils held on November 17th, the following resolutions were passed.\n\nThat the Department of Indian Affairs be asked if it is their intention to build a Residential School on the Queen Charlotte Islands, as soon as financial conditions warrant it.\n\nTHAT the Department be asked to pay the fares in full, to and from the present Residential School on account of them being situated so far from these Islands.\n\nTHAT the Department be asked to give a statement of the expenditure of the special grant of One Hundred Thousand made yearly to the B.C. Indians.\n\nCertified correct.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of the Resolutions passed by the Massett and Skidegate Councils, at a joint meeting held on November 17th.\n\nOn Mr. Henry Edenshaw's return from his recent visit to Ottawa, he reported having had an interview with Indian Department Officials regarding a Residential School on these Islands. The Massett Council therefore invited the Skidegate Council to meet them and to talk over the matter and to decide on a suitable location. It was felt that before the Councils could commit themselves, the Department should be asked to officially whether or not a Residential School would be built.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6038)\n\nFile 154-17-1, part 1\nKamloops - Bonaparte School Establishment. 1910\n\nFile 154-26-1, part 1\nKamloops - Spence's Bridge School Establishment. 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 154-42-1, part 1\nKamloops - Upper Nicola - Douglas Lake School Establishment. 1919\n\nFile 154-45-1, part 1\nKamloops - Upper Nicola - Coldwater School Establishment. 1919\n\nFile 155-6-1, part 1\nKootenay - Creston School Establishment. 1910\n\nFile 156-6A-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Cape Mudge Boarding School Establishment. 1919 - 1920\n\nFile 156-20-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Blunden Harbour School Establishment. 1911 - 1915\n\nFile 156-31-1, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Fort Rupert School - General Administration. 1904, 1920, 1927, 1935\n\nFile 156-31-5, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Fort Rupert School - Supplies. 1931\n\nFile 157-1-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Massett Boarding School Establishment. 1911 - 1931\n\nFile 157-7-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - Naden Harbour School Establishment. 1912, 1939\n\nFile 157-10-1, part 1\nQueen Charlotte Agency - North Island School Establishment. 1910 - 1911\n\nFile 158-1-1, part 1\nStikine Agency - Stikine Summer Day School - General Correspondence. 1925 - 1942\n\nFile 158-3-1, part 1\nStikine Agency - McDame Day School - General Administration. 1930 - 1948\n\nFile 158-3-2, part 1\nStikine Agency - McDame Day School - Quarterly Returns. 1940 - 1944\nI have the honour to report that a change is taking place at Massett Reserve which will mean a great deal to the Indians of the Massett Band and also to the School.\n\nA company is erecting a cannery at Naden Harbour, or Virago Sound, about twenty miles from Massett, and is employing the Indians in clearing the ground and on construction work.

Every man who is now employed took his wife and children and the problem of educating the Indian children will be one to be solved in the early future.\n\nWhile this means employment for the Indians it also will be a drawback to the education of the younger members of the band. I feel sure that it will be necessary to have a school building and a school teacher at Virago Sound, for a great part of each year, and thought it advisable to let you know the condition of things on the start.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. Thomas Beasy,\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 5th and 6th instant in reference to conditions at the Massett School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as from your letter it would appear that the children will all leave Massett for a period of eight months the Department is prepared to transfer the grant for a teacher to Virago Sound, provided a building is available and His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia is prepared to nominate a competent person to undertake the work. It is presumed that Mr. McConkey's resignation, to which you refer, will be received shortly. You will be good enough to take this matter up with the Bishop of Caledonia and report the result of your negotiations to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report with reference to the Massett Indians, now at Naden Harbour, Virago Sound, where Cannery buildings are in course of erection and where a large majority of the members of the Band are now located:\n\nAfter consulting with Rev. W. Hogan, the Anglican clergyman here, and with Mr. Gilmour, who is in charge of the work of erecting buildings, it has been decided to recommend the erection of a building by the owners of the Cannery, to be used as a Church and School. The Cannery owners are willing to erect a building and, when Mr. Hogan's health permits, it is the intention to go over there, with him and select a site. Few children are now attending the Massett School and, on the erection of a building, arrangements should be made to have a Teacher go there. Whether the Teacher of the Massett Day School should take up this work is for the Department and His Lordship Bishop DuVernet to determine. The Indians leave here, in the Summer, for the Canneries, and the school, at Massett, is closed, for some months. If we should find the attendance at the school, in Naden Harbour, is good, the Teacher should remain there, until the Cannery closes. I feel sure that\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\na large number of the children will remain at Naden Harbour Cannery during the fishing season, returning to Massett periodically, and making Naden Harbour their home, for the Summer months. The Cannery Company is building houses for the Indians and it will be a large settlement, while operations are going on.\n\nI understand, also, that Mr. McConkey's agreement with His Lordship is to teach until May, or until the Indians leave, and the school attendance dwindles to ten pupils. This new cannery, and keeping the Indians on the islands, should mean that we will have them in this neighborhood for the whole year, and the school attendance should be good at all seasons, either in Massett or at Naden Harbour, thereby improving the Indian children all of the year, instead of having them scattered. It is what we have been desiring, to keep the Indians away from the cities and cannery towns, and holding them at home. If the Department, and His Lordship, consider that a school should be opened at Naden Harbour, arrangements will have to be made about the Teacher of the school. I feel sure that Mr. McConkey will not go there and the question arises: \"Is it advisable to have a school in Massett and another at Naden Harbour?\" I would recommend that we keep the school open, at Naden Harbour, during the Spring and Summer, and at Massett during the Winter months. The Teacher would be under expense, at Naden Harbour, unless we can have the Cannery Company build a house for him; but I think this can be arranged. It is the intention to have a building, for religious purposes and the books and other supplies, used at Massett, could be moved from one place to the other. As stated, in a former letter, the desks, to be ordered, might be movable, or the old desks could be taken over there, and left until next year, after the school closes. The children are there now, with the exception of the few in Massett, and, when the building is ready, a Teacher should go there. Whether the Department\ndesires to take this matter up with His Lordship Bishop Du-\nVernet, or instructs me to do so, the question is one that\nshould be arranged shortly. Rev. Mr. Hogan is corresponding\nwith His Lordship, on the question of the Church building,\nand Mr. McConkey, the Teacher, states that he will expect\nextra recompense and a home for his wife and child, should\nhe decide to go to Naden Harbour, after his arrangement with\nHis Lordship, regarding his term of employment, is completed.\nHe does not appear to know what the conditions will be, al-\nthough he informs me that he has written His Lordship explain-\ning that the Indians are moving away. Mr. McConkey questions\nwhether more children will attend school, at Naden Harbour,\nthan in Massett, and this can only be found out when the\nbuilding is constructed and ready for occupancy. With a\nCannery running, and the children off the reserve, it is\nquestionable whether attendance could be made compulsory?\nThe canneries give employment to women and children and the\nIndians always consider the financial end, during the\ncanning season. At Skidegate, where another cannery will be\nin operation-three miles from the village-the school question\nwill also arise, in the near future.\n\nI considered it proper to report to you fully,\non the matter, through the distance and time taken in\nreceiving a reply from the Department. Although the Cannery\non Virago Sound-at Naden Harbour-is only twenty miles from\nMassett, there is no regular means of communication, and the\nweather, on Hecate Straits, is very boisterous, at times.\n\nThe Indians are doing well there now, many being\nEmployed in construction work, at good wages.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the establishment of a school at Naden Harbour.\n\nIn reply I would refer you to Departmental letter of the 23rd ultimo, in which you were advised as to the action of the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Denby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th March, regarding conditions at Massett School-(Letter No 122723/1), I have the honour to report that I have just returned from Naden Harbour and arrangements have been made to open the school there, on the 1st May. The company officials were very anxious to meet us on every question and to accede to any arrangements we desired. The new building will be large and sanitary and will accommodate all of the children. Two rooms and a kitchen will be added, for the Teacher and his wife. We will ship over the old desks, now in use at Massett schoolhouse, and one of the Hyloplate Boards, also a stove and the books etc. Immediately after arriving here I explained to Mr. McConkey that he will be expected to go to the Cannery, on May 1st. Rev. W. Hogan accompanied me to Naden Harbour and is well pleased with the arrangements made.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 424/12\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMay it please Your Lordship:\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that a visit was made to Naden Harbour, on the 16th inst., from which I returned last night, after spending two days with the Massett Band at the Cannery of the Wallace Cannery Company there. Rev. W. Hogan accompanied me and we consulted with the officials of the company regarding the placing of a building at our disposal, for a Church and Schoolhouse. We succeeded in having a large building provided, and three rooms for a Teacher's residence. The whole will be ready for occupancy, on the 1st May next. With your permission, the Teacher will go to Naden Harbour of 1st May, closing the Massett School, while away. In compliance with the new regulations, Mr. McConkey is keeping the Massett Day School open, during the prescribed hours; but the attendance is so small that no real benefit is being derived. We will take the old desks and other material, to Naden. The Department is providing new desks for Massett. I feel sure that the change will be beneficial. The women and children will remain at Naden, while the men are fishing, at North Island, and they have a large number of separate houses erected, for the Indians. In fact, they are better provided than any Indians on the Coast, with two-roomed houses, facing the beach, and all offal will be carried off by the tide, which rises and falls in front of the doors. The Company is doing everything to keep the Indians\n\nfor\n\nHis Lordship,\n\nF. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, B. C.\nSir,\n\nfor the Summer, requiring the men, for fishing, and the women, to work in the Cannery. The Indians now have a pay-roll of over $5,000 per month and have been at work since the 1st Feb. last. They will make more money, during the fishing season and the children will be in one place all of the time. I feel sure that the company, and the Indians, want the school, at Naden Harbour, and the Department is anxious to have the school opened at an early date.\n\nAs you are aware, the Indians returned from the outside canneries, last year, with a great deal of sickness. The attendance, at the school was small. They left here, on the 1st Feb., and there has been little improvement in an educational way, recently. I would suggest that there should be no vacation, this Summer, for the reason that the children will have to make up for the three lost months. We have an Indian Council there, with Mr. Alfred Adams as Chief Councillor, and they intend to use the power granted them, under the Advancement Part of the Indian Act to force attendance at the school.\n\nHoping this will meet with Your Lordship's approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) [Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 3, 1912.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to know that you have succeeded in completing arrangements to conduct a school at Naden Harbour for the Masset Indians during the fishing season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ____________________________\n\nMr. Inspector Green in his report on the Masset School says, \"I think it will be very desirable in the near future to have a plain, cheap house for school purposes at Naden Harbour Station as the Indians were spending half the year there where there is lots of work. The teacher could then be with the people.\n\n(Original on file 122723-6)\nOttawa, September 6, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report as to the building erected by the cannery company for Indian school purposes at Naden Harbour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMascott, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Quarterly Report of Teacher of Massett Indian Day School, for the term ending 30th September 1912.\n\nIn connection therewith permit me to state:\n\nAfter obtaining a building, at Naden Harbour, where the cannery is located, at which the Indian women work, and from which the men go out fishing, Mr. E. W. Baker was installed there, and opened the school. The attendance was not very good, through the Indians taking their children to the fishing camps, and for other reasons.\n\nAt the same time, the Indians asked for the school to be opened there, and, considering that they stay in that locality, for several months of the year, it assisted many of them and proved that we are endeavoring to do our part in the education of their children.\n\nThe school will be moved to Massett Reserve, in a few days, the cannery closing down, when the attendance will materially increase.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian School.\n\nEdward Watkins Baker, the new teacher of the Indian school, is installed at Naden harbour where the cannery company furnished a building in which have been placed the old desks from the Masset schoolhouse. During vacation the schoolhouse on the reserve has been painted and new single desks installed.\nINFORMATION OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett Reserve, B.C., October 9, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour, in reply to yours of 6th September last, to report that the building which was occupied, for Day School purposes, at Naden Harbour Cannery, was erected this year and used first as a store, for a few months. It is a good, substantial building, standing quite high from the ground, and about 40 feet by 20 feet, with two small rooms, at one end. It was quite large enough for the scholars, with plenty of light. The Cannery Company kindly placed the building at our disposal, and built a new store for themselves. The teacher, with his family, did not live in the building, the company furnishing them with two large tents, in which they were comfortable. They also placed a raised platform, for the teacher, and we installed a number of the old desks, from the Massett Bay School Building. Considering that the whole of the ground, at Naden Harbour, was cleared and built on, this year, it was commendable of the company to place such a building at the disposal of the Department.\n\nThe Indians are now returning to their homes, at Massett Reserve, and we expect to open the school here, in a short time. The Cannery closed down on the 5th instant.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nP.O.

Box 702,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAt your request I have given consideration to the correspondence forwarded with a letter 20/5192 dated July 11th 1939 addressed to you by Acting Indian Agent B.T. Phillips of the Queen Charlotte Agency.\n\nIn my report on the Massett Indian Day School dated May 12th 1939 I explained the need for a third teacher at Massett for the eight month period that this particular school is open each year. The question of such a teacher being then available for either Tow Hill or Naden Harbour was discussed on page one of my letter to you forwarded with the above mentioned report.\n\nMy own opinion is that we should have a third teacher as the numbers at the Massett school have increased and even if the Tow Hill Cannery is in operation as well as the cannery at Naden Harbour there would then be teachers for each of these seasonal schools and one for the main Massett Indian Day School. No matter where the Indians were employed there would be continuous education for the children.\n\nI consider that the Naden Cannery should be requested to provide a suitable room as a schoolroom, and a suitable residence for the teacher, and that the Cannery should furnish these rooms in a simple manner.\n\nI do not recommend that the Department be asked to supply school desks etc. A number of simple forms and desks made at the Cannery would be quite sufficient at least to start with. The necessary Asbestoslate Blackboards three pieces 4ft by 6ft might be supplied by the Department. Texts and exercise books would need to be requisitioned by the teacher some months in advance, and could be taken to the proposed Naden Harbour School from Massett.\n\nMay I ask that the whole of this correspondence be forwarded to the Department with whatever recommendation you may care to make in the matter. The main need is first for the third teacher at Massett and the blackboards and desks I recommended for that place in my report on the Massett School.\n\nPlease note Project 5 proposed by me on Page 2 of my letter to you dated July 6th in connection with the disposal of children from Coqualeetza.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Barry for the Massett Indian Day School, this teacher would be available to go to the proposed Naden School. If not, it would be impossible to send one of the other two, as one is needed at the Tow Hill (Hi-Ellen I. R.) School when the Clam Cannery is working (digging).\n\nReferring to the Naden Harbour matter, I suggested that Mr. Simpson write to the Department regarding their attitude in the proposed school, I am therefore enclosing Mr. Simpson's letter, also I have typed copies for Capt. Barry, which are attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"B. T. Phillips\",\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.

Barrie, Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOn behalf of the natives employed here we wish to approach the Department in regard to establishing here a school for the native children.\n\nWe have here at present time twenty-one children a list of whom is attached. This number is consistently maintained during the months of March, April, May, September, October, and November, these months being our operating season. For some time back the Natives here, who find their children growing up with practically no education whatsoever, have been after us to assist them to obtain school here for these months of the year. In midwinter we are closed down and the natives go to Massett, where the children can go to the Massett school for about two months. We have been operating here for five years but we have put off requests for a school until we were reasonably sure of our operating months and the number of natives we are likely to keep employed.\n\nOur present plans are for a gradual expansion of our activities here which will involve probably the hiring of more natives as we go along in addition to maintaining employment for the present force. We have employed the natives from Massett for twenty years and find them very satisfactory on the whole, faithful and hardworking and it would probably be a steadying influence and a help to them if their children could have access to primary education for the long period they are here each year.\n\nWe understand that the Department will not consider constructing a school on private property and there is no Indian Reserve property at convenient distance. We would suggest therefore that we will construct such a school including suitable quarters for the Teacher sufficiently large for the present and future needs and rent the building to the Indian Department at a rental of $10.00 per month for the time the school is in session, the Department to install the necessary equipment such as Desks, blackboards, stove, etcetera.\n\nOur budget for the does not permit us to construct the school at once but if arrangement can be worked out this arrangement can be worked out we believe we can build the school in the winter in time for the opening of our spring season, in the latter part of February. Meanwhile we would appreciate hearing from the Department as soon as possible on the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nQueen Charlotte Canners, Ltd.,\n\nby S.L.Simpson\nQUEEN CHARLOTTE CANNERS LTD.\n\nS.

In view of this fact the proposal submitted to Inspector Barry by S. L. Simpson, Manager of Queen Charlotte Canneries Limited, is reasonably satisfactory to the Department. If the Company is prepared to build a school and provide accommodation for the teacher the Department will supply a teacher although no provision has been made for a teacher at this point in the 1939-40 estimates. It is not likely, however, that the school will be open and in operation until late in the present fiscal year. I agree with Inspector Barry when he states in the fifth paragraph of his report that simple school desks for this school should be constructed by a local carpenter and this suggestion might well be considered with respect to a number of Indian day schools in outlying districts. The Director has, on more than one occasion, pointed out to me the enormous cost of transporting school desks to a number of Indian Reserves in the outlying districts of the Dominion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding educational facilities in which you state that if the Cannery is willing to provide school accommodation, the Department will supply the teacher, but that the school will not likely be open until late in the present fiscal year, I would advise that I have not made the situation clear. The permanent local educational centre for the Queen Charlotte Indian children is at Massett with approximately 100 children, but when fishing commences, a number of Indians with their children leave Massett, about 25 proceeding to Naden Harbour for the period, March to October, and 30 to Tow Hill from March to May. The proposal is to have three teachers at Massett, two of them to follow the children to Naden Harbour and Tow Hill as soon as the migration commences and return with them at the end of the fishing season.\n\nI would, therefore, request authority to employ a third teacher for this purpose, her duties to commence on October 1st on a basis of eight teaching months to the year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

In view of your recommendation, it will be in order for you to secure from Right Reverend G. A. Rix, D.D., a nomination of an additional teacher at the Massett school.

Our Church of England missionaries in this Diocese of Caledonia (Northern B.C.) have steadily counselled the Indians to be law abiding. In consequence of this the Indians say that we are servants of the Government trying to get their land from them. Our Indians have been stirred up by agitators. They have been asked to raise a large sum of money to carry their case to the Privy Council. Money is being freely given for this purpose. Our Missionaries hold aloof from this telling the Indians that if they will only wait patiently the Dominion Government will see that they are treated fairly. Not very long ago Indian Delegates from all parts assembled at Vancouver to arrange to carry their claims to England. I think the Department should inquire who presided at this meeting. I am informed that it was an official of the Indian Department. Since then the attitude of our Indians towards our Missionaries is more marked. Our missionaries are loyal to those in authority while at the same time telling the Indians what will be best for them in the end.\nTo give a specific example of what I mean:\n\nOur Nassett Indians were not in the least agitated about the land question, they were quite contented in mind until they received a letter from Rev. Mr. Tait a Methodist Missionary more than 500 miles away. He and the Rev. A.R. Green seem to be the chief movers in this matter. Rev. A.R. O'Meara, Church of England, does not belong to this Diocese, and has no authority from me. No doubt some of our missionaries think that the question of the Indian Title should be authoritatively settled but as a Body we hold that the Indians being wards of the Dominion Government, this Government should have the question settled without this most unwise stirring up of the Indian mind. This is by way of introduction to what I have to report.\n\n1. With great difficulty and at much expense I secured a male teacher for Gitladamika, the uppermost Indian village on the Nass river. Mr. R.J. George has an expert knowledge of gardening and farming & has an earnest desire to show the Indians of this village how to cultivate their rich lands. Accompanied by Archdeacon Collison, who knows the language well, I took him up the river last summer and introduced him assuring the people that he was not after their land, but only wished to teach them and do them good. They received him most kindly until the delegate from this land conference returned from Vancouver. Now Mr. George writes me as follows: \"At a Council meeting at Gitladamika to consider the matter of setting apart a piece of land for the mission house they were so undecided that they came to no decision. I inquired the cause and was told they considered me the thin end of the wedge. They summed up the situation thus. The Bishop, the Archdeacon, Mr. McCullagh and myself are the servants of the Government and are seeking to deprive them of their land. Seeing that I am regarded as a traitor by them...\"\nI have concluded after prayerful consideration that the only thing for me to do is to leave the river.\n\nMr. A. R. Smeath, our School teacher at Iakkalzap on the same river, writes by the same mail in much the same strain. I shall endeavour to persuade these men to hold on, but you will see how this land agitation is upsetting all our work. The feeling up the Skeena has been intense but is a little easier now. Our Missionaries urged the Indians to wait patiently till the Commissioner came from Ottawa. He came but only to repeat the same message which had so often been given before\u2014\"I will report to Ottawa all you have to say\". The Indians have great respect for authority. All that is needed is a decided answer.\n\n2. In regard to Nassett a new industry has developed at North Island a fishing Company is erecting a station there with a steamer carrying fish to Prince Rupert. In consequence of this large numbers of the Nassett people have gone from the Village. What Rev. Mr. Hogan recommends is that Miss Edenshaw should continue teaching the little ones at Nassett and that Mr. Sherwood should follow the bigger children to North Island and teach school there. If the Department will make a grant of rough lumber 3,000 ft at $17.50 per thousand, with shingles so the natives will put up 30 x 30 with a \"lean-to\" at back for teacher to live in.\n\nI wrote about this to the Indian Agent, Queen Charlotte Islands, but as Mr. Perry was leaving about that time the letter may be waiting for the new agent, whoever he may be to arrive. I hope the department will make this small grant. It will be seen from this that owing to this new move on the part of so many of the people the question of tents must be deferred for another year. This will show the Department what we have to contend with in trying to carry out any plan.\n\n3. I asked Mr. Fuller the Carpenter to whom I referred to in my previous letter if he would undertake the work of teaching the Indian young men & older boys carpentry but he sees too good an\nopportunity for work in Prince Rupert to accept such a position. I think that this is a matter which the Indian Agent should take in hand.\n\nLet me say in closing that I fully appreciate the difficulty in connection with the Indian Title and the dispute between the two Governments but there is no denying the fact that our whole Indian work is suffering because of the lack of a decisive answer from those who represent \"The King.\"\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(sgd) P. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 1st instant in reference to educational matters in your Diocese, and in regard to the suggestion contained therein that a school should be established for the Massett Indians, who have gone to North Island to engage in fishing during the coming summer, I beg to say that the Department, while most anxious to forward the interests of the Indians in respect to education, is not prepared to make this departure without more detailed information, and the new Agent John R. Scott, will be written to at once for a detailed report.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication for His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia in which he states that a number of Indians from Massett have gone to North Island, where a fishing company is erecting a station, to engage in fishing, and he suggests to the Department that Mr. Sherwood, the senior teacher, should follow the bigger children to that place and conduct school there while Miss Edenshaw remains at Massett in charge of the younger children, and asks for a grant to purchase lumber, shingles, etc., to erect a building.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to grant his Lordship's request without further information and I have to ask you for a detailed report and recommendation thereon. It would appear that it is only the larger children that are leaving with their parents and it is presumed that their services will be required in fishing operations, and the Department would like to know the number, if any, that would be likely to attend the school, if one were put in operation.\n\nAn early reply on this matter will be awaited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

May 5, 1910.\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that, on February 10th last, I received a communication from the Right Rev the Lord Bishop of Gal-\n\n-deria, as follows: \"I have received a letter from the Rev Wm Hogan, of Massett, in which he recommends that our senior Indian Day School Teacher, Mr Sherwood, at Massett, should accompany the older scholars to North Island where there is a fishing station, (twelve large canoes having gone there already) for the halibut fishing, and teach those scholars there; the junior teacher remaining at Massett with the junior scholars. After consultation with the Rev J.H. Keen, who was for some years at Massett, I have written approving of this plan. Mr Hogan further says that if a grant could be made for the lumber which can be bought at the Massett sawmill for about $17.00 per thousand, the Massett men would erect the building at North Island.\n\nI write to ask if you will forward my request for a small grant for this purpose to the Department. It is evident that from now on this fishing industry at North Island will be of importance so that a rough building there will be most useful for school purposes. I am, etc.\"\n\nIn reply to this communication I wrote as follows: \"I have the honor to request that you will be good enough to make a requisition stating the quantity of lumber required, and the amount you desire the Department to grant. The Department will require this.\"\n\nThe estimate asked for has been forwarded under cover of letter from the Bishop dated May 10th, IO, as follows: \"I enclose two copies of the estimate sent me by Alfred Adams. He thinks that delivered at North Island this will cost about $250.00. Mr Hogan says that if you gave the order to Georgetown Sawmill co Capt Stanley could take it direct from there to North Island, and save transhipment.\"\n\nI beg herewith to enclose the estimate referred to, and in connection say that I have recently returned from Massett where I saw that the need of a rough building such as the Bishop asks for is badly needed, as for several months of the year the people leave Massett for North Island, taking their children with them, and unless something as suggested by the Bishop is done, the education acquired by the children while at home will be all forgotten as there is nothing to occupy the minds of the children, save to run about or play or make mischief.\"\nI therefore recommend that the amount of material required for construction be purchased from the Georgetown Sawmill Co., that Captain Stanley be asked to convey the same to North Inland at a nominal rate, and that the grant, which I think will not be so high as $250, be made on condition that the Massett people for whose benefit the grant is asked erect the building by voluntary labor.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 6, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to the establishment of a day school at North Island where a number of the Massett Indians are temporarily located.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this question was receiving the consideration of the Department, but action was delayed on account of the death of the late Agent, Mr. John R. Scott. The matter will now, however, be taken up, with the newly appointed Agent, Mr. Deasy of Prince Rupert.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nC. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nOttawa, June 6, 1910\n\nSir,\n\nSometime ago the Department received a request from His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia to make a grant to erect a day school at North Island, a fishing station occupied by the Massett Indians. On the 23rd ultimo Mr. Perry, Indian Agent for the Naas District, forwarded an estimate of the cost of the necessary material, which amounts to approximately $250.00. A statement showing the necessary material is enclosed herewith.\n\nThe Department has decided to grant His Lordship's request and supply this material on the condition that the Indian themselves perform all the labour. This lumber, etc., may be purchased from the Georgetown Sawmill Co. and can be taken to North Island by Captain Stanley.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to consult with the local Missionary and make the necessary arrangements for the purchase, the amount above mentioned in no case to be exceeded, and you will be good enough to report at a later date upon the progress being made in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, June 6, 1910\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of March 23rd, last,\nI beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department has decided\nto make a grant of $250.00 for the purchase of material\nwith which to erect a school building for the Massett Indians\nat North Island, and the necessary instructions have been\ngiven to Mr. Deasy, the Agent, to have the work proceeded\nwith at once.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of communication of 6th inst., (No. I22723/1) with enclosure, re. \"the erection of a Day School at North Island?\"\n\nWith reference thereto permit me to state: The Massett Band just returned from North Island and a large majority of them left last evening for the Salmon Canneries on the Skeena River.\n\nCaptain Stanley sold his schooner and went with the others to Skeena River.\n\nI consulted with Rev. Thomas Hogan, the Local Missionary, in accordance with your instructions, and the suggestions we respectfully submit are:\n\nFirst:-That an estimate on the price of the lumber and building material required from the Sawmill be obtained from the one located at a place two miles distant from Massett, and, if the price is considered below your estimate, the lumber &c., be purchased and stored here, until the Indians return to North Island, when it can be shipped there and the building erected.\n\nSecond:-That the shipment of lumber from Port Simpson would now mean an expensive undertaking. No steamers run to North Island and the lumber would be brought from Port Simpson to Massett and from here again shipped by some chartered boat to North Island. When the Indians return we may make some arrangement with them to take it over.\n\nThird:-It is questionable whether the Indians will return to North Island before next year, and no delay would occur now in arranging to procure the material from the nearest and cheapest place and arranging for its shipment, after the Indians return from\nfrom the Skeena River.\n\nFourth:-We would both be pleased to have the Schoolhouse erected at once; but it is practically impossible, with the Indians away, the schooner sold, and no direct communication from Massett at the present time. To order the material; store it here, and have it taken over when the Indians return to their fishing grounds, and to purchase from the Sawmill adjacent to the Reserve, would mean a saving and no loss to any person concerned.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in reference to the erection of a school building for the Massett Indians at North Island, for which the Department offered a grant of $250.00 for the purchase of material.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the existing conditions as described by you have been noted and the matter of purchasing the material and having it taken to North Island will be left to the discretion of yourself and the Rev. Mr. Hogan. It is the wish of the Department to have all this material purchased at the most reasonable rates and at the most convenient and accessible place. If the material is purchased now as suggested by you, in order that it may be shipped to North Island when the Indians again go to that point, it will be necessary to see that proper arrangements are made for careful storage.\n\nYou will be good enough to report the action taken at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nSecretary.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJuly 4th, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the following letters:- 1. No 122 723/1 informing me of the grant of $250.00 material for North Island School. I thank the Department for this.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H. Du Vernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa, 9th December, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to call your attention to official letter of July 11th last which referred to a letter from you of the 21st June dealing with the proposed erection of a school building for the Massett Indians at North Island. It was therein stated that it was the Department's wish to have all this material purchased at the most reasonable prices and at the most accessible point for shipment, and you were, consequently, authorized to purchase the necessary material at the time considered most favourable by you, and arrange to store it carefully until possible to ship it to North Island when the Indians again go to that point.\n\nAs no report, as asked, of the action taken in this matter has been received from you, I have to ask that you be good enough to advise the Department fully as to what has been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy & Secretary\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nOttawa, January 31, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to the erection of a school building for the Massett Indians at North Island with which you enclose copies of correspondence had between yourself and His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia in regard to the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your proposition to delay action in this matter until such time as you have had an opportunity to visit the Island and look fully into conditions. In the meantime I may say that the suggestions contained in your letter and in those of the Bishop to you will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nMasset Reserve No. 1, Massett B.C., Feb. 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 31st ult., (No. I22723/1) with reference to the delay in connection with the erection of a School Building at North Island\u2014now named \"Langara Island.\"\n\nI am more convinced than ever the erection of a school building there would be a great mistake. The Indians go there for a short time, to catch Spring Salmon, and are scattered along the beach. While fishing, the women and children assist them and also procure wood. For at least ten months of each year, the school would be closed. No Indians live there permanently. The new Whaling Station, now in course of construction at Virago Sound, will most likely, employ a number of the Indians this year. The fishing for Spring Salmon is only taken up to fill in the time before the Indians go to the canneries, on Skeena River, and might be discontinued at any time. There would be no-one to look after the building for many months of each year\u2014not one Indian remaining there\u2014and the prospectors or evil disposed persons might use it or burn it. Even the Indians feel as I do on this matter.\n\nI might state that no expenditure was made on this account. After going into the matter with all concerned, I did not purchase any lumber.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 22, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in reference to the erection of a school building for the Massett Indians at North Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the circumstances as described by you the Department agrees that it would be well to postpone action at least for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, and in order to carry out the requirements of the Census Commissioner, I visited North Island (now called Langara Island) and will now submit a report on the question of a Schoolhouse there, a matter which has been under consideration for some time:\n\nLeft Massett on the 3rd inst., on a launch, and called at the new Whaling Station, on Virago Sound. All of the Indians formerly employed there have gone\u2014not one Indian remaining and little prospect of their returning\u2014which I feel sure they cannot be blamed for doing, considering the low wages they received and the unwholesome stench from the bodies of the whales treated there. Proceeded to \"North Island,\" arriving at Massett Reserve at 1 o'clock a.m. on Sunday morning. Found \"six\" families camping there. Remained until Monday morning, 5th inst., and went to four other camps, along five miles of rocky sea-coast.\n\nIt would be practically impossible for children to walk from one camp to the other and I cannot understand how anyone would suggest the construction of a schoolhouse there. The Indians left Massett on the 15th May, for \"North Island.\" They will return on or about the 20th June, to prepare for the cannery work. Not one Indian will remain and none will return there until the next year. It is a bleak, desolate coast, away from all lines of communication and the Indians only go there for a short time each year.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto fish for \"Spring Salmon.\" They take their children, 'tis true; but it would be practically impossible to get them in one place, even for the few weeks they are on the Island. The Indians realize this, themselves, and say so. The camps, also are the Summer outing places of the Indians, before they begin the hard drudgery in the canneries and it is questionable whether even the children in one camp would attend a school, should the Government go to the expense of erecting one, and sending a teacher there. There is no harm done to the children, at \"North Island.\" It is the leaving for over three months more of each year, for the cannery towns, and the mixing up with all kinds and classes there that brings demoralization and death to the young Indian. They require a Summer outing-like the White children; but that should be in just such places as they are located in now. After they return from \"North Island\" they go to the canneries for months and many return with ideas of their own and ways, that are impossible to eradicate. There is no use in mincing matters. I have been accused of interference in the plans of others on this school question and other school matters. It has been my endeavor to inspect the schools and suggest improvements, which were made. I have reported to you all of my actions and endeavored to do what was in the interests of the Department and the Indians. When I found a teacher who informed me, himself, that he could not manage the Indian children\u2014it was time to change matters. When a schoolhouse was proposed for \"North Island,\" I investigated and reported against it. When it was suggested to me that a teacher should go to Naden harbor, at the new Whaling Station, I considered it inadvisable\u2014the results show for themselves. His Lordship, Bishop DeVernet, agreed with me. You informed me that I should pay particular attention to the School work. I have done so, and reported all of my actions to you and also to His Lordship. When the school teacher closed the school, fault was found. I received, today, a letter from the teacher and he states: \"I saw the Bishop, when in Prince\nRupert and we arranged that I was to come back after holidays. I did not engage the present teacher, nor do I know what arrangements he has with Bishop DuVernet. I do know that he improved the school and was commended by every Indian that spoke to me on school matters. Where everything was chaos and confusion, before, he enforced discipline and brought the school children to a higher standard. Even some of the men took lessons from him.\n\nAs his Quarterly Report will show, he closed the school because of non-attendance of the children. It has been usual to close the school at this time, every year... He made every endeavor to get the children to continue, when all were at home; but failed. I do not know the reasons for what appears to be a difference between the clergyman here and the teacher; but I certainly object to being brought into any of their troubles. It is not good for the Indians, for the school or for your Agent. It would be far better if the suggestion of His Lordship, in his letter to me of the 12th May were carried out. In that communication His Lordship states:\n\n\"I think the day is fast coming when the Government should take over the entire responsibility of educating the children, leaving the Church of the Mission to look after their spiritual and moral welfare.\" This is true of a place isolated as we are, with a few hundred of Indians and divided authority in the school. His Lordship can only make periodical visits; the teacher hardly comprehends where his responsibility rests; the clergyman will accept no responsibility and the Agent is a new innovation, with duties and responsibilities that are laid down for him but apparently misunderstood by the others connected with the school. I would strongly recommend that His Lordship be written to regarding the Government taking full control of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th ultimo in which you deal with the question of the construction of a school at North Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, no further action will be taken in this matter at the present time.\n\nWith regard to the taking over of the Massett school by the Department I may say that you were written to on the 14th ultimo and informed that the Department would assume the responsibility for Mr. McConkey's salary at the rate of $700.00 per annum from the 1st of April, last, and it would be well for you to communicate with His Lordship and advise him to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Some had heard of the residential school at Lejacq, B.C., and wanted me to bring their children there. They were told that there were already more children in that district that the school could afford accommodation for, then the cost of transportation would be too high to allow many children to be taken down. Furthermore, a great number would undoubtedly object sending their children that far, the Lejacq residential school being, for some of them, over one thousand miles away.\n\nBoarding School.\u2014 A boarding school would be the only possible way of educating and civilizing the Indians of the northern interior of B.C. They are of the nomad type. Very few live in log cabins; most of them live under tent all the year around. During the summer they gather or move as they please around some of the above mentioned trading posts. The rest of the year is spent in the mountains. Under those conditions, a day school would be a failure and a waste of time and money.\n\nHowever, a school that could afford accommodation for about eighty children would be sufficient as a start.\n\nLocation.\u2014 Telegraph Creek, on the Stikine river, is actually the terminus of the transportation facilities and the commercial center for the Cassiar and Liard districts. During the summer, supplies are easily taken in by a boat from Wrangel, once a week.\n\nIf my memory does not fail, there is no proper location reserved yet for an indian school around Telegraph Creek. But I am confident that it could be done if wanted. There are some good spots for an institution of the kind, six, eight, ten and twenty miles below Telegraph Creek, right along side the river. Some of them, like the six mile lot that I have personally visited, have a large and ever running creek going through, which would be a great convenience both for the school and the land.\nRe a boarding school for the catholic Indians of the Stikine Agency.\n\nThere are again a few good locations around Dease Lake some seventy two miles from Telegraph Creek. But perhaps the cost of hauling supplies in there would be too high.\n\nHowever that matter of the location could be looked over again. Herewith I have attached a sketch of the six mile creek lot, which, I understand, is now Government Reserve.\n\nGreat Need.\u2014 It would be useless for me to try to point out to the Department the necessity of providing immediately education facilities for those Indians of the northern interior of British Columbia. It has become the outspoken cry of the white who have heard of the superstitious and inhuman customs, such as witchcraft, still prevailing amongst some of them. Others are still given to polygamy. Amongst those who have met with the white man or rather gather around his camp, evil influence is more easily followed than good. It was the missionary's sad experience to notice how this evil influence manifested itself by blasphemy, debauchery and the frequent breaking of the marriage bonds.\n\nIs it not true that the only remedy to those deplorable evils is education?\u2014 And now that those Indians show good dispositions towards the sending of their children to a boarding school would it not be wise to take into account those dispositions. And now that they ask themselves for a boarding school would it not be fair to grant them one immediately.\n\nHowever, the undersigned is not writing for himself. He is a missionary who has at heart the advancement of the Indians. He is ready to do his share as he has done before. He only wishes and hopes that the Department will see its way to grant his request for the good of the Indians of the northern interior of British Columbia and their children.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. Allard, L.M.I.\nPrince Rupert, B.C. Sept. 24th, 1925.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou are no doubt aware of the fact that 5 Liard Indians were tried before an Assize Court in Prince Rupert last August for the murder of one of their own young men. The trial naturally attracted wide attention and occasioned a good deal of inquiry and comment on the habits of the Cassiar natives. On finding that the crime had been committed as a result of superstitious convictions still alive among those Indians many officials and prominent citizens have expressed to me a desire that I should send missionaries to them in order to prevent the recurrence of such abominations.\n\nAs a consequence I have sent Fr. E. Allard to visit the Dease Lake and Liard Indians in order to ascertain the best that could be done for them. On his return he has submitted a report written for the Indian Department, indicating that the only adequate remedy to cope with existing evil would be the establishment of a Residential School in that vast district. I earnestly concur myself in making the same recommendation, realizing, as I do, that the want of proper education is the root of the deplorable disorders that have existed among those Indians in the past.\n\nI know that such school is costly but it must be remembered also that the trial referred to cost almost the price of a school.\n\nAnd what about the future?\n\nAtlin Day School.\n\nMoreover having accepted that charge, I must convey to the Department the incessant request of the Atlin Indians for a day\n\n(over)\nschool. They want to learn how to read and write. Their constant dealings with white people make them realize this need. They claim they feel ashamed to appear so ignorant. In fact they have more reasons for that feeling now than they had in the past. Atlin has become a Summer resort of considerable importance. The numerous tourists who come there inevitably visit the indian village, inquire about their school, deprecate the want of it &.\n\nHence, I hope, that a school that will cost so little and satisfy so many will readily be granted by the Department. It would be sufficient to run it 6 months in the year, viz: from the 15th. of April to the 15th. of October, the period of time when most of those indians stay in their village at Atlin.\n\nRespectfully yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nBp.\nOctober 12th, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Bunoz,\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 24th ultimo and I note that you join the Rev. Father E. Allard in the request that a Residential School be provided for the Indian children of the Stikine Agency. I am convinced that there is an opening for such an institution in this part of British Columbia, but there are so many pressing claims on the appropriation for Indian education that it is impossible to foretell when funds could be provided for such an enterprise.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Simpson at Telegraph Creek with reference to Your Lordship's request that the Atlin Indian Day School be reopened and when a decision has been reached I shall direct to you a further communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Rt.Rev. R.M. Bunoz, C.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nUpper Stikine Mission\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C. October 15th, 1925.\n\nTo the Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following request for the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nOn October 1st 1924, I submitted a letter to your Commissioner for Indian affairs in B.C. pointing out the necessity of a Boarding School for the Indians in this District. The School to be situated near Telegraph Creek on the Stikine River, where the Indians of this District could send their children for education & to learn trades, observing that in a few years\u2014owing to the opening up of this District for Mining\u2014there will be no means of livelihood from trapping for the younger generation of these Indians, unless they are taught Trades, as the trapping will be so greatly diminished & there is no suitable Agricultural Land in this District. I am writing therefore, requesting that this matter be given earnest consideration, for I consider the establishment of a Board School an absolute necessity for the welfare of these Indians & will in the end save a large expense to the Crown & be of mutual benefit to the Indians & to the Country in general.\n\nI am sir, yours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Mission.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nMinister.\nThe Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Caledonia\n\nVEN.-ARC DEACON G. A. RIX\nADMINISTRATOR\n\nC. V. EVITT\nSECRETARY-TREASURER\n\nSYNOD OFFICE:\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.\n\nOctober 30, 1925.\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the missionary of the Church of England at Telegraph Creek which explains itself. I believe it is not the policy of your department to build boarding schools for Indians to be run on interdenominational lines but that you co-operate with the church which is carrying on the missionary work among the natives where the school is desired.\n\nIn any case the district including and adjacent to Telegraph Creek has been for many years supervised by the Church of England. The Roman Catholic Church never has had a missionary in that field except for long separated visits and for many years the Presbyterian Church which at one time had a work there has withdrawn its missionary.\n\nThere is absolutely no justification for a Roman Catholic school in that locality; nor is there for a Roman missionary over which point you have no control. There is a small Roman Catholic native mission at Atlin about two hundred miles distant where there is not even a regular day school. That Church might do something in a small way there and not encroach upon the ground where the Church of England has been doing faithful and costly work for many years.\n\nAs administrator of the Diocese of Caledonia I sincerely trust that no favorable consideration will be given to an appeal which I believe has been sent into your department that a Roman Catholic boarding school for Indians should be built in that district. There are not a half dozen real R.C. Indians in the whole district.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A.Rix,\nAdministrator.\nOttawa, November 17, 1925.\n\nVenerable and dear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a communication from your missionary at Telegraph Creek, explaining that the Church of England is interested in the evangelization and education of the Indians on the Stikine River. I wish to assure you that, when plans for the extension of our educational programme in this area are being formed, your representations will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVen. Archdeacon G. A. Rix,\nAdministrator,\nDiocese of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nI consider that \"tying up people as Witches\" is now no longer practised by the Liard Indians but there is no doubt that the belief in witchcraft is still prevalent, and always will be, among the elders.\n\nIt would do a great deal of good if a School Teacher could be sent into the Post every year, coming in on the first H.B.C. boat and returning with the last one. The children here are bright and there are a lot of them, including quite a few Half-Breeds. If this teacher had, in addition, a slight knowledge of medicine, he would find plenty of use for it.\n\nThe Indians are now much more friendly and talk to us about their many troubles. There is occasional mention of the \"Ipsheot\" (presumably the Devil, or at any rate a very evil spirit) but there is much more talk of the Big Chief who tried Mie and Big Alee (Mr. Justice D.A. Macdonald). The trial made a very great impression on the Lots and their description of it to the other Indians has evidently been graphic. In the Summer Mie often came to the Detachment for a talk (and something to eat) and always referred to the Big Chief. \"No more kill witch\" she said. \"You tell him I good now.\"\n\nOur Eddie is a great wonder to them but I am afraid that it is regarded as part of the \"Ipsheot's\" work.\n\nSir: Forwarded for your information. I have sent copies of this report to the Hon. D.A. Macdonald, as it may interest him, and to the Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n(A.W.Duffus) Superintendent Commanding B.C. District.\n\nVancouver:\n17-5-27. C.\nSir:\n\nRe - Conditions Among Indians - Liard River District, B.C.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, for your further information in connection with the above, copy of a report dated the 21st December last, as received from the Officer Commanding B.C. District.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCortlandt Starnes,\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nD/HNC\nVisit of Bishop Bunoz and Father Allard.\n\nOn 8th July Bishop Bunoz and Father Allard came to the Post, and stayed four days.\n\nDuring that time they held services, married two couples, baptised three children and consecrated the graves of those who we had buried this winter. (The marriages were Leo Corniere and Lucy, and Fred Hanselberg and Emilie. See \"Indians Liard District. 17-7-26.\") All the white trappers who are living with Indian women are now married to them, which is a satisfactory state of affairs.\n\nWe did what we could for the comfort of the Bishop and Father Allard, and attended the Sunday Service.\n\nThe Bishop was kind enough to commend our work with the white men and Indians, and thanked us for attending the different funerals. (At any rate we prevented any \"witch business\" on those occasions.)\n\nBoth these Priests spoke against witchcraft but as I have reported several times already, the elder are pretty hard cases. A school for the children is the only solution. It was unfortunate that there were so many deaths among the Loots this winter. (Fortunate perhaps that we were here.) I am sure that the old Loot Mother thinks there is a \"witch\" loose somewhere. After the girl, Betty Loot, had started to bleed at the nose, Glen Loot went over to the camp of a white trapper, Carlson, and asked if his sister had not had a cup of coffee there just previously. Carlson is obviously the \"witch\" in this case, especially as he suffered from the same complaint as the girl last summer. On hearing this I went to the Loot camp and spoke to them all very strongly, perhaps using words that the Bishop and Father Allard cannot.\n\nIn spite of Sergt. Paton's instructions the girl would not lie down, and we had perpetual calls for assistance. Bribery having proved useless I made her relations use force.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.Police,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nForwarded,\n\nSupt.\nCommdg.

It would be much better than sending the Children to Lower B.C.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Town, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\nAugust 28th, 1928.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by your letter of this day I will here-\nwith reduce to writing my views on the school question.\n\nLocation:\nI would suggest 6 Mile Creek as there is a good stream\nof water running through the property the year around. This\nwould help to solve the problem of water supply needed for the\ninstitution. The location is also close to Telegraph Creek\nwhere a good number of Indians come to trade. It is also con-\nvenient for boat landing the only mode existing to bring in our\nfood and other supplies. But any other location, just as\nconvenient, that you or the Department of Indian Affairs would\nsuggest could be considered.\n\nStyle of running: Residential School.\n\nGround required: About 15 or 20 acres would be sufficient\nfor building, recreation yards and garden purposes. But another\n50 acres or so would be desirable for cutting hay, grain, etc.\nas a team of horses and a few heads of cattle would perhaps be\nneeded. But such a parcel of land, if impossible, need not\nto be attached to the school ground. It could be even a few\nmiles away from it.\n\nReligious training: As you may see by the list I have just\nlately given you there is 111 children of school age amongst the\ncatholic Indians of your Agency that come to trade to Telegraph\nCreek or Dease Lake, not including those from Atlin or other\nparts of it. I think this is sufficient to justify a school\nfor them that could accommodate, to start with, 75 children.\n\nFor any other suggestions or plans I would kindly\ninvite you to write to His Lordship Bishop E.Bunoz at\nPrince Rupert, P.O.Box 236.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) E.Allard, O.M.I.\n\nThis is in regard to\nan undenominational\nschool which the Father\ndoes not entertain.\n\n(Sgd.) Harper Reed.\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe the question of an Indian Industrial School for this district, I would inform you that I have had considerable correspondence with the former Agent on this matter, with the approval and complete sanction of the Ecclesiastical Authority of this Diocese.\n\nIn my former appeal for consideration of this matter I most distinctly and emphatically stated that I considered an undenominational School was essential, for there is no doubt that the religious controversies are a most terrible handicap to the religious advancement of the Natives in all the mission fields at the present time, and that this is being now recognized more than ever is shown by the advancement towards unity of the Churches, particularly in the Mission Fields. I personally consider that the selection of religion should be kept out of the matter, and the school should be free of all ecclesiastical interference, the sole religious instruction in the School being confined to the simple Gospel teaching to which there can be no objection by any denomination who have the welfare of the children at heart. Should a service be required by the teachers at the School, the resident minister at Telegraph Creek could be applied to, observing that the Anglican is the only permanent clergy in this District and that the district itself was first visited by Anglican clergymen, before even the Roman Catholics penetrated into the district of Telegraph Creek, Dease Lake and Liard.\n\nAs a site for the School I would personally recommend 6 Mile for the following reasons:-\n\n1. In convenient reach of Telegraph Creek for telegraphic and mail communication.\n\n2. Convenient for transport by water to and from the Coast in the season of navigation.\n\n3. A considerable amount of arable land where vegetables, etc. could be grown for use and excellent drinking water and is healthy and free from contamination with all whites or natives and can easily be reserved for privacy.\n\n4. Dry climate similar to what the native here is used to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) O.T. Hodgson.\nMinister.\n\nTo the Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nP.S. Rev. Hodgson makes the following note under his list of children fit to go to school.\n\ntotal 44. These are only children between 6 and 16.

The solution of this problem would seem to be an agreement between the Anglicans and the Roman Catholics that all children should be educated at one Residential School centrally located. If such an agreement could be entered into and if it is deemed to be workable, some arrangement might be made to establish such a school.\"\n\nHaving just completed a tour of inspection of this Agency I find that the above figures are incorrect, and would you therefore be so good as to render to this office, a list of such children in this Agency that come under your care and that would be entitled to go to such a school. The Teslin, Atlin and Liard Indians are quite willing and indeed want to send their children to school, and would do so if located say within 100 miles of Telegraph Creek. As we are all here now the time would be good to have a meeting and talk this important matter over, will you please advise me on this matter at once.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Indians.\nStikine Agency.\n\nI beg to submit the following information in regard to the above subject and reference.\n\nThe necessity of a Residential School for this Agency has been under discussion for some years, and now with the increase of children, suitable for instruction in such a school, it is becoming a vital and much talked of question amongst the Indians themselves.\n\nThis has been due mostly to the Roman Catholic Fathers engaged in mission work in the Agency, and partly to the general trend of affairs, by which the Indians see that it is to the advantage of their children to have them read, write and add figures. Eaton's catalogues have also had a lot to do with this line of thought.\n\nAt all points of the Agency, during my rounds the matter has been advanced and questions asked, hence the mention of the subject in my reports.\n\nThe total number of children of school age mentioned in your letter dated August 6th, viz. 112, has now grown to bigger numbers, and a correct return will be rendered later on, but in this district, as per the attached sheets, there are 155.\n\nIn Atlin, under Father Godfrey's care, there must be at least 25; he has compiled a list for this purpose, and at Teslin, under Bishop Stringer's care, there is at least another 30, making in all a conservative total of 210 children.\n\nThe Roman Catholics have the greater total in this district and in Atlin, but the Anglicans have an advantage at Teslin and Telegraph Town.\n\nThe School Report just rendered will speak for itself. Whilst at Teslin, the school was being run by a young gentleman who had no control over the children, and the school was looked upon as rather a joke by the Whites, and also by the Indians who are most intelligent. Otherwise there is no tuition for Indian children in the Agency.\n\nCarcross Indian School has been drawing a few children from Atlin and Teslin Lake, but it is gathered that the Natives would much rather send their children to a school somewhere located in the Stikine Agency and south of Teslin Lake.\n\nAs Rev. Hodson was here, and also Father Allard, the attached letter was written, but a meeting could not be arranged, and so they were asked to reduce their views to writing, which same is also attached.\n\nIt would\nIt would seem that a Residential School is desirable and that if located in or around Telegraph Creek, the Indians would be pleased to send their children for school training.\n\nIt also came to notice during several talks with them that the education of their children was really more important than the religious aspect of the case to them, and that it did not matter so much where they went, so long as the children were looked after and taught.\n\nThe matter of location has been gone into, and at first Dease Lake was chosen, but looking into the matter it is found that a far and away better location would be at 6 Mile Creek down the Stikine from Telegraph. To the Indians it does not matter so much, anywhere will do providing its in the dry belt and that they are able to get to the school, at anytime, overland.\n\nIt is admitted that Dease Lake is more centrally located, and easier to get to, for the Indians, but against that there is the cost, etc. of getting supplies in, etc. and being away from the route of travel.\n\nThe location at 6 Mile, although at present a British Columbia Government Reserve, has a fine site, good water, salmon fishing. It is much drier than Dease Lake, and above all is on a main line of travel and supplies can be got in at a reasonable rate and would be in connection with the town of Telegraph Creek, the Dominion Government wire, and it is hoped a resident doctor.\n\nMoreover, crops can be grown at this point, it is not subject to the early frosts that have this year killed all crops in and around Dease Lake and nowhere in the Agency can a school be built cheaper than at this suitable point.\n\nIf the necessity of a school is warranted, the construction of same can be gone into, but it is thought that suitable sand and clay is there, if not a saw-mill could be arranged for, and failing that lumber could be obtained at a fair price from the mills in Wrangell, at the mouth of the Stikine River.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted for your consideration and is as much data as can be gotten together in the limited time at my disposal.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., October 24, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-School in Stikine Agency.\n\nAs the matter of erecting a residential school in the Stikine Agency becomes more desirable from time to time, I feel it is of sufficient importance that I furnish you with some correspondence I have had with Mr. Indian Agent Harper Reed, of Telegraph Creek, on the subject, he having stated in his report for July last, after a visit to the Atlin and Teslin Lake Indians that, \"in both places the crying need is for schooling. They are all willing to help but do not want religion taught, or at least, they wish more learning of a practical sort given their youngsters.\"\n\nYou remember we discussed this matter when you were in Victoria and the decision was come to that unless the Anglican and Roman Catholic parties could agree upon an undenominational school it would be impossible to erect one as there were not sufficient children of either denomination to warrant the building of a school for each. I am not at all satisfied with the figures given by Mr. Indian Agent Harper Reed which he has received from the Missionaries, and I am asking him to forward to me with as little delay as possible a complete list of the Indian children between the ages of seven and sixteen years taken from his census, showing the bands they belong to and the religion they profess.\n\nIn conclusion I may say I am of the opinion that it would go very far in satisfying the Indians of the Stikine Agency, who do not in any event give us any trouble, if an undenominational school was erected for the education of the Indian children in that district.\n\nI was wondering in view of the suggestion of the Rev. Father Allard if the matter was referred to Rt. Rev. Bishop Bunoz, of Prince Rupert, whether you would feel inclined to write to him on this subject pointing out not only the desirability of the children becoming educated but also that a school would afford far better opportunities of permitting Christian Doctrine being given to the Indian children after school hours than can possibly be the case in such a scattered district.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10), Volume 6038, file 158-1-1, part 1\nNovember 3, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 15/12754 of the 24th ultimo, with enclosures, concerning a residential school in the Stikine agency. I do not know when it will be possible to extend our programme to include this section of the province; but the facts presented in your letter will receive consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nN. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo having reference to the possibilities of building an Indian residential school in the Stikine Agency.\n\nIn this connection I beg to inform you that Rt. Rev. Bishop Buonoz, O.M.I., of Prince Rupert, called at my office on the 30th ultimo when this question was discussed and I pointed out to him that in view of reports so far to hand there did not appear to be sufficient children of school age in the Agency to warrant the building of two schools, one for those of the Catholic denomination and the other for the Protestants, and it would be much more satisfactory if an understanding could be arrived at between himself and the head of the Anglican Church that a non-sectarian school should be erected.\n\nThe Bishop, however, did not see his way clear to concur in such a proposal as he considered it would only lead to endless trouble and he put forth the suggestion that each church build its own school with some financial assistance from the Department by way of a grant towards the building and the guarantee that the regular per capita grant would be paid, and I stated I would lay this point before you for your consideration. I may say I have not so far received from Mr. Indian Agent Reed the information I requested from him on August 6th last with regard to the actual number of children of school age in his Agency with the religious belief they adhered to, but when this comes to hand I will report further on the subject.\n\nBishop Buonoz also spoke to me with regard to the school at Atlin at which it is extremely difficult to obtain a teacher for the salary the Department is paying. He stated that he would like to put in a priest to teach the children during the summer months or that we should increase the salary sufficient to warrant the employment of a suitable teacher, the salary to be the same as is paid in the Yukon, whatever that may be.\n\nI am of the opinion that this point is well taken as it will be noted in a communication from the Indian Agent, dated 29th August, forwarded to this office, he speaks of this school at Atlin being run by a young gentleman who had no control over the children and the school was looked upon as rather a joke by the whites and also the Indians who are most intelligent.\n\nAs the living expenses in the Stikine Agency are\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nalmost as high as they are in the Yukon, I feel it would be advisable to provide a salary sufficiently large to warrant the employment of a competent teacher.\n\nWED/KD.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, October 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 15/12/13086 of December 4th, last, and to enquire if you have received the report from Indian Agent Reed, with reference to the actual number of children of school age in his agency, showing the religious denomination. The Department has had a visit from Rev. Father E. Allard, O. M. I., of Telegraph Creek, and he is urging the establishment of a residential school there. I should be glad to have your further report on this subject, with the figures of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E.

These must have increase of children. A big gathering is expected to take place at McDames this year. A check is being maintained by H.B. Factor from now on.\n\nReligions -\n\nMc Dames and Liard. The Anglican Mission do not \"go after\" the Indian Families arriving from outside districts, and there are many who perhaps would join that body if asked.\n\nAtlin & Teslin. The R.C.s only are down this way now, and claim everybody. The Indians are glad of any attention, but really the most are Pagans. There are some Indians that wish the A.s would go down that way.\n\nAtlin & Teslin. The R.C.s give more attention here (Atlin) than the Anglicans, but this is for want of attention from the Anglican s.\n\nTeslin. The R.C.s do not come over here and the Indians are C.E.s or Anglicans, if anything.\n\nI am.\n\nSir.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP. O. BOX 656\nVICTORIA, B.C. November 19, 1929.\n\nYour file 158-1-1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Residential School in Stikine Agency.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enquiring whether I have received a report from Mr. Indian Agent Harper Reed with reference to the actual number of children of school age in his Agency, showing the religious denomination of each.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that after a fairly reliable checking up by the Indian Agent, it appears there are in the Stikine Agency 181 children of school age, 86 of which are male and 93 female. As to their religious beliefs the Agent states there are 65 Protestant and 104 Roman Catholic, with 12 pagans. These are located as hereunder:\n\n| Band          | No. | Males | Females | Prot. | R.C. | Pagans |\n|---------------|-----|-------|---------|-------|------|--------|\n| Telegraph Creek | 64  | 31    | 33      | 35    | 26   | 3      |\n| McDames-Liard | 78  | 36    | 42      | 7     | 62   | 9      |\n| Atlin-Teslin  | 39  | 21    | 18      | 23    | 16   | -      |\n| Totals        | 181 | 86    | 93      | 65    | 104  | 12     |\n\nThere is apparently good reason for establishing a residential school for the accommodation of from 75 to 90 pupils of the Roman Catholic denomination at an early date. Possibly at a later date a smaller school might be established for the Protestant Indians, though for the time being the Protestant children of Telegraph Creek can be educated at the Day School at that place.\n\nThe matter of location of such a school is an important phase of the question and I note in your letter that the Rev. Father Allard is desirous of having one situated at Telegraph Creek, but I beg to inform you that there is no suitable land at that place for such an institution. There is, however, a piece of good land on the Stikine River six miles below Telegraph Creek, a part of which would be eminently suitable for our purposes in every way. This is known as Lot 1, Cassiar District, and comprises 320 acres; it is under reserve by the British Columbia Government at present for possible townsite purposes. Today I had an interview with Mr. Cathcart.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCathcart, Superintendent of Lands for the British Columbia Government, to see if it would be possible for our Department to acquire about 50 acres or so of this Lot for school purposes and he informed me that in all likelihood his Department would give sympathetic consideration to an application in this direction. This Lot is an above state, six miles below Telegraph Creek on the Stikine River and there is on the Eastern portion some good land suitable for agricultural purposes on which could be grown sufficient vegetables for the use of the school. I would say that 50 or 60 acres ought to be sufficient for, of course, cereals cannot be grown in that Northern district nor would it be possible to keep many cattle, if any.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to say within the last few days Mr. Boyd, Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company store at Telegraph Creek called on me and I asked him about a possible location for a school in that district. He informed me that the Lot above mentioned is the only logical place on which to locate as all other land along the river is of a precipitous rocky formation. You will understand, of course, it is most desirable to have such a school located somewhere on the Stikine River as it would be on the regular line of communication with the outside. In a letter of Mr. Indian Agent Reed, of 29th August, 1928, he also favors this site as also did Rev. Commander Hodgson. A copy of the Agent's letter will be found on your file as I forwarded the same to the Deputy Minister on October 24th, 1928.\n\nAttached hereto will be found the Agent's returns showing the number of children of school age in the various bands of the Stikine Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, November 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/12/16019 of the 19th instant, enclosing a report from Mr. Agent Harper, Telegraph Creek, B.C., with reference to the number of children of school age in his agency and showing the religious denomination of each.\n\nIn reply I have to thank you for the information which you forwarded. The matter of providing educational facilities for these children will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, January 9, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Bunoz:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo, concerning a residential school for the Indian children in the Stikine agency. When funds can be provided for the extension of our educational program in British Columbia, your representations will not be overlooked. Dr. Scott informs me that Reverend Father E. Allard, O.M.I., of Telegraph Creek, visited the Department a few weeks ago and explained the needs. At the present time, I am unable to state when such a school could be established by the Government.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nDec 20th 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nRe:- Development of the Cassiar, B.C.\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, for your inspection, a Blue Print of a Proposed (U.S.A.) Highway, through the Stikine Indian Agency.\n\nIn view of the fact that an Industrial School has been mooted for the Indians of this Agency, this is now forwarded as bearing on that matter.\n\nIf a Highway should materialize, the town of Telegraph Creek will practically be deserted, and therefore, perhaps it would be advisable to await further events, ere the location of a School, if such is considered, be fixed.\n\nWhere the Highway must run, is not yet known, but Philip M. Monckton Esq., B.C.L.S., of Vancouver, B.C., has already spent some time on a private reconnaissance of the Nass Divide, and he certainly knows most about the Passes.\n\nHowever, J.D. Craig Esq., of the International Boundary Commission, Ottawa, will no doubt be in touch with the matter, as he is intimately acquainted with this district.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the future establishment of a residential school for the Indian children of the Stikine Agency, and enclosing a blue print of the proposed international highway which would pass through the Agency. I have to thank you for the blue print of this proposed highway. At the present time I am unable to state when such a school could be established.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Secy.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.C.\nOttawa, April 23, 1930.\n\nDear Father Allard:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, urging the establishment of an Indian residential school at Telegraph Creek. I am not sure when it will be possible to provide funds for the extension of our educational programme in British Columbia. At present, all I can say is that your representations will be given consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. E. Allard, O. M. I.,\nFort St. James,\nB. C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. C. C. PERRY, ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA, DATED AUGUST 30/30, HIS NO. 45/18704, forwarded under cover of Commissioner Ditchburn's #45/18751, dated September 5, 1930, addressed to Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThere has been a long standing controversy between the representatives of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Anglican Churches, respectively, as to which church merits an ascendency in regard to residential school facilities as a result of the advent from time to time of their respective Missionaries. In response to my request, Reverend Father Allard, O.M.I., of the R. C. Church and Reverend Commander Hodgson, Anglican Minister, agreed to come together at the Indian Office with the Agent and myself with a view to going over the Agency census and determining what Indians were reputed to belong to either of these churches, in other words to determine who are considered to be Roman Catholics and who are deemed to be of the Protestant faith. This action was thought necessary as a preliminary step in the direction of deciding what recommendation should be made to the Department with respect to Indian education in this large district; a residential school having been asked for during my visit by the Reverend Father Allard, O.M.I., for the accommodation of 92 children stated by him to have been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church. A list of these children was submitted by Father Allard.\n\nReverend Commander Hodgson of the Anglican Church had also submitted a list of families which embraced many of the children in the R. C. list.\n\nA frank and fair discussion of the matter went to show that Indians baptized many years ago by the Anglicans had been rebaptized later with their children into the Roman Catholic Church and vice versa.\n\nThe Agency official census book was examined, Family by Family, and agreement was reached between the two Church representatives in regard to each, subject, of course, to the acceptance of such status by the respective Family heads.\n\nA distressful aspect was the division, through baptism, by the respective clergy, of families. In some cases, the fathers would be pagan, the mothers Catholic and the children Protestant. In other cases the father is Protestant, the mother Catholic, part of the children of one Church and part of another. Many old Indians were baptized by the Anglicans years ago and had lapsed into paganism, some of whom were now claimed by both Catholics and Protestants.\n\nA decision was reached as to the status of\nExtract from Asst. Commissioner Perry's Report (continued)\n\nthe Indians as understood by the clergymen. A subsequent numerical checkup shows as follows:\n\nIn the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, Tahltan and Dease Lake, including Bear Lake migrant visitors, there are,\n\nRoman Catholics 120.\nAnglican 150.\n\nIn the McJames and Liard districts there are claimed by the Roman Catholic clergyman 320 Indians, one-third of these are said to be nomads and are not claimed by the Anglicans. The Roman Catholic Church therefore expects to register these 320 Indians as Roman Catholics.\n\nIn the Atlin and Teslin districts at least two-thirds of the Indians, who in total number 222, are adherents of the Anglican Church. It was admitted that the work of the Anglican Church is increasing there while that of the Roman Catholic Church under Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., is not extensive. Rev. Father Allard, O.M.I., stated that his Church would be willing to give up any religious activities that might be prejudicial to the Anglican interests there, especially if the Department would be willing to make provision for a residential school for say 50 of 92 Catholic children of school age at a place called Six-Mile point which is on the right bank of Stikine River about 6 miles below Telegraph Creek. On the other hand, Rev. Commander Hodgson, of the Anglican Church, at Telegraph Creek, has suggested that if the Roman Catholic Church would be willing to vacate their Telegraph Creek Mission (where Rev. Father Allard has recently erected a church for the Indians in what the Anglicans believe to be their territory) the Anglicans might give up any claim they may have to Missionary territory around McJames Creek and Dease Lake where however the Anglicans have no established or organized missions. The Anglicans may offer some objection to the establishment of a residential school for the Roman Catholic Church near Telegraph Creek as they consider the district an Anglican Missionary territory even though there is some lack of appreciable Missionary activity along educational lines on the part of the Anglicans in this district, the latter through Rev. Commander Hodgson claiming not to have any funds for such purpose. It should be pointed out that despite the past religious work of the Anglicans at Tahltan (now abandoned) and Telegraph Creek, the Roman Catholic Indians have erected new churches at Telegraph Creek and at McJames whether the Anglicans like it or not and the priest has decided to press for the education of the Indians who identify themselves with the Roman Catholic Faith, and hence is asking that a departmental residential school be established under the supervision of the Catholic Church for Catholic children within the territory for which they have established these churches.\n\nThe Department will be aware of a medical\nExtract from Asst. Commissioner Perry's report (cont'd.)\n\nsurvey made in 1928 by Dr. Wride of the Indians in Stikine Agency, in view of which I pointed out to the clergymen concerned that a medical report of the present resident medical officer Dr. Edgelow as to the physical fitness of the 92 R.C. children to enter a residential school would appear to be necessary before consideration could be given to the request for a residential school. This suggestion met with approval, and Dr. Edgelow has promised to make a careful medical examination of the children whose names appear on the list of Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I.\n\nShould a medical report on these children prove satisfactory, it would then be desirable that the Department give consideration to the question as to:- whether\n\n1. A residential school should be provided.\n2. Whether such school should be denominational, undenominational or inter-denominational.\n3. Whether or not the Anglicans' view that the Catholics are usurping their recognized Missionary territory or sphere of influence should be endorsed in view of the limited nature of the present Missionary work of the Anglicans and the recent more active work of the Roman Catholics in this district.\n\nIt seems to me that it might be reasonably deduced from the foregoing observation that as the Roman Catholic Church claims adherents numbering 440 and the Anglicans 372 - (total population of Stikine Agency is 812) there would appear to be reasonable grounds on the part of the former to ask for separate educational facilities for at least 50 of their 92 children, particularly as the Anglicans have a residential school at Carcross, Y.T., which is near the center of their larger church activities and which has at present some accommodation and which might be extended if necessary in order to accommodate the Anglican children who might in future be found available for admission thereto. It is thought that an extension of educational facilities for the Anglican Church at Carcross by the Department for the accommodation of Anglican children should fully compensate them for any obviously questionable loss they may claim to have sustained by the advent of the Catholics into their Missionary territory which at present is showing very slight signs of either religious or educational activity. The children of the district around Telegraph Creek are attending the Provincial public school, while the Mission at Tahltan is deserted and practically abandoned. Should the Department be inclined to recognize the claims of the Roman Catholics to a\nresidential school for Catholic children, it is recommended that such a school be established at 6-mile Point where acreage of sufficient area might be obtained from the Provincial Government which is understood to have placed a reserve on it for educational purposes. I have examined the site and believe the same to be quite suitable for this purpose. It is further recommended that a special inspection be made at the Carcross Indian Residential School which at present seems to bear an unsavoury reputation in the North, with a view of bringing it to a higher degree of efficiency and in order that the children of Anglican families in the Stikine Agency may be given suitable and satisfactory residential school accommodation and supervision. Of course, this recommendation is made subject to a satisfactory report being made by our medical officer respecting the physical fitness of the applicant pupils.\n\nI should advise you that your suggestion to have a joint undenominational school for Stikine Agency while approved by Reverend Hodgson for the Anglicans, is not received with satisfaction by Reverend E. Allard, O.M.I., of the Catholic Church.\n\nIt should further be pointed out that the erection of a residential school at McDames, or Dease Lake for the Catholics as suggested by Rev. Hodgson would be fraught with great expense; while such a school if erected on the bank of the Stikine at a proper elevation would cost a great deal less as freight could be landed close to the proposed site. Moreover it is believed that the Stikine River will always be a main artery into the Cassiar country even though a public highway may be made into Dease Lake and Alaska from the south in the future. Moreover there is a beautiful creek and splendid fishing right at this proposed school site where fish food could easily be obtained for the use of the pupils.\nExtract from estimates submitted by the Indian Agent of the Stickine Agency for the fiscal year 1931-1932.\n\nA Indian Residential school to include all children disregarding to what faith they or their Parents belong, is sadly needed. This would be the very best and most helpful way of bettering the Indians of the Cassiar, and practically the only way. The Carcross School is quite all right in its way, but to reap a full advantage, the School will have to be conducted by The Indian Department itself.\nSeptember 21, 1931.\n\nDear Father Allard:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the education of Indian children of the Atlin district. I quite understand the Indians in the extreme north of B.C. are hesitant about sending their children so far south as our Fraser Lake School. Our educational programme for this area is, as yet, undetermined, but I am free to state that it is not the practice to allow grants for the education of Indian children who are enrolled at institutions outside of Canada.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. J. Allard, O.M.I.,\nAtlin,\nB.C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nAugust 30th, 1932.\n\nMr. Ferry,\nIndian Department Office,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWorking on the favourable report you made two years ago about the necessity of a boarding school for Indian children to be erected at Telegraph Creek or in the vicinity, I have been trying ever since to find a community of Sisters that would be willing to take over an institution of that kind. I am now glad to announce that the General Chapter of the R.R. Sisters of St. Ann has finally accepted and that four Sisters will be available for September 1933.\n\nIt takes a long time to find a staff that will qualify for such a venture and be permanent. Other places had to wait longer. Now that there are helpers willing to come to Telegraph Creek, will you be kind enough to let me know what can be expected from the Indian Department in the way of assistance. The R.R. Sisters, I believe, would also be ready to take hospital work. I have not been able to meet the members of the local hospital board who are all out in the woods just now, but from what was said before I am confident they would be too pleased to have the Sisters take care not only of the Indian patients but also of the white patients.\n\nYou know the conditions around here, Mr. Ferry: over one hundred children of school age between this place only and the Liard and no school; nobody to look after the crippled ones, sick and orphans; much cruelty, superstition, etc., still going on amongst the tribes. Proper education and training of the young generations would, I believe, assure the betterment of the race.\n\nIt is too late now to start anything but I would like to know as soon as possible what the Indian Department would be willing to do for next spring. If it was impossible for Ottawa to accept to build themselves perhaps they could give a grant let us say of $20,000.00 and let the church do it. His Excellency, Bishop Bunoz is away in Europe for perhaps a couple of months more but I thought I would let you know as soon as a staff had been found for Telegraph Creek and ask your assistance for the realization of our plans.\n\nI remain, Sir,\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"E. Allard, O.M.I.\"\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter received at this office from Reverend Father E. Allard, O.M.I., of Telegraph Creek, Stikine Agency, in regard to educational and medical matters in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek. This letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nIf the Department will kindly refer to my report on the inspection of Stikine Agency, dated August 30th, 1930, considerable light will be thrown upon the matter now written on by Reverend Father Allard. The latter, however, has not seen my report on the situation, although I had told him during my visit that I would make the Department fully acquainted with conditions at and around Telegraph Creek. Beyond this, of course, I could not say. My report, at page 6\u2014under the heading of \"Education\" deals with the matter of a School; and at page 10, under the heading \"Hospital and Medical\" the local hospital and medical situation is dealt with. The Department will be aware that there is no medical man at Telegraph Creek at present owing to Dr. A. Edgellow not returning from leave of absence. The doctor was to have made an examination of the children of the Agency before the question of a school could be proceeded with.\n\nI should add that although Mr. Ditchburn furnished Dr. Young, Provincial Health Officer, with copy of that portion of my report dealing with the Telegraph Creek hospital, no steps have been taken by the latter in regard thereto. The situation, therefore, both as regards education and medical matters remains exactly as when I made my report in 1930, and it is therefore suggested that the Department take the report as a basis of consideration of the letter of Reverend Father Allard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

I would direct your special attention to the report of Assistant Commissioner Perry, dated August 30, 1930. This report is turned out on the file and explains the situation fully.\nFort St. James, B.C.,\nOctober 31, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nI wish to thank you for the copy of your letter sent to Mr. Reed, also for the copy of the letter of the Department. Mr. Reed had not received those letters when I left Telegraph Creek, October 4th.\n\nI understand that owing to the lack of funds at the present time, the Department is not prepared to make any decision regarding the erection of an Indian Boarding School in the vicinity of Telegraph Creek, but what about the estimates for next spring? Could not our demand be included in. What I have been asking for is not such a big sum after all. It is, I think, worth noticing the need of that district and also the fact that I am not asking the Department to go to the trouble of sponsoring all the undertaking alone. I have a qualified staff already assured but we must build now when it is available.\n\nWill you be good enough to explain to the new superintendent-general Dr. H.W. McGill, that owing to the need of that immense district in which there is no organization yet to take care of the moral and physical welfare of the Indians in a practical and efficient way; nobody to look after the abandoned children and orphans; owing to the fact that most of the Indians of the Stikine Agency are now baptized in our church; owing to the fact that I went to the trouble of finding and have now found a very capable staff to do the work, the Rev. Sisters of St. Ann of Montreal; it is to be hoped that action will no longer be deferred by the Department and that our request for a grant of at least $20,000.00 towards the erection of a school will be included in the estimates for next spring.\n\nWith kind personal regards and wishes, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"E.

G. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDr. H.H. McGill  \nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Superintendent General,\n\nAs this is the time when the Estimates are being prepared I consider it my duty to remind you of my demand made last November of a residential Indian school for the Stikine Agency. As you know there is no school in that immense district of Northern British Columbia. Yet a school is just as necessary there as in any other part of the Dominion, perhaps more so, in order to aid in the civilization of those natives who so far have had no chance to get an education and who are inclined to be troublesome at any time, as was the case rather recently. For you may remember that in 1926 five Indians charged with murder and witchcraft had to be brought from Liard river to the Okala prison near Vancouver and again several witnesses had to come from that distant place to Prince Rupert for the assizes. The trial cost the Government an enormous sum. What has happened then may happen again unless something is done to prevent it. The best prevention of that evil, I think, is to give those wild natives a good education which will convey to them knowledge and respect of the law. This would be an invaluable blessing for a region so far away from police officers, prison and court house.\n\nTo secure these advantages for natives and whites I have offered and still offer to put up the school building and supply a good teaching staff provided the Government supplies a per capita grant for about fifty children. This is an offer which I am sure, the Government cannot turn down even in time of depression.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nThe children to be admitted to the school will be carefully chosen among the most healthy and fittest to profit by that special training intended to qualify them for the exercise of a beneficial influence on their fellow natives.\n\nIn the expectation of a favorable answer and with anticipated thanks, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n+ E.M. Bishop of Yukon & Prince Rupert\nJanuary 13th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Thomas G. Murphy -\n\nIn regard to attached copy of communication from His Lordship Bishop Bunces, I have to say that no item has been placed in the Estimates for the erection of a new school in the Stikine Agency, and no provision will be made for such expenditure except with your express directions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nJan. 7th, 1933.\n\nThe Hon. T.G. Murphy\nMinister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nHonorable & Dear Sir,\n\nI consider it my duty to remind you of my visit, last November, in the course of which I appealed to you for Government aid for the establishment of an Indian residential school in the Stikine Agency. I offered you to build the school and supply a good teaching staff provided the Government would supply the annual per capita grant for about 50 pupils. This offer which the Government cannot turn down even in time of depression.\n\nThe Indians have no school in that immense district, perhaps the only one in Canada where the natives are without some educational facilities. Yet they have a right to a school just as well as the other natives; they need one and ask for it. The Government is in duty bound to give them a chance to acquire some education to aid in their civilization and thus to avoid in the future those disorders which in the past have been very costly to the Department of Justice.\n\nIn the expectation of a favorable answer and with anticipated thanks, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) E.M. BUNOZ, O.M.I.\nBishop of Yukon & Prince Rupert.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJanuary 21st, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am sending, herewith, a copy of a letter addressed to the Minister by the Roman Catholic Bishop of the Yukon and Prince Rupert with reference to Government aid for the establishment of an Indian Residential School in the Stikine Agency.\n\nThe Minister would like to obtain a report which will enable him to reply.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, January 23, 1933.\n\nDear Bishop Bunoz:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 7th instant, with reference to Government aid for the establishment of a residential school in the Stikine Agency, northern British Columbia. Your proposal has been carefully considered, and your representation for the establishment of a residential school will be kept in mind. However, owing to reduced appropriations, I am unable to provide the expenditure required for a per capita allowance. I may add that it may be necessary to curtail our present educational programme during the coming fiscal year.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev. E. H. Bunoz, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJanuary 24, 1933.\n\nDear Bishop Bunoz:\n\nPlease accept my sincere apology for my long delay in answering your letter of January 5th, in respect to the proposal to build a school for the Stikine Agency. The only excuse for my delay is that I wished to take this matter up with the Minister and was unaware that you had taken it up with him directly.\n\nWe have noted your arguments in favour of this project and have given very careful consideration to the matter. I discussed this with the Minister and, for the reasons that you will understand, we find it impossible to undertake the guarantee that you suggest. We are extremely short of funds and have had to cut our estimates severely, even yet we do not know whether our very modest requests in the way of estimates will be met in full and we may have to make still further sacrifices.\n\nThe only new building for which we ask appropriation is the replacement of the Lebret School and even in this case we are simply asking for something to make a start. It is our constant fear that unless the financial situation improves we shall have to give serious consideration to curtailing the activities of the Indian\n\n- Department -\n\nRight Rev. E. M.

However, we hope that things will not come to this pass; but for the next year we shall be very well satisfied if we are able to maintain our position intact.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOffice of\nThe Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJanuary 25, 1933\n\nDear Bishop Bunos,\n\nI have received your letter of the 7th instant with reference to Government aid for the establishment of a residential school in the Stikine Agency, northern British Columbia.\n\nYour proposal has been carefully considered.

Allard to be the school master for the coming summer.\n\nEvery assistance shall be rendered to the Rev. Father, as in times past, and it is expected that his services will result in benefit to the children of that District.\n\nThe matter of the school supplies was taken up with the Department, under letter from this Office dated May 5th, and mailed ere the above acknowledged communication arrived, and little can be added to the statements therein contained.\n\nFather Allard generally spends some time in and around this upper district ere proceeding to No Dames Creek, so it is thought the supplies will arrive in correct time for him to take them down to No Dames, personally.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

MCGILL,\n\nHas the Reverend Father Joseph Allard, (Atlin, B.C.) requested assistance in the matter of education for Indians in the district? He is said to be doing good work. If such a request has been received, how is the Department disposed to consider it?\n\nfor Private Secretary.\nOttawa\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nSeptember 6th, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Bishop,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 5th instant, with reference to the education of Indians in the district served by Reverend Father Joseph Allard, Atlin, B.C.\n\nFor the past three summers, the Department has allowed Father Allard a grant of $100 a month, less 10% during the present fiscal year, for the conducting of a summer school known as \"Makken\". This school has been open during the months of June, July and August in 1931, 1932 and 1933.\n\nFor several years past, Right Reverend M.M. Baines, O.M.I., D.D., and Reverend Father Allard have urged the establishment of an Indian residential school in this district but, owing to lack of funds, the Department has been unable to give serious consideration to the matter. You will remember that Right Reverend M.M. Baines wrote the Honourable Mr. Murphy on January 7th, last, and he replied in a letter dated January 23rd, 1933.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKamloops, B.C., July 28th, 1936.\n\nInspection Report No.4, Stikine Agency.\n\nEX'D.\n\nThis is a very pressing question in this agency, the Indians so far being practically uneducated. On the other hand, to send them out to boarding schools would be fatal, as they then lose touch with woodcraft and wild life, which is and can be their only source of livelihood. As long as a majority of the children can learn to read, write and figure up to even as low as grade 5, and are not kept at school for too long periods, or until thirteen years old, this should be sufficient for a long while to come.\n\nIn fact a period of winter or summer schools in the most favourable positions is probably the best way. Further, it must be borne in mind that wherever the women and children are assembled together for the children's period schooling, provision will have to be made for hunting for food, and possibly anyhow in the winter schools, some sort of buildings for them to live in. Further, too, anyhow at winter schools, teachers will have a pretty hard time and I should think require some extra pay, as they will have to outfit themselves specially. Summer school teachers too will have to contend with the curse of mosquitos and flies, besides in both cases, the high cost of reaching their destination and getting out again.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nLIARD POST, B.C. For the past few years the matter of a Summer day school for this far-away Hudson Bay Post has been mooted, and much correspondence passed as to the best method of procedure. As quite a few children at this point were half-breeds Bishop Bunoz was requested to find out from the B.C. Provincial School Authorities, exactly what they were prepared to do in the way of assistance were a school started. Up to the present His Lordship has not replied giving such data but has sent in Father Dream O.M.I., with Father Poulette, O.M.I., as his Assistant. This summer they have constructed a very fine Church-School House, also living quarters. Much of the material they brought in with them, and the buildings stand on their own owned compound, side on to the Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Department has not assisted in this case at all. The number of children at this point that might attend such a school is about half Indian and half halfbreed, it might be that the Indians have slightly more than half at certain times when the nomads come down to this Post. However Father Dream requested to know if he could obtain assistance for the summer of 1936, and he was promised that the Department would be written to in regard to school supplies. As the school is just starting a full equipment would be required, the same as allowed to Mc Dames School on its first opening. Salary for the Teacher was carefully avoided, but if same is to be paid the sum of $150.00 is considered reasonable in this most expensive locality. A School is certainly needed here, and the very fact that two Fathers are residing at the Post will tend to lift the general moral tone of the Camp. Father Dream was asked if he intended going up to Francis Lake in the Yukon, his reply being \"that he might do so, but not this Fall\" As the Hudson Bay Company has recently bought up a Trader's Store on Francis Lake, it is quite expected that the R.C. Mission will establish some kind of small Mission house there also. Photographs of the above mentioned buildings at Liard will be submitted later. May this Agency be advised as to further action, if any, that the Department considers correct.\n\nKLAPPAN WINTER DAY SCHOOL. The location of this school is out in Klappan District, south of Telegraph Creek. It serves a whole lot of nomads and acts as a concentration camp for the very large families during the winters, when the head of the family has to travel long distances for trapping purposes. The school ran all last winter in one or two very good cabins erected for this purpose\u2014it is on a Reserve near-by a Lake. The school was successful from its start, and good progress was made by the children. Through its establishment more fur for the families was obtained, and this winter they will reap its full benefits. Requirements have been met, for this winter and from now on it needs only worn out school supplies restocked. The Salary allowed the Teacher is $100.00 (158-7-1) and Father Bosse O.M.I., conducts this during winters and the Bease Lake School during the summer time. However this winter Father Bosse has with him a certain Mr Moran, most capable person, and he in turn has brought up as an extra help, a certain Halfbreed named Mac Stephens. It is thought that this lad will be going out again next spring.\n\nCARIBOU HIDE NATIVE SCHOOL. This school has never been officially started, but Cripple Jimmy, a member of that Band has, on his own been conducting a very primitive school of his own. The matter was up for consideration upon Inspector Parnells visit to these parts, but it was impossible to reach this very distant Band of Indians. This Fall The Department has been kind enough to allow a supply of school material, which has already been forwarded to them. (Dept. letter - July 31-36 158-7-1) There is little doubt but what Father Bosse will this winter pay a visit to these Indians and start up a little school. This should be able to run along until such time as correct arrangements can be taken up and settled. This is a very fine bunch of Indians and deserve help, but their location is about 200 miles from anywhere, and are obliged to stay where they are for trapping purposes. A teacher for this location will have to go in by Plane.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a Special Report on the progress accomplished by The R.C. Mission with their various Schools etc throughout the southern part of this Agency. The Mission have the following Churches and School:\n\nTelegraph Creek, Headquarters, Large Mission Church.\nDease Lake, Church-School House.\nMc Dames, Church Also School House.\nLiard Post Church-School House.\nKlappan District, School - Church building.\nCaribou Hide, Indian Cabin used as School- and Church.\n\nIn the Indian quarter of the Telegraph Creek Townsite the R.C. Mission have their Headquarter Church building, which is well founded. At this point stop all the Teachers on their way to their several schools in the Interior. When such are here, services are held, otherwise the Church remains closed. There is no school in connection with this Church, such being considered hardly feasible during the short summer months, with the Nomads who come in from the \"bush.\"\n\nDEASE LAKE. This spring a summer day-school was opened at this point for the Indian children who go out trapping in the winter with their parents. For this purpose an excellent Church-School House building has now been completed, situated on the Reserve. Father Boss\u00e9 O.M.I., has acted as Teacher and is expected to do so next summer. Attendance was rather good, and will be better next year, little can be said regarding the progress, as the effort is new. The Teachers Salary (158-3-1) allowed is $100.00 per month. Supplies needed for 1937 season will be re-stocking of school books with odds and ends. It is considered that who-so-ever is installed as the Reserve Teacher of this school, should also act as a Reserve Constable, and look after the general morals of the Reserve\u2014reporting all incorrect affairs for Indian Office attention.\n\nMC DAMES CREEK. On the Reserve at this point is a very excellent Church and some ways away, on higher ground stands a more excellent School House. A fresh School Teacher seems to arrive for duty here, every year. However for 1936 it is thought that Father Poulette, now at Liard Post, will take over the charge of this summer school. The salary allowed for this school is $110.00 (158-3-1), owing to the higher cost of provisions. For the past summer Mr Anglin (late British soldier-service in Sudan) was in charge, and much good work accomplished. He was however a little too earnest in his efforts with the nomadic children, who could not respond to his requirements as soon as wished. Here again the Schoolmaster, who resides on the Reserve, should be requested to keep order, or at least report disorder, whilst he is there, to the Indian Office, and Police. School progress however was good. Requirements for season 1938 will be re-stocking the worn out school supplies.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAT Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nR.C. Mission Schools.\n\nSpecial Report.

The school buildings, except Tahltan, leave much to be desired, but under existing circumstances it will presumably be impossible to deal with this situation entirely at one time. The chief difficulty, apart from lack of funds, is the very high cost of transporting material, often several times its value. The schools can be dealt with one by one, each being put into fairly good condition or replaced, or a certain amount of improvement carried out each year on the entire group, until they are as satisfactory as local conditions will permit; and this will no doubt be found the most feasible procedure after the ownership question is definitely settled and the Churches quit claiming financial interest in them. The Agent should place a suitable and reasonable amount in his estimates for this purpose. Subject to foregoing remarks regarding individual schools, I am satisfied of the necessity of continuation of the schools and would recommend, subject to further investigation by Mr. Sampson, that consideration be given to extending the teaching period, provided competent tuition is given.\n\nI am most definitely not satisfied that the tuition in any of the schools is even anywhere near the Department's requirements, despite the fact that I was unable to check the children's work. I feel that investigation will show that they are more mission than school and that the stipends are actually more in the nature of mission assistance than educational expenditures. Five of the six teachers speak very imperfect English and none of them, so far as I am aware, have even a rudimentary training in Educational work; Father Carpentier being the most successful.\n\nIf the present set up is to be continued, and trained teachers are hard to get in this country where living costs are abnormally high, I would recommend that the Inspector of Schools visit the district during the summer months, when the summer schools are in session, and report on the work in detail endeavoring to give what instruction is possible to these missionaries. In this he will meet all the teachers as they also cover the winter schools during that season. The Stikine Indians are bright and intelligent and there is an urgent necessity that they be given a reasonable educational program with efficient teaching. Meanwhile, Mr. Sampson has been instructed to secure report forms from the Department and visit the schools as frequently as possible, insisting that our requirements be met.\n\nUnfortunately we have been led to believe by Mr. Reed that the Stikine Indians are a low type of nomadic Indians, here today and miles away tomorrow. This idea has been strengthened...\nThe School requirements of the Agency appeared to be pretty well covered, except at Telegraph Creek and possibly Teslin Lake, insofar as location is concerned.

Nothing is further from the truth apart from the necessity of their having to proceed to their traplines during the late winter, but this does not make them any more nomadic than the Coast Indian Fisherman.\nOttawa, January 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have had before me for consideration for several days the report submitted to you by Inspector Coleman, immediately following his recent inspection of the Stikine Agency.\n\nThe inspection of this agency, undertaken and carried out by Inspector Coleman, appears to have been both thorough and comprehensive, and his report, while somewhat disturbing, contains very valuable information.\n\nAt this time I am anxious to discuss Inspector Coleman's references to the educational facilities of the agency. In his general summary the Inspector states:\n\n\"I am most definitely not satisfied that the tuition in any of the schools is even anywhere near the Department's requirements, despite the fact that I was unable to check the children's work. I feel that investigation will show that they are more mission than school and that the stipends are actually more in the nature of mission assistance than educational expenditures. Five of the six teachers speak very imperfect English and none of them, so far as I am aware, have even a rudimentary training in educational work, Father Carpentier being the most successful.\"\n\nYou are aware, of course, that the Government has never at any time accepted responsibility for missionary effort amongst any Indians anywhere in the Dominion. Missionary effort on Indian reserves, looking toward the Christianization of the Indian population, has always been assumed willingly by the Churches. It would appear that in the Stikine Agency, however, there is very close relationship existing between missionary effort on the one hand and educational effort on the other. I do not feel that we should take any serious objection to this, provided that the missionaries, in addition to their regular missionary work, act as school teachers and are fully qualified teachers in a professional sense. Inspector Coleman informs us that none of these teachers are so qualified, and I feel confident that our officials in British Columbia responsible for the administration of Indian affairs, the Department itself and even the Churches would be subjected to a great deal of severe criticism if the facts submitted in Inspector Coleman's report became the subject of discussion in Parliament or in the Press. With the burden of taxation in Canada becoming increasingly more onerous, the taxpayers\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nin the future are likely to demand that every dollar authorized by Parliament is spent on the program for which the Government is responsible.\n\nIt appears to me that we should first of all decide very definitely what these Indians in the outlying districts of the country should be actually taught. Districts such as the Stikine district are becoming more and more accessible, as the result of improved transportation facilities, particularly aeroplane travel. If such is the case, these Indians should be, if they are going to be even partially assimilated, instructed in English. They should be taught Arithmetic to the extent that they will be able to undertake simple business transactions, and above all they should be taught how to take care of their bodies and how to use their hands. It may be that a thorough survey of the district should be undertaken by a qualified educationist, preferably Inspector Barry, if he is physically fit and has the time at his disposal to undertake the task. The investigator should be called upon to submit a curriculum designed to meet the needs of these people. He should report on school buildings, their number and exact location. Indian day schools, in my judgment, should be the property of the Department and should be used exclusively for educational purposes. Inspector Coleman's suggestion, that a school be built at Telegraph Creek and an undenominational teacher employed, would not, I feel sure, be acceptable to the Churches. My experience here has been that there is no such thing as an undenominational teacher; a teacher is either Catholic or non-Catholic. It is just possible that at Telegraph Creek two schools should be built, just as soon as funds are available for such buildings.\n\nThe officials here are disposed to think that it is a sheer waste of time and money to keep schools open and in operation unless these schools are under the direction of fully qualified teachers. However, in view of the difficulty that we may experience, for the time being at least, in getting fully qualified teachers, it might be worth while considering the advisability of securing a fully qualified, experienced teacher and putting him in charge of two schools in the agency, spending approximately six months at each, and allowing him a three week holiday period. I suggest this as an inducement that might be held out to teachers who would not be prepared to go in for such an extended period. It might also be possible that we might, by the payment of a higher salary, induce a fully qualified and experienced teacher to take charge of one of our schools and at the same time assume responsibility for the inspection of other schools in the district. It is difficult for me to persuade myself that we can hope for worthwhile results from these schools until our inspection is more regular than it is at the present time or is likely to be at any time in the future, in view of the large number of schools for which Inspector\n\nBarry -\nBarry is now responsible.\n\nI have referred to the emphasis that should be placed in the curriculum on the care of the body and the use of the hands. It might be worth while, as an experiment, to employ - if they can be secured - fully qualified nurses with normal training and pay such teachers a much higher salary than we have been paying to the teachers in charge of our seasonal schools.\n\nYou are aware that at the present time our building program has been suspended. We have not at any time within the last couple of years constructed Indian day or residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. However, this period of suspension cannot, in my judgment, last indefinitely. Our Indian school population is increasing at the rate of 300 per annum, and unless funds are available for the construction of schools in the immediate future, our schools are likely to become congested and overtaxed. When a building program is undertaken in the Stikine Agency, care should be taken to recommend the construction of a school with ample living accommodation for the teacher - quarters that will be comfortable and satisfactory in every sense. The average teacher will hesitate to undertake work in an outlying district such as this, unless there is assurance of comfortable living accommodation and reasonable remuneration.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss the subject matter of this letter not only with Inspector Barry and Inspector Coleman, but with the Roman Catholic and Anglican Bishops. The Director, with whom I have discussed Inspector Coleman's report very fully and in detail, is not at all sure that we should continue to keep our day schools in the Stikine Agency open and in operation unless the bishops are prepared to nominate fully qualified teachers. I feel confident, however, that you will find the Bishops very willing and very anxious to co-operate with us in the establishment and conduct of better schools. They must be convinced, as we are, that present conditions, from an educational standpoint, are wholly unsatisfactory and cannot continue. When I intimate that you should discuss this letter with the Bishops, I base this suggestion on the assumption that these Bishops visit Vancouver from time to time. It would be highly desirable, of course, if you could discuss the matter with them when Inspectors Coleman and Barry are at the same time. In view of the critical times in which we are living, it is just possible that we may not be able to do much in the construction of better buildings for the time being at least. I do feel, however, that we should do something at the earliest possible date to supply qualified teachers for these schools. Apart from any investigation that may be undertaken by Inspector Barry or an educationist in the future, there is sufficient evidence -\nevidence in Inspector Coleman's report to justify us in taking immediate steps as far as the teachers and courses of study are concerned.\n\nI should welcome any comments you may care to send forward on these suggestions, just as soon as you have had an opportunity to discuss them with your officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Mr. C.W. Jackson's memorandum to Dr. McGill dated January 29, 1942.\n\nSpecial reference might be made as to the class of teachers that are now employed. It was surprising to know that very few of them were able to speak the English language properly. It would seem advisable that regardless of the manner in which teachers are engaged, every effort should be made to see that they are fully qualified, that they are British subjects by birth or naturalization, and that they are able to speak the language of the majority of the persons in the district with whom they will be required to do business.\nMAY BE MILITARY HOSPITAL\n\nOttawa Takes Over Victoria Normal School for War Aims\n\n(By Daily Province Staff Correspondent.)\n\nVICTORIA, Feb. 4.\u2014Victoria's Normal School has been requisitioned by Ottawa for war purposes, it was stated in the Legislative Assembly today by G.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have given considerable thought to the views of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training as expressed in Departmental Letter 158-1-1 of January 28th last, this letter being returned herewith.\n\nYou have asked me to let you have my views on the various points raised. This has been done to the best of my ability in the following paragraphs, the matters to be discussed being taken up in the order in which they are mentioned by Mr Hoey.\n\nIt is a fact that a very close relationship exists between missionary effort and educational effort in many of our Indian day schools. I have never expressed any adverse opinion on this, except in those cases where the missionary teacher was obviously quite unfit for the work of a teacher and where he held no professional qualifications acceptable to a Provincial Department of Education in Canada.\n\nThe Department will be well aware that again and again I have objected to the retention in the schools of Anglican mission teachers in the Diocese of Caledonia where such teachers were not giving satisfactory service as such in their schools. Reference to the files on such schools as Hazelton, Gitlakdamix, and Kitkatla will confirm this. My actions during the past ten or eleven years in this regard have led the Rt. Rev. G. A. Kix, Bishop of Caledonia, to express a very critical view of my services, and this is quite understandable as when the Department terminated the services of unsatisfactory teachers as a result of my reports the Bishop lost at the same time one of his Missionaries, the greater part of whose salary we were paying.\n\nIt would appear from Inspector Coleman's report that in the Stikine Agency none of the teachers or missionaries in charge of schools are in fact qualified by any sort of professional training or certification, and I for one consider that the retention of such persons as teachers of even seasonal schools could not possibly be justified even in less critical times. I have never met any of these men to my knowledge, their appointments having been made by the Department without any reference to the Vancouver office of the Commissioner. I do not remember having had any request from these Missionary teachers for professional advice, courses of study etc. It is true that a former teacher at Klappan Seasonal Indian Day School did call on me once in Vancouver, but this visit was in relation to a dispute that he had with the Indian Agent then at Telegraph Creek.\nSeasonal Indian Schools Stikine Agency:\n\nWith reference to a suitable course of study for the Indian children in seasonal Indian day schools, and in particular the children of the Stikine Agency, I may say that I see no reason why the course now being taught in the Primary and Junior Grades of our regular day schools should not prove highly satisfactory.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that I have adapted the B.C. Programme of Studies to our schools and all teachers visiting my office for assistance, as well as those teachers who on first appointment can arrange for a conference here, are given three or four hours detailed instruction here. This instruction covers the limits of work to be taken up in the various Grades, notes on the texts to be used, and very detailed advice as to the methods to be employed in teaching the key subjects, Language, Reading, Spelling, Writing, Arithmetic. The use of the work Books supplied by the Department is explained, and remarks made with regard to the instruction to be given in Health and Physical Training, Memory and Singing, Nature and Science, History and Geography, Vocational subjects in general. Teachers as a rule leave this office with many notes taken during my conference with them.\n\nWhen schools are inspected the suggestions made to teachers in Vancouver are repeated when necessary, amplified, and demonstration lessons given to cover the more important points or those parts of the course not so well understood by the teacher. This work has been undertaken for years and has proved a very great strain on me, though it has been the means of obtaining a fairly satisfactory general level of teaching throughout British Columbia, with the exception of those Seasonal Schools in northern parts of the Province which I am unable to visit and whose teachers have not sought assistance by calling here.\n\nI very much doubt that any advantage whatever would result from an educational survey by a professional man.\n\nI have never found that untrained teachers, that is teachers lacking both university education and also professional training, gained much from my visits. While it is true that a School Inspector may be in a position to note much that an Indian Agent would perhaps overlook, the information now required with regard to the schools in the North is hardly of a professional nature.\n\nWe wish to have particulars of the number of children of school age, and below school age, available for each school. We no doubt wish to know just which months these children would attend the school. We need some particulars of the buildings used for schools, their ownership in particular and if used for other purposes as well as that of a school. Particulars with regard to accommodation for a teacher are also necessary. All of this and much more would be well known to the local Indian Agent.\n\nThe absence from Vancouver for any lengthy period of either Inspector Coleman or myself simply means greatly increased work here for the Inspector remaining in Vancouver. A further report following that of Inspector Coleman on the present condition of the Stikine Indian Seasonal Day Schools if this involves expenditure of time and money, as it would if I were to go to that part of the Province later this year, could not, in my opinion, be justified.\nSeasonal Indian Schools, Stikine Agency:\n\nThe whole of the information suggested as necessary with regard to the Stikine schools by Mr. Doucet would no doubt be available in the Indian Agent's office at Telegraph Creek, with the exception of a suggested curriculum.\n\nIn general and even in a seasonal school we should make use of the B.C. Programme of Studies, though this should not of course be followed in detail. My adaption of the above Programme for Grades 1 to 6 inclusive has never been reduced to print or even typed out. It would be necessary to employ the services of a teacher stenographer for several days at least to get the instructions given to teachers here into a form which they might be reproduced. While Mr. Doucet and I were in the St Paul's School classrooms last year I made an effort to have one of the school staff reduce my remarks and instructions to typescript, but the result was so poor that the notes were useless. An untrained teacher simply does not understand the technical terms and when these have to be explained in simple language the time taken is lengthy and the resulting notes more or less useless.\n\nI understand from Inspector Coleman's report that five out of the six teachers now in charge of the seasonal schools under review speak very poor English. This coupled with the lack of even rudimentary training in educational work would make a visit from me a complete waste of time, for I am perfectly certain they would be unable to understand even the simple instructions I give to teachers taking up appointments for the first time.\n\nI regret to say that my health is failing very rapidly. My own doctor has been doing his best to keep me going till I am 55 years of age as I had intended to retire then, but though I am now on a daily allotment of Calcium and vitamins I am simply not equal to the constant travelling, inspection work, and in particular the daily worry of office work (conferences, preparation of reports, and correspondence) in an office where electric light has to be used almost the whole day. I shall be 53 next July and I propose to ask at the close of the present Fiscal Year for a Medical Board so that I can retire at the end of the 1942-43 academic year. My application for such retirement will of course form the subject of separate correspondence, but I am forced to mention the matter here as it must be quite apparent to the Department that I am in no fit state to undertake a journey to the Stikine schools. If I can complete the inspection of the schools south of Prince Rupert, and I somewhat doubt my ability to do this, this year, I shall have completed the programme I considered essential.\n\nIt is quite possible that an Indian day school is now required at Telegraph Creek. This should probably be conducted in much the same way at the school at Koksilah, Cowichan Agency, that is as an undenominational school. A properly qualified teacher would be necessary and of course a residence of such teacher as part of the school buildings.\n\nThe teacher at Telegraph Creek might be asked to take an interest in the other schools and assist the teachers of these schools, but I do not believe that such a teacher should be asked to report on the other schools. Supervising Principals not Inspectors sometimes get into serious trouble through making adverse reports on teachers, particularly when such reports lead to the dismissal of such teachers, and in this case differences of Church affiliation would complicate the situation greatly.\nMr. Hoey states that the officials in Ottawa are disposed to think that it is sheer waste of time and money to keep schools open and in operation unless these schools are under the direction of fully qualified teachers.\n\nI have found that certain persons can be given sufficient instruction here say in one or two days to enable them to operate an Indian day school in a successful manner, but such persons are somewhat difficult to find. I am at the moment thinking of such a teacher as Mr. Barre of the Pemberton Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, who after short instruction here and later at his school has made a very great success of his work in the Primary and Junior Grades.\n\nIn general however I am in perfect agreement with the other officials and consider that seasonal schools at least should be closed and kept closed till certificated teachers are available to take charge of them.\n\nMr. Hoey's idea that a nurse teacher would be suitable for the work in a Stikine school or schools is of course perfectly sound and in fact an ideal set up, but I have no hope whatever of finding a nurse teacher for even one of the best of our schools near Vancouver say till after the present war. In fact I do not know where we shall find certificated teachers for the regular schools next year. Attached is an extract from the Vancouver Province of February 4th which may be of interest to the officials in Ottawa.\n\nWould it not be possible for Mr Doucet to come out to B.C. for at least a month or better two months say April and May and make a survey of the present schools on the coast including a few of the residential schools in the Fraser Valley. I would very much like him to visit the schools before I retire and this would give him a chance of working out with me a Programme of Studies for the Indian schools based on the work I have found possible and the present wishes of the Department.\n\nI trust that you will find some suggestions in this letter of assistance, and that if means can not be found to improve the Stikine Seasonal Schools very greatly they be closed at least during the period of the present war. I regret that I know so little of them or of the seasonal schools in the Stuart Lake Agency as in neither case were we consulted in Vancouver either as to their establishment or as to the appointment of teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to the Department's letter of January 26th, your file 158-1-1, regarding the seasonal Indian Day Schools operated at Departmental expense in the Stikine Indian Agency.\n\nThe matters dealt with by Mr. Hoey have been fully discussed with Inspector Barry whose report on the various points raised is enclosed herewith. It will be found that Inspector Barry has dealt quite fully with the important items and in the order in which they occur in the Department's letter.\n\nThis office had very little information with regard to the Indian Schools in the Stikine Agency until the submission of Mr. Coleman's report on his inspection of this Agency in August, September and October of last year, the arrangements in connection with the appointment of teachers and the operation of these schools having been made directly by the Department with the classes concerned, without reference to the Commissioner's office. This has also been the procedure followed by the Department with respect to the seasonal schools in the Babine and Stuart Lake Agencies regarding which we have practically no information here.\n\nThe policy followed by the Department in this regard has no doubt been entirely responsible for the opinion frequently expressed by Inspector Barry and accepted by myself, that we have little, if anything, to do with the operation of these schools, particularly in the matter of the appointment of teachers. This does not apply to the seasonal school at Ulkatcho, which was authorized by the Department following representations made by Mr. Indian Agent Christie through this office, or\nto the seasonal schools in the Kwawkewlth Agency. So that although the Department may have considered it the duty and responsibility of the Commissioner to report on the seasonal schools in the remote northerly sections of the Province, the policy pursued by the Department with respect to these schools worked against the acceptance of such responsibility by the officials here. I mention this not as a criticism of Departmental policy, but to make it quite clear that there has been no disposition on the part of the staff of this office to shirk responsibility with respect to the matter under review.\n\nApart altogether from other causes which may have contributed to the backward condition of the seasonal schools visited by Mr. Coleman, I think it is fairly obvious that the lack of properly qualified teachers could be rightly regarded as the most important factor leading to their present unsatisfactory state. Nor have we the right to expect conditions to improve greatly until certificated teachers are placed in charge of these schools.\n\nIt will be noted from the Inspector's report that he intends to apply at an early date for retirement, on the grounds of ill health, and even if Captain Barry should decide to remain longer in the service than his present intentions would suggest, his condition is such, that he could not possibly undertake the difficult journey which an inspection of the Stikine Agency Schools would entail.\n\nThe suggestion that a fully qualified teacher be placed in charge of two of the Stikine Agency Schools with partial supervision over the remainder, appears to have considerable merit. Before definite arrangements in this respect were made, however, a decision should be arrived at in advance regarding the localities of the two schools mentioned, in order that suitable accommodation for both teacher and pupils could be provided.\n\nIt is my intention to deal further with this subject following a discussion of its various divisions with the Roman Catholic and Anglican Bishops concerned. To do this it may be necessary for me to visit Prince Rupert, as Bishop Bunoz seldom comes to Vancouver. In the meantime, you will have Inspector Barry's views on the subject before\n6th March, 1942.\n\nyou and, I might add, that these views are very largely shared by myself.\n\nI enclose for your information clippings from certain local newspapers on the difficulties being encountered by the province in securing qualified teachers for the provincial schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. M. Mackay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 14, 1942.\n\nRe: Operation of Seasonal Schools -\nStikine Agency, British Columbia.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein. The comments made by Inspector Barry in his letter to you dated February 10, 1942, have also been carefully noted.\n\nWe are anxious that you should communicate with us again, immediately following your interview with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Bishops. We are frankly of the opinion that unless qualified teachers can be secured it is a waste of public funds to keep these schools open and in operation, and the Bishops should be so informed. It is just possible, of course, as Inspector Barry intimates, that the church authorities might be able to secure the odd individual who, though lacking professional training, would be fairly successful as a teacher. This individual, in our judgment, should have a thorough knowledge of the English language and be in a position to teach it and of course he should also be a British subject, by birth or naturalization.\n\nWhile our building program has been suspended for the time being, it has occurred to us that the agent now in charge of the Stikine agency might review the educational needs of these Indians and in due course select sites where buildings might be established. We are still disposed to think that a fully qualified teacher might be placed in charge of two schools and that one teacher in the agency might, in addition to his teaching duties, be given nominal supervision of the other schools. I regret to state that owing to the demands now made upon his time it will not be possible for Mr. Doucet to visit the Pacific coast at any time in the immediate future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nCatholic Missions of the Yukon and Prince Rupert\n\nBishop's Residence\nWhitehorse, Yukon Terr.\n\nSeptember 23, 1942\n\nMr. Phil Phelan\nWelfare and Training Service\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon returning, along with Father J. Rousseau O.M.I., our general Inspector, from a lengthy visit of our Indian Missions of the Yukon and Northern British Columbia, I beg to submit to the Department some of our findings and suggestions.\n\n1. Dease Lake and Iskut Lake (or Klappan) Day Schools. The winter day schools of Dease Lake and Iskut Lake, conducted under very hard circumstances, without adequate help from the Department in regard to suitable accommodation, wood supply and appropriate furniture, have accomplished a considerable amount of good in those two camps; the devotedness of the local missionary in charge, Father Cl. Carpentier O.M.I., is above all praise, and according to the testimony of all desinterested persons who have seen him at work, we readily think that it would be hard to find a better qualified man for the task. These two schools must, by all means, be continued.\n\n2. Cariboo Hide Winter Day School. The winter day school at Cariboo Hide could not be conducted last winter on account of the extreme difficulties of communication with that point and the lack of adequate accommodation. Father J. Plaine O.M.I., one of our most zealous missionaries, was ready to undertake the task, but owing to inadequate means of transportation, I could not allow Father Plaine, who is not of a very robust health, to undertake again, as he did the previous year, at the peril of his life, a journey of 250 miles on foot in January, in order to reach his school. After the various attempts made during the past five years to conduct a day school at Cariboo Hide during the winter months, we came to the conclusion that no teacher will ever be found to go and teach at such a place unless proper housing accommodation is arranged by the Department and transportation is provided by airplane.\n\n3. McDame Summer Day School. The Summer Day School at McDame had a better attendance this year than during the two previous years; a very capable teacher was dispatched directly from Ottawa last May in order to conduct the school; this name is Father B. Arsenault O.M.I.; he gave himself wholeheartedly to the work of teaching these very primitive children; the extreme misery prevailing in the camp, along with the poor state of health and condition of halfstarved band of most children, did not favor on the part of the pupils a response corresponding to the zeal and devotedness of the teacher. The camp gives to every stranger the impression of being sadly neglected by the local Officials of the Department; more adequate clothing and rations should be provided to this fast disappearing tribe which has experienced a very high mortality rate last winter.\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nowing to the lack of medical attention and proper nourishment, a very special attention and generous expenditure should be provided to that small band of Indians if they are to survive and benefit by the school. The School should, therefore, by all means be maintained along with all encouragement and help possible on the part of the local Officials of the Department.\n\nN.B.\u2014In regard to the above mentioned schools, I beg to submit to the Department the names of the school teachers for the School Year 1942-1943:\n\nDease Lake\u2014Father G. Garnetier O.M.I., (four months winter school)\nIskut Lake or Klappan\u2014Father B. Arsenault (four months winter school)\nMcDame\u2014Father P. Arsenault O.M.I., (three months summer school)\n\n4.\u2014Lower Post Summer Day School.\u2014We were amazed to hear that the new Acting Indian Agent of the Stikine Agency had no knowledge of a Summer Day School being conducted at Lower Post until he arrived there by boat in June; if the gentleman had only perused his files, he would, no doubt, have seen many letters referring to the Summer Day School at Lower Post; and since no official announcement of its closing had been given to him, and no new teacher appointed, it was self evident that both school and teacher were being maintained; at any rate, if he had entertained in his mind any doubt on the matter, surely he could have written to us and inquired.\n\nAs you may know from past reports, the conduct of the Day School at Lower Post has been fraught, all along, with great difficulties, on account of the very primitive and nomadic spirit of the Indians calling at the post, and who are probably the most backward Indians of North America. The various war undertakings carried on in that part of the country this summer have still added to the ordinary difficulties; the excitement of the children on seeing so many white men with their strange and noisy machinery, and the various war works which their parents were called upon to perform in widely scattered areas away from the school, made the attendance of the children more unsatisfactory than ever; and so little encouragement did Father P. Poulet, the school teacher, receive from the local Acting Agent, at the occasion of his visit, that he decided right there and then to follow the latter's suggestion and stop the school altogether. We hope, however, that Father P. Poulet O.M.I. will be compensated over and above for the work he has done during a full month previous to your agent's visit.\n\nIt is firmly believed that, owing to the special features of the Lower Post and Frances Lake bands of Indians, the children should be sent to a Boarding School located within a reasonable distance from their home and wherein they would be kept under close supervision for a few years.\n\nWith the Alaskan Highway now connecting Lower Post with Teslin or Tagish Lake, the realization by the Department of our long cherished project of an Indian Residential School and Preventorium at Teslin Lake or at Tagish Lake would afford a considerable help for the education and civilizing of the Indians of Lower Post and Frances Lake moreover, destitute, backward orphan children from other parts of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory could also greatly benefit by such a school.\n\n5.\u2014Teslin Lake Summer Day School.\u2014We have felt unfairly treated by the Department over the school question in Teslin Lake, especially after the favorable report forwarded to you last winter by the then acting Indian Agent, Mr. G.A. Jeckell, concerning the work done by Father A. Dream at that point. Father A. Dream O.M.I. is a very capable teacher and had a good school attendance during the Summer of 1941; the parents of the catholic children who attended school were unanimous in stating that their children had learned more in one summer under father Dream than during the previous years under any other school teacher.\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nAfter such an earnest endeavor on the part of our missionary to give to our Catholic children the Catholic education they are entitled to by the Indian Act, I must admit that Father Dream felt quite discouraged this year over the little recognition given to his work by the Department; under the circumstances I dispensed him from conducting the school on a regular schedule until the Department do justice to our cause; nevertheless Father Dream has carried on this summer end is still at present teaching school as faithfully as his other occupations with the American troops allow him. We earnestly beg once more that our Catholic Summer Day School at Teslin be recognized by the Department.\n\nA Catholic Boarding School requested by many other Indians of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon. Finally I must say that we have been approached time and time again by the Indians of Atlin, Teslin, Carcross and Whitehorse for a Catholic Boarding School where they could in all security send their children for a Catholic education; as you are well aware, several of our Catholic Indian children had to be sent to the Anglican school of Carcross in the past, much to their detriment; lately again some of our Catholic Indians camping at Carcross complained to me that the Officials of said school were annoying them trying to induce them to frequent their school... notwithstanding the fact that all the Indians of Carcross and Whitehorse are officially registered as belonging to the Anglican Church in the Official Census of 1892, I must state here that several of those Indians belong to the Catholic Church, others have never been baptized in any Christian church, and a certain amount of them, from ten to fifteen at Whitehorse, regularly attend our services and have severed all connections with the local Anglican Church.\n\nAll the Indians referred above, as well as many members of the white population of the North, wonder why there are in the Territory three day schools and two boarding schools supported by the Department at a total expenditure of $31472.12 for a grand total of 79 boarders (half-breeds included) and 42 day pupils belonging to the Anglican Church, while nothing is being done for the children of the Catholic Indians of the Yukon, and so little is done for the Catholic Indians of the Stikine Agency, as can be easily verified from the Report of the Indian Affairs Branch for Year ending March 31, 1941, pages 166 and 169.\n\nOur American Allies, actually working throughout the territory referred to, are themselves amazed at such conditions.\n\nMay I add that no medical Official of the Department has been seen this year in any of the camps mentioned, though in some instances the physical condition of the Indians was simply deplorable; under the circumstances some of the American army doctors asked authority from Washington to attend to the physical welfare of our Indians, feeling in duty bound to do something for those at least whom they met along the Alaskan Highway, now under construction; one of those American doctors confided to me that in one Indian camp alone he had performed operations and rendered services which normally should be valued at more than $400.00.\n\nWe rely on the spirit of Justice and Fairmindedness of the Officials of the Indian Affairs Branch to see that a better treatment be granted to the Indians of the North, and we dare to insist especially that Justice be done to our Catholic Indians, through a more\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nadequate support of the existing day schools, the recognition of a day school at Teslin, and the erection in the near future of a Boarding School and Preventorium at Teslin Lake or at Tagish Lake for the Catholic Indian Children of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nBishop J.L. Coudert O.M.I.\nCondJ.of the Yukon and P.R.\n\nP.S.-For further references and additional informations on all above mentioned subjects or facts you may apply to the Rev.Father Jos.Rousseau O.M.I. who will shortly be back to the University of Ottawa.\nOttawa, October 8, 1942.\n\nMy dear Bishop Couder:\n\nYour letter of September 25, addressed to Mr. Philip Phelan, has been passed on to me for consideration and comment.\n\nIt is my intention to ask Mr. Phelan to communicate with you direct in respect to the schools which in the judgment of the Department should be kept open and in operation during the present academic year. I am sending forward your communication also to the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nI am, of course, particularly interested in the operation of the schools and in the educational facilities provided for the Indians of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory. The Stikine Agency was inspected by Inspector Coleman during the months of September and October of last year. His report was very carefully reviewed by the officials of this Branch and was later sent forward to the office of the Minister, for the information of the Minister himself and his officials. Later, I sent a letter to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, Major D. M. MacKay, in which I expressed certain views in regard to an educational program that might be provided for the Stikine Agency, just as soon as times become normal. In this letter I expressed the hope that the Indian Commissioner would find it convenient to discuss this matter with the Bishops concerned. A copy of this letter is enclosed, for your information. I trust that he will have an opportunity to interview the Bishops before any definite action is taken.\n\nI am sending you forward also a statement showing the number of Indian residential schools in Canada, the number operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church and the number operated under the auspices of the non-Catholic denominations. You will readily see that while no Catholic residential school has been established in the Yukon, the number of Catholic schools in operation in the Dominion indicates that there has been no discrimination on the part of the Government at any time in the establishment of residential schools - certainly no discrimination against the Catholic Church.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEnc.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend J. L. COUDERT, O.M.I.,\nCoadjutor of the Yukon & Prince Rupert,\nBishop's Residence,\nWhitehorse, Yukon Territory.\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nBishop's House\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nNov.12,1942\n\nR.A.Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir;\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Oct.8, and enclosed copy of your letter to Major D.M.McKay, dated Jan.28, regarding the school situation in the Stikine Agency.\n\nSo many misstatements and harmful insinuations are contained in the latter document that I feel it to be my duty, for the sake of justice and truth, to address to you the following corrections.\n\n1.-Regarding our School Buildings.\u2014Our Mission buildings were graciously put at the disposal of the Department for school purposes; all our buildings at McDame, Lower Post, Klappan and Dease Lake, were built by our missionaries' own hands, and at our own expenses, and primarily for our own purposes. A small allowance was, at times, given by the Department in order to help us make said buildings serviceable for school purposes, but such donations all counted would not even make a decent rent as a compensation for the use of our buildings during the past five years, during which schools have been conducted on a regular schedule at McDame, Lower Post, Klappan and Dease Lake.\u2014The Department must realize what a nuisance it is to have all the year round our private dwellings thus constantly open to the public for so many purposes and free of charge, and far from criticizing us for such conditions, your Officials should have apologized to us for having encouraged such conditions by neglecting to build in those various camps the special school buildings the Indians were entitled to have.\n\n2.-Regarding our School Teachers.\u2014For several years with much difficulty we endeavored to secure the help of so called \"qualified teachers\" for our catholic day schools of the Stikine Agency, but owing to the high cost of living, the extreme difficulties of communications, the total absence of social life in those camps, and finally the constant misunderstanding arising between said teachers and the local Officials of the Department, our missionaries were urgently asked by the local Agent, Mr. Harper Reed, to perform the duties of common school teachers.\n\nI personally represented to Mr. Reed the difficulties our missionaries would have to reconcile their duties as priests with those of Government teachers, but your Agent insisted that our fathers were the only qualified men to be found for the work in such a difficult country, where only men of high moral character and real devotedness, with a thorough understanding of the particular mentality of those primitive tribes could possibly succeed.\nThe Department must admit that, owing to their religious and psychological training, as well as due to their thorough knowledge of the country and its inhabitants, our missionaries are by far the best qualified teachers the Department could possibly find for such regions.\n\nMoreover, any one who is somewhat familiar with the course of studies followed by all priestly students during a period of twelve years after they have completed their grammar school, will readily acknowledge that our missionaries ought to be somewhat superior, as teachers, to those whom you decorate with the pompous title of \"qualified teachers\". All our missionaries teaching in the Stikine Agency have gone through a course of studies corresponding at least to the one gratified in this country with a diploma of B.A., and M.A.; they also possess the current use of the two official languages of Canada\u2014a qualification which, much to the dismay of very few, is termed \"qualified teachers\", and Department Officials possess here in the West\u2014and finally their work as priests make them particularly well fitted to grasp the mind of these Indian children and have the necessary authority and control over them in a classroom where most of the younger pupils do not understand a word of the English language.\n\nAs a matter of fact, all cultivated and non-prejudiced strangers who have ever visited our northern wilds and have seen our missionaries at work in the Indian day schools were amazed to see such highly cultured and educated gentlemen humbling themselves to the humble functions of common school teachers.\n\nTherefore, far from being afraid of having such conditions becoming, in your own terms \"the subject of discussion in Parliament or in the Press\", we would feel that no greater advertisement could be made in behalf of our missions; and we dare to state that the scandal caused would not be coming from the lack of qualification of our fathers as teachers of your schools, but from the niggardliness of the Department in securing at such a cheap price the services of so highly cultured men as teachers, simply because they are men of self-sacrifice, and no ordinary teacher could possibly be found to accept working for the wages offered by the Department.\n\n5.\u2014Regarding Inspector Coleman's proposed Day School.\u2014Finally I must point out here how illegal and impractical is the plan suggested by your Inspector Coleman to have an undenominational day school built at Telegraph Creek. The gentleman shows here a thorough ignorance of the local conditions.\n\nWhy should our many Catholic children of the Stikine Agency be compelled to frequent an undenominational school when by right they are entitled, according to the Indian Act, to a Catholic School? At a time when all right-minded men are clamouring for an urgent need of religious and moral training of our youth in schools, advocating a large introduction of religion in the curriculum as the only solid basis of future reconstruction and as an antidote against the fast spreading pagan spirit of the age... the suggestion of Inspector Coleman to do away with religion or religious influence in our Indian schools, is baffling, unpatriotic and highly insulting to our religious feelings.\n\nAnd where in the world will be found the benevolent flyer willing to bring in every day, in his flying bus, the children of the Stikine Agency to the proposed \"Telegraph Creek Indian Day School\" from such distant camps as Klappan (60 miles), Dease Lake (30 miles), Cariboo Hide (200 miles) etc., etc.? The suggestion is too ridiculous to be dwelt on any longer. If the officials of the Department are in any way familiar with the travelling conditions prevailing between the actually existing day schools of the Stikine Agency, they will readily see from the most modern \"restricted maps\" that not the slightest improvement has so far been made in that region, which lies hundreds of miles away from the chain of modern airports and the Alcan way.\n\nConclusion.\u2014The only logical solution of the school problem in that region is the one we have constantly advocated for the past five years and suggested to the Department, along with the local Indian Agent:\n\na.\u2014the erection of decent day school buildings right where our missions actually stand in Dease Lake, McDame, Dease Lake, Klappan and Cariboo Hide.\nb.\u2014the defraying of the travelling expenses of the school teachers from Telegraph Creek to the various schools of the Agency and back, along with a reasonable allowance for their wood supply, in case of winter schools.\n\nc.\u2014the erection of a Boarding School and a Preventorium in a central place whereto destitute and neglected children, as well as T.E. cases, would be sent from the various parts of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory, from Cariboo Hide and Klappan as well as from Atlin Lake and Lansing Creek, often suggested Teslin or Tagish Lakes, which are both located on the boundary line of northern B.C. and the Yukon Territory, and which two points are now easily accessible through the Alcan way running right through them.\n\nA more recent suggestion might still prove a better one, viz Lower Post or Watson Lake, according to a recent survey made by the U.S. Army Doctors, the Indian population needs a very close supervision, if it be allowed to survive; Lower Post being the point of intersection of the Alcan way and the proposed Fairbanks Railway, would be a central point both for a Preventorium and for a Boarding School serving the whole Indian population of Northern B.C. and the Yukon.\n\nPardon me, Sir, for this lengthy report, but since you declared in your letter that you were particularly interested in the operation of the schools and in the education facilities provided for the Indians of the Stikine Agency and the Yukon Territory, I thought that these practical suggestions would be agreeably received by your Department, especially in view of the fact that they are coming from one who also claims to be deeply interested in the welfare and training of said Indians.\n\nI have openly and in all sincerity expressed my views on the whole question in an objective way as was possible, claiming to have a fair knowledge of the country referred to, its local conditions and its inhabitants. You may be sure that I have done so with no other desire save that of having the Officials of the Department better acquainted with the actual conditions and needs of the North Country and of its native population; I also intended thereby to show our willingness to work to the welfare and training of the Northern Indians not as an organization independent from the Government, but as a religious body always anxious to cooperate in a friendly way with the Officials of the Department for the best possible treatment of the Indians entrusted to our common care. It seemed strange to us that, after having been accused a few years ago of making opposition to your local official in Telegraph Creek, our missionaries are now faced with an accusation of too close a relation between their missionary efforts and the educational efforts of your agent; I may be mistaken, but in isolated districts as the one covered by the Stikine Agency, I dare to maintain that a good \"entente cordiale\" between the Church and State over the education of the Indians should by all means be fostered and encouraged by both sides; you may be assured that our most constant efforts will be directed towards the continuation of such friendly relations under the present Agent, and the same attitude will be expected from him in his dealings with us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop J.L.

Those people have requested me since 1925 to petition the Department on their behalf for a boarding school. Reports upon reports have been sent to the Department both by myself and Mr. Harper Reed, the Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek, and also by Mr. Ditchburn at Victoria. But nothing yet has been done for the children of those Indians or for the children of the Indians in the other parts of the district. Indeed, the Department realize how badly a school is needed even if it was only to help prevent those people from being exploited because they know neither to write nor to read. True that I spend over a month at Mc Dame and at Liard Post every summer teaching the Natives besides Christianity, sanitary habits, discipline and cleanliness, but a school would also be a great benefit to the future generations.\n\nHowever if the Department cannot grant a boarding school for next year would it not be possible to give a grant of $500.00 to bring a day teacher and the necessary equipment to Mc Dame for next summer. With the help of the Indians of that locality a little church has now been built on the Indian Reserve at Mc Dame. It could be used for a school as an experiment.\n\nHoping that the Department will be able to do something and let us know beforehand so that we will have the time to find a teacher and have the equipment ready for the opening of the school,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.\nOn the other hand, Rev. Commander Hodgson, of the Anglican Church, at Telegraph Creek, has suggested that if the Roman Catholic Church would be willing to vacate their Telegraph Creek Mission (where Rev. Father Allard has recently erected a church for the Indians in what the Anglicans believe to be their territory) the Anglicans might give up any claim they may have to Missionary territory around McQuesten Creek and Dease Lake where however the Anglicans have no established or organized Missions. The Anglicans may offer some objection to the establishment of a residential school for the Roman Catholic Church near Telegraph Creek as they consider the district an Anglican Missionary territory even though there is some lack of appreciable Missionary activity along educational lines on the part of the Anglicans in this district, the statement being made by Rev. Commander Hodgson claiming not to have any funds for such purpose. It should be pointed out that despite the past religious work of the Anglicans at Tahltan (now abandoned) and Telegraph Creek, the Roman Catholic Indians have erected new churches at Telegraph Creek and at McQuesten whether the Anglicans like it or not and the priest has decided to provide for the education of the Indians who identify themselves with the Roman Catholic Faith, and hence is asking that a departmental residential school be established under the supervision of the Catholic Church for Catholic children within the territory for which they have established these churches.\n\nIn the McDames and Liard districts there are claimed by the Roman Catholic clergyman 320 Indians, one-third of these are said to be nomads and are not claimed by the Anglicans. The Roman Catholic Church therefore expects to register these 320 Indians as Roman Catholics.\nOttawa, September 6, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, recommending that an Indian summer day school be given a trial next year at Kolesne, B.C. I note that there are over 40 Indian children of school age living at Kolesne during the summer months. The Department will give favourable consideration and allow a grant of $100 per teaching month for the salary of the teacher and will supply whatever books, stationery, etc., is needed. You should make requisition early in the spring for the equipment required and nominate a teacher, indicating his or her qualifications, etc. I note that this experiment will be conducted in the church, and I take it for granted that there will be no expenditure necessary in connection with desks or other heavy equipment at this time and that the Department will not be called upon to make repairs or improvements to the building. Mr. Indian Agent Reed is receiving a copy of this letter, for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.C.\nFort St James, B.C.\nOctober 24th, 1930\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter No. 158-3-I of September 6th last. It was delayed having been sent to Telegraph Creek that I had already left for Stuart Lake.\n\nWhile I am glad to learn that the Department is giving a favourable consideration to my request for a day school for the summer months at McDame I do not think that the allowance, that is $150.00 per month for the salary of the teacher is sufficient. There is no teacher in the district. He will have to come from outside, a long distance from McDame. Travelling expenses alone both ways, will come close to $150.00 if not more. Then there is the cost of food in a place where supplies are taken in at the price of .20\u00a2 a lb; and the teacher could not perhaps teach more than two months or two months and a half at the most, because the Indians do not stay around the post more than a couple of months. So I would suggest the Department to pay travelling and food expenses as well as the salary of the teacher or otherwise to give a straight allowance of $150.00 per teaching month.\n\nBut since your letter of September 6th, perhaps the Department got some further information on the situation and on who is who around Telegraph Creek and in the district above, Dease and Liard rivers, etc., Mr. Perry from Victoria was in Telegraph Creek in the latter part of August this summer. From what he saw and said may we not hope to see something going up around Telegraph Creek, but for the whole district, that would be better an experiment than a summer day school only at McDame. I would be interested to know.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, regarding the salary to be paid the teacher of the proposed Indian summer day school at McDame, which is to be opened next summer.\n\nIn reply I regret that the Department can only allow the teacher salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month for this experiment, and the text-books, etc., required, as stated in letter of September 6th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

But I must say that it will be difficult to find one at the salary fixed by the Department. There is no teacher in the P.C. provincial schools that gets less than $120.00 a month, and these schools are right close to the railroad. McDame is over 600 miles from the railroad.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nLejac, B.C.\nOctober 15th, 1930\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nAs you will see by enclosed letter from the Department (for your office) we are promised a grant of $100.00 per teaching month for a day school at Mc Dame for next summer. I do not think this is sufficient as travelling expenses and food at Mc Dame is so high. Don't you think so yourself? However it is a break. I am writing to the Department again asking for $150.00 per teaching month for reasons given above. Could you also write to the Department and explain things to them. Coming from both of us they will likely understand that it is only a fair proposition.\n\nAs to the expenditure in connection with desks and benches perhaps it is not necessary to bother the Department about that now. About 24 Boards 1\"x 12\", 12' and 12 Boards 1\"x 6\", 12' (for desks) and 12 pieces 2\"x 10\", 12' (for benches) all dressed lumber would do and I suppose you could have that taken to the Head of the Lake early next spring and put on the H.B.O.'s scows and taken down to Mc Dame. What do you think of all this? Wish you would let me know.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nE. Allard\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nDec 30th 1930.\n\nRef: 158-3-1.\nOttawa. Sept. 6/30.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a \"Copy for Agent\" of a letter addressed to Rev. E. Allard, O.M.I., regarding an allowance for Teacher for his school at Mc Dames Creek, B.C., and also submit his letter to this office on the same subject.\n\nThere is no doubt that the cost of travelling and freight etc. to Mc Dames is very heavy, and I beg to humbly suggest that the Teachers salary be advanced to $150.00 per teaching month, which it is understood will not include the time taken to arrive at Mc Dames Creek. If a summer school is opened at this point it will certainly do a lot of good, and the new Church building, recently constructed by the Indians there, could be used to no better purpose.\n\nIn the Rev. Father's letter mention is made of some boards required, but the list is excessive, and would cost too much. If the Indians can erect a Church they could also whip-saw a few boards, and save that expense.\n\nHowever it is suggested that the Rev. Father be allowed One Dozen Boards each i.e. 1 x 12 x 12 & 2 x 10 x 12 of Cedar planed one side only, which avoids duty, as boards could be obtained in Wrangell, S.E. Alaska.\n\nA few sheets of 4 ply building boards, would do for Blackboards, and cover of desks required, all of which it would be possible for the Rev. Father to bring from Prince Rupert, on his way up, next spring.\n\nI am.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with further reference to the proposal to conduct a summer school for Indians at McDame. In view of your representations, the Department is prepared to allow a salary of $120 per teaching month for the summer and will allow a small expenditure for lumber. Mr. Indian Agent Reed believes that a dozen inch planks and a dozen two inch cedar, planed on one side, and some material for blackboards, etc., is all that is really required.\n\nThe Department understands that there may be additional expenditure; but a school of this type is partly missionary in character and I believe that any extra costs should be met by the church interested.

Mission School - REPORT.\n\nI beg to submit a report covering a visit to the above newly appointed Mission School.\n\nAt Mc Dames Creek, on July 10th 1931, a visit of inspection was paid to the Mc Dames R.C. Mission School for which purpose the New R.C. Mission Church, on the Reserve, is used - pro temp.\n\nThis Indian School was started this Spring under Rev Father E. Allard, with Mr Letchford, under Salary of $120-00 per month, as teacher, during the summer months.\n\nI found the school, or rather Church Building, in a very clean state, altho the pest of Flies were such that a low steady drone was audible constantly, and interfered with work undertaken. The Lumber kindly granted by the Dept, for use of desks etc., had not yet arrived, and the scholars were proceeding with their work, on the floor. Thirty children were present, and upon examination, the results obtained were beyond expectations. After school, in spite of flies these scholars continued their studies outside the building, busy still with pencil and papers.\n\nMr Letchford shows great interest, and enjoyment, in his difficult work, and with the sanction of the Department, hopes to next year make a much better showing.\n\nThat the School is short equipment already, is most apparent, and therefore the Teacher was requested to list out what he thought necessary. This list is herewith submitted in requisition form with the hope that the Department will see their way clear to grant the same.\n\nIndians of the Cassias are Nomadic in character, and Mc Dames Creek is their central meeting place, and there is no better way of helping these people than by the formation of Schools for their use.\n\nFather Allard has already forwarded to the Department, his return for Month June 1931, therefore a duplicate was made and same is submitted herewith in correct order.\n\nFather Allard mentioned that he thought a School House should be erected, and asked for help. He was informed that at the present time, the present arrangement should be held to, but that later perhaps, the Department might consider some further help. The Father thought that he could get the whole thing done, by free labour, if the Department would allow him to draw provisions, so that he could supply meals to the Indians whilst at work. His request is reasonable, for at present they are living at the back end of the Church, and have no place of their own.\n\nIn conclusion, it is respectfully stated that the venture seems to be a success, and for the future there is no reason why it should not be more so.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept Indian Affairs.

Mission School in charge of Father E. Allard was opened at McDames Creek, and the liberty is taken of enclosing a view of the Building.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nFort St James, B.C.\nSeptember 16th, 1931\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe first summer school at McDame's Creek, B.C., is closed for the season. The Indians that come to trade and meet the missionary and Indian Agent in that locality had not a good catch of fur last winter and the price they got for it was so low that after paying for what they got on credit from the H.B.Co., the fall before, they had very little coming to them and so had to leave earlier this year for their respective hunting and fishing grounds where they can always find something to eat without having to contract debts for it. But as it was, sufficient interest was manifested in the school as may be seen by the large attendance of the pupils and the progress made was as much as could be expected for such a short period the school was opened.\n\nI regret to say that the lumber allowed by the Department for making tables and benches was late to be sent and so were the drugs which are so badly needed when all the Indians are around. It was finally dispatched from Telegraph Creek by Mr. Indian Agent H. Reed with the aid of a special carrier; otherwise it is possible that it would never have been sent at all this summer.\n\nI have to ask the Department to make an allowance to help build a school at McDame next year. We used the church this summer to see how a school would take with the Indians. But now that the experiment is successful separate quarters have to be built not to interfere with the church work. A suitable site has to be cleared, logs have to be hauled, some of them whipsawed for lumber for the roof, floor, windows and door frames. Mosquitoes are an awful nuisance up at McDame, at work day and night. Only those that have to put up for over two months with their painful vexations will know what it is. But this situation could be much improved by draining the swamp going through the Reserve, source of all the trouble. For all the work to be done an allowance of a thousand dollars ($1000.00) is necessary.\n\nHoping that my report and present request will meet with the approval of the Department,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.

B.C.\n\nStikine Agency\nNOV 14 1931\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith the final report of the R.C. Mission School at Mc Dames Creek, B.C. Also is attached a letter from Rev. Father M Allard, upon the subject, and the liberty is taken of enclosing a photograph of the present building that is used for the school. It is much regretted that delay has occurred in rendering this report, but inspection trips have intervened.\n\nAs previously reported, it is now most apparent that school training is required for the many Indian children that come to the Mc Dames Creek Hudson Bay Post, each summer, and the results obtained by Father Allard, this year has in every way justified the expenses gone too. To carry on this work successfully, a school building, is an urgent necessity at the present time.\n\nMention is made by the Rev. Father of a sum to the extent of a thousand dollars ($1000.) but if a grant, not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.) were allowed the mission, with which he could feed the Indians whilst construction was in progress, and only to those Indians that gave their services \"free,\" a more concise working agreement would be obtained, and value received for money spent. It would seem that if the parents have been willing to build a Church for their own use, there should be no reason why they could not exercise the same efforts for the schooling of their children. This arrangement would be most suitable for next summer, for it is thought that the Indians winter fur catches will hardly cover their trapping expenses, and the above arrangement would act, also, as a relief measure during the summer months. Therefore it is most respectfully submitted that the Rev. Father Allard be allowed this grant.\n\nAlso in the letter attached, mention is made of the pest of Mosquitoes, this is indeed very real, and interferes greatly with school work. This annoyance could easily be handled with the use of two barrels of suitable oil, spread over the swamp at high water, at the same time cutting and burning the brush, and it is again most respectfully submitted that this reserve be allowed this relief.\n\nIn a separate letter received from Father Allard he mentions that he forgot to order Slates for school use; in the order now delivered at Mc Dames Post awaiting next spring's opening of the school, therefore a requisition for these supplies, under separate cover has been forwarded to the Department.\n\nIn conclusion, it is correct to mention that the school at Mc Dames has been the subject of much good talk amongst the Indians of this end of the Agency, and in every way has had good effects.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of November 14th last, enclosing a communication from Rev.

The photograph of the mission building which was used for school purposes was also received.\n\nIt is noted that the school conducted at this point during the past summer met with success and, no doubt, the same arrangements can be made for the continuing of the work next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I am enclosing the References submitted and wish to recommend that he be appointed and paid last year's salary, that is $120.00 per teaching month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 23, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, nominating the services of Mr. Walter Sowrey for the position as teacher of the McDame Summer School and enclosing testimonials regarding his qualifications, etc.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the appointment of Mr. Sowrey is approved. He should be at McDame to commence duties on or about the first of June, next. The Department hopes that he will meet with every success and that there will be a good attendance of Indian children. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $120 per teaching month for the summer months. Mr. Theo. F. Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, is being informed of the approval granted for Mr. Sowrey's appointment. Please inform Mr. Sowrey and arrange with him to take up duties on the date mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.,\nFort St. James,\nB. C.\nOttawa, March 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. E. Allard, O.M.I., Fort St. James, B.C., has nominated the services of Mr. Walter Sewrey for the position as teacher of the Summer School for the Indian children at McDermot. The Department is approving of the appointment of Mr. Sewrey, with salary at the rate of $120 per ten weeks' work for the summer months. We have requested Father Allard to inform him of his appointment and to arrange with him to commence duties on or about June first, next.\n\nPlease give Mr. Sewrey any assistance you can in his work during the period he teaches at this school during the coming summer. It is hoped there will be a good attendance of Indian children. You should see that Mr. Sewrey prepares and forwards, through your office, returns on the form for that purpose, showing attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of each month, when cheque in payment of the salary due will be sent. The address to which the salary cheque is to be forwarded should be given on the return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter under the above reference, in which it is stated that Mr. Walter Sewrey has been appointed as Teacher for the No Dames Creek R.C. Mission School.\n\nAs instructed every attention shall be rendered, and it is expected that the school will prove a great success this summer, and with the aid and help of Dr. Edgerton, who could spend some time there during the school term, a lot of good will result.\n\nAll the school supplies are now at that point awaiting Mr. Sewrey's arrival.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit for your inspection the Day School Return sheets of the Mc Dames R.C. Mission School, for the months of July and August, made up by Walter, W.H. Sewrey, the schoolmaster.\n\nIt will be noticed that the attendance has been very good, in fact better than expected. In July there were 46, and in August 37, children attending this day school.\n\nThe liberty has been taken of forwarding a photo showing a few of the elder girls, with Rev Father Allard and Schoolmaster Sewrey in the background.\n\nRev Father Allard has requested more help for this Mission, but he has been informed that just at present matters are so that extra help cannot be expected.\n\nSchoolmaster Sewrey has done good work this summer, and leaving here has accepted the management of a school at Bute Inlet, B.C.\n\nIt is taken for granted that his Salary will be forwarded to the Rev Father Allard, as has been the custom.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nFort St James, B.C.\nApril 1st 1933\n\nThe Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nNow is the time to look for a teacher for the Indian Summer School at McDame's. I beg to offer myself for the position. I have no ordinary teacher certificate but my full college course, not mentioning others, enables me, I believe, with my 15 years of missionary work in British Columbia, to fill the place satisfactorily.\n\nIt is difficult to find a man to come so far only for a three months' salary. Besides, as the only building now available to carry the class room work is the same building (under construction yet) that is being used for a church, there is always something broken if I am not there myself. Another thing; since the Department has not been able so far to give me any assistance towards the construction of a separate building at McDame's, the teacher's grant will help me some to continue what I started off my own last summer.\n\nYou will kindly remember that the teacher's salary for the past two summers was $120.00 per month and it is hoped that it will not be lowered. The conditions have not changed up there. It is still the same distance; over a thousand miles from here, a very costly trip and a great deal to do. Besides teaching school there is also all the work of a field matron to do. Last summer I had to walk through mountains and bush nearly a hundred miles only for two sick calls.\n\nI hope the School Requisition for the coming term sent in through the Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek last September has been forwarded to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.\nOttawa, April 12, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, offering your services as teacher of the McDame Indian Summer School for the coming summer months.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of this school being conducted during the months of June, July and August, next, and also of your appointment as teacher. As our Appropriation for the present fiscal year has been considerably reduced, the Department can only provide salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month, less 10 percent. I would request, if you accept the position at the salary offered, that you arrange to commence duties on or about June 1st, next. It is hoped there will be a good attendance of Indian children.\n\nYou should prepare and forward returns on the form for that purpose, showing attendance, days' taught, etc., at the end of each month. These returns should be forwarded to the Department through the office of the local Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C., when cheque in payment of the salary due will be sent. The address to which the salary cheque is to be forwarded should be given on the return.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Harper Reed, the local Indian Agent, of the approval granted for your appointment, and we are also requesting him to forward the requisition for supplies which you sent him last September. This requisition will receive immediate attention when received at the Department. It is hoped that the supplies required will arrive before you open the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.,\nFort St. James,\nB.C.\nOttawa, April 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. E. Allard, O.M.I., Fort St. James, B.C., has been appointed teacher of the summer school for Indian children at McDame. He is being requested to arrange to reopen this school on or about June 1st, next.\n\nAs our Appropriation this year has been considerably reduced, the salary we will allow Father Allard for his teaching services will be at the rate of $100 per month, less 10 percent. He has been requested to prepare returns at the end of each month, on the form for that purpose, showing attendance, days taught, etc., and forward same to the Department, through your office. It is hoped that there will be a good attendance of Indian children. I would request that you give Father Allard any assistance you can in his work during the period he teaches at this school.\n\nFather Allard states that he forwarded to you in September, last, a requisition for classroom supplies, etc. This requisition has not been received, and I would request that you forward same as soon as possible, in order that the supplies required for the coming summer will reach Father Allard in time for use when he opens the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Nov. 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder, a report covering the month of October 1935.\n\nThe McDames Creek Mission school was not visited this year as it was impossible to make that trip this summer, but herewith is submitted some samples of colour work carried out by the youngsters of that school, which goes to show that they are capable of much improvement under steady supervision. The Rev. Father E. Allard is really doing some good work at this point, and deserves all the help that can be allowed his efforts.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nNov. 30th 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nIn last month's Report, mention was made of some colour work done by the school children of the Mc Dames Creek, R.C. Mission, but it was found later, when the report had been mailed, that the samples had not been enclosed.\n\nHerewith are submitted the samples mentioned, and it is regretted that same were not forwarded with the month's report.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nFort St James, B.C.\nMarch 3rd, 1934\n\nDoctor N.W. McGill,\nSuperintendent, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to have met you when you were up at Fort St James last summer but I had already left for Telegraph Creek and points beyond.\n\nIt will soon be the time to think about my next summer work in the Cassiar. May I ask the Department's assistance for the summer school at McDames and offer my services as teacher again. May I ask also that the grant be restored to $120.00 per month as it was originally. You have no idea how costly a trip and a sojourn of three or four months up there. I understand there is a special allowance for Indian Welfare Work for the Yukon because of the distances and the high cost of transportation. The Cassiar, and particularly Liard and McDames, is in that way every bit as bad as the Yukon.\n\nAnother thing. Now that there is a Doctor at Telegraph Creek, he will likely be asked next summer to take a trip down to Dease Lake, McDames and Liard Post. Unfortunately he will stay only a day or so in each place and the result of his efforts will necessarily be minimized. If a nurse would spend, let us say a couple of weeks at Dease Lake and Liard and the rest of the summer at McDames where the largest group of Indians is, the money spent by the Department, I think, would be well justified. I would be glad to try to find a nurse and help her along if the Department could only pay her travelling expenses which would be in the vicinity of $200.00 for the summer.\n\nAs it takes a considerable time to arrange things up here I am writing you this early hoping that it will meet with your approval.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.\nOttawa, March 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. E. Allard, O.M.I., has been appointed teacher of the summer school for Indian children at McDame. He is being requested to conduct the school during the months of June, July and August and he is being informed that he will be allowed salary at the rate of $120 a month, less 10%.\n\nI would request that you give Father Allard every possible assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\nOttawa, March 15, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the third instant, offering your services as teacher of the NeDene Indian Summer School for the coming summer months.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department approves of this school being conducted during the months of June, July and August, next. Your appointment as teacher is approved, at a salary of $120 a teaching month, less 10 per cent.\n\nYou should prepare and forward returns, on the form provided for that purpose, showing attendance, days taught, etc., for the period the school is open. These returns should be forwarded to the Department through the office of Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nMr. Reed is being informed of your appointment and requested to give you every possible assistance.\n\nWith reference to the last part of your letter, you will be advised under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Allard, O.M.I.,\nFort St. James,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 15th 1934, in regard to the appointment of Rev. E. Allard, O.M.I., as teacher of the Indian Summer School at McJames Creek, B.C.\n\nAs in years past, every possible assistance will be rendered to him by this Office.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nDecember 18, 1934.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMr. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, and Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, were informed that the Department would continue a grant for teacher's salary at the McDames Summer School during the summer of 1935. For correspondence, see letter of November 1st, 1934 - File 158-7-1.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. E. ALLARD, O.M.I., Prince Rupert, B.C., dated March 7, 1935, addressed to Mr. Harter Reed, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nOriginal on 158-7-1.\n\nYou will kindly remember how difficult, almost impossible, it is for me, and for the Indians to get to McDames every spring before the middle of June. It has also been my experience - and I believe yours - that it is better for the same Indians to go back to the woods, to put up their winter supplies, one or about the middle of August. There is also the fact that about the same time navigation on the Dease River is very uncertain. So perhaps it would be better if the summer school at McDames was of two months instead of three, starting with the 15th of June or about, and closing with the 15th of August or about. But as the expenditures incurred in getting in and out would be the same it is necessary to ask that the grant should be at least $300.00 for the whole term of two months.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT,\ndated April 10, 1935, addressed to Rev. Father E.\nAllard, O.M.I., Prince Rupert, B. C.\n\nOriginal on 138-7-1.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 7th, which was received a few days ago, upon my return from a visit to McDames Creek. The air-mail will be leaving here in a few days' time, and this is the first chance of sending you a reply.\n\nYour letter covers three separate matters, the Mission work at McDames, a proposed school at Liard, and a proposed school for the Klappan Indians within your Church - in Drytown.\n\nFirstly McDames affairs, everything has been settled in regard to the summer's work at this point, everything but the allowance for the teacher, I believe, and that of course the Department will no doubt fix in due course. Even school supplies have been arranged for and some good few extras have been allowed for improvements, etc. Your school at this point is doing good work, but there is still much to be done in helping the families personally, especially towards a better state of general sanitation. By the end of August the families should be returning to the woods to put up their fat meat, if it is possible to get them to do so. All this really means a full summer's work.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM HARPER REED, INDIAN AGENT, TELEGRAPH CREEK; dated April 11, 1935, addressed to Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOriginal on 158-7-1.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Father E. Allard, O.M.I., who is in charge of all the R.C. Missions in this part of the Stikine Agency.\n\nAlso attached is this office's reply to same, and if taken in conjunction with other correspondence that has passed, under Refi- Ottawa, 158-7-1; December 14th, 1934, will, it is hoped, be self-explanatory.\n\nThe McDames Mission at that point was reported upon by Doctor Hildebrand, M.D., and your Agent under date of last July's monthly report. It was found that good work was being carried forward, but it was quite all one man's work for a summer, and a lot of supervision could be given to the old Indians, outside the work of the school itself.\nOttawa, May 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Reverend E. Allard, O.M.I., together with a copy of your reply, with reference to the establishment of schools for the coming summer months, at McDames, Liard Post, and Telegraph Creek; to be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the school at McDames being conducted this coming summer. It is considered, however, that this school should be in operation for at least a three month period. I have noted that Father Allard suggests it should be open only two months. It is thought that very little could be accomplished by conducting the school for such a short period. If possible, it should open on or about June 16th, next, and remain in operation until September 15th, following. The salary allowed for teaching services will be at the same rate as was paid last year, viz.: $108 per teaching month. I would request that you inform the Department, as soon as possible, the name of the teacher who has been selected by the church authorities to teach the McDames Summer School.\n\nI may say that a supply of classroom material has been ordered, to be forwarded, addressed to Rev. Father Allard, Telegraph Creek, B. C.\n\nRegarding the conducting of a day school during the coming summer months at Liard Post and for the Catholic Indian children at Telegraph Creek, I have to say that the Department has no funds provided in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year for teacher's salary at these two points, and therefore, we will be unable to authorize the conducting of classroom activities at these points. I may add that there was no opportunity to discuss the matter of summer schools with the Assistant Indian Commissioner during his recent visit to Ottawa.\n\nEarly next fall, you might give the Department a report, with your views regarding the summer schools you would recommend be operated during the summer of 1936, when we would be able to provide funds to pay salaries of teachers in the case of the summer schools which it is decided to establish.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMay 29, 1935\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI have your letter of May 26th giving me the answer of the Department to mine of March 7th. It was arranged with Bishop Bunoz before I left Prince Rupert a few weeks ago that I would accept to teach at Mc Dames this summer again. Will you kindly inform Ottawa and ask if this meets with their approval.\n\nI may not be able to start teaching at Mc Dames before the beginning of July. Our Bishop is expected to pay Telegraph Creek about the same time and I have to wait here to meet His Excellency. I regret the delay but it is unavoidable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. Allard, O.M.I.\n\nP.S. The Prov. is paying for the upkeep of the two Campbell children at the Orphanage.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated May 8th, in regard to the establishment of Schools, for the coming summer months, at Mc Dames Creek - Liard Post, and Telegraph Creek, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church Mission of these parts.\n\nSubmitted, herewith, is a letter from the Rev Father E. Allard, O.M.I., in which he informs the Department that, as last year, he intends to carry on the work of a teacher for the Mc Dames Creek Summer Mission School.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunoz will arrive in Telegraph Creek, it is now understood, or or about July 4th, and of course he wishes to meet all his Indians and rather Allard must be present at that time. Therefore it will be impossible for the Mc Dames School to be opened, this year, until the arrival of the Bishop with rather Allard at that point. It will be opened as soon as possible.\n\nAt Liard Post no school will be conducted this season, again the Bishop will look the matter over, and come to some arrangement with the half-breed families, who should be the back-bone of such a school. It will then be possible to report upon the Indian side of the question.\n\nAt Telegraph Creek, again no school will be conducted, this important matter will be closely gone into by the bishop Rev Father Allard, the Indian agent, and all the Klappan Indians concerned. It is generally conceded, by everybody concerned - Indians, Townspeople, and Stores, that the school, if started must be outside the Town District, and there is now every reason to think such will be the case, with no more trouble.\n\nThe interview held with Rev. Father Allard, on the 26th inst was most satisfactory in every way, due it is thought to the practical contents of the Department's letter, and the Rev Father has called at the Office several times since, and is being assisted in every way possible.\n\nSince 1930, he has contended that a water System should be allowed Dry Town, where his Mission is situated, and that the Department should assist. This meant a Grant of $800-00, to carry a water supply from the casca reserve, some distance back, to his Mission. At the interview it was explained that now the Indians were leaving the Town, owing to hard times, the project was rather expensive, so he has now decided to undertake the water supply, himself, and perhaps rent out connections here and there. This saves the Indian Office a lot of expense and trouble.\n\nTherefore the matter of Schools will again rest in abeyance until His Lordship's arrival, and will be reported upon in due course.\n\nI am.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

Contiu. 2.\n\nDear Mr. Boss:\n\nAt this point your Indians are very few, a little over one family, but at times inside Indians rest awhile on this Lake during summer time. On the Reserve has been constructed a very decent little Cabin, which is used by your Mission each summer, when passing through to the Inside.\n\nMc Dames Creek. Here has been established a full going Mission Church and a Mission School in operation within the Church, up to now. In 1934 a School Building was constructed, quite large with living quarters upstairs. This building requires some finishing touches but can be used for school purposes right away. The School has been well equipped with school material, and is now only lacking, Scribblers, crayons, odds and ends. There have also been supplied picks and shovels for teaching purposes, i.e., drainage of Reserve. For this reason Teachers Salary will be granted, as requested, which should be from June 1st to September 15th. It is high time then for the Indians to return to their winter camps. The Department will be requested to again allow a small grant, to be used by the purchase of provisions, to drain the Reserve frontage. This Grant should be around the value of $50-00 and would act as summer relief to large families, under the supervision of the Teacher. It is requested that His Lordship Bishop Bunoz be asked to forward the name of the proposed Teacher, as soon as possible. The Teacher here will be fully engaged all the summer time. The attendance at this summer school is expected to be, not so good as in times gone by, for several families have gone towards Liard Post, where fur is still plentiful.\n\nLiard Post. At this point your Mission has only been able to give occasional visits, but the intention was to construct a building of some sort, and use same as The Church and School. To this end a small waterfront Lot was obtained and marked out. Also Anderson the Trader was instructed to have some lumber cut, which he did, but later on, it is thought, sold the Material. We decided to allow this area to \"wait\" until at least until you can personally visit the point and see what is actually required. Therefore a Teachers Salary will not be requested for this point. It is correct to mention that the Indians visiting this locality are on the increase, owing to the fact that more fur is obtainable in the District. It is also easily arrived at from the lower reaches of the Muddy River, and drains some of the fur from Francis Lake, to the North.\n\nFrancis Lake District. It is a question as to if this Lake has ever been visited by your Mission, from Liard Post, but the Indians have come down to Liard Post and have been given attention by your Mission there. Upon visiting Francis Lake this summer it was found that nearly all the Indians with their children have been receiving attention from the English Church authorities visiting Belly Banks & Ross River Trading Posts. The Doctor and Agent were shown cards to that effect dated as recently as 1934. However a H.B.C. Post has now been established on Francis Lake, and perhaps the Indians will reside there permanently, but this is not expected by this Office. We decided that this area will also rest in abeyance until visited by yourself when it will be possible to take the matter up again.\n\nThis, it is thought covers the Indian work of your Mission in these parts, and has been gone over in detail, as you are totally unacquainted with the Interior, and is submitted only as an outline of matters, and might be of some little value. It is desired to state in conclusion that if at any time, or in any way, this Office can be of any service towards helping along the strenuous and good work being strived at by your Mission, it is entirely at your service.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed, Indian Agent.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C., Nov. 7th 1935.\n\nThe Rev. Father Leo, Boase', O.M.I.\nThe R.C. Mission,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nDear Father Boase', at the request of the Indian Office, you were good enough to come up, on the evening of the 4th inst., and together we went into the matter of your Mission's future work, in this part of the Stikine Agency; this letter is to confirm the decisions then arrived at. It was found that your Mission work covers the following Districts - Telegraph Creek - The Klappan Band of Indians - The Caribou hide band of Indians - Dease Lake Indians - Mc Demos Creek Indians - Lizard Indians, and some few Indians now residing up at Francis Lake Y.T. In all a huge district for the correct regulation of which, assistance will have to be afforded you. Taking the districts in turn we start with:\n\nTelegraph Creek. This is the Headquarters of your Cassiar Mission and your Church House here serves the Indians of the Town, with also those of the Klappan Band, who arrive here during the short summer season, for fishing purposes etc. Also some few Indians that come in from Shesley way, to the north of this Town. The good work done will be continued.\n\nKlappan Band of Indians. We both agreed that during the last few years these Indians have not much improved in their ways of living, and that the less they are around the Townsite, the better for them all. Two sample cases were spoken of, i.e., those of Isobell Reid, and Ida Cocks Girl - Mary Ann.\n\nHowever it was thought, that as they will come in during the Spring time and live on the Reserve across the river, that their children might as well receive some schooling; which we also thought would be interesting in its way. Therefore the Grant of a Salary by the Department, for a Teacher here, should be accepted, and His Lordship Bishop Bunce requested to supply the name of a Teacher for the summer months of May-June, July & August. The Department is also to be requested to supply the necessary school material; i.e., the same as that of Mc Demos Creek, but that no desks were required at present. We would then observe how this arrangement proceeds. Meanwhile you were kind enough to offer to go out to the Klappan winter Camp sometime soon, and see these Indians and find out, whether or not they would establish a permanent winter Base, in some good spot, where their families could gather, a school started for their children, which would free their men to earn a living from trapping, their only real main supply of revenue.

However, when looked at closely, it is found to contain some little Relief work, but more especially, the settlement of a nomadic band of Indians, who are fast increasing in numbers, and who can and will increase their fur revenue, if some settlement is brought about.\n\nThe Mission's work at Liard Post B.C. is at present most uncertain, as stated, it will have to be personally inspected by Father Bosse; and even after that inspection it is fancied that not much action will be taken around this District.\n\nUnder separate cover, will be submitted the School Supplies requisitions Sheets for the above mentioned Schools.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nThe Dept.

Mission Schools, in these parts, as instructed under the above references; heresunder is submitted further progress for your kind consideration.\n\nLast summer all Mission work came to a sudden halt with the drowning of the late Father E. Allard O.M.I., but His Lordship, Bishop Bunoz, carried out an inspection of his Missions here, and obtained a comprehensive knowledge of matters generally.\n\nThe result of all this being that late in the fall, the Rev. Father Leo Bosse' O.M.I., arrived to take charge of all the work hereabouts. We have worked together ever since, and it is wished to state, that Father Bosse's views in regards to the betterment of the Indians, coincide exactly with the views held by the Indian Office. The Father was quite unacquainted with the interior, and his work generally; so we met, came to some working arrangement, a \"resume\" of the meeting will be found attached, in copy letter form.\n\nIt will be observed that the Mission wish to operate two Summer Schools, one at Telegraph Creek, within the Church building - the other at Mc Dames Creek, to be carried on as usual. Two teachers will be requested from Bishop Bunoz to carry on these schools, for Father Bosse' will only supervise the Mission's work, during summer times.\n\nThe copy of letter attached covers all details, but Father Bosse' considers it absurd to fancy that a school during the summer months, within this Townsite, will achieve success. He states that he is not willing to teach such a school, but, that as His Lordship Bishop Bunoz thinks it is correct to make a trial of same, this could be tried. The Department would be requested to fully supply this school, and should it not meet with success, the school material could be used elsewhere.\n\nThe letter attached mentions a visit to the Klappan Band of Indians by Father Bosse' this winter. This has been accomplished. The very Indians who signed a petition for a Summer School, as above, now sign a new petition to have a village established out in their trapping district, and a Winter School established next winter. This Father Bosse' is most willing to undertake and conduct. To here, in the fall, could be sent the school material ordered for the town trial summer school, which we consider will be poorly attended, if allowed.\n\nThe visit to Klappan Indians by Father Bosse' was very successful, not only have they started to cut logs for a School House, but they have in addition, decided to construct a \"work-shop\" in which Father Bosse' will give wood-cutting instruction.\nWith further regard to the Affairs of The R.C.

He is considered a very good man, having had experience in the Soudan, and has since been bothering this office for some up-to-date school extras.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nThe Mc Dames R.C.

A fresh school teacher seems to arrive for duty here, every year. However for 1938 it is thought that Father Poulette, now at Liard Post, will take over the charge of this summer school. The salary allowed for this school is $110.00 (158-3-1), owing to the higher cost of provisions. For the past summer Mr. Anglin (late British soldier-service in Soudan) was in charge, and much good work accomplished. He was however a little too earnest in his efforts with the nomadic children, who could not respond to his requirements as soon as wished. Here again the Schoolmaster, who resides on the reserve, should be requested to keep order, or at least report disorder, whilst he is there, to the Indian office and police. School progress however was good. Requirements for season 1938 will be restocking the worn out school supplies.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIndian Agent Harper Reed, in a letter dated November 4th writes as follows:\n\n\"The Mo Dames R.C.

The reason being that the time necessary for the Cheque to arrive from Ottawa, was ever long, and that as Winter was always near, the cash was required.\n\nSeveral requests for advances to meet these requirements have been submitted, and if such are considered it is thought correct to use a Cheque Book issued by the Department; rather than a private cheque issued by the Agent in charge.\n\nMight therefore a Cheque Book be supplied, as no doubt is being issued to other Agencies, so that a correct procedure may be followed.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

This was the Agency's first venture and was started by the late Father Allard - it was a success from the start, and went along fine until we lost Father Allard by drowning. Father Bosse then took charge and the change was noticed. Father Bosse gave this attention and also Liard Post visitations at the same time and it was really too much. Lately we have had separate teachers and the school has shown good results until this year. This season, owing to several reasons, the Indians have all side slip'd to Liard Post - there is more excitement at that point. Also owing to sickness in two families, and the fact also that they were questioned last summer in regard to the McDonald Murder charge, undertaken by Corporal Blatta of the R.C.M.P., these two families with a lot of school youngsters, have not reported in to McDames Creek this summer. It has all meant that the attendance is low. However, it is most certainly expected that all the McDames Indians will return again to that point - next summer. His Lordship thought that a winter school here also would be perhaps good. The office point of view is that it is not quite possible. Should this take place these real nomads would just come in to the Post and sit down, and beg rations - it would eventually be very expensive, and wind up in trouble with the Indians going away again to the \"woods\". McDames is the centre of the cartwheel arrangement of trapping grounds around that district, but is too large for Indians to be running in and out during the trapping season. This school should be retained as it is.\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nFebruary 12th, 1939\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Mc Dames Reserve Summer School, R.C. Mission.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a Requisition for School Stationery that is required for the summer term of the Mc Dames Reserve School. Perhaps it might be remembered that this same list was forwarded last Fall for this school, but owing to delay in other school supplies - they were used elsewhere.\n\nNo word has yet been received from His Lordship Bishop Bunoz as to who he wishes as a Teacher for this School, but it is understood that Mr. J.A.M. Anglin (now teaching at Caribou Hide) will be sent to that point.\n\nLast summer Mr. Anglin was in charge, his school term was from June 1st. to the end of August. His pay was at the rate of $110-00 per month, payable through this Office. It is respectfully considered that the same regulations should be observed this coming summer, and therefore may the necessary Authority be granted.\n\nMr. Anglin called at this Office ere returning to Caribou Hide last month, and the matter of attendance was taken up with him. We found that a possible 24 children could be in attendance at Mc Dames next summer, but it is thought that if a steady 18 youngsters can attend the school would be worth running. However some families bring in their children and \"then lay down\" and expect Rations, Mr. Anglin was told that he would have to watch out for such actions and perhaps send a family \"out\" now and again to either fish or hunt meat. However should the Indian Families return from their trapping and gather at Liard Post, then perhaps the attendance at this school would be very low, but in any case, the families living around the Mc Dames Post alone would turn in over ten children.\n\nNo Grant for extra equipment is required here, the excellent school house is complete, but perhaps an allowance for Trenching, and perhaps a Drum of Thick Oil to reduce the Fly Pest (very bad at this point) might be considered. It is thought a hundred dollars would cover both items.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

This day school has an attendance of about 15 to 20 nomadic children who come in to the H.B. Coy Post at this point for the summer months. Besides what is taught them, they are prevented from running wild during these months, and are taught some sanitation etc. It is considered that this should be allowed.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bumoz has been written to, in regard to a Teacher, but one will be found even if Mr Anglin - who carried on these duties last summer - cannot do so during 1940. The Salary allowed at this point is at the rate of $110-00 per month, the extra rate being for the very high cost of provisions etc to this Interior Post.\n\nSubmitted herewith is a Requisition covering material for this School, but it seems they are rather well stocked at present. However in addition to the Requisition the following should also be supplied.\n\n6. Wash Hand basins. Life Buoy Soap 12. Fly Tox. 1. Gas 2. Brooms. Paper Towels - sufficient to cover school term.\n\nOwing to the lateness of my inspection last summer to this point, the school was not seen in action, but the coming season should see the Agent in there at an early date, for a full inspection. However Mr Anglin did report personally on the school, and from other sources it is understood that this school is doing good work.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\nHead Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo the Department will allow for teacher's salary at the McDames Creek Seasonal School an amount of $100.00 a month for a period of 3 months only during the coming summer.\n\nYou should advise me later regarding the name, qualifications etc. of the teacher nominated for this school by His Lordship Bishop Bunoz.\n\nYou may purchase for use at this school 6 basins, 12 bars soap, 1 gallon Fly Tox, 2 brooms and a supply of paper towels.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

He wrote to me that at the end of the school term at Caribou Hyde he has to go South to have his teeth attended to.\n\nBesides he is a soldier, having served in the British Army in India. If he is wanted and receives a call he will join the army immediately, he says.\n\nHowever supposing that Mr. Anglin would not return I think that Mr. Moran would be glad to go to McDames for the Summer.

Father Carpentier, O.M.I., and during the winter three such schools have been in operation viz. Klappan Bay School - Dense Lake School, and that of Caribou Ridge. Reports on all the above have been rendered to the Department whenever it was possible to do so. As this month sees the breaking of winter into the summer season, it is mentioned that three summer season schools will be in operation this year, viz., Thalton Reserve Anglican, as mentioned above. The McDame Reserve Day School, in the middle of the Cassiar and the Laird Post Day School, near the Yukon border line at which several Yukon children attend. The latter two schools being carried on by the R.C.Mission.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nwinters fat meat, and generally arrange their trapping affairs,\nso that if the school term extends from June 1st to the end of\nAugust, it would be quite sufficient and nearly all these nomadic\nyoungsters can absorb at one time.\n\nThe question as to who, and who shall not attend this Bush School,\ncan be taken up during the Inspection, next Spring, when Inspector\nColeman, of the B.C. Agencies, will be present to help matters go\nalong smoothly.\n\nTherefore, Sir, may the Authority be granted to open up this Seasonal\nSchool for the year 1941, for a period of three full months, with\nthe Salary of $100-00 per month as in past years. Also a few school\nmaterials will be required to replace used books etc., and if required\na few extra supplies, such as Fly Tox - Soap - Paper Towels, and per-\nhaps a Broom or two.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nRe: Mc Dames Creek, B.C., R.C. Mission School.\n\nI beg to submit a Report on the above Seasonal Summer School, covering the summer of 1940.\n\nUnder the Authority 158-3-1, February and March 1940 permission was granted to open the above school, for the duration of three months. The Salary allowed was at the rate of $100.00 per month, and some extra school equipment was allowed, i.e., Fly Tox etc., along with the usual school material supplies; all of which was duly obtained and forwarded. The Rev Father O'Carpettier, O.M.I., eventually took charge, as Teacher for the summer and his school returns have been forwarded as received.\n\nHowever his Returns cover only 23 months, his reason for the loss of half a month, is laid to the fact that fresh meat and fish are hard to obtain around and near the Post of Mc Dames, and the Indian families could not maintain themselves on \"Store Provisions\". Therefore the school closed early, and the Indians went off to the woods. It is his intention, if allowed, to open up the school next summer on June first, when he hopes to give a full three months teaching to these youngsters.\n\nThe Reports submitted show a good attendance, and the School is certainly worth the expenses incurred. It is drawn to the attention of the Department that some few children who have attended this last summer, do not belong to this Agency, but with their folks have wandered up from the Agency to the South, and are really Finlay River Indians. Father Carpentier's attention has been drawn to the fact that if these children are allowed to attend, bringing, as they do their parents with them; the Department should be first requested to grant permission for such actions. It is found that these families do not return to their Agency for the trapping season but rather hang around with the Mc Dames Indians and trap on our Registered Trap Lines. This brings hardship on our Indians, and they for their part do not like to protest, on account of \"bad blood\" between themselves. Father Carpentier states that \"The Jack Abou Family when asked why they come up this way, state that the Game Wardens down on the Finlay River don't want us, and they say that we can go up north.\" These Indians were instructed to return to their own Agency, but it is understood that they have only returned half-ways.\n\nThe Liard Post School Report deals with trapping matters to some extent, and here, at Mc Dames Post, the same sort of affairs have an over-riding effect on the Mission School. This School was the original one opened up in the Interior of the Cassiar, and owing to its very central location, should be allowed to continue its good work. Whilst the Game and Fish are not as plentiful as in the years gone bye, yet there should be no need for the Indians to suffer for want of same during three summer months. It is considered that at about the end of August it is full time for the families to get out to their grounds and put up their...\nCATHOLIC MISSIONS OF THE YUKON AND PRINCE RUPERT\n\nChlate Fathers\nWhite Horse, Yukon Terr.\n\nMarch 1st, 1941\n\nTo Mr. Harper Reed, Indian Agent\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI wish hereby to apply to Your Department to the effect that\nthe McDame Summer Day School be remained open during the next\nfiscal year for three months.

Also a Requisition for some school supplies. The material listed can be obtained locally.\n\nHis Lordship has already arranged for Father Marcel Bobillier O.M.I. to take charge of this school over the coming summer months.\n\nThe period of three months is all that this school should be allowed, for it is difficult for the indian families to remain longer at the Post, where meat and fish are not so plentiful.\n\nIt has been customary to allow a Grant of around $50. to $75-00 for the improvement of the Mc James Reserve during the time the school is in operation. In this way the parents of the children attending school, have some small Revenue coming in, and therefore retain their children at the Post, over the school term.\n\nSuch a Grant if allowed, would be issued exactly as that of Rations, but in this case we would obtain work improvements - drainage etc - for the relief allowed. The Reserve badly needs this attention as it is fly infested owing to low river banks, and very wet.\n\nThe last report on this school was rendered under letter dated November 19 th 1940, and the Salary allowed last year was at the rate of $100-00 per month.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Marcel Bobillier, O.M.I., will be in charge of this school. I enclose staff questionnaire which he should complete and return when he begins duties and at the end of the teaching period the usual return should be forwarded showing the names of the pupils in attendance, days taught etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A letter from Rev. G.

I should be glad if the Department would let me know the name of the teacher approved for this school when an appointment is made though I consider it would be better if the actual letter of approval is sent directly to His Excellency Bishop Bunoz and only a copy to this office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Boubillier, O.M.I., as he left immediately on my arrival on the same boat, being aware, of course, of my visit. He is French and I understand not entirely satisfactory as a Teacher.

It requires a great deal of fixing up so far as I could see from the outside; the building being locked. I could see no blackboards. Equipment is homemade. One dilapidated latrine served the pupils of both sexes and that of the missionary was not much of an example.\n\nThe Grades are as follows:\n- Grade 1 \u2014 4 pupils\n- Grade 2 \u2014 6 pupils\n- Grade 3 \u2014 2 pupils\n\nBoys 7, Girls 5, total 12.\nAverage attendance (August) 7.71.\n\nList of textbooks in use will be submitted later by the Indian Agent.\n\nThere were quite a number of Indian children residing across the river from McDams, behind the Hudson's Bay Company's store. Arrangements were made during my visit for them to move over to the Reserve and build there, and this may augment the pupils in future. Unless the average attendance can reach 10 I do not think the present expenditure warranted.\n\nI consider this school should be subject to the careful scrutiny of the agent during the next term both as to general conditions and the quality of the teaching.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STIKINE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF SEPT. 1942.\n\nMC DAME CREEK SCHOOL\n\nOwing to poor attendance the teacher closed this school August 24th, a week earlier than expected and it was therefore not possible to inspect it. The teacher states he is very disappointed with the attendance and the general lack of interest by the children and parents in school work. The McDames Creek people are backward and civilization has had little effect on them. A full report is being submitted on the school situation here and at Lower Post.\n\nR.H.S. Simpson,\nActg. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, April 1, 1942.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to the attached, Mr. J. E. Fitzpatrick was in our employ for a short time as teacher of a seasonal Indian day school at McDane Creek, B. C. As far as we know from reports received from the Indian agent at that time, his work was satisfactory, but there is no one in this office who has sufficient knowledge of Mr. Fitzpatrick's qualifications to correctly answer the questions which you ask.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd.,\nTrail, B. C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to apply for permission to purchase the under-noted supplies and equipment for the McDame Creek Seasonal School:\n\n3 pts. Fly Tox\n6 pkts. Buhac fly repellant\n1 only Broom\n10 \" Enamel cups\n\nIt is imperative that this school be supplied with the fly tox and repellant because the mosquitoes in that district are extremely bad and a smudge must be kept burning all during school hours despite the screen door. The mosquitoes come right through the mesh in the screen.\n\nThe enamel cups are required for school children from indigent families. There is much tuberculosis amongst the children and the practice of all children drinking from the same dipper from a pail of water, which has been done in the past, is conducive to the spread of disease.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 17, 1943.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th ultimo, you may purchase the following articles for use at the McGane Creek Seasonal School:\n\n3 Pts. Fly Tox\n6 Pkts. Buhac fly repellant\n1 Broom\n10 Enamel cups\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOTTAWA,\nMay 31, 1944.\n\nM.D.G.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing letter from Indian Agent Sampson regarding the ownership of various Indian seasonal schools in the Stikine Agency. The Department concurs in your recommendation that the title to these buildings remain with the churches which erected them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Indian Agent Sampson's letter dated April 28, 1944.\n\nThe alternative to this suggestion would be to endeavour to purchase the Missions' share in the schools but I would definitely not recommend this course as I believe that it would be far less expensive, even over a period of years, to pay an annual rental of $75.00 in the case of the Dease Lake and Klappan schools and possibly Lower Post or McDevitt Creek if Fisher operates, than to purchase these crude log buildings and try to improve them. From past experience it seems that the operation of these bush schools is quite provisional, depending as it does upon whether or not the Indians camp at the location of the school during the usual term. At the present time it seems that any extensive outlay for establishing day school buildings would be unwise, especially in the more remote locations because it is evident that the Indians in this area as a whole are still not inclined to settle permanently in one location. Their houses in and near Telegraph Creek and the most used are used only as stopping over places between their trapping and fishing seasons. This has been more evident during the past fall and winter when these people have had to earn their living from the country, as they did prior to the freighting boom from 1941 to 1943 when supplies were going in by this route to Watson Lake Airport. It seems that the life-long habits of the Indians will not easily be changed, even to ensure the education of their children and the more or less temporary bush schools will probably have to serve, at least for the present.\nRe: McDAME (Seasonal) School\n\nIn letter of April 8, 1945, on File 158-7-1 the Department approved the appointment of Rev. J. P. Tanguay, O.M.I. as teacher for the period it is open during the coming summer.\n\nRev. J.

B.

He also submitted the enclosed requisition for supplies.\n\nIt was pointed out to Rev. Arsenault that we had no authority to operate this school as the Department had already been advised of the closing of the McDame Creek School. However, he felt that the Department would favourably consider his work because several of the children who had previously attended the School at McDames were attending at Lower Post, having changed their place of residence by force of circumstances.\n\nIf the Department is inclined to compensate Father Arsenault for his two months' work operating the school, it would be appreciated, as this priest was conscientious in his efforts to establish a school in place of the inoperative one at McDames Creek.\n\nRev. Arsenault's present address is Dawson, Yukon T.\n\nAt the present time it seems unlikely that a school will be operated at Lower Post next summer as there is no priest stationed there since the transfer of Rev. Arsenault to Dawson.\n\n(R.H.S.

As you may have already seen by the reports for June, July and August there was a very large attendance of children as soon as all the Indians got back from the woods. It would seem that with that second experiment it can be taken for granted that the Indians at McDames want a school for their children. The teacher, Mr. Bowrey, did very well in every way.\n\nFor two summers the school has been conducted in what is now the only building on the reserve. It is also used for a church and the missionary's residence during the two months or so of his work at that point. It is not yet completed and cannot be as long as it is being used for a school during the months that I am at that place. Would the Department kindly consider the inconvenience I have to put up with. I did not mind it as long the venture was in an experimental stage but now that it seems to be a success would not the Department give at least some kind of a grant towards a separate building for next spring.\n\nBefore leaving McDames this time I gave the contract to two men to haul the logs and whipsaw the lumber this fall so that it will be ready for next spring at the cost of $396.00. It will cost approximately another $400.00 to bring in windows, shingles or paper for the roof, plane the floor, window jams and casings (by hand) and put up the building. If not all of that sum perhaps a part of it could be given for next spring.\n\nI shall return to Fort St. James for the winter in a couple of weeks. Will the Department kindly acknowledge this report and also send the teacher's cheque for August to Fort St. James, B.C.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Allard, o.m.i.\nOttawa, October 3, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th ultimo, regarding the summer school at McDames.\n\nReturns have been received showing the attendance and days taught during the period this school was in operation. The Department is pleased to note that there was a good attendance of children and that the classroom work carried on during the past summer proved successful. A cheque in payment of the teacher's salary for the months of July and August will be sent you in due course.\n\nRegarding your request for assistance to erect a school building, and stating the cost of the work which you are having undertaken in the hauling of logs and whip sawing the lumber and in the other materials required in finishing the building, I have to say that the Department is unable at the present time to state definitely what assistance, if any, can be provided towards the cost of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

It is hoped that this requisition may be granted.\n\nLast summer the logs were cut and partly hauled by the Indians concerned under the supervision of Father Allard.\n\nThis spring it is intended to construct a school house away from the church so that the church itself can be kept cleaner and more sanitary. Father Allard with his assistant live in the church building when at McDames Creek.\n\nThe Ottawa Authorities mentioned are in connection with small supplies that are needed for this school and which same - just small amounts - were to be bought and charged up under those authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Harper Reed\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nChas.

Father E. Allard, O.M.I., about whose efforts there has been previous correspondence with the Department.\n\nPerhaps the Department will be good enough to advise whether or not it is prepared to authorize this purchase which will be approximately $20.00 f.o.b.

Also there are a few special small odds and ends that Father Allard can obtain from the large stores \"below\" at a most reasonable charge, and which he can also bring along with him when coming North, might authority be granted to include these necessary articles, perhaps to the total value of Ten Dollars.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept.

The oakum that was kindly supplied by the Department for filling the spaces between the logs was not quite sufficient. Another fifty pounds is required to finish the task. Do you think it would be possible for the Department to supply it.\n\nA path to the school is needed. As it is a good number of children have to go through a swamp to reach the school. Some drainage and levelling will have to be done. May I ask you to request the Department to allow some relief in order that the work may be carried on when I shall be there myself and could supervise it.\n\nA few tools are also needed for which I must also ask the Department:\n\n- Brush Hook\n- Miners' Pick (for rock)\n- Wheel Barrow\n\nAnd last but not the least, for mosquitoes:\n\n- Quart Flit\n- 4 large cans Buhac\n\nAll of which I submit to your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. Allard, O.M.I.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, herewith, a requisition for School Material required by The Rev. Father A. Allard, O.M.I., who is in charge of the Mc Dames Creek, R.C., Mission Summer School.\n\nA covering letter from the Rev. Father, also attached requests further supplies for the Mission and its grounds, and are therefore listed with their approximate costs:\n\n- 50 lbs Oakum 5-50\n- 1. Brush Hook 2-50\n- 1. Pick 2-00\n- 1. Wheelbarrow 6-00\n- 1. Art. Flit 2-00\n- 4. Tins Nuhac 2-00\n- 1. Gall. Paint 2-00\n\nTotal about $22-00\n\nA trench, 100 yards long, from the back bench to the river bank is certainly required. It should be 5 feet deep with a 4 foot bottom. If this was accomplished by the issue of staple provisions, only, they find their own meat etc., it would cost around $30-00.\n\nIt is respectfully thought that if the Department considers that the above requirements should be allowed, the Total sum of $50-00 should be allowed the Rev. Father Allard with the understanding that he obtains his own tools etc., and that by the end of the Season the necessary trench must be completed.\n\nThe subject of the Mc Dames Mission was covered in the Agency Report for July 1934, and remarked upon by the Agency's Doctor in letter dated August 27th 1934.\n\nAs stated in previous correspondence on this matter, this R.C. Mission is doing splendid work, and were the Rev. Father devoting more time to this work, great improvement to these Nomads would soon come about.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 18, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Rev. H.

You should forward a certified account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRegarding the digging of the trench, the Department will allow an expenditure not exceeding $28.00 in the issuing of staple provisions to the Indians who do the work. The Rev. Father should see that the Indians perform the labour satisfactorily in digging the trench, which, it is noted, should be 5 ft. deep, with a 4 ft. bottom. You should also forward accounts, in triplicate, for the expenditure incurred in the issuing of provisions, the cost of which should not exceed the amount authorized above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Inspector Pragnells Report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir\n\nBoat arrived today with letters, find enclosed paper in re my particulars.\n\nSorry that on my letter dated 17th ultimo I failed to express myself clearly, as to number of windows etc., likewise as to my intention. I had already priced fine wire at the local Hudson's Bay store, the same being (1) one dollar per yard on measuring its width. I found suitable to these windows in this school so I purchased (10) ten yards of same and have covered six windows four down stairs and two up, upstairs my living quarters.\n\nThe frames I made of slats of which I found a considerable number in the church here, these can be very easily detached in the fall before I leave here. Now all I actually wished to know was would the Indian department stand the price of the wire I have purchased.\n\nHaving windows covered has made a deal of difference and although the flies are bad we find none of them in the school.\n\nJuly first has come and gone (sorry the soft balls and bats had not arrived at that time) we had a very good day here indeed, besides the ten dollars donated by yourself, the Hudson's Bay donated ten then Mr Meek and I went around the various whites here and with our own donations made it up to thirty-six dollars, this we spent in prizes and refreshments, all the prizes we purchased were for the school children. Some of the Indians thinking they would like to indulge in the sports collected certain monies and we organized events for them after the children's sports. One race being a four man relay race, Mr Wilms brought his crew down from the mine and we were able to get four teams in the relay which proved very effective in showing these people the spirit of competition.\n\nAfter the races were over we had a soft ball game there being a ball we made a passable bat with a saplin. One game of Lacrosse completed the day, every one came away with the feeling of a day well spent.\n\nMy evenings are occupied in fixing a toilet for the school and making my quarters more habitable, am in a hurry to catch up with the remainder of my mail so wishing you a pleasant trip.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE Note:- I remain\n\nSubmitted.

Mission Winter Seasonal School, JOHNSON VILLAGE S.TESLIN LK.\n\nIn an interview with His Lordship Bishop Couder O.M.I., in Atlin, B.C., February 25th last, at the suggestion of Rev Father Dreaan, O.M.I., His Lordship suggested that a winter School be opened up on the Indian Reserve at the mouth of the Jennings River - being at the south end of Teslin Lake. Again it is mentioned that the \"Line\" between the Yukon and B.C. cuts Teslin Lake in half - north and south. His Lordship stated that there were 56 people on this Reserve during the winter months.\n\nAttention was given this application, or suggestion, but it was not reduced on paper as an Application.\n\nIt was pointed out that the Indians of that Reserve were mostly of the Church of England Faith, and that their children attended the Teslin Post school during the summer months. That nearly all the Johnston Family, who have houses at Johnston Village, took their families out trapping up the Jennings river, and were not at the Village all the winter long. Also that no children would go to school all the year around, and that the summer school at the Teslin Post was good and wanted, so that the children could have something to do, and keep out of harms way. No requisition has been received from the Indians as a Band, but that might be expected this summer, when the inspection of that point takes place. No doubt Father Dreaan has suggested such a movement, under favourable colours.\n\nHis Lordship was asked as to the number of Indians they considered of their Church, and as he did not know, Father Dreaan was given the Census List to mark, which he did. The result was that out of 149 persons at Teslin Post (or near abouts) he claimed 72 as R.C.'s and 19 doubtful - but that had stated they would be R.C.'s, leaving 58 to be considered as of the Church of England.\n\nIt was pointed out that ere he arrived in Teslin, all these Indians attended the Church of England Mission and all their children attend the school. This was not denied but an expressive shrug of the Rev Father's shoulders, was all the reply obtained regarding such a state of affairs.\n\nTherefore it is considered that this suggested seasonal school, be laid in abeyance until Inspector Coleman can visit Teslin Lake and see for himself how matters stand. From the point of view of the Indian's correct living - that these children must be taught trapping etc - the summer school facilities now in operation at Teslin Post, or that could be arranged there, are sufficient for the time being.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the establishment of a seasonal school at Johnston Village.\n\nAs no funds were provided in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for a school at this point favourable consideration cannot be given to the matter. When Inspector Coleman arrives at your Agency the whole situation should be further investigated and a report submitted to the Department in order that at some later date the advisability of conducting a seasonal school at this point may be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Harper Reed, also a copy of our reply. As you are aware there are several seasonal schools in operation in the Stikine Agency. When Inspector Coleman visits this Agency this summer he should fully investigate the work that is being done at these seasonal schools. You are aware of the condition of our funds and while we have no desire to curtail seasonal schools if they are doing effective work, at the same time the situation at each place should be carefully studied in order that we may be assured that the seasonal school justifies the expense that is being incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMay 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 156-10-1.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to Mr. Indian Agent Reed's letter of the 15th ultimo regarding the opening of a seasonal school at Johnston Village in the vicinity of Teslin Lake. In reply, I would advise that it is the intention of Mr. Inspector Coleman to visit this agency in the latter part of August and he will investigate the work being done by the seasonal schools in this district.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nStikine Agency.\n\nIn regard to opening a seasonal school under different religious auspices to that previously recognized for the Band in question, this would no doubt depend largely under the circumstances, but I am of the opinion that such defections should not be officially encouraged. The possibility of such general apostasy generally arises in this Province as a result of neglect by Protestant churches in their field of endeavour. Mr. Simpson will make a careful and unbiased investigation on the ground as soon as the Indians re-assemble and report on his findings with a recommendation.\nProposed Teslin Lake School.\n\nWhile it was not brought to my attention by Mr. Reed, a perusal of the school files late in my inspection brought to light Department's letter of April 28th, 1941. File 156-10-1 stating that the matter would be investigated during my inspection visit and a report made in order that at some later date the advisability of conducting a seasonal school at this point may be investigated.\n\nApparently this is an Anglican mission and that the Indians are baptized into that faith, but that a Roman Catholic mission has opened up there claiming to have swung about half of the tribe over to their faith and that they wish the Department to open up a seasonal school under their auspices.\n\nIn the first place there are serious doubts as to the status of these Indians, whether they belong entirely or in part to this agency or to the Yukon Territory. If the latter it will necessarily be a matter for consideration and report by the Indian Agent at Dawson, as it is outside this Inspectorate. At the time of writing this report it is open to question whether I will be able to investigate the matter on the ground owing to the lateness of the season and that the Indians had scattered to their traplines before I arrived in the Agency. If any information can be secured this section of the report will be supplemented.\n\nInvestigating the status of Indians at Lower, or Liard Post I find fairly definite evidence that at least half of them are Yukon Indians and Teslin Lake is a similar boundary line problem.\nExtract from Father Plourde's letter dated March 26, 1942.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Coudert, the Co-Adjutor of the Prince Rupert Diocese, wrote me, on November 27th last, a lengthy letter regarding the needs of the Catholic Indians in the Yukon Territory. Unfortunately the letter has just reached me and it is only today that I am able to call your attention to its contents. I can think of no better method of doing so than by quoting the Bishop's letter itself:\n\n\"Re Teslin Catholic School.- You will find herewith a letter of Father A. Drean O.M.I., our school teacher and resident missionary at Teslin; this letter is a copy of a recent communication sent to Mr. Jeckell, the now acting Indian Agent for the Yukon. I think that father Drean has been far too modest in his request; I would insist that the Federal Government supply our school not only with books and stationery, but also officially approve such a school, pay a reasonable salary to Father Drean and give us a grant to erect a decent building wherein we may conveniently conduct a school; as things stand at present, we have to conduct the school in our residence.\"\n\nCould you please let me know as soon as possible what can be done to meet the wishes of His Excellency.\nMonthly Report\n\nStikine Indian Agency - July, 1942.\n\nLower Post.\n\nThis private Roman Catholic school was visited early this month. The attendance was only six and no official record was being kept of daily attendance. An almost entire lack of interest in school affairs was noted in the Indian parents and consequently attendance has been irregular and poor. A separate report will be submitted on this subject when school has been visited again later this summer. No regular school report is being submitted as the school is private and as far as is known has not been officially operated by the Department this year.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nR.H.S.

I beg to say that having written to the Methodist Supt. of Missions for confirmation, he writes me that the Church will supply the teacher \"on terms of a letter from the Dept., Feb. 23rd, which is to the effect that the Dept. will pay the salary.\"\n\nSuch an arrangement would bind the Dept. to pay a monthly salary of perhaps $60.00 a month instead of the usual $75.00 a quarter.\n\nIt would be as well for the Dept. to take this up with the Methodist Church and have it clearly understood what is to be done by both parties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nALBERNI, B.

May 15th, 1911\n\nLETTER NO. 5-25-11\n\nSIR,\n\nRe Wyah school and my letter of March 1st, No. 402-15 stating Mr. Ferrier's views re salary of the teacher of proposed school, I have now received another and somewhat extraordinary epistle from him in which he concludes as follows:\n\n\"In view of these facts I feel that it would be unwise to give my sanction to a scheme that is not feasible.\n\nOf course you are familiar with all the conditions & if they are changed since the days of Mr. Dockstader, and if in your judgement it is wise to carry out the proposal you make, all well and good provided you take the responsibility.\"\n\nHis objections seem to be that he has been told the Wyah children are often away from July to October and that the trail between Cloose and Wyah is unfit for a lady teacher. As I was aware of these facts and so was Mr. Gibson the present teacher and he proposed to get round the latter difficulty by going over to Wyah himself and letting a lady teacher teach at Cloose. As to the children being absent in summer time that is a fact found in nearly all Indian day schools on this coast.\n\nBut I would like to know just where we can find the Rev. Mr. Ferrier. The Dept. proposed to build a school evidently on the assurance of the Methodist church that they would find the teacher on the usual terms, that is, if the Dept. paid the usual grant. A month ago when I wrote to him for confirmation of this he replies that he will furnish\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\na teacher if the Dept. will pay the whole salary and now he writes he can not give his sanction to a scheme which (in his opinion) would be unwise.\n\nIt would be highly desirable to ask the Rev. gentleman down to something definite and satisfactory before proceeding to build the school room.\n\nMay I suggest that the Dept. take the question up with the Methodist Church head authorities and try and obtain a promise that the Church will supply a teacher at Wyah if the Dept. build a school room on the usual terms of the Dept., paying the usual grant when earned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 30, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and in reply I beg to say that a few days ago the Rev. Mr. Perrier visited Ottawa and explained to the Department that he had been informed that it was difficult for a teacher to cross from Classee to Wyah. It would appear, however, that a school is needed at Wyah and if Mr. Gibson will undertake to teach the school at that point the Methodist Church will nominate a teacher for Classee. There would not appear, therefore, to be any difficulty in reference to obtaining a teacher and you may proceed with the erection of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nOttawa, July 25, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has approved of the temporary appointment of Miss Sarah E.

This school is on the Government list at $400. For this year with a man of that ability I would like the salary raised to $600. Would the Department agree to this? I feel that to give a man of that standing $400 in that out-of-the-way place is poor encouragement to solicit the best that is in a man.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

I sent a copy of this letter to Mr. James. He makes reply under date of the 4th instant to the effect that he is going to leave the school at the end of this month. I have no idea what we will be able to do for a successor. However, we will do the best we can and notify the Department. It seems a very difficult matter to secure teachers for these day schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Ferrier\nOttawa, July 29, 1915.\n\nRev.

He recommends that the Clooose (Nitinat) School be closed for at least one year and that the grant for the Wyah School be increased by $200.00 per annum.\n\nThe Department concurs in his recommendation and would like you to take the necessary action to have the suggested change carried out.

A further report would be gladly received and at the same time you should obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting a small building such as you consider suitable for the Wyan village accompanied by a sketch plan. As you were informed in letter of May 19th the conditions at that time were not such as would justify the maintenance of two schools, but if only one school is to be maintained the conditions at that time tended to show that it should be in Wyan and not in Clo-oose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberta, B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nALBERNI, B. C., January 19th, 1911.\n\nLETTER NO.\n\nSIR,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 27th ultimo re school at Wyah, I am informed by Mr. Gibson the Missionary at Classee that there are 13 children of school age at present at Classee and 25 at Wyah.\n\nI enclose suggested plans (not to scale) of a building which would be suitable for a school at Wyah. Its cost would approximately be about $485.00 rather more or less according to the time of year at which it was erected, summer time being the best as the lumber would have to be rafted round from Classee to Wyah in the open ocean which could only be done under favourable weather conditions.\n\nThis price does not include desks or tables, etc. or blackboards.\n\nYour letter quoted above refers to a letter to me of date May 16th, last in which it is remarked that conditions tended to show that Wyah was the proper place to have the school located and drop the Classee school. In reference to this I may say that I have no letter on file making such a remark and that to move the school from Classee to Wyah would not be desirable.\n\nThe Missionary House is built at Classee and to build another one at Wyah would be a large expense and the same difficulty as to how the Classee children were to get to school would at once present itself and while there are more children of school age at Wyah at present it might not be so in the course of a few years. The arrangement now suggested by Mr. Gibson is to get another school room or house at Wyah for school use only and let the teacher walk over every day from Classee and keep another teacher at Classee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 31, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has under consideration the erection of a small building at Wyah during the coming summer, although a definite decision has not yet been arrived at. In the meantime, however, it is considered that it would be well for you to forward a detailed estimate of the cost of the erection of a suitable building with recommendations as to how the work should be done.\n\nI may state that the letter dated May 19th, last, which was referred to in the Department's last communication to you was written to Rev. Mr. Perrier.\n\nThe question which the Department wishes to decide is whether it would be justified in maintaining two schools, one at Glo-oose and the other at Wyah and, if so, the erection of the building at Wyah will then be considered. The Department would also like to have a definite recommendation from you in the matter, as it is not desirable to erect a new building unless there is a prospect of fair and regular attendance at both places.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nALBERNI, B.C. Feb. 13th, 1924.\n\nLETTER No. 94-15\n\nSIR,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 5th ult., No. 18964/1 re Wyah school I beg to report as follows:\n\nI have trouble in getting detailed estimates of the cost of buildings. As a matter of personal obligation I can get some local builder to give me a rough estimate of the probable cost but unless the Dept. is willing to pay for full plans and a detailed estimate, the estimate I have already sent in is about as near as I can get it. The cost is uncertain due to the fact that the Dept. sometimes asks for these estimates and does not authorize the expenditure until long afterwards when owing to increase in price of material or labour, the cost has materially increased. The cost of material was put at $250.00; labour, say $150.00; contingencies, say $40.00; probable cost of rafting the lumber round in the open sea from Clansone to Wyah, $60.00. If weather conditions were favourable, the latter might be done for $25.00. If the Dept. wished the school put up forthwith, it might cost $80.00 or the whole raft might be lost on the way, it being in the open sea.\n\nThe summer months would be the best time to erect it. If men went down there just now they might be carried past Goose for 3 trips, representing as many weeks before they were able to land.\n\nThe Nitinat, those of them who live at Wyah have been anxious to have a school for years so that their children might attend school but once started the attendance would not likely be any more regular than under similar conditions elsewhere, that is when the parents wanted to go to another reserve for business or plea-\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nLeisure, they would certainly go and take the children with them but at present I know they are really desirous to have their children go to school and the proposal to build only a school room at Wyah and let a male teacher walk over every day from Clarence and maintain another teacher at Clonese seems to me to be an reasonable and economical arrangement as could be made, provided of course that the Methodist Church agrees to this and undertakes to provide the second teacher.\n\nI note that the Dept. asks for a definite recommendation from me on the subject. In that case I would say yes, build the school room and have another teacher but I would also say that the day school system in this Agency will never amount to much or do the best under the difficult conditions until the Dept. puts its feet down and insists that all teachers shall have a teacher's certificate to teach.\n\nIt is easier to teach white children than Indians and no white child in this Province is allowed to be taught unless by some one who has not only a teacher's certificate but also a normal school certificate showing that they have been taught how to teach.\n\nThe attendance being more irregular at Indian schools and as they speak a different tongue it would seem as if their teachers should certainly be as well qualified to teach as those who have charge of white schools. Some of the Churches seem to think any one will do to teach an Indian school. It would be invidious to give instances but the enforcement of a general rule that the qualifications of all teachers in Indian schools must be submitted to and approved by the Dept. before their appointment by the Church, would ensure that the teachers were at last qualified to teach.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Agent\nOttawa, March 30, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo in further reference to the erection of a school building in the Wyah Village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to try the experiment of conducting a day school in this village and I have to ask you to state whether you can make arrangements to have the work done by day labour or otherwise under competent supervision. If so the necessary authority to proceed with the work will be given as soon as funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. W.

The sooner I receive authority to do so the better, as this I can be looking ahead.\n\nIt would be well to first obtain from the heads of the Methodist Church a definite assurance that if the building is erected they will supply regularly a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 4, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that the Department has no detailed plans and specifications for the school at Wyah, it is considered advisable under the circumstances to allow you to have the work performed by day labour, provided you are satisfied that you can obtain the services of competent men who will expedite the work in a satisfactory and businesslike manner. It would involve considerable delay at this stage to prepare plans and call for tenders. It will be necessary for you to have prepared some sketches and simple specifications for the guidance of the foreman who will be placed in charge of the work. You should try to arrange to have the Missionary or some other reliable person regularly in supervision and you should require reports from him at regular intervals to be forwarded to the Department. All accounts for materials purchased should be forwarded to the Department for payment and an accountable cheque for $150.00 is being sent you, under separate cover, for the payment of wages. I am also sending you a supply of blank return of labour forms which should be carefully filled out at the end of each week and certified.\n\nIn reference to the appointment of a teacher I beg\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nto say that the Methodist Church will be in a position to nominate a competent teacher when the school is ready for occupation.\n\nIn reference to the sketches and specifications above referred to I would ask you to supply the Department with a copy.\n\nThe expenditure should be kept within the sum of $500.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\nVancouver, B.C. 5th May 1911\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nA few weeks ago I had a letter from Mr. Neill of Alberni, B.C. stating that the Government were agreeable to building a school for the Indian children at Wyah. Replying to this I gave him my promise that we would furnish a teacher providing the Department would build a school and pay the salary. I have just had a conversation with Mr. Dockstader, the teacher who was there before Mr. Gibson, he informs me that the children are away from home from the end of June to October or November and that they are not many in number, also that is it impossible for a lady teacher to board with Mr. Gibson and get over to the school at Wyah, unless there has been a road built since his time. In view of this I have written Mr. Neill and also Mr. Gibson, stating that I could not give my consent to a scheme that is not feasible. You might look into the matter very carefully before going to the expense of building this school. From all I can learn I have serious doubts as to the wisdom of such a course.\n\nAt Kohsilah we have a little school house built on Methodist property off the Reserve. If a new site were secured on the Reserve and a building put on it about three-quarters of a mile from the present site, I believe that one of the best schools\non Vancouver Island could be built up at that point, while the Indians are not many, they are all living on farms and stay at home and I believe are more anxious than the average to have their children educated. You will see from the recent reports that the attendance has been greatly improved. I would rather a good deal that a school be built at that point. I may say we have no play ground whatever, in connection with our little building, when we fence the property, which we have to do this year in order to satisfy our neighbors. You might give this matter your consideration.\n\nWe had the meeting of our Commission re Indian Affairs in Alberta and have arrived at a definite policy. A copy of this report will reach you in due time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T. Ferrier]\nOttawa, May 15, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in further reference to the establishment of a school at Wyah.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that previous to the receipt of your communication authority had been given to Mr. Neill, the Indian Agent, to have a school-house erected and an accountable cheque has been sent him for the payment of wages. The recommendations previously received by the Department were definite and were such as to warrant it in undertaking the work of putting up a new school building and for this reason it is considered that the building should be proceeded with.\n\nYour remarks in reference to Koksilah have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

August 9th, 1911.\n\nLETTER NO. 18-16\n\nSIR,\n\nI beg to report that the new school at Wyah is now near-\n\nly finished. The cost for material to date has been $350.54, and\nfor labour, $159.50, total, $450.04. The cost was limited to $500.00,\nbut in that estimate no provision was made for either a chimney\nor for painting the school. There are some bricks\nby\nat Claroose bought by the Dept a number of years ago and new not\nneeded; they could be taken round to Wyah and a few more obtained\n& used for the chimney or glazed tile can be used. A few yards\nof water pipe and a tap are needed to bring water to the school\nfrom a water pipe which passes near. The missionary, Mr. Gibson says\nboth chimney and pipe could be done for $25.00.\n\nTo paint the school two coats outside and one coat of oil inside\nwould cost about $55.00. I think it ought to be done and done soon\nbefore the winter rains set in. I would ask the Dept's permission\nto spend enough extra on the $500.00 allowed to do this.\n\nI have not exceeded the amount originally allowed as the painting\nwas not included in the first estimate of cost. I should like an\nanswer as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 17, 1911\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the new school building at Wyah is so near completion.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to have the chimney completed and the building painted and also to purchase the necessary water pipe and tap.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a request for the purchase of the school building at Wyah. As you are aware, the school at this point has not been in operation for a number of years. We have very little information as to the value of the building, and as to whether there is any likelihood that it would be required in future for school purposes.\n\nI shall, therefore, be pleased if you will inform the Department as to whether you would recommend that this old school building be sold, or whether there is any need or retaining it for school purposes in the event of it being necessary to re-open the school at a later date. We are writing you for this information as the Indian Agent resides at some distance from Wyah and may not be able to supply the information. You might state the number of children of school age at this point, and what provision if any is made for their education, also whether any of the children from this point are in attendance at residential schools. I shall also be pleased, if you are in a position to do so, if you will state approximately the value of the school building at Wyah.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Rendle,\nMissionary, Nitinat Reserve,\nClo-osee, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.159-5-5 Mar.14th,\n\nI may state that the school building at Whyac is in such a state that it would take nearly one hundred dollars to repair it into a condition suitable for school purposes. In 1920 school was held for two months in the building, since that date on account of the unsanitary condition of building and non-residence of people no school has been held there.\n\nA. I would recommend the sale of the building, the proceeds to go towards providing desks for the school at $7.00 each.\n\nB. Besides several Indians, one white man named Matthews wishes to buy the building; I would suggest that it be disposed to Indians only.\n\nC. Seven children of school age in Whyac six attending residential schools.\nD. During the fishing season the children stay at school at 65.00.\n\nE. I would consider $75 as a fair price for the lumber the building contains. I would also suggest that the site be still reserved for school or community purposes.\n\nF. One of the applicants, Morris Hicks, wished to take possession last fall. I would not allow it; so he ordered me to remove the building off the reserve at once, as he was acting Chief in his father's absence. The rest of the people ordered him off the reserve and he has not returned.\n\nG. I would recommend that the offer of Ernest Johnson be accepted.\n\nSam [signature]\n\nP. Edw.

Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, reporting on the request made for the sale of the school building at Wyah.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are authorizing Mr. Agent Cox to arrange for the sale of this building to the Indian offering the highest price.\n\nWe note that this building is in a very poor state of repair and that it will not be further required for school purposes. The building only is to be sold, as the site is to be retained for school or community purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. E.

We understand that there are several Indians who are anxious to secure this building, and that $7,00 would be a fair price for the lumber it contains. We also understand that one of the Indians who desires to purchase the building is Ernest Johnson.\n\nYou may dispose of the building to the Indian who offers the highest price and is prepared to pay in cash for the same. The building only is to be disposed of, as the present site is to be reserved for future school requirements or community purposes.

The Village can only be approached in fine weather & calm sea.\n\nWith regard to the Rev. J. Halls letter there are about forty families in the Nittawalt Tribe who all reside at the Wyck Village at the mouth of Nittawalt Lake (covelet) in the Winter months and some 35 children and young people who could attend school but there are only 16 families.\nwho belong properly to Wyah Attinak Village the other 25 families have their houses and land at the villages of Sagamooka Claymore and Carnevali and remove from Wyah early in the Spring and as with all Tribes in this Agency many families are away at the Fisheries for the Summer months.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarry Guellot\nAgent\n\nA.

There are probably forty families at this point, and religiously and educationally they are at present in a state of utter destitution.

As only a limited number can be carried on the most suitable localities should be selected.

The Natives reside in four villages, Cloose being by far the best land and most central and if a good trail were cut it would be an easy distance from the main Victoria Village at the mouth of the Lake. Mr. Stone's wish is to form a Christian settlement at Cloose, there is sufficient land there for building lots for the whole Tribe; and for the formation of a Mission it is necessary to have a place where timber and goods may be easily landed and communication had with fortnightly steamers which can always be spoken from Cloose except in bad weather.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nHarry Guillod\nAgent\n\nA.W.

These schools are fairly well attended, and an earnest interest seems to be taken in the work by those in charge.\n\nThe List marked \"B\" also forwarded contains the names and locations of such as I consider doubtful as to the\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nthe beneficial results of same. The attendance is of such an extremely intermittent nature that during long absence from school the half wild pupils are apt to forget the teaching of a shorter period.\n\nAs to the localities where it may be considered necessary to establish day schools in the future, that knowledge can only be acquired as settlement or civilization advances which in its course naturally produces openings for such institutions. These can easily be located as the occasion arises.\n\nWhilst upon this subject I may mention what my experience has forced upon my understanding in regard to the efficacy of day schools as a means of educating to any practicable degree the native children.\n\nAs so often before stated these people are forced in their continual struggle for existence, being self-supporting, to move throughout the year from place to place, being obliged on such occasions to take their\ntheir children and for the most part their belongings with them, consequently for the time being the children are, in many cases, removed from school for long periods, the latter being established as a rule at the winter villages.\n\nThe Industrial Indian School at East Kootenay meets the requirements of these Indians known as the upper Kootenays.\n\nOn the lower Kootenay there are in the neighborhood of 70 children having no school in their vicinity. An Industrial School might, with advantage, be opened there at some future time; although these are such a good-for-nothing class of Indians it is doubtful if they would profit much by it.\n\nIn conclusion I may state that the conviction is forced upon me that with the exception of the Alert Bay School all the Industrial Indian Schools should in the meantime be increased to a capacity of\nof 50 pupils, and that later, if funds are available, other similar Industrial Institutions should be established.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nAlberni, B.C., Sept. 5th, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the Rev. Mr. Stone on behalf of the Methodist Church has applied to me to re-shingle the whole or half of the building on the Nitinat reserve at Cla-cose used as a school & church. I requested him to send in duplicate application giving prices but he has not done so.\n\nFor the whole roof he states it will require 16 M. shingles & 40 lbs of small galvanized wire nails. The putting on will cost $1.00 per M. He states that half the above quantities would suffice for one side of the roof & the other side might last a few years longer but one side must be done at once.\n\nThe Methodists have worked well there & Mr. Stone was for many years their representative there but I can not see any good ground why the Dept. should be asked to do this work. Mr. Stone bases his claim on the fact that when erected this building was paid for by the Dept. At least they paid $500.00 which I believe was the total cost & he therefore assumes that as the building is the property of the Dept. it falls on them to keep it up.\n\nI fail to see it in this light, & regard the $500.00 payment more as a grant in aid of the building in the same way as the Dept. has given grants towards building Boarding schools but never with the idea of thereby creating an obligation to keep them in repair thereafter. A grant in aid of any the building of a day school is rather unusual & if this request is granted other day schools will be asking for the same aid & will take the position that the fact that they were built without aid from the Dept. should be an argument in favor of, rather than against, their getting aid from the Dept. to repair them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for the information and consideration of the Department a letter, dated the 5th instant, No. 591/5, received from Mr. Agent Neill of the West Coast Agency stating that the Reverend Mr. Stone, on behalf of the Methodist church, has applied to him to re-shingle the whole or half of the building on the Nitinat Indian reserve at Clanses used as a school and church.\n\nI cannot but agree with the view of the application taken by the Agent, there being, as he aptly remarks, no good reason why the Department should be asked to do this work. It would seem that the least the de would missionary society Mr. Stone represents should be to reshingle the roof of the building without government assistance, more especially as the sum of $500.00 granted by the Department in the first instance practically covered the entire expense\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof erecting the structure. All things considered I think that\nthe society should make whatever repairs are from time to\ntime required on the building and about the premises, as not\nonly school work is carried on but religious instruction is\nafforded the children and others of the village and church\nservices are, as stated by the Agent, held therein throughout\nthe greater part of the year.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

Yesterday they telephoned me that the cheque had been received by them on September 2nd, 1911, through the mail and the amount had been credited to the Dominion Government and not to the Department of Indian Affairs, as the cheque did not specify what it was for.\n\nMessrs Hibben & Co. today inform me they also must have received their cheque through the mail about September 15th, 1911. This firm was burned out during November last and their establishment since that time has been somewhat disorganized.\n\nThe complication would appear to be due to the fact that the cheques were sent direct to these firms instead of to this office. I am now marking my vouchers paid on the dates above-mentioned.\n\nThe following are the only cheques received by me made out in the month of September last:\n\nNo. 652, Sept. 7, H. O.

The amount of the account is $10.25. The firm rendered an account some time ago for the same stove and charged $11.75, also 70\u00a2 freight charges, or a total charge of $12.45. I enclose for your information copy of the letter which is being addressed to them in this connection. You will observe that they are being asked to make a refund of $2.20 as the Department made payment at the amount of the first account. You might look into the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nG.A.

The account which is for \"Charmar\" box stove supplied to the Rev. J. Gibson for the Olo-oose Indian School, was previously rendered. It is observed from the account now before the Department that the price of the stove was $10.25. The account previously rendered and forwarded to the Department by Mr. Neil, when he held office as Indian Agent, gave the price of the stove as $11.75 and showed freight charges of 70\u00a2 or a total charge of $12.45. A cheque in payment of the account was sent forward on the 17th January. It would, therefore, seem that a refund of $2.20 should be made to the Department by you.

The building will have to be shingled, one round of an post re-set, bell tower repaired, windows put in and the approaches to the school put in a state of repair. Estimate the cost of these repairs at $300.00; and would ask you to request the Department to vote the sum of $300.00 for the above repairs at their earliest convenience.\n\nI am, evidently yours,\n\nP. E. Remple\nOttawa, November 6, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a communication from T. E.

Kindly inform Mr. Rendle accordingly. I may say that he should have brought this matter to the attention of the Rev.

Purch. 1895\nOttawa, January 25, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 28th of October last, in which you enclosed a communication from T. E. Rendle, teacher of the Nitinat (Clo-oose) Day School, requesting a grant of $300.00 to cover the cost of repairing the school building. Mr. Rendle states that the building requires to be shingled, one foundation post re-set, bell tower repaired, windows put in and approaches to the school put in a safe state.\n\nThe Department is prepared to authorize having these repairs made, but before doing so you will be good enough to state whether it would be advisable to purchase the material required and have the work done by Indian labour or whether these repairs should be done by contract and the material required supplied by the contractors. If the first scheme meets with your approval you will be good enough to give a statement of the lumber required and the cost of the same, but, if you think the work should be done by contract you should obtain prices from several contractors or competent carpenters and submit their prices to the Department for approval before any action is taken. In either event the Department cannot expend more than $300.00 on repairs to this school and the work should be done at much less expense if possible.\n\nKindly give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas.

Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter re. school repairs received but on visiting and examining the building since my visit last October, I feel that under the condition the building is now in, it is past repairing and new approaches would also have to be provided. The people think it would be better to have a school in the village proper, where at present under rent at Cooose the building used by the late Henry Chipps as store and dwelling, a two story frame structure 25' x 35', well lighted and in a central position, same being used for church and social purposes, the lower portion all in one room, and Sask permission to use the part in making this building suitable for school uses.\n\nP.E. Rendle\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith communication received by me from the Rev. J. E. Rendle of Cie-esse, and which, has reference to the school building at Cie-esse.\n\nI would recommend that at the present moment no expenditures be incurred on the building which Mr. Rendle mentions in his letter, as that particular building is under dispute by the relatives of the late Henry Chipps. As this building is practically new, I am of the opinion that this place will answer the purpose until such times as there is something definite decided upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 20, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 12th instant, with letter of Rev. Mr. Rendle enclosed, in reference to school building at Clc-cose which is suggested as being more suitable for school purposes than the one in which classes were formerly held.\n\nAs the building in question is only rented for church purposes, and title in doubt, the Department could not consider the expenditure necessary to fit it up for a school.\n\nIt might be well, however, to make enquiry as to the probable cost of the building in the event of its being for sale, and the expenditure necessary to fit it up for school purposes, that this information may be available if the matter should be given consideration at a later date.

Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nAlberni, B.C., Jan. 31, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with Department's letter of Dec. 3, No. 143578, I beg to submit the following report on the Nunkunus Indian Day School.\n\nFormerly, the Day School for the Ohiaht Band was situated on the Indian Reserve at Dodger's Cove, but as all the families with children of school age have resided for some time past on the Nunkunus Reserve, the Dodger's Cove school has been closed, and one opened at Nunkunus.\n\nThe school building belongs to the Presbyterian Church and was built by Mr. Ross, now of the Ahousaht Boarding School, but formerly missionary to the Ohiaht Band, who held school and service in this building a few years ago. The present teacher, Tom Shewish, is an ex-pupil of the Alberni Boarding School, with an ordinary boarding school education.\n\nHe has been employed by the Presbyterian Church, under the supervision of Mr. Currie of the Alberni Boarding School. He has been supplied with school material, at different times from this school. The school is not opened regularly; sometimes owing to the teacher's absence, and very often to the absence of the children. On my recent visit to the Nunkunus Reserve, January 13, I found the school open, after informing the teacher of my intended visit, with five pupils present. There is an enrolment of about twelve children of school age, but half of these were absent from the Reserve with their parents. I was well pleased with\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nSir,\n\nwith the appearance of the school room and pupils, also the discipline. They read very well, and their pronunciation is good, considering they have not the opportunities of the children attending boarding schools. Good progress is being made in arithmetic and spelling. Service is held in the school room, morning and evening, each Sunday. The teacher informed me that as the Indians will soon be moving to Banfield, where there is no school building, the Chiaht or Kunukumus Day School will be closed for a time. The W.F.M.S. have written asking him to open a school, at the Uchucklesit Cannery.\n\nSince receiving the Department's letter in this connection, I have received a letter from the Stationery Department No. 143576/4, of Jan. 7, informing me that a supply of school material was being sent me for this school. I will supply this to the teacher as it is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n159-12-1\n\nclosed\n\nfrom 27/4/1893\n\nto 21/1/15\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6039)\n\nFile 159-5-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - General Administration.\n1911 - 1915\n\nFile 159-5-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1910 - 1916, 1923\n\nFile 159-6-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinaht School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1893 - 1895, 1902 - 1914, 1919\n\nFile 159-6-7A, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinaht School - Agents reports.\n1925, 1922, 1933\n\nFile 159-12-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - General\nAdministration. 1893 - 1896, 1912 - 1915\n\nFile 159-12-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - School Land.\n1899 - 1902\n\nFile 159-14-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - Administration -\nTeachers. 1901 - 1902, 1909 - 1915\n\nFile 159-14-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - School Land.\n1899 - 1900\n\nFile 159-14A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Bamfield Boarding - School - General\nAdministration. 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Protestant School -\nGeneral Administration. 1897 - 1898, 1904, 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Roman Catholic\nSchool - General Administration. 1896 - 1897,\n1914 - 1916, 1928\n\nFile 159-31A-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot Roman Catholic School -\nEstablishment. 1897\nAt a meeting of the Ojibwa Band of Indians held at Nicahtanis village on the 24th day of November 1899, it was unanimously voted by the members of the band present that the Rev.

I. Johnston to Dodger's Cove. We asked that Committee to consider her appointment. She has had years of experience in Alberni and because of difficulties that arose in the mission at that time, her services were dispensed with. I scarcely know any woman who has such an enthusiastic interest in the Indians. She is decidedly capable but has some qualities that make it difficult for her to work with others. The thought was that in Dodger's Cove she might do excellent work, and there would be no room for conflict with any other. She would at any rate keep the work in hand until some further step in advance is taken along the lines suggested to the Department, that is the establishment of a boarding school at Bamfield. That must be, I presume, the final solution of that mission if it is to be made a success. I would like to know your judgment in this matter also that I might write to the B.C.

MacKay,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\nToronto, Ont.\nApril 26th, 1911.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou are aware that Dodger's Cove has for some time been neglected. It was not found possible to find a suitable person and besides when Mr. Ross left he felt that the habits of the Indians and the tendency towards Bamfield made it unprofitable investment of a life. There is a young Indian, named Joseph Samuel in the Indian School at Ahouscht, who has been a leader in the evangelistic movement in that village. Evidently he is proving a great blessing to his own people. Mr. Ross recommended that he be appointed as missionary and teacher to Dodger's Cove and undertook to take oversight of him if such appointment were made. He suggests that the salary should be $25 a month and that the engagement should be for short periods at first in order to properly test him. Our Committee has agreed to the suggestion, and with your approval would like to see Joseph Samuel tested in that way. He is evidently a lad of not only ability but of spiritual attainment, that is quite unusual amongst the Indians. Mr. Ross in a letter just received, states that a number of the pupils and three women were at the Rancherie when he was writing, asking for Christian baptism and he also stated that another young lad is ready to take Joseph Samuel's place as soon as he leaves. He would like to have him enter upon his duties upon the last of May. This is a development that is, I think, of peculiar interest and should it prove satisfactory, is along the lines we have often longed for. I shall be very glad to have your approval of this appointment.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/LOB.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 2, 1911.\n\nRev.

His salary will be at the rate of $300.00 per annum.

The Band has been for years divided into two sections, - Nunkakamus and Dodgers. The frequent changes from place to place have necessarily impaired school work. Since Bamfield has begun to grow a section of the Band is moving there and all threaten to move. In addition to this the merchant who had a store at Dodger's Cove has moved to Bamfield and on that account the steamer that used to call regularly at Dodger's Cove has ceased to call. This leaves Mr. John Ross, the missionary, not only isolated, but unable to secure attendance at the school.\n\nHe writes that the only hope of caring for these children is a Boarding School, and in this Mr. Neill, the agent, supports him. A small Boarding School capable of accommodating about 20 children with possibility of enlargement, if necessary, would meet the situation.\n\nI am instructed in view of these conditions to write the Department asking whether or not they would be willing to authorize a Boarding School at Bamfield allowing the usual per capita grant, and also whether a grant in aid of building would be allowed. Mr. Ross who is himself a carpenter sent plans of suitable building which he estimates would cost about $2000.00.\n\nTrusting this will receive favourable consideration, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 23, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th inst., reporting the unsatisfactory condition of the Chiaht day school at Dodger's Cove, B.C., owing to the unsettled habits of these Indians, who are constantly moving from place to place, and recommending the establishment of a boarding school at Bamfield.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Department is not at present in a position to deal with this proposition and it thinks it would be undesirable for your Church to incur any expenditure in the erection of buildings until the British Columbia school policy is finally settled.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nFeb. 24th., 1909.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours just received in which you recommend that no expenditure for buildings be made at Dodger's Cove or Banfield until the B.C. school policy is finally settled. This commends itself to my own judgement. While the interests of the Indians there demand attention yet it is important that in the consideration of the new policy the conditions be left as they are. I trust the Department will find a wise solution to this exceedingly difficult problem.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nREV/MBA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOctober 29th., 1909.\n\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear sir:-\n\nYours of the 27th., 119469/1 just received, I am so glad to receive the endorseration of the Department as to appointments already made. We are looking for one for Ucluelet and have not succeeded, nor have we succeeded in getting a principal for Ahousaht. There is one candidate who has had some experience in India work, and is recommended, but his letter does not indicate to me that his knowledge of English would justify his appointment as the teacher of a school. He may be competent in many ways, and yet there is hesitation. We would regret very much if that school fell from the good standard already secured.\n\nRe Dodger's Cove. You will remember the correspondence we had with the department some time ago asking that a grant might be made for the erection of a Boarding School at Bamfield, which was declined, because of the possible changes that might be made in Indian administration. It does not seem worth while appointing a teacher to Dodger's Cove along the old lines, insomuch as they have moved away largely toward Bamfield, and are likely in the future to make that the centre. Mr. Ross when he left there stated that he did not think it was worth any man's while spending his time at Dodger's Cove teaching a day school. Our Board did not feel itself able to proceed with the Boarding School, although a very modest one was deemed sufficient. The plans have been sent as prepared by Mr. Ross and seem satisfactory. It was thought that a $2000.00 grant would have sufficed to establish there a small boarding school that would be very useful amongst that tribe.\n\nIf it were possible to reconsider the Department's action it would be gratifying to us, because we do not wish to discontinue a work that has been so long carried on and with considerably results.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on Tuesday of next week in connection with the W.F.M.S. Presbyterial meeting. I shall make an effort to call on the Department and would be glad to know your views.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRPM/MBA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. P.

That must be, I presume, the final solution of that mission if it is to be made a success. I would like to know your judgment in this matter also that I might write to the B.C. Committee before final action is taken.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) R. P. MacKay.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nDuring the past year the authorities of the Presbyterian Church approached the Department with a view to having established a boarding school at Bamfield for the Indians of the Ohiapt Band.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you upon the school work as conducted at present by the Presbyterian Church in this district with your views as to whether the needs of the children would be better met by a boarding school situated at a central point than by the day schools as at present.\n\nI may add that the appointments of Miss B. I. Johnston as teacher of the Dodger's Cove school, which has been closed for sometime, and of Mr. Vanderveen to the Ucluelet school have been approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Neill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 9th inst.,\n\nNo. 357280, asking for information re the school situation among the Chiat Indians, I beg to report as follows\u2014\n\nThe Presbyterian Church have maintained, or have been supposed to do so, a teacher among this band for some ten years or so past. The teacher taught day school when the pupils were available. For long intervals sometimes lasting over a year and more at a time, there was no teacher and the work done was entirely lost. Then another teacher would be sent and another spasmodic effort made. If the work is to be continued along these lines, then certainly a Boarding school would be better as the Church would have to keep some kind of a staff continuously on the ground.\n\nSome time ago when Mr. Ross was there he applied to the Church for permission to start a small boarding school and at that time I would have endorsed his application. Since then conditions have changed. Mr. Ross has gone away. There has been a change in the principalship of the Alberni school and the new principal, Mr. W.A. Hendry, since resigned, induced an Chiat man to sign in two of his children into the Alberni Boarding school. It is to be hoped that the ice once broken, others may follow his example.\n\nAs Alberni school has a grant for 50 pupils and has never been able to fill up to that number and as Alberni is only some 35 miles from the Chiat reserves and mostly inside, i.e., smooth water, it would seem as if it was the natural solution for the Chias to patronise the Alberni Boarding school, helped out by a\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nproperly conducted day school on their reserves.\n\nThe number of children of school age among the Chiats is now about 28, two of whom are in the Alberni Boarding School. Of the 28, experience in similar cases lead one to expect that a local Boarding School would get about 17 or 18 pupils, which is rather a small number for a Boarding School.\n\nThe Church have now got two day schools and two teacher's houses on the Chiats reserves, one each at Dodger's Cove and at Kukumkamis. If they would pay salaries to induce competent people to undertake the work and stay at it, I think for the present at any rate under all the present conditions, that it would be as well to retain the day school system there and let the teacher try and induce the older children to spend a year or two at Alberni Boarding School.\n\nI may mention here a constant source of trouble in connection with getting Indians to sign in their children into boarding schools.\n\nBy the rules of the Dept., a child can be kept in until it is 18 years old. That, in this Agency at least, is too long.\n\nThese people have lived for centuries in the open air. A child taken into a school at 8 spends ten years in the school. After that its constitution is so weakened that it has no vitality to withstand disease. These Indians come to maturity so much sooner than whites that it is like keeping white children in a boarding school until they are 22 or 23.\n\nIt leads to immorality among the children unless they are watched like convicts. It leads to all sorts of concealed bargains between Indian parents and principals who, anxious to get children in, are pressed to promise the parents that they shall get their child out in a specified number of years, often four or five.\n\nThen if the parent has neglected or been unable to make this private arrangement with the principal, he will start when his boy or girl is about 15 years old and perjure himself and suborn all his friends to do the same in an effort to convince me that\nthe child is 18 years old and should therefore be discharged.\n\nI think that all the school principals agree that 18 years is too old. If the Dept. would allow the children to leave when they are 15 or even 16 or better still allow the parents to sign them in for a specified time say five years or seven years according to age at admission, I am sure that more children would attend the Boarding schools, that less deaths would take place among the pupils, and more especially among the ex-pupils, and I think that for the first generation grown from what is practically barbarism, the children should learn enough in five years to fit them for life on their reserves as they will find it during their lifetime and the next generation can be taught more and longer.\n\nI would also recommend that a quarterly inspection of each individual pupil be made by the medical officer, not a casual glance round the room full of children but have their lungs sounded on the first symptoms of tubercular trouble, let the child be sent on sick leave for a time, very often (at that early stage) ensuring complete recovery for the sick child and always, at the least, guaranteeing freedom from infection for the other children.\n\nFor the present therefore, I would recommend the continuance of the day school on the Ohiat reserves provided a teacher can be kept there regularly.\n\nI note the appointment mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter of Miss Johnson as teacher there. Miss Johnson did good work in charge of the Alberni Boarding school many years ago but I fear she will find the position a very difficult one, a solitary woman alone among these Indians and with no white person within several miles and absolutely cut off by water from being able to communicate even with them in case of necessity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n159-14 A-1\n\nClosed\n\nfrom 12/2/09\n\nto 25/4/10\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6039)\n\nFile 159-5-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - General Administration.\n1911 - 1915\n\nFile 159-5-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1910 - 1916, 1923\n\nFile 159-6-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinahlt School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1893 - 1895, 1902 - 1914, 1919\n\nFile 159-6-7A, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinahlt School - Agents reports.\n1915, 1922, 1933\n\nFile 159-12-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - General\nAdministration. 1893 - 1896, 1912 - 1915\n\nFile 159-12-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - School Land.\n1899 - 1902\n\nFile 159-14-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - Administration -\nTeachers. 1901 - 1902, 1909 - 1915\n\nFile 159-14-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - School Land.\n1899 - 1900\n\nFile 159-14A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Bamfield Boarding - School - General\nAdministration. 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Protestant School -\nGeneral Administration. 1897 - 1898, 1904, 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Roman Catholic\nSchool - General Administration. 1896 - 1897,\n1914 - 1916, 1928\n\nFile 159-31A-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot Roman Catholic School -\nEstablishment. 1897\nExtract from letter from the Methodist Missionary Department dated Toronto, Dec 3rd 1897.

Sutherland\nGeneral Missionary.\n\nThe Honourable the\nSupt: Genl: of\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa\nThe Secretary.\n\nWith reference to the application of the Rev. Dr. Sutherland for the usual grant ($300) for a school to be established at Clayoquot, B.C., by the Methodist Church, I beg to say that there will be danger of trouble between that Church and the Roman Catholic Church if this grant be allowed.\n\nAt the point in question there is at present a school conducted by the latter Church. According to the census for 1896, out of a population of 266 at Clayoquot 150\u2014or more than half\u2014are Roman Catholics, and the remaining 116 are pagans.\n\nI think Dr. Sutherland ought to be informed that another school cannot be opened at Clayoquot without the permission of the Department, and that under the present circumstances this cannot be given.\n\nH.

Ross\n\nACCOUNTANTS\nBRANDON\nDEC 15 1897\n\n[Stamp]\n\nNote: Memorandum approved by\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nSir,\n\nSome twelve years ago the chief of Cayugan sent a deputation of his Indians to the Roman Catholic Bishop requesting him to locate a priest in their tribe. This request was granted, and ever since, with the exception of a short interruption, a priest has resided here. A fine church and a missionary's residence were built on the land given by the chief. All our children have been baptized by Roman Catholic bishops or priests. We were pleased with their work for the good of our Indians. There was peace and happiness in the tribe. A few months ago a Methodist minister came here; and at once there was trouble in the tribe. A few, who always were opposed to the chief, follow him; and cause disturbance where there was none before. This minister has rented a house on the Reserve in spite of my opposition, and he says he will build a house and church in spite of me. Now the Government has always acknowledged the ownership of the Reserves on this coast as vested in the chief. Therefore I hope that you will assist me in this, and that you will instruct the Indian Agent Mr. [illegible] to inform the Methodist minister not to build on our Reserve without the consent of the chief. If the chief's authority is to be ignored in this case serious trouble may result all over the coast; for then Indians will quarrel and...\nperhaps fight over a piece of land which they wish to occupy; whilst now they are always satisfied with the land that the chief lays out for them.\n\nIf this minister wishes to have a mission on this coast why does he not go to some tribe where there is no lewd man at all? This tribe is too small for two churches, and the Roman Catholics are too long established here to disturb them. I consider it unfair.\n\nI trust that you will support me in this share the honor to be,\n\nSir, your obedient servant,\n\nJoseph\nChief of the Cayugans\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nThe enclosed letter I have written at the request of the chief of the Chippewas, who signed it, understanding that it has always been the policy of the government, as much as possible, to prevent two denominations from going to the same Indian tribe; and why, as far as the past history of this province shows, that the presence of two denominations in one tribe leads to endless troubles and difficulties. The Roman Catholics have never interfered with any denomination that was established in any tribe; and there are present very much the undue interference of a Methodist minister in this tribe where we have laboured so many years. By false representations and lies, some irresponsible party in this district the Methodists have been induced to open a mission here. For the sake of peace and harmony I trust you will give heed to the appeal of the chief of the tribe, and prevent the Methodist missionary from building or taking up his residence on this reserve in spite of the wishes and almost all of the Indians of the tribe.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. A. Van Nevel,\nR. C. Priest.\n\nThe honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 3rd March, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith copy of letter from Rev. Father VanNevel, also of one therein referred to from Chief Joseph of the Clayoquot Band, both complaining of the alleged action of a Methodist Minister in endeavouring to establish a mission in a field already occupied by the Roman Catholic Church, and in this connection to refer you to Mr. Agent Guillo's Agency report for the month of January last, transmitted under cover of your letter No. 720 B.3 of the 11th Ultimo.\n\nIf the matter be as represented, there seems to be a good deal that is regrettable, but yet it is difficult to see how the Department could do anything which might savour of an attempt to coerce the minority in religious matters.\n\nThe Department will be glad to have an expression of your views on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria B.C.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa 3rd March, 1896.\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 10th Ultimo, transmitting one from Chief Joseph, both complaining of the action of a Methodist Minister in endeavouring to establish a mission in a field already occupied by your Church; and in reply to inform you that the Department is making further enquiry into the matter.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I may point out, that although it would certainly be most lamentable to have peace and harmony disturbed, more especially in the name of religion, it is not apparent how the Department could interfere in a manner which would be susceptible of construction as an attempt to deprive the minority of religious freedom and the exercise of liberty of conscience.\n\nThere is doubtless much to commend itself in the practice, which you say has been that of your Church, to confine itself to the occupation of new fields and to leave unmolested those already occupied by other Denominations, but it is one thing to approve of a given course and another to attempt coercion.\n\nThe Department's policy has been to abstain from any further interference in the religious concerns of its wards, than may at any time have been necessary to ensure\n\nRev: Father VanNevel\n\nthe\n\nB.C.,\nthe enjoyment of equal rights by all alike.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nBritish Columbia,\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\nVictoria, March 1898\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, no. 142095-1, with enclosed copies of letters received from Rev. Brother Van Nevel, and from Chief Joseph, of the Clayoquot Band, respectively, and in response to his request I will refer to the Clayoquot Reserve.\n\nThe question raised is one that never can be settled so as to give satisfaction to all concerned. The policy of the Department in regard to religious matters being one of non-intervention, I doubt very much a missionary, having followers who are members of any particular Band, ever be prevented from having a School or a Church upon any reserve occupied by these Band or any other. There is no doubt but that much trouble is caused by having missionaries of different denominations working on the same Reserve and amongst\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nthe Indians for whose use it has been laid off, and the establishment of missionary or different denominations upon certain Reserve etc., be discouraged as much as possible.\n\nSimilar cases of disagreements however, may be observed in many small white settlements where it would seem to be the accepted principle, governing such matters, that each party work out its own salvation as may seem best, so long as no cause for the preservation of the peace, order and property etc., be violated. The \"Indian Act,\" in clause 76, under \"Regulations to be made by Chiefs,\" subsection (2), provides that the Protestant or Catholic minority may have a separate school, etc., etc.\n\nOffences if any person under the part of the missionary abused attempt to carry on any other business, at all injurious to the interests of the Indians or the Department, should advise that he be at once removed.\n\nHave the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs Your obedient servant\n\nIndian Dept.

He does not state just where the school is but I assume it is in their buildings on a small Island close to but not on the Opitsat Reserve. He also encloses requisition for school material (the school has been open one week); he also alludes to asking my approval after he or they have \"completed negotiations for the purchase of certain property on the Reserve\" but does not state for what purpose. In order not to allow the trouble to arise in this matter which occurred 3 years ago over the Oswald matter I have written Mr. Stone informing him\n\n1st that it is a strict rule that no one shall start school or religious teaching on a reserve without the consent of the Dept.\n\n2nd Advised him even if teaching school off a reserve that he should ask permission of the Dept.\n\n3rd Informed him of the necessary steps if he wishes to acquire land for church purposes on a reserve and\n\n4th informed him that it is useless to send in requisitions for material until the school is recognized by the Dept.\n\nI may be in Clayoquot for a few hours this week or beginning of next and I shall endeavour to see the Revd. gentleman.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) A.W.

Vowell forwards copies of correspondence had with Mr. Agent Neill with reference to the starting of a school at Clayoquot by Rev. W.J. Stone, Methodist Missionary. This school has been opened without consulting the Department and you will see from the correspondence that our officers in B.C. take the view that without permission no missionary has a right to engage in education work on an Indian reserve. The Roman Catholics have a boarding school on this reserve and have been engaged in missionary work there for a long time and look upon it as their special mission field. There are a number of pagan Indians there and it is no doubt to reach these that the Methodists wish to establish themselves, but as trouble is sure to grow where two religious denominations work side by side, it is a question to be decided by the Department whether a religious denomination is to be allowed to start educational work on a reserve without the Department's permission and even if applied, whether it would be wise to grant it.\n\nA similar case in connection with the establishment of a second school at Quamichan is now before you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 25th March, 1905\n\nE--4, 571\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr Agent Neill reporting the starting or re-starting by the Methodists of a day school at Clayoquot; and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to be informed as to whether the school in question is situated on the Indian reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.W.

School has been opened with 26 on the roll and an average attendance of 15 pupils, a splendid showing I will admit.

I know the Rev. Metcalfe worked there years ago but I have only been here a few months & can not ascertain when Creek was there first. At one time they spoke they were both there as to which asked a majority of the band favor it is hard to say. In either case the majority would be very slight. Probably both parties if applying for consent of band on separate occasions could obtain a majority consent as a certain number of Indians would vote for having Creek on reserve.

Vowell has taken the right course in dealing with this matter. His instructions to Mr. Agent Neill, in his letter of the 16th instant, would only complicate the matter. The Roman Catholics have a boarding and a day school on the reserve and out of a total population of 345 only 11 Indians are shown by the Census as Methodists. I think it is premature to call on the members of the Band to vote on this question, which should be decided by the Department in the first place. The question of the establishment on a reserve of schools of different religious denominations (especially Catholic and Protestant) is under the Minister's consideration, and until his decision is reached, I think this matter should remain in abeyance.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing correspondence in connection with the opening by the Methodists of a school on the Clayoquot reserve; and in reply I beg to say that the question of the recognition of this school is under consideration, and until it is recognized by the Department no school material can be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.W.

Miss Johnson is said to be the holder of a teacher's certificate and also to have had experience in nursing.\n\nKindly let the department have this report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA. W. Neil, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\n\nALBERNI, B.C. February 28th, 1910.\n\nLETTER NO. 468-13\n\nSIR,\n\nI beg to report as follows in reply to your letter of 14th inst., No. 255855/1 re the proposal to grant for the Methodist day school on Opitseat reserve.\n\nRe Miss Johnson the present teacher, I wrote to her asking for her teacher's certificate and she replies that it was sent to the Dept. about two weeks ago. She does not hold any nursing diploma. So far as Miss Johnson is concerned, there is very little to report. She no doubt did her best with the conditions as she found them. I am told she is likely to leave soon. In any case she might do so at any time as it is the conditions which prevail which most need to be considered in view of the request for a grant.\n\nIf the Dept.'s letter indicated also a desire for my report on the situation generally I would say that it would be against making any such grant.\n\nThe Methodists discontinued the day school early in 1908 and I had hoped that they realized that they would do far better by confining their attention to the medical part of the work and the hospital. Miss Johnson has only sent in one quarter's report since the school was reopened.\n\nThe census shows about 28 or 29 children of school age in the Clayoquot band. There is a large Industrial school of about 60 to 70 pupils within 3 miles from the reserve. It would probably be reasonable to suppose that at least ten to fifteen of these pupils come from the Clayoquot band. This would only leave 15 or 16 children to attend two day schools on the reserve. This number must be further reduced in view of the fact that the Opitseat\n\nTo The Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nreserve is only one of the many belonging to this band and while\nthe Opitsat reserve is the principal home, yet there is always\na considerable number at any given time who are not living\non the Opitsat reserve and very often the bulk of them are absent\nfor periods. There certainly not enough pupils to justify the\nmaintenance of 2 schools and very often not enough for one.\nThe consequence of two rival schools is bad for the work.\nThese Indians are far from civilised; as to the distinction between\nthe Roman Catholic and the Methodist faith, they knew little and\ncare still less. As one of them told me once, they think it is a\ngood thing to have two rival teachers on the reserve because it\nis like having two stores, when they can't get a thing from the\none store or teacher they can play off the other store or preach-\ner as the case may be. For instance if the Catholic priest were\nto scold them on Sunday for getting drunk or to inform on\nthem, the attendance of their children would at once fail off,\nthey would deliberately send them to the rival school. I have\nseen this happen both ways. Of course any attempt at exercising\ndiscipline during school hours would have much the same effect.\nNow when the Methodists reopened their school last fall, it was\nalleged that they offered inducements to get the children to\nattend. Either something of that kind was done or else the novelty\nof a new teacher and a lady, or perhaps a combination of both\ncertainly proved successful for they got nearly all the pupils.\nI have not a note of the exact figures, they would be seen on a\nreference to the Dec. Q.R. report of the Methodist day school but\nI knew the average was large and the enrolment much more so.\nBut the novelty has worn off, the average attendance for this Q.R.\nup to date is 4.3 and for this last week, 1.6.\nMiss Johnson herself admits that a Govt. grant under present\nconditions is \"quite uncalled for.\"\nThe Methodist church got a per capita grant for their hospital\nat Clayoquet, which is close to the reserve. Unfortunately the\nChurch had to close it saying they did not get enough support.\nThis hospital was a success and was a blessing to many of the\nIndians and I would heartily endorse a proposal to give such support to this branch of the work as would enable the Church to reopen it.\n\nI am convinced that it would be in the best interests of the Indians to have only one school on the reserve and to encourage the hospital to keep open. I may explain that the hospital is of use not only to the Clayoquot band, but to the rest of the Agency which lies north and west of Clayoquot, comprising some 1500 Indians.\n\nPossibly if the Dept. felt disposed to aid the Methodist church in an extension of their day school located at Clacose on the Nitinat reserve, they could arrange with the heads of the Methodist church to withdraw from the day school work at Clayoquot on condition of getting help at Clacose where they could do far more good. The circumstances of the situation at Clacose are set out in my letter to the Dept. under date of the 5th inst., letter no. 398-13.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 19th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your communication of the 8th December last, and previous correspondence in reference to a grant for the salary of teachers at Koksilah and Clayoquot, B.C., I beg to say that the Department has made careful inquiry into the conditions as they exist at the latter place and has arrived at the conclusion that the time is not opportune to grant your request, as the total number of children on the reserve does not warrant two day schools, more especially in view of the proximity of the industrial school.\n\nOn the 16th ultimo the Department, as you have already been advised, received from the Missionary of the Methodist Church at Clo-oose an application for assistance to enable him to establish a lodging house for the children from the Village of Wyuh who should attend his school, but are now prevented during certain seasons of the year on account of the dangerous roadway between the two villages.\n\nAgain the hospital work conducted by the Methodist Church at Clayoquot was discontinued, the reason advanced being that the grant received was insufficient.\n\nThe information before the Department leads it to offer the suggestion that your Church should withdraw from the school work at Clayoquot in consideration of assistance to develop the work at Clo-oose along the lines\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nmentioned by Mr. Gibson, if deemed advisable and practicable, and of further encouragement to continue the hospital work, which was of great importance and proved most beneficial to the Indians of the district.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have your views on this suggestion at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n159-31-1\n\nClosed\n\nfrom 6/12/1897.\n\nto 19/3/10\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6039)\n\nFile 159-5-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - General Administration.\n1911 - 1915\n\nFile 159-5-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Wyah School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1910 - 1916, 1923\n\nFile 159-6-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinah School - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1893 - 1895, 1902 - 1914, 1919\n\nFile 159-6-7A, part 1\nWest Coast - Nitinah School - Agents reports.\n1915, 1922, 1933\n\nFile 159-12-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - General\nAdministration. 1893 - 1896, 1912 - 1915\n\nFile 159-12-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Ohiet Numukamis School - School Land.\n1899 - 1902\n\nFile 159-14-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - Administration -\nTeachers. 1901 - 1902, 1909 - 1915\n\nFile 159-14-9, part 1\nWest Coast - Dodgers Cove School - School Land.\n1899 - 1900\n\nFile 159-14A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Bamfield Boarding - School - General\nAdministration. 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Protestant School -\nGeneral Administration. 1897 - 1898, 1904, 1909 - 1910\n\nFile 159-31A-1, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot (Opitsat) Roman Catholic\nSchool - General Administration. 1896 - 1897,\n1914 - 1916, 1928\n\nFile 159-31A-5, part 1\nWest Coast - Clayoquot Roman Catholic School -\nEstablishment. 1897\nWest Coast Agency\n\nClayoquot B.C.\nJune 1st 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose duplicate copies of letters received from the Rev.

The Clayoquot Tribe number 266 and there are some 40 children who should attend school and a good attendance may be looked for during the two winter quarters. The proposed school house would be built in the middle of No. 1 Opitbat Village Reserve where the Roman Catholic Mission have already built a residence and Church. In considering the question of grant for school house the Department may take into consideration that the Roman Catholic Church have churches and buildings at Kyuquot, Nootka, Sedgwick, Ahousaht Clayoquot &c. &c. and have done considerable missionary work among the Indians on the West Coast extending over the last 20 years without the aid of the Government except for medicines and occasional grants to schools &c.

It is the largest and the only one I can use; but certainly it is too small for the requirements of a school, and too unhealthy to crowd in the large amount of pupils which I am sure to have in attendance next winter.\n\nAs I see by the blue books of the Department, the Government has from time to time made an allowance (as in Clayoquot and other places) for the purpose of building a school on an Indian Reservation. As you yourself are aware that a large school room here is an absolute necessity, I would respectfully ask you to make such representations to the Department as will secure me a grant for the purpose of building a proper school room on this Reservation.\n\nI estimate that, as freight charges on this coast are so high, not less than five hundred dollars ($500) will be required to put up and paint the school house and fit it with proper forms.\n\nTrusting you will exert yourself in this direction on behalf of the Indians under your care.\n\nShame the honor to the\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Van Nevel\n\nSt. Paul's Agency\nAlberni\nClayoquot B.C.\nMay 12th 1876\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHis Lordship the Rt. Rev. Bishop Secumus has appointed me permanently to the Mission of Clayoquot. I have the honor to inform you that I intend to reopen the school for Indian children on this Reservation; in fact I have reopened it already since four months, I am applying for the customary grant allowed by the government.\n\nThe Indians are very well disposed towards the school; they are anxious that it should be kept permanently and that their children attend regularly; at present I have an average attendance of 15; but with better accommodation and a new stock of school supplies, I am confident that during the two winter quarters (when all the Indians are here) I will have an average attendance of 25.\n\nAs to school supplies, since the school has been closed so long, I find none but an old dilapidated stock. Consequently the whole should be replaced by a new supply for at least 30 pupils. Some of my pupils are sufficiently advanced to begin with the second Reader; others can follow in the first Reader, while the majority are beginners.\n\nI trust therefore that you will make such representations to the Department as will secure for my school the customary Government grant and have forwarded to me a full set of school supplies for at least 30 pupils; together with such information and instructions as are necessary, to carry on the school in accordance with the requirements of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A. Van Vleck relative to the Indian Clay School formerly established by the R.C. Missionaries at Clayoquot Station Reserve (Capilano) and which the Rev. Father is now commissioned by his Bishop to re-open on a permanent basis.\n\nIn this connection I beg to submit that the Roman Catholic Missionaries have for over twenty years been endeavouring to inculcate good morals and spread the light of civilization amongst the West Coast Indians; they have had comparatively little assistance from other sources in support of their cause; they have frequently suffered great privations and have often been in danger of losing their lives. The good influence of their teachings on the Indians is exemplified in their more orderly behaviour, their more industrious habits, their greater cleanliness, and in increasing desire to be taught. With these facts in view I would strongly support the Rev. Father's application for a grant of $500 towards the cost of building a school-house at his mission at Clayoquot and as he\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nhas omitted to specify the quantities and kinds of school material which he states he requires.

J.A. Van Beek, relative to the Indian day school recently established by the N.W.Missionaries at Clingwood, which it is now proposed to re-open; and in connection with the request made for a grant of land for the erection of a building for this school, I beg to state that the Department regrets that it has no funds available for this purpose, and as no returns have been received from this school and the Wynapot School for some time provision for the current year (1895-6) has only been made for the Town of Nelson and in the East Coast Agency, consequently, if the Clingwood school is re-opened any surplus funds remaining will be no longer available for the payment of a teacher's salary at Wynapot. But it should be borne in mind that no funds have been voted by Parliament and changes might possibly be made even as regard the above.\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\n\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nA.J.

In regard to this Report I may say that the enclosed copy of letter, dated the 10th. instant, explains the teacher's reasons for rendering a return for the Clayoquot Day School instead of for the Ahousaht Indian Day School.

J. Schindler, of the Clayoquot Indian Day School, for an increase of $25.00 per quarter. For the marked improvement in school and missionary work on the Utsitut Reserve, at Clayoquot, I beg to recommend that the increase asked for be granted, and to take effect, for quarter ending June, 1914.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the reports of St. Anselm's Day School for the past three quarters you will notice that I have had a good attendance at my school; for, the number of children on the register is over thirty with an average attendance of 13 for the Dec. & March quarters and 15 for the June quarter. Moreover, I have endeavored to apply more time to teaching than formerly because the children are now more anxious to learn and have shown a greater interest in the school than other years. It will be difficult for me to arrange to continue their interest and desire to learn unless I am financially assisted by the Department.\n\nIn consideration of the above I respectfully apply to the Dept. of Indian Affairs to raise my salary from $75.00 to $100.00 per quarter and hope the increase can be made to cover the past two quarters beginning with Jan. 1, 1914.\n\nGreatly your humble servant,\n\nJos. Sabindles, O.S.B.\nOttawa, July 10, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing an application from the Rev. J. Schindler of the Clayoquot Indian Day School asking for an increase of $25.00 per quarter in his salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the very irregular attendance at this school, the Department does not consider that it would be justified in giving any increase at present. The school was only kept open for 94 days last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. A. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI am informed by the Indian Agent, Mr. Chas. A. Cox, that in answer to my application for an increase of salary for teaching the Clayoquot Indian Day School, the Department does not consider that it would be justified in giving an increase at present, owing to the very irregular attendance at this school.\n\nIn answer, I would state that unless my salary is raised I shall not consider myself obliged to give more attention to this school than formerly. In fact, owing to my missionary duties to advance their spiritual interests and my efforts to improve the temporal welfare of the Clayoquot Indians, I am unable personally to devote much more time to the school than formerly.\n\nHowever, if the Department is willing to grant an additional salary, I am in a position at present to engage an assistant teacher in the person of my sister, Miss Victoria Schindler, who has been residing with me on the Reserve since last December. With her assistance and considering the increased interest the Indians have shown in the school last winter, I can assure the Department a considerably better report than that of last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Rev.) Jos. Schindler\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nALBERNI, B.C.,\n\nLETTER NO. 161-20\n\nSIR:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Rev.

Jos. Schindler in further reference to his application for an increase in his salary as teacher of the Olayoquot Indian Day School. In reply to a former application Mr. Agent Cox was informed that owing to the irregular attendance at this school the Department did not consider that it would be justified in giving any increase at present. Mr. Schindler is the missionary there and he now states that if his salary were raised he would be in a position to engage an assistant teacher in the person of his sister, Miss Victoria Schindler, and that this would leave him ample time to attend to his missionary duties and the school would not suffer in consequence. He only asks to have his salary increased from $300.00 to $400.00 and I think his application might be favourably considered.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, August 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant enclosing a communication from the Rev. Joseph Schindler, teacher of the Clayoquot Indian Day School, in further reference to his application for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will grant him the $100.00 increase previously asked for on the understanding that he will, as stated in his letter, engage his sister as his assistant in the school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. A. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\nMakawis, B.C.\nNov. 20, 1914.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I have engaged my sister, Miss Victoria Schindler, to assist me in the school work. She teaches penmanship regularly to all the pupils and has charge of the primary English class. On days when I myself am unable to teach on account of missionary duties she supplies my work also in the other classes.\n\nHoping this will be satisfactory to the Department, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nReceived\nNov 28 1914\nAlberni, B.C.\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY,\n\nAlberni, B.C., Dec. 1, 1914.\n\nSIR,\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 142095/1 of August 20, I enclose herewith letter from Rev. J. Schindler, O.F.B., of the Clayoquot Indian Day School, informing the Department that he has engaged his sister as assistant in the school work. In accordance with this change, the requisition for grant for this school, for the quarter ending December 31, will be $100.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIrregular attendance on the part of the pupils and lack of interest on the part of the parents make the teaching of an Indian day school very discouraging and disappointing work. The rate of progress is so slow that the problem looks hopeless.\n\nI am satisfied that trained teachers would make the work more interesting and attractive to the pupils. More kindergarten methods should be introduced.\n\nReport dated, June 23rd 1915.\nOttawa, July 28th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a recent report on the Clayoquot R.C. Day School, Inspector R.H. Cairns states that the attendance is very unsatisfactory. The Department trusts that you will cooperate with the teacher, Rev. J. Schindler, O.S.F., and endeavor to secure a larger attendance at this school. Kindly point out to the parents the necessity and advantage of having their children attend school regularly.\n\nInspector Gagnon also recommends that more kindergarten methods should be introduced into the school work. The Department approves of this suggestion and you will be good enough to explain the Department's wishes in this matter to the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

They expressed a desire to have you visit them and to fill the void and carry out what I felt (at the time) was surely or would have been surely, your attitude. I rashly accepted their suggestion that the school should and would be presented with a large 15 foot flag to be used on the large new pole then in course of erection.\n\nSeeing that I was practically acting as your locum tenens, I hope and trust that you will not let your substitute down and for the credit of us both will be able to implement your (sic) promise.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W.

Father Van Nevel's application for a grant of $500 to build a school house at Clayoquot I have the honor to report that if the present attendances continue a school house is urgently needed; the Indian room in the Priest's residence is far too small so that at the present time school is taught in the Church, a curtain being put up in front of the Chancel on school days. The Tribe number 266 and there are forty children of school age, the Indians expressed to me their wish & willingness to send their children to school. The average attendance for the Dec. quarter was only 10 but during the first 6 weeks the Indians were away fishing, also Father Van Nevel did not put pupils over school age on the register, as has been done in the Methodist & Presbyterian schools on this coast, which lowered his average. At the present time the average attendance is 27 and on the day I visited the School of which the Indians were notified there were 20 boys & 15 girls present; the Rev. Father has had 12 year experience teaching school at St. Louis College, Victoria. While the prospects for the School seem good during the Summer months there will be very few Indians on the Reserve and it is not likely that school can be kept open more than nine months in the year.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\nA.W.

Father desires to know if the Department will bear the expense of the gasoline consumed by his launch for a trip every day from Clayoquot to Echachis and return in order that he may hold school at the latter place.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay for the gasoline used for this purpose, which should not exceed the sum quoted by you, viz.- fifty cents per day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Guillod, Indian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOur Bishop, Right Revd. B. Orth has decided to locate permanently a Catholic Priest at Friendly Cove, Noothka Sound, and to open there at once a day school for Indian Children. I am therefore applying through you as our Indian Agent, to the Dominion Government for a grant to help us to carry on said School. At one time as you may remember, I had a grant for a School in Hosquiat, but owing to circumstances I discontinued to ask the assistance of the Govt. Now as Friendly Cove is in the District of Hosquiat, I consider that my application for a grant in this locality, is only asking the Government to renew the grant which at one time was made to Hosquiat my headquarters. I have for some time past taught school in both places, that is at Hosquiat and (Nootka) Friendly Cove without troubling the Government. I am therefore all the more confident that my application will be favorably received, and the grant accorded without delay.\n\nHoping that you will attend to this matter at once.\n\nI remain Your Obedient Servant.\n\n(sgd) A.J. Brabant\n\nR.C.P.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nKyuquot, B.C. June 23rd, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose letter received from the Rev. Father Brabasht, Roman Catholic Pioneer Missionary on this Coast, asking for the usual Government grant to a Day School in Yuquot Village, Friendly Cove Nootka. The Rev. Father has a Church and residence at this Village, and has always spent some months in each year with this tribe, and I think that his request should be granted, as the building is ready School could be opened at once.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\nYour Obedient Servant.\n(sgd) Harry Quilled\nAgent.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith for the information and consideration of the Department a copy of a letter dated the 25th instant from Mr. Agent Guilled together with a copy of the communication from the Reverend A. J. Prabrant therein referred to being an application for the usual grant for a teacher's salary for a day school at the Indian village of Yuquot, West Coast Agency.\n\nIn connection with this application which I have pleasure in recommending to the favorable consideration of the Department I may state that the applicant is one of the pioneer Roman Catholic priests attached to the West Coast of Vancouver Island and has done more towards bringing the West Coast Agency Indians from a state of barbarism to one approaching civilization than any other person that I am aware of, and partly on that account, and also because I know that if given a grant the money therefor will be made good use of I feel constrained to urge the granting of the application.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedt. Servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nEx'd.\n\nOTTAWA, 11th July, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo forwarding an application from Rev. Father Brabant, which is recommended by Mr Agent Gilliod, for the usual grant for a teacher's salary at the Indian village of Yuquot. In reply I beg to say that there are no funds available for this purpose at present.\n\nThe department would like, however, to be furnished with further information in regard to this school as there is a school at \"Kyuquot\" for a band of the same name.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nSecretary\n\nA.F. Vowell, Esq.:\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI am glad to know with the valuable and substantial assistance of your Department an Indian Industrial school was erected at Clayoquot. This institution is giving effective and gratifying assistance to the Catholic missionaries on the West Coast of Vancouver Island and the good results of its first year's assistance is a sure guarantee for its future usefulness. Its splendid success however seems to cause antagonistic efforts in others. At this time of hopeful advancement a Presbyterian Reader went about a month ago, to establish himself during a temporary absence of the Catholic missionary among the Indians of the Hootla tribe at Friendly Cove, Hootla Sound, of the North West Agency, B.C. The Chief of the Hootlas remonstrated to Mr. A.W. Vowell, Sup't of Indian Affairs, against the intrusion of the Presbyterian Reader, and I endorsed, I thought on sufficient grounds, his protest. Mr. A.W. Vowell informed me this morning that he could neither remove nor suspend the pending intrusion. I took exception to his ruling. It does not require a keen observer to say that one day's work of such an intrusion creates more harm than one year's arduous missionary work can rectify. In behalf of the poor Indians, their spiritual and temporal good, and for the sake of justice to the Indian Department, I appeal to you, Honorable Sir, for protection and a speedy adjustment. I respectfully requested Mr. A.W. Vowell to forward to your office at Ottawa the Chief's remonstrance and my endorsement with its brief explanation.\n\nI have, Honorable Sir,\n\nThe honor to be\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nB.O.F.\n\nP.S. Permit me to add that the Hootla Indians have been in charge of Catholic missionaries since the year 1874. - B.O.\nBritish Columbia.\n\n679, T.3. Indian Office.\n\nVictoria, July 5th, 1901.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Right Revd. Bishop Orth of this City called at this office today to complain that a Revd. Mr. Oswald of the Presbyterian Church had entered on the Nootka Reserve, and is engaged in clearing land thereon, with a view to permanently establishing there a Mission. I may say that no one not even a Missionary, should be allowed to enter upon a reserve without first having obtained authority for that step in the regular way. Please report if what the Bishop states is correct; and give all the particulars of the affair as far as you, of your own knowledge, are cognizant in order that the Department may be communicated with if need be. Please state the attitude of the Indians on having on that particular Reserve a missionary of any other creed than that of the Roman Catholic persuasion. If what Bishop Orth states be correct, Mr. Oswald should be informed that permission to enter upon the reserve must first of all be granted to him by the Department; and that unless he obtains such permit he must not enter upon the reserve. Please give the official name of the reserve alluded to, and the population thereof, and the religion of the Indians belonging thereto, and the number of each denomination.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\n(sgd) A.W. Vowell.\n\nper W. MacLaughlin.\n\nH. Guilled, Esq.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAlberni, B.C.\nHon. A.W. Vowell\nSupt. of Indian Affairs.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nA few weeks ago when holding an interview with the Indians of the Nootka tribe, West Coast, it was stated by the Indians that a Presbyterian Minister had come among them and that the minister had told them that he had been sent at your own suggestion, and with your personal instructions to establish himself in their midst. The Catholic Priest, as you are aware, has labored among the Indians for several years and should his methods not have proved successful and satisfactory, I venture to say that the Department, as well as the Indians themselves would have been served much better both materially and religiously, had the Priest in charge received a timely instruction to employ more effective means in bringing them under the influence of Christian civilization, than by the presence of an opposing minister. Giving due consideration to the principles of religious liberty, I am however constrained to say, owing to peculiar local circumstances and vacillating proclivities of these Indians that the presence of the minister will prove a detrimental experiment, not only from a religious but also a worldly standpoint. An impartial observer cannot but admit, upon a personal investigation of the case under consideration, the truth of what I have said. Recognizing the very grave responsibility I owe, as a citizen, to our Government for the civilization of these Indians, and impressed with the sacredness of my office regarding their eternal salvation, I endorse strongly and unreservedly the remonstrance of Chief Napoleon Aquinna enclosed. Hoping that speedy provisions will be made to remove or alleviate the impending trouble.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nHon. Sir, Yours respectfully\n(signed) B. Orth.\nEp. Of Vancouver Island.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\n\nVictoria, 11th July 1901.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 9th inst. together with enclosed communication from Chief Napoleon Maquinna, all of which came to hand this a.m. I am more than surprised at the information conveyed, the substance of which is diametrically opposed to my views on the subject. The policy of the Dept. in connection with such matters is that of non-interference, and that I should suggest and personally instruct any missionary to act contrary to these lines seems unreasonable. There must be some mistake and it may be that in conversation with someone my meaning has been transposed. I most certainly have no recollection of having ever authorized any one of my own suggestion (or any one else's) and with my personal instructions to interfere with any other missionary in the work being carried on for the Christianizing of the Indians. Had I done so the authorization would have been in writing. I enclose you a copy of my letter to the Revd. Dr. Campbell on the subject.\n\nYour Lordship's Most Obedient Servant,\n\n(sgd) A.W. Vowell\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Orth Indian Superintendent, B.C.\n\n100 Yates Street,\n\nVictoria.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office\n\nVictoria, July 11th 1901.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed this morning that some short time since a Presbyterian Minister commenced his labours, much to the disquietude of the Indians, amongst the Nootka tribe on the West Coast and that when remonstrated with against interfering with a people who had been cared for during the past several years by a Missionary of a different denomination, it being very properly urged that to do so would be unwise & not in the interests of the Indians or of religion, it was stated by the Presbyterian Missionary that he went there with my instruction & at my personal suggestion. I feel convinced that there must be some mistake as I never advise any one on such subjects, the attitude of the Department in regard to such questions being strictly that of non-interference. Should I be induced to express an opinion in reference to such matters that opinion must certainly be in accordance with my convictions which are, after many years observation, opposed to the conflict, more or less, of religious denominations amongst the untutored Native races, as such a course is more apt to confirm them in their old superstitious beliefs than to convert them to the Christian doctrines.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Chief Napoleon Maquinna in which he expresses his views on the subject, & would feel much obliged if you would kindly inform me upon what authority it was stated that the Presbyterian Minister was sent at my suggestion and with my personal instructions to establish himself in their midst.*\n\nYours Faithfully.\n\n(sgd) A.W. Vowell\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Rev'd Dr. Campbell\n277 Fort St.\nVictoria.\nRev. Dr. Campbell,\n277 Fort St.,\nFirst Presbyterian Ch.\n\nVictoria, B.C. July 15th, 1901.\n\nA.W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndn. Supt. B.C.\nVictoria.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter re Nootka came to hand a few days ago, but owing to pressure of work I was unable to acknowledge it earlier.\n\nI must say that I was very much astonished at the statement made to you on the authority of Indians at Nootka, that our Missionary said to them that he went to Nootka by your \"instructions and approval\". Our Missionaries are too intelligent to suppose it is part of your office to send out teachers to any field, and too honest to willfully state an untruth. I have no reason to believe that you knew that the Presbyterian Church had appointed a Missionary to any part of Nootka Sound, until you received the letter complaining of his presence there. I intended submitting the matter for your approval when I had all the data necessary for your information.\n\nMr. Oswald, one of the young Ministers of our church, went to Nootka only about three weeks ago, and the next boat after his arrival will not reach there until the 24th inst., so it is rather soon to make so much ado over the affair, in asking his removal.\n\nMr. Oswald went to Nootka with the instructions and approval of the Foreign Missions Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, by whom he was appointed. I may also say that I am the convener of the Foreign Missions Committee of the Synod of British Columbia, and that of the Presbytery of Victoria, in whose bounds Nootka is, and that Mr. Oswald had my approval, for he and I discussed the question when we met at the Synod in May last, and also when I saw him at Ahousaht on his way to Nootka.\n\nOur Missionary may have said that he went to Nootka, with my \"instructions and approval\", which is correct, and the Indians never probably having heard my name before, and being familiar with your name, may have confounded my name with yours; for unless distinctly pronounced they are very similar in sound: - Vowell - Campbell.\n\nThe statement alleged to have been made by our Missionary you say is not true, I believe it is not true, and I furthermore believe our missionary never made the statement. It is made on the authority of certain Indians, and evidently is believed by your informant, but are Indians always to be relied upon in statements which they make? If so what does your informant think of the following Statements.\nstatements made by the Indians to our missionary on his arrival at Nootka? He says-\"We are informed the Indians are unanimous in desiring to have a School and Teacher, but that the first Chief was afraid\".\n\n1st Because Father Brabant threatened to deprive him of his Chieftanship should he give his consent to our coming.\n\n2 To take away the cattle the Cattle he gave to Chief Maquinna(recently died)and Napoleon Maquinna succeeded.\n\n3 To allow the Indian Deprament to keep the money due him for rent of store.\" They also stated that Father Brabant said if they allowed Protestant Missionaries to come to Nootka their Children would die,and the Missionaries would stop their dances,Potlatches,&c.&c.\n\nI am scarcely prepared to believe that Father Brabant would so far forget himself as to make these threats even to the scarcely semicivilized Indians of Nootka Sound,and yet the document which Chief Napoleon Maquinna sent you last week,a copy of which you kindly sent to me,in which,inter alia,he demands that our Missionary be ordered away from Nootka,seems to indicate that at least part,if not indeed the whole,of the above is true.\n\nI forwarded your letter to our missionary,and in due time he will speak for himself,without fear or favor.\n\nThe policy of the Presbyterian Church has always been non-interference in fields occupied by another Church. This is clear to all who know the history of our Church in relation to the Indian work in Vancouver Island.\n\nThe fact that a Roman Catholic Missionary had been in a certain tribe at one time or another is surely not sufficient reason to protest against another Church taking up work there,when for years the Roman Catholic Church practically gave up the place,abandoned the work,and neglected the Indians. This has been the case in every place where our Church has taken up work among the Indians of Vancouver Island,viz. at Alberni,Ucluelet,Ahousaht,and Dodgers Cove.\n\nOur Church was asked three years ago to send a teacher to the Indians at Nootka. She declined on the ground that she understood there was a Catholic Priest in that part of the Island. Again this year the representatives of forty families of the Nootka Indians,asked that we send them a teacher,saying that their children were not taught,their sick were neglected,and that Father Brabant was doing little or nothing for them. I and others refused at first to believe this,but on reading\"Vancouver Island and its Missions-The reminiscences of the Rev.A.J.Brabant\"-1874-1900\"recently published, I was forced to conclude that all he did in reality was to celebrate Mass and Baptize the Children. This surely cannot be regarded as educating the Indians.Probably he was doing all he could for his Church had not given him the help she should have given to do the work as it should be done,and as the Government expects it to be done.\n\nI am\nI am assured that all the Chiefs but one, and that Maquinna, wish our Missionary to remain at Nootka. Last June I myself was called on at Ahousaht by one of the Chiefs of Nootka, who said that they wanted our teacher, and if Mr. Oswald went to Nootka he would assist him to establish a School Mission, and would send his own children to the School, as Father Brabant was neglecting them. At Nootka Sound there are four tribes of Indians, extending over a large Sea coast, surely Father Brabant has not the monopoly of the whole of Nootka Sound, especially when the Indians are urgently calling for teachers from us, as the Roman Catholic Church has failed to do her duty to them.\n\nWhat is the result of Father Brabant's work at Nootka? How many of the Nootka Sound Indians can read and write? Even Chief Napoleon Maquinna, the first chief of the tribe Father Brabant claims to have educated, signed his letter of remonstrance against our Missionary with \"his mark\". You would naturally ask, why do not your Church and the R.C. Church confer about the work among the Indians, and thus avoid friction through misunderstanding? When the R.C. Church takes down the wall she has built between us and her, or at least so lowers it, that we can more easily shake hands over it, our Church will be delighted and ready to confer with our Catholic friends, and move on together in the educating and christening of the Indians.\n\nThe aim of the Presbyterian Church is not to embarrass any other church, but to help to raise the Indians to the level of a civilized, educated and christianized community.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(sgd) J. Campbell.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to my letter to you of the 5th instant, No. 679, T.3., on the subject of the trespass being committed by the Rev. Mr. Oswald on the Nootka Indian Reserve, I have the honor to again draw your attention to the fact that no one, other than an Indian of the band or an official of this Department, has a right to enter upon an Indian Reserve without first having obtained authority for the step from the Department. In the instance under consideration I received from you absolutely no intimation of the residence on the Nootka Reserve of Mr. Oswald, and such laxity on your part in permitting his entry and subsequent residence thereon is certainly deserving of the severest censure. I repeat that no person has the right to enter upon a reserve, be he a trader, hunter, miner or missionary etc., without first having received a permit for so doing, and unless he has such a permit he is to be regarded as a trespasser and dealt with accordingly. I may add that this is not the first time that I have had occasion to write to you with reference to the subject of trespass committed by outsiders on Indian Reserves in your Agency, and I trust that this will be the last time that such complaints as that of His Lordship Bishop Orth's will be brought to my notice or steps will have to be taken to procure the services of a person acting for the Department who will endeavor to carry out its regulations. This matter is all the more regrettable in view of the fact that no intimation reached me from you as to the trespass in question.\n\nH.

Sir,\n\nThe undersigned present Chief of the Nootka tribe, West Coast, B.C. respectfully protests against the arrival and doings of a Presbyterian Minister among his people. There was peace among us when the Catholic Priest alone attended to us, but now since the arrival of the minister there is discord on the increase. For the sake of peace I ask that this minister be instructed by you to leave the reserve of my people.\n\nNapoleon Maquinna X\nhis mark.\n\nJohn Enos.\nMichael O'Dea.\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on the 5th inst., Bishop Orth (R.O.) reported to this office that the Rev'd Mr. Oswald, of the Presbyterian Missionary Society, had entered upon the Nootka Indian Reserve & had commenced to permanently establish a Mission there, etc., to which he objected on the grounds that one of his (R.O.) missionaries had been already there established, etc. Upon receipt of this information a letter was at once written to Mr. Agen Guillod instructing him to report upon the matter after inquiry, etc.\n\nOn the 10th inst., I received another letter from Bishop Orth on the subject in which he informed me that he heard that the Presbyterian Missionary had gone to Nootka at my suggestion & under my instructions, etc., which was not so. I wrote to his Lordship on the 11th inst. so informing him & also telling him that I had written to the Rev'd Dr. Campbell who I felt sure had no desire to create trouble. On the forenoon of the 15th Bishop Orth called at the Indian office & insisted that Mr. Oswald should be peremptorily ordered off and ejected forthwith. I informed his Lordship that I did not feel justified in resorting to such harsh measures & that I felt sure that everything would come right in the end. He got quite excited & threatened to do this & that when I told him that if he was not satisfied with my action in the matter he was at perfect liberty to apply to the Dept. at Ottawa, etc., with a view to make everything clear to the Department, I forward\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nforward herewith copies of the following letters,-\nSupt.'s letter to In.Agent,5th inst.678T/3;\nBishop Orth's letter to In.Supt.9th inst.;\nIn.

Agt.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor a number of years the Indians of Nootka have been desirous that the Presbyterian Church in Canada should send them a teacher, and at the solicitation of about forty families made early last spring, we contemplate to begin work there, and the Foreign Missions Committee of the general Assembly of our Church appointed the Rev. Thos Oswald a very suitable young Minister of the Presbyterian Church to go to Nootka and look into the situation there. Mr. Oswald went there four weeks ago, accompanied by an experienced Teacher among the Ahousahts, to assist him more reliably to decide what would be best in the circumstances to do. They strongly recommend that a School be permanently established, and name the Iatt-sahts as the tribe among which our church should open a School. The Indians set apart a site on the Reservation for a School house. He is now awaiting your permission to locate there, build a School house and teach the Indians and their children. As there is only a monthly boat, and consequently a monthly mail to Nootka, and rather than be idle a whole month, he has been teaching the children to read, pending permission by the mail which leaves here on the 29th instant tomorrow, which is the first mail to Nootka since his arrival there.\n\nTherefore I hereby on behalf of the Presbyterian Church in Canada make application to you for permission in accordance with the regulations governing the Indian Work, for the Rev. Thos. Oswald to locate at Nootka, build a School house on the Reservation, and teach the Indians there.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) J. Campbell.\nConvr. F.M.

Mr. Oswald, our missionary at Nootka, in which you say you were informed that when Mr. Oswald was remonstrated with for being at Nootka, he stated \"he went there with your instructions, and at your personal suggestion,\" you say, \"you never advise any one on such subjects\" and request to be informed upon what authority the above statement was made? Mr. Oswald writes me:\n\n1. I have never to my knowledge seen Mr. Vowell.\n2. I have never received any written instructions from Mr. Vowell.\n3. I did not at any time, or to any man make such a statement.\n4. The truth is not in the man who fabricated that statement.\n\nIn the light of the above I need add nothing to what I stated in a former communication in this behalf, than that it is clear to me that the statement was made not by our missionary, but by the parties interested in having your sympathy with them and against our missionary, that you might order him away from Nootka, for with the statement came to you a peremptory demand from Bishop Orth, that you order Mr. Oswald off the Reserve as a trespasser.\n\nYou say in your of the 10th ult. that my application on behalf of Mr. Oswald for \"permission to enter on the Indian Reserve at Nootka,\" &c., \"should come through the Indian Agent.\" I beg to say that Mr. Oswald made the request to the Indian Department through Mr. Guillo in a letter he handed to him when he was at Nootka on the 3rd. ult. and which Mr. Guillo acknowledged on the 22nd. ult.\n\nI was not aware when you complained to me that you had not been notified of the intention of our church to begin a School at Nootka, nor when I sent you the application on behalf of our Church re Nootka, that Mr. Oswald had communicated with the Indian Department through Mr. Guillo i.e. did the very thing you say should have been done by us.\n\nI remain, Yours Truly,\n\n(sgd) J.

No. 176 U/3 I have now the honour to inclose copy of a letter dated 15th inst. today received from the Rev'd Dr. Campbell explaining more fully the situation. I also inclose copy of Mr. Oswald's letter referred to by Dr. Campbell wherein it will be seen that he did not ask for permission but merely notified the Dept. that he had opened a day school at the reserve. I have called Dr. Campbell's attention to the fact.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, Sept. 6th 1901.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 18th of last July, No. 218, U. 3., on the subject of the entry made on the reserve at Nootka by the Rev. Thomas Oswald without the sanction of the Department therefor I have the honor to state for your information that in a communication to-day received from Mr. Agent Guillod the information is conveyed that Mr. Oswald intended leaving the reserve on the 26th ultimo in time to board the regular steamer for Victoria. It is said that Mr. Oswald has decided to discontinue missionary work on the Nootka reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt. Servant,\n\nA. Willowell\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nUcluelet, B.C. August 29/1901.\n\nRE WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nA couple of months ago, the Reverend Thomas Oswald, under appointment of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, proceeded to Nootka Sound with the purpose of establishing a mission in that locality.\n\nIndians from various tribes in that sound had, for years, been requesting a Protestant teacher and a school, but until his arrival and survey of the field Mr. Oswald did not know which of the four tribes would be finally selected. In company with Mr. J.W. Russell, of Ahousaht, an experienced missionary, Mr. Oswald visited the various tribes, receiving invitations from the two largest to remain and open a school. Of these, the Cow-ach-ants, at Friendly Cove, seemed to be in the worst plight and his decision was to give them the preference.\n\nThere was, at Friendly Cove, a Roman Catholic Church, but the Indians claimed that the priest visited them but seldom\u2014not oftener than once or twice a year\u2014and that they had never had a regular school. These Indians are said to be generally illiterate. One of their number admitted to me, not long since, that they were a tribe of drunkards and gamblers. They are also much diseased in body and are utterly ignorant and superstitious. The Roman Catholics have apparently no control over the people, except through the first chief, who, for special reasons, as he has alleged on different occasions, favors that church.\n\nAs soon as the Roman Catholics learned of Mr. Oswald's intention to begin work at Friendly Cove, they at once took steps to prevent it. They started a school, applied to your Department for the usual school grant, and then approached the Department's office at Victoria in an effort to get Mr. Oswald ordered off the reserve.\n\nAs a result of this effort, I have a letter from Mr. Agent Guillod, of Alberni, dated August 8th inst., in which he says he is to notify Mr. Oswald that he is a trespasser on the Indian reservation at Friendly Cove.\n\nUpon being asked the cause for so extraordinary an action as stigmatizing a missionary of the Presbyterian Church a \"trespasser\" on an Indian reservation, Mr. Guillod quotes from the Indian Act, \"No person shall settle, reside, occupy or use any land without the license of the Superintendent General.\"\n\nReferring to this matter, may I be permitted to point out:\n\n1. The Rev. Mr. Oswald was not \"settling, residing (upon) or occupying Indian lands in the ordinary sense of a 'trespasser.' He was asked by the Indians to remain with them and teach their children. As the Indian village occupies the only cleared land in the vicinity, the surroundings being rock, forest and water, in order to comply with the request, Mr. Oswald was obliged to secure temporarily a small house on the reserve until permission could be obtained from your Department to erect a suitable building.\n\n2. The procedure followed by Mr. Oswald in this matter was the customary method in the past on the coast, and this is, so far as I am aware, the first instance of a Christian missionary having been ordered off a reservation as though he were there for some personal or evil purpose.\n3.- Not only has it been the custom, in the past, to permit missionaries freely to preach the gospel to the Indians on this coast, but considerable leniency has been shown towards men who were on Indian reservations for other purposes than the welfare of the Indians.\n\nI have personally known a white man of immoral repute to be on an Indian reservation almost within sight of the Agent's residence, and he was not molested until I objected (on moral grounds) to his presence. Even then, the Agent would not assume the odium of ordering him off himself, but sent a note to the constable saying that Mr. S. had complained, etc.\n\nWhen the Ste. Cleveland went ashore in Barclay Sound, and a white man, who was married to an Indian woman, was seriously complicated with the Indians in looting the cargo, your Agent evidently considered the presence of this man on the reservation as a matter of course.\n\nAt another time, a man came to me and asked permission to remain on a reservation, claiming that the Agent would not interfere with him so long as I was satisfied. The store-keeper at Ohiaht remained on the reserve for years without having been ordered off, and it is difficult to understand why such a notice should have been sent to Mr. Oswald, except on the assumption that action was taken at the request of the Roman Catholic Bishop.\n\n4.- Whilst we have no quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church, and believe that body to be entitled to the same consideration as any other, I desire to protest against its claim of special privilege in the natives of this coast being recognized by your Department's officials.\n\nYour Department's Agent lays considerable stress upon the fact that the Roman Catholic priests have been on this coast for twenty-five years, have built several churches and baptized many children. And, in his reports (see p. 423 of No. 14-1900, An. Rep. Dep. of Ind. Affairs), he gives credit to the Roman Catholics of 560 converts out of a total of 2,421.\n\nBut, at the risk of being tedious, I desire to say -\n\n(1) The Roman Catholics have not educated the Indians. Though they have been here so long, and have not been hampered by the stringent conditions regarding education enforced since the arrival of the Protestants, during my residence of over seven years among the Indians I have not seen one Indian who has been taught by the priests to read and write.\n\nNor would the Roman Catholics, even now, have been interested in educating the natives but for the fear Indian children might come under the influence of the Protestant schools. In the published Memoirs of the Rev. Father Erabant (Heshquah) he plainly states that the boarding school at Nisqually (which is subsidized by your Department) became necessary in order to save the Indian children from being educated by the Protestants.\n\n(2) In reference to the moral improvement of the Indians, the position is much the same.\n\nOf the buildings erected, those at Alberni, Ohiaht and Ahousaht have been abandoned, whilst that at Friendly Cove (from which Mr. Oswald is now ordered away) was only occasionally used until it was learned the Presbyterian Church contemplated beginning work in Nootka Sound.\n\nThe Indians, as a whole, do not show evidence of twenty-five years of Christian work. Except perhaps, at Heshquah, they are still practically heathen. They follow their old customs, practicing oomimitch and witchcraft and giving \"potlatches\" whilst their indulgence in drinking and gambling has not been materially checked by the prayers.\nNor is it likely the Roman Catholic Church would make a serious effort to put down these evils, in which the priests themselves indulge. For proof of this statement I beg to again refer to Father Frabant's Memoirs and to say that I have myself witnessed a Roman Catholic priest, the Indian Agent and two others engaging in a friendly game of cards, with a decanter of liquor on the table between them.\n\nNor is it simply in the evils of drinking and card playing that the influence of the priests has been on the wrong side. Apparently with the object of turning the natives against the Protestants, a Roman Catholic priest is said to have warned the Indians, on different occasions, that the Protestants or \"Just Now\" missionaries (as the Protestants have been named by the priests in ridicule) were seeking to put down potlatching, which is not only an ancient custom, but against which laws have been enacted by the Parliament of Canada!\n\nFor your information, I may say, the priest who thus encourages the Indians to break the laws of the land rather than permit the Protestants to secure an influence over them, is the one who has been on the coast for so many years, and who has so far won the admiration of your Department's Agent\u2014the Reverend Father Embleton\u2014of Hesquiat, at whose instigation Mr. Oswald is now being ordered off a reservation in Nootka Sound.\n\nBy further reference to Father Frabant's Memoirs, you may ascertain how so many Indian children were baptized by the Roman Catholics, and the basis of your Agent's report giving that church nearly a thousand converts on this coast. With such a system of counting converts the marvel is that any pagans are reported!\n\nI have no doubt these reports have, at least to some extent, misled your Department as to the position of the Roman Catholics on this coast, and, unless they have been since altered, I would respectfully suggest an enquiry into the matter, and that a proper method be adopted of securing such information.\n\n5.\u2014Regarding the demand of your Department's Office at Victoria, that application be made for permission to reside on an Indian Reservation before any step is taken to open mission work, I may say, if this is insisted upon, it will place a serious barrier in the way of Protestant effort on this coast.\n\nMen are not always available for mission work, and should application be made before the missionary is secured, the Church runs a risk of being unable to meet its engagement with the Indians. If application is made after a missionary is secured the delay may cause the loss of the missionary, who cannot be expected to wait for months until your Agent is able to interview the Indians, whose decision, in the absence of the missionary, is likely to be influenced by the Roman Catholic priests, who have free access to all the reservations and have only to impress the head chief in order to make their influence felt in the tribe.\n\nUnder these circumstances,\u2014with which I feel certain you have not been made familiar,\u2014I would respectfully suggest that instructions be given your Department's officials on this coast so to interpret the rules of your Department as to permit Protestant missionaries some latitude in their endeavor to preach the gospel to the Indians.\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\n(Over.)\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Stewart\n\nMissionary\nP.S. I have just received a letter from Mr. Oswald, in which he says:\n\n\"In an official letter to me Mr. Guilloch has asked me to leave the reserve until permission to reside thereon has been granted by the Department. ...... I am obeying his intimation.\n\nWhen I explain that official permission cannot be expected for some months, the Indian man being nearly all absent on the F.Sa sealing cruise, you will understand the hardship of this peremptory order, a hardship that is fully understood by the Indian Agent to whom, both verbally and in writing, I protested against the issuance of such an order.\"\nTo the Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nRe WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a letter written by your Department's Agent confirming my statement that your Department's officials here admit the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to a special propriety in the natives on this coast.\n\nAhousaht was occupied by the Roman Catholics many years ago for a short time. For one term - I think it was the Winter of 1889-90 - they conducted a school, and then they practically abandoned the place. About five years afterwards, the Presbyterians opened a school and work has been carried on by that Church ever since. The Indian children have been taught to read and write, and the tribe, as a whole, has been much improved.\n\nNow, the priests are endeavoring to take the little girls away from the Protestant school and have them transferred to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Claoquah.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, this evil would be rectified by reference to the Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Victoria; but when it is understood that this official admits the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to the whole West Coast, and has, only a few days ago, at the instigation of the Roman Catholic Bishop, and without interviewing the Indians, ordered a Protestant minister off a reservation, as a 'trespasser', you may realize that we, Protestant missionaries, tremble for the safety of our work.\n\nI feel sure it is the wish of your Department to encourage the education of the natives, and that you will, as soon as you investigate this position of affairs on this coast, give the Protestants, who have been the means of securing to the Indians the opportunity to obtain an\neducation, at least equal rights with the Roman Catholic Church, which is proven by its twenty five years of unfruitful occupation of this coast to be incapable of elevating the Indian.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYours obediently,\nM. Swartout\n\nFollowing is copy of letter referred to:\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY, Alberni, B.C. August 31, 1901.\n\nDear Mr. Russell:\n\nWith reference to Columbia Swan I am writing to the Rev. Father Maurus on the matter and as soon as I receive his answer will offer the question to Mr. Noyell, sending him a copy of your letter, as the subject of receiving into schools children of other denominations than the school management is a matter for the Superintendent's decision.\n\nWith reference to Father Maurus visiting Ahousaht, or any other Reserve, to select children for his School, I consider that the Department would rule that he is in order and if the Roman Catholics decided to recommence work in Ahousaht they would not be considered trespassers having worked in that tribe in former years.\n\nI remain,\nYours very Truly,\nHarry Guillod,\nAgent.\n\nJno. W. Russell, Esq.\nAhousaht.\nTo the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nRE WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nOn the 25th of August last I addressed a communication to you stating that one of our missionaries had been, at the request of the Roman Catholic Bishop, and without interviewing the Indians, ordered off a reserve as a \"trespasser.\"\n\nOn Sept. 5th, I again wrote, quoting from a letter of your Department's Agent, in which he expresses the opinion that the Roman Catholics have a right to go anywhere on the coast, and to reopen stations long abandoned by them and held by us.\n\nI also referred to the fact that Roman Catholic priests were endeavoring to take children from our Ahousaht Day school to their Claoquah Boarding school. Our missionary at Ahousaht appealed to Mr. Superintendent Vowell, Victoria, against this, enclosing declarations by parents that they were Protestants, and giving explanations as to the unfair method by which parents' signatures had been secured.\n\nMr. Vowell's decision - as anticipated by me in my letter of Sept. 5th - was adverse to us. Further, Mr. Vowell, in his reply, lays down the rule that \"any difference that may arise as to the retention or discharge of this or any other pupil, or pupils, regularly admitted, should be settled between the school authorities and the parents themselves.\"\n\nThat is, - as I interpret this rule, -\n\n1.- We are not to assist parents of Indian children even though (as is claimed in one of the Ahousaht cases) their consent to the removal of children has been obtained by misrepresentation. And\n\n2.- Indians are recognised as having the right of choice of school without interference of priest or minister.\n\nIf the first position is maintained, then our Indians are without\ntators in any dispute that may arise between them and the Roman Catholic priests.\n\nIf the second position is maintained, why was our missionary ordered off the reserve at Mow-ach-aht at the request of the Roman Catholic Bishop?\n\nI again repeat, my complaint is not against the Roman Catholic Church, for which I have always maintained a friendly feeling, but I respectfully petition that your officials on this coast be instructed either to refrain from all interference in our work, or else permit us the exercise of the same rights as those enjoyed by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th November, 1901:\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nThe correspondence hereto attached relates to the opening of a day school by the Rev. Thos. Oswald at Nootka in the West Coast Agency without the authority of the Department. This correspondence contains copies of letters from His Lordship Bishop Orth, Roman Catholic Bishop of Vancouver Island; Rev. D. Campbell, Convener of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church; Rev. A. J. Brabant, Roman Catholic missionary at Kyuquot; Mr. Supt. Vowell; Mr. Agent Guillod and the Rev. Mr Swartout, Presbyterian missionary at Ucluelet.\n\nFrom a careful perusal of this correspondence I find that Mr. Oswald, after being authorized by his superior, proceeded to Nootka and opened a school as above stated. Bishop Orth objected to this on the grounds that a Roman Catholic priest had ministered to these Indians for a number of years to their satisfaction and enclosed a letter from Chief Enos protesting against the doings of the Presbyterian minister and his people.\n\nThe census returns of the Department show that the Christian Indians in this district are Catholics. If the Roman Catholic missionaries have not been successful it is more owing to their lack of opportunity than to their want of zeal for they entered the missionary field many years ago when they had everything to contend with. Mr. Campbell\nclaims that they neglected the Indians and that other denominations should be permitted to enter the missionary field claimed by the Roman Catholics and open schools and receive Government support. The Roman Catholics were willing to open a school there on the same conditions.\n\nMr Vowell called the attention of Dr Campbell to the unauthorized establishment of a mission and school by Mr Oswald, whom he considered a trespasser and to be dealt with accordingly. After Mr Oswald had established himself, Rev. Mr Campbell made a formal application to Mr Vowell for permission to locate at Nootka, build a school on the reservation and teach the Indians there. A similar application was made by Mr Oswald to Mr Agent Guilled.\n\nMr Vowell, when forwarding a copy of Dr Campbell's application, stated that he had asked Mr Agent Guilled for a full report, which, when received would be immediately transmitted to the Department. Agent Guilled reported to Mr Vowell that Mr Oswald had decided to discontinue missionary work on the Nootka reserve and return to Victoria.\n\nRev. Mr Swartout is the last to take part in this controversy and he claims that Rev. Mr Oswald was forced to leave, having been ordered off the reserve as a trespasser at the request of the Roman Catholic Bishop. This may be the case although the correspondence does not prove it. However, Mr Vowell, in writing to Agent Guilled under date of 15th July last in regard to this matter previous to Dr Campbell's application, says that no person has the right to enter upon a reserve, be he hunter, trader, miner or missionary, etc., without first having received\na permit for so doing and unless he has such permit\nhe is to be regarded as a trespasser and dealt with\naccordingly.\n\nIt has been the practice of the Department\nnot to encourage two or more religious denominations\nto enter upon missionary work even among pagan Indians\nwithin certain areas, and to discountenance the\nproselytizing of professing Christian Indians.\n\nThe census returns for the West Coast\nAgency show the Indian population to be made up of\n\n326 Presbyterians\n180 Methodists\n1005 Roman Catholics\n972 pagans\n\nTotal-2483\n\nIt was to protect some of these 1005 Roman\nCatholic Indians from the Proselytizing influences\nof Rev. Mr Oswald that Bishop Orth made his protest.\n\nThe Presbyterians allege that by their\nneglect the Roman Catholics have forfeited any\nclaims they may have had to the number of Roman\nCatholic adherents shown above and that the former\nshould be permitted to preach the gospel to the\nIndians.\n\nThe Department has, hitherto placed no re-\nstrictions upon religious bodies carrying on mis-\nsionary work among our Indians so long as they\nconfine their operations to certain localities, but\nunfortunately they are usually averse to doing so.\nMr Vowell, in expressing his views on this subject to\nDr Campbell, wrote as follows:\u2014\"Should I be induced\nto express an opinion in reference to such matters,\nthat opinion must certainly be in accordance with my\n\"convictions which are after many years observation,\n\"opposed to the conflict more or less of religious\n\"denominations amongst the untutored native races,\n\"as such a course is more apt to confirm them in\n\"their old superstitious beliefs than to convert\n\"them to the Christian doctrine\". These are the\nsentiments of most careful students of the Indian\nproblem as applied to religion.\n\nThe Rev. Mr Swartout, writing on this sub-\nject makes charges reflecting on the Agent and Roman\nCatholic missionary which should, I think, be submit-\nted to Mr Supt. Vowell for enquiry and report, although\nsuch charges are likely to lead to recrimination and\nbad feeling. He also refers to other matters which\ndo not bear upon the case in point but require spe-\ncial report.\n\nThe questions to be decided by the De-\npartment are whether any religious denomination should\nbe allowed to enter a reserve or district already\nministered to by a denomination professing a differ-\nent doctrine or belief without the permission of the\nDepartment first being obtained, and whether it would\nbe wise policy to grant such permission.\n\nThe Presbyterians take exception to the\ngeneral mode of procedure adopted by the Church of\nRome in converting and Christianising the Indians.\nThe Department can hardly be expected to decide\nwhat constitutes Christian religious\nbelief among these people. The difference of opinion\namong men on the most important questions of human\nlife is sufficient evidence that the mind of man is\nvery easily led astray in matters of opinion, but\nwhatever difference of opinion there may be among\nChristians there should be but one sentiment of love\nand good-will among those who strive to follow the example of Christ rather than their own passions.\n\nThe claim made by the Roman Catholics to include all Indians who have been baptized by their missionaries as members of their Church is based upon the significance attached by them to this rite. Baptism was adopted as an initiatory rite by the Christian Church and in the Church of Rome it is exalted into one of her sacraments and she holds that baptism avails not only for the remission and removal of sin but also for the inward sanctification of the soul and anathematises those who teach that baptism is a matter of indifference and not necessary to salvation and who deny the propriety efficiency or necessity of infant baptism.\n\n[Signature]\nUcluelet 50 miles from Alberni\nDodgers Cove 12...

General,\n\nWith regard to Mr. Benson's memo., under, and the correspondence hereto attached, which relate to a dispute between the Presbyterians and the Roman Catholics as to the right of the former to open a day school at Nootka, in the West Coast Agency of B.C., I beg to state that since 1890 the rule followed by the Department has been that when a religious body desired to establish a mission on a reserve they should obtain the consent of the Indians and the sanction of the Department. This rule was set aside by you in 1900 when the Roman Catholics desired to erect a church on the White Fish Lake Indian Reserve, in the North West Territories. It appears from the correspondence that the Rev. Mr. Oswald opened a day school on the Nootka Reserve on the 25th of June last, and on the 3rd of July advised Mr. Agent Guillod that he had done so, and applied to be furnished with blank quarterly school returns. The day before he opened the school the Rev. A.J. Brabant, who is described as the Roman Catholic pioneer missionary on the West Coast, applied to the Agent for a grant to carry on a school at Nootka as it had been decided to permanently locate a Roman Catholic priest at Friendly Cove, Nootka Sound.\n\nWhilst the Presbyterians, no doubt, are justified in questioning the right of the Roman Catholics to blanket a large territory for missionary purposes, still their case would have been much stronger if they had obtained the sanction of Mr. Superintendent Vowell before sending the Rev. Mr. Oswald.\nOswald to Nootka. It appears from Mr. Vowell's letter of the 6th September that owing to his remonstrance Mr. Oswald has decided to discontinue work on the reserve.\n\nThe following will show the day and boarding schools conducted by the two bodies in the West Coast Agency:\n\nDay Schools\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n1.

Vowell was advised as follows as to the discharge of Roman Catholics from Protestant schools and Protestants from Roman Catholic schools:\n\n\"I am directed by the Superintendent General to inform you that Section 14 of the Regulations respecting the education of Indian children, which reads as follows:\u2014\n\n'Notwithstanding anything in these regulations contained, no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic school or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices; and no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a Protestant school or in a school conducted under Protestant auspices.'\n\nmust be followed by the Department, and it will insist that all schools receiving Government aid shall abide by this Regulation, and any Protestant children in Roman Catholic schools and Roman Catholic children in Protestant schools are to be discharged. The Department wishes you to see that these instructions are carried out. In case, however, of a dispute as to the religion of a child, you are authorised to decide the question.

The Indian children have been taught to read and write, and the tribe, as a whole, has been much improved.\n\nNow, the priests are endeavouring to take away the little girls from the Protestant school and have them transferred to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Claoquaht.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, this evil would be rectified by reference to the Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Victoria; but when it is understood that this official admits the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to the whole West Coast, and has, only a few days ago, at the instigation of the Roman Catholic Bishop, and without interviewing the Indians, ordered a Protestant Minister off a reservation, as a \"trespasser\" you may realize that we, Protestant missionaries, tremble for the safety of our work.\n\nI feel sure it is the wish of your Department to encourage the education of the natives, and that you will, as soon as you investigate the position of affairs on this coast, give the Protestants\nProtestants, who have been the means of securing to the Indians the opportunity to obtain an education, at least equal rights with the Roman Catholic Church, which has proven by its twenty-five years of unfruitful occupation of this coast to be incapable of elevating the Indian.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSd. M. Swartoub.\n\nFollowing is copy of letter referred to:\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY,\nAlberni, B.C. August 31/1901.\n\nDear Mr. Russell,\n\nWith reference to Columbia Swan I am writing to the Rev. Father Maurus on the matter and as soon as I receive his answer will refer the question to Mr. Vowell, sending him a copy of your letter, as the subject of receiving into schools of children of other denominations than the school management is a matter for the Superintendent's decision.\n\nWith reference to Father Maurus visiting Ahousaht or any other Reserve, to select children for his school, I consider that the Department would rule that he is in order, and if the Roman Catholics decided to recommence work in Ahousaht they would not be considered trespassers having worked in that tribe in former years.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Harry Cuilled,\n\nAgent.\n\nJno. W. Russell, Esq.,\nAhousaht.\"\nUcluelet, B.C. August 29/1901.\n\nSir,\n\nRe West Coast Vancouver Island:\n\nA couple of months ago, the Reverend Thomas Oswald, under appointment of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, proceeded to Nootka Sound with the purpose of establishing a mission in that locality.\n\nIndians from the various tribes in that sound had, for years, been requesting a Protestant teacher and a school, but until his arrival and survey of the field, Mr. Oswald did not know which of the four tribes would be finally selected. In company with Mr. J.W. Russell, of Ahousaht, an experienced missionary, Mr. Oswald visited the various tribes, receiving an invitation from the two largest to remain and open a school. Of these, the Mow-ach-ahts, at Friendly Cove, seemed to be in the worst plight, and his decision was to give them the preference.\n\nThere was at Friendly Cove a Roman Catholic Church, but the Indians claimed that the priest visited them but seldom\u2014not oftener than once or twice a year\u2014and that they had never had a regular school. These Indians are said to be fearfully debauched. One of their number admitted to me, not long since, that they were a tribe of drunkards and gamblers. They are also much diseased in body and are utterly ignorant and superstitious. The Roman Catholics have apparently no control over the people, except through the first chief, who, for special reasons, as he has alleged on different occasions, favours that church.\n\nAs soon as the Roman Catholics learned of Mr. Oswald's intention to begin work at Friendly Cove, they at once took steps to prevent it. They started a school, applied to your Department for the usual school grant, and then approached the Department's Office at Victoria in an effort to get Mr. Oswald ordered off the reserve.\n\nAs a result of this effort, I have a letter from Mr. Agent Guillo, of Alberni, dated August 8th inst., in which he says\nHe is to notify Mr. Oswald that he is a \"trespasser\" on the Indian Reservation at Friendly Cove.\n\nUpon being asked the cause for so extraordinary an action as stigmatizing a missionary of the Presbyterian Church a \"trespasser\" on an Indian Reservation, Mr. Guilled quotes from the Indian Act, - \"No person shall settle, reside ......... occupy or use any land...... without the license of the Superintendent General.\"\n\nReferring to this matter, may I be permitted to point out:\n\n1. The Rev. Mr. Oswald was not \"settling, residing (upon) or occupying Indian lands in the ordinary sense of a \"trespasser. He was asked by the Indians to remain with them and teach their children. As the Indian village occupies the only cleared land in the vicinity, the surroundings being rock, forest and water, in order to comply with the request, Mr. Oswald was obliged to secure temporarily a small house on the reserve until permission could be obtained from your Department to erect a suitable building.\n\n2. The procedure followed by Mr. Oswald in this matter was the customary method in the past on the coast, and this is, so far as I am aware, the first instance of a Christian missionary having been ordered off a reservation as though he were there for some personal or evil purpose.\n\n3. Not only has it been the custom in the past to permit missionaries freely to preach the gospel to the Indians on this coast, but considerable leniency has been shewn towards men who were on Indian reservations for other purposes than the welfare of the Indians.\n\nI have personally known a white man of evil repute to be on an Indian reservation almost within sight of the Agent's residence, and he was not molested until I objected (on moral grounds) to his presence. Even then the Agent would not assume the idiom of ordering him off himself, but sent a note to the constable saying that \"Mr. S. ......... had complained &c.\n\nWhen\nWhen the Str. Cleveland went ashore in Barclay Sound, and a white man, who was married to an Indian woman, was seriously complicated with the Indians in looting the cargo, your Agent evidently considered the presence of this man on the reservation as a matter of course.\n\nAt another time, a man came to me and asked permission to remain on a reservation, claiming that the Agent would not interfere with him so long as I was satisfied. The storekeeper at Chiaht remained on the reserve for years without having been ordered off, and it is difficult to understand why such a notice should have been sent to Mr. Oswald, except on the assumption that action was taken at the request of the Roman Catholic Bishop.\n\n4. Whilst we have no quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church, and believe that body to be entitled to the same consideration as any other, I desire to protest against its claim of special propriety in the natives of this coast being recognized by your Department's officials.\n\nYour Department's Agent lays considerable stress upon the fact that the Roman Catholic priests have been on this coast for twenty-five years have built several churches and baptized many children. And in his reports (See p. 433 of No.14-1900, An. Rep. of Ind. Affairs) he gives credit to the Roman Catholics of 969 converts out of a total of 27,491.\n\nBut at the risk of being tedious, I desire to say -\n\n(1) The Roman Catholics have not educated the Indians. Though they have been here so long, and have not been hampered by the stringent conditions regarding education enforced since the arrival of the Protestants, during my residence of over seven years among the Indians I have not met one Indian who has been taught by the priests to read and write.\n\nNor would the Roman Catholics, even now, have been interested in educating the natives but for the fear Indian children might come under the influence of the Protestant schools. In the\nPublished Memoirs of the Rev. Father Brabant (Hoshquaht) he plainly states that the boarding school at Claoquaght (which is subsidized by your Department) became necessary in order to save the Indian children from being educated by the Protestants.\n\n(2) In reference to the moral improvement of the Indians, the position is much the same.\n\nOf the buildings erected, those at Alberni, Ohiacht and Ahousaht have been abandoned, whilst that at Friendly Cove (from which Mr. Oswald is now ordered away) was only occasionally used until it was learned the Presbyterian Church contemplated beginning work in Nootka Sound.\n\nThe Indians as a whole do not show evidence of twenty-five years of Christian work. Except perhaps at Hoshquaht, they are still practically heathen. They follow their old customs, practicing oos-im-itch and witchcraft and giving \"potlatches,\" whilst their indulgence in drinking and gambling has not been materially checked by the priests.\n\nNor is it likely the Roman Catholic Church would make a serious effort to put down these evils in which the priests themselves indulge. For proof of this statement, I beg to again refer to Father Brabant's Memoirs and to say that I have myself witnessed a Roman Catholic priest the Indian Agent and two others engaging in a friendly game of cards, with a decanter of liquor on the table between them.\n\nNor is it simply in the evils of drinking and card playing that the influence of the priests has been on the wrong side.\n\nApparently with the object of turning the natives against the Protestants, a Roman Catholic priest is said to have warned the Indians on different occasions that the \"Christians\" or Just Now missionaries (as the Protestants have been named by the priests in ridicule) were seeking to put down \"potlatching\", which is not only a heathen custom, but against which laws have been enacted by the Parliament of Canada.\n\nFor\nFor your information, I may say, the priest who thus encourages the Indians to break the laws of the land, rather than permit the Protestants to secure an influence over them, is the one who has been on the coast for so many years and who has so won the admiration of your Department's Agent - the Rev. Father Brabant, of Heshquaht, at whose instigation Mr. Oswald is now being ordered off the reservation in Nootka Sound.\n\nBy further reference to Father Brabant's Memoirs, you may ascertain how so many Indian children were baptized by the Roman Catholics, and the basis of your Agent's report giving that Church nearly a thousand converts on this coast. With such a system of counting converts the marvel is that any pagans are reported.\n\nI have no doubt these reports have, at least to some extent, misled your Department as to the position of the Roman Catholics on this coast, and, unless they have been since altered I would respectfully suggest an enquiry into the matter, and that a proper method be adopted of securing such information.\n\n5. Regarding the demand of your Department's Office at Victoria, that application be made for permission to \"reside\" on an Indian reservation before any step is taken to open mission work, I may say if this is insisted upon, it will place a serious barrier in the way of Protestant effort on this coast.\n\nMen are not always available for mission work, and should application be made before the missionary is secured, the Church runs a risk of being unable to meet its engagement with the Indians. If application is made after a missionary is secured the delay may cause the loss of the missionary, who cannot be expected to wait for months until your Agent is able to interview the Indians, whose decision, in the absence of the missionary, is likely to be influenced by the Roman Catholic priests, who have free access to all the reservations and have only to secure the head chief in order to make their influence felt in the tribe.\nUnder these circumstances, with which I feel certain you have not been made familiar, I would respectfully suggest that instructions be given your Department's officials on this coast so to interpret the rules of your Department as to permit Protestant missionaries some latitude in their endeavour to preach the Gospel to the Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSd. M. Swartou.\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. I have just received a letter from Mr. Oswald, in which he says: \"In an official letter to me Mr. Guilloz has asked me to leave the reserve until permission to reside thereon has been granted by the Department...... I am obeying his injunction.\n\nWhen I explain that official permission cannot be expected for some months, the Indian men being nearly all absent on the B. Sea sealing cruise, you will understand the hardship of this peremptory order, a hardship that is fully understood by the Indian Agent, to whom, both verbally and in writing, I protested against the issuance of such an order.\nSir,\n\nRE WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nA couple of months ago the Reverend Thomas Oswald, under appointment of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, proceeded to Nootka Sound with the purpose of establishing a mission in that locality.\n\nIndians from various tribes in that sound had, for years, been requesting a Protestant teacher and a school, but until his arrival and survey of the field Mr. Oswald did not know which or how far north he would be first called upon. In consequence, Mr. Oswald visited the various tribes, receiving an invitation from the two largest to remain and open a school. Of these, the Nuu-chah-nulth, at Friendly Cove, seemed to be in the worst plight, and his decision was to give them the preference.\n\nThe members of Friendly Cove's Roman Catholic church, but the Indians claimed that the priest visited them but seldom, not oftener than once or twice a year\u2014and that they had never had a regular school. These Indians are said to be fearfully deluded. One of their number admitted to me, not long since, that they were a tribe of drunkards and gamblers. They are also much disfigured in body and are utterly ignorant and superstitious. The Roman Catholics have apparently no control over the people except through the few chiefs who, for special reasons, as he has alleged on different occasions, favor that church.\n\nAs soon as the Roman Catholics learned of Mr. Oswald's intention to begin work at Friendly Cove, they at once took steps to prevent it. They started a school, applied to your Department for the usual school grant, and then approached the District Agent's Office at Victoria in an effort to get Mr. Oswald ordered off the reserve.\n\nAs a result of this effort, I have a letter from Mr. Agent Guilled, of Alberni, dated August 6th, in which he says he is to notify Mr. Oswald that he is a \"trespasser\" on the Indian Reservation at Friendly Cove.\n\nUpon being asked the cause for so extraordinary an action as trespassing a missionary of the Presbyterian Church a \"trespasser\" on an Indian Reservation, Mr. Guilled quotes from the Indian Act, \"No person shall settle, reside ....... occupy or use any land ...... without the license of the Superintendent General.\"\n\nReferring to this matter, may I be permitted to point out:\n\n1. The Rev. Mr. Oswald was not \"settling, residing (upon) or occupying Indian lands in the ordinary sense of a 'trespasser.' He was asked by the Indians to remain with them and teach their children. As the Indian village occupies the only cleared land in the vicinity, the surrounding hills being covered with timber, in order to comply with the request, Mr. Oswald was obliged to secure temporarily a small house on the reserve until permission could be obtained from your Department to erect a suitable building.\n\n2. The procedure followed by Mr. Oswald in this matter was the customary method in the past of the country, and this is, so far as we are aware, the first instance of a Christian missionary having been ordered off a reservation as though he were there for some personal or evil purpose.\n\n3. Not only has it been the custom, in the past, to permit missionaries freely to preach the gospel to the Indians on this coast, but considerable missionary work has been carried on within the Indian reservations for other purposes than the welfare of the Indians.\n\nI have personally known a white man of evil repute to be on an Indian reservation almost within sight of the Agent's residence, and he was not molested until I objected (on moral grounds) to his presence. By this the Agent would not assume the right of ordering him off himself but sent a note to the constable saying that \"Mr. S----- had complained.\"\n\nWhen the Str. Cleveland went ashore in Furelay Sound, and a white man, who was married to an Indian woman, was seriously complicated with the Indians in looting the cargo, your Agent evidently considered the presence of this man on the reservation as a matter of course.\n\nAt another time, a man came to me and asked permission to remain\non a reservation, claiming that the Agent would not interfere with him so long as he was satisfied. The storekeeper at Ohsaht remained on the reserve for years without having been ordered off, and it is difficult to understand why such a notice should have been sent to Mr. Oswald, except on the assumption that action was taken at the request of the Roman Catholic priests.\n\n4. While we have no quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church and believe that they too should be treated with the same consideration as any other, I desire to protest against its claim of special authority in the natives of this coast, since it seems to have very little influence among them. The Roman Catholic priests have been here only for twenty-five years and have built several churches and hospitals near the Indians. And in his reports (see p. 183 of Vol. II, Report of Ind. Affairs) he gives credit to the Roman Catholics of 926 converts out of a total of 2,561.\n\n5. At the risk of being tedious, I desire to say:\n\n(1) The Roman Catholics have not educated the Indians. Though they have been here so long, we have not been impressed by the stringent conditions regarding education enforced since the arrival of the Protestants, during my residence of over seven years among the Indians. I have met one Indian who has been taught by the priests to read and write.\n\nNor would the Roman Catholics, even now, have been interested in educating the natives but for the fear Indian children might come under the influence of the Protestant schools. In the published \"Memoirs of the Reverend Fransant\" (Nashquah) he plainly states that the boarding school at Cloughought (which is subsidized by your Department) became necessary in order to save the Indian children from being educated by the Protestants.\n\n(2) In regard to the moral improvement of the Indians, the position is much the same.\n\nOf the buildings erected, those at Alberni, Ohsaht and Ahousaht have been abandoned, whilst that at Friendly Cove (from which Mr. Oswald is now ordered away) was only occasionally used until it was burned by the Presbyterian Church congregation beginning soon after its founding.\n\nThe Indians as a whole are still evidences of twenty-five years of Christian life. Except perhaps at Nashquah, they are still practically heathen. They follow their old customs, practicing one-in-itch and witchcraft and giving potlatches, whilst their indulgence in drinking and gambling has not been materially checked by the priests.\n\nNor is it likely the Roman Catholic Church will make any serious effort to put down these evils, in which the Indians themselves indulge. For proof of this fact, I have to again refer to Father Fransant's words and to say that I have myself witnessed a Roman Catholic priest, the Indian Agent and two others engaged in a friendly game of cards, with a decanter of liquor on the table between them.\n\nNor is it simply in the vials of drinking and card playing that the influence of the priests has been seen on the wrong side.\n\nI am convinced with an object of turning the natives against the Protestants, a Roman Catholic priest is said to have warned the Indians on different occasions that the Christians or Quakers (as the Protestants have been named by the priests in Victoria) were seeking to put down the potlatches, which is not only a heathen custom but against which laws have been enacted by the Parliament of Canada!\n\nFor your information, I may say, the priest who thus encourages the Indians to break the laws of the land, rather than permit the Protestants to secure an influence over them, is the one who has been on the coast for so many years and who has been the inspiration of your Agent at Ohsaht, the Reverend Father Fransant of Nashquah, at whose instigation Mr. Oswald is now being ordered off the reservation in Nootka Sound.\n\nBy further reference to Father Fransant's Memoirs, you may ascertain how many Indian children were baptized by the Roman Catholics and the basis of Mr. Agent's report giving that Church nearly a thousand converts on this coast.

If application is made after a missionary is assured the delay may cause the loss of the missionary who cannot be expected to wait for months until your Agent is able to interview the Indians whose good will, in the absence of the missionary, is likely to be claimed by the Roman Catholic priests, who have free access to all the reservations and have only to secure the head chief, in order to make their influence felt in the tribe.\n\nUnder these circumstances, with which I feel certain you have not been made familiar, I would respectfully suggest that instructions be given your Department's officials on this coast so to interpret the rules of your Department as to permit Protestant missionaries some latitude in their endeavor to preach the gospel to the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S.

Whilst we have no quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church, and believe that body to be entitled to the same consideration as any other, I desire to protest against its claim of special propriety in the natives of this coast being recognized by your Department's officials.\n\nYour Department's Agent lays considerable stress upon the fact that the Roman Catholic priests have been on this coast for twenty-five years have built several churches and baptized many children. And in his reports (See p. 483 of No.14-1900, An. Rep. of Ind. Affairs) he gives credit to the Roman Catholics of 969 converts out of a total of 26,481.\n\nBut at the risk of being tedious, I desire to say -\n\n(1) The Roman Catholics have not educated the Indians. Though they have been here so long, and have not been hampered by the stringent conditions regarding education enforced since the arrival of the Protestants, during my residence of over seven years among the Indians I have not met one Indian who has been taught by the priests to read and write.\n\nNor would the Roman Catholics, even now, have been interested in educating the natives but for the fear Indian children might come under the influence of the Protestant schools. In the\npublished Memoirs of the Rev. Father Brabant (Hoshquaht) he plainly states that the boarding school at Claoquaht (which is subsidized by your Department) became necessary in order to save the Indian children from being educated by the Protestants.\n\n(2) In reference to the moral improvement of the Indians, the position is much the same.\n\nOf the buildings erected, those at Alberni, Ohiaht and Ahousaht have been abandoned, whilst that at Friendly Cove (from which Mr. Oswald is now ordered away) was only occasionally used until it was learned the Presbyterian Church contemplated beginning work in Nootka Sound.\n\nThe Indians as a whole do not show evidence of twenty-five years of Christian work. Except perhaps at Hoshquaht, they are still practically heathen. They follow their old customs, practicing oos-im-itch and witchcraft and giving \"potlatches,\" whilst their indulgence in drinking and gambling has not been materially checked by the priests.\n\nNor is it likely the Roman Catholic Church would make a serious effort to put down these evils in which the priests themselves indulge. For proof of this statement, I beg to again refer to Father Brabant's Memoirs and to say that I have myself witnessed a Roman Catholic priest the Indian Agent and two others engaging in a friendly game of cards, with a decanter of liquor on the table between them.\n\nNor is it simply in the evils of drinking and card playing that the influence of the priests has been on the wrong side.\n\nApparently with the object of turning the natives against the Protestants, a Roman Catholic priest is said to have warned the Indians on different occasions that the \"Christians\" or Just Now missionaries (as the Protestants have been named by the priests in ridicule) were seeking to put down \"potlatching\", which is not only a heathen custom, but against which laws have been enacted by the Parliament of Canada.\nFor your information, I may say, the priest who thus encourages the Indians to break the laws of the land, rather than permit the Protestants to secure an influence over them, if the one who has been on the coast for so many years and who has so won the admiration of your Department's Agent - the Rev. Father Brabant, of Heshquaht, at whose instigation Mr. Oswald is now being ordered off the reservation in Nootka Sound.\n\nBy further reference to Father Brabant's Memoirs, you may ascertain how so many Indian children were baptized by the Roman Catholics, and the basis of your Agent's report giving that Church nearly a thousand converts on this coast. With such a system of counting converts the marvel is that any pagans are reported.\n\nI have no doubt these reports have, at least to some extent, misled your Department as to the position of the Roman Catholics on this coast, and, unless they have been since altered I would respectfully suggest an enquiry into the matter, and that a proper method be adopted of securing such information.\n\n5. Regarding the demand of your Department's Office at Victoria, that application be made for permission to \"reside\" on an Indian reservation before any step is taken to open mission work, I may say if this is insisted upon, it will place a serious barrier in the way of Protestant effort on this coast.\n\nMen are not always available for mission work, and should application be made before the missionary is secured, the Church runs a risk of being unable to meet its engagement with the Indians. If application is made after a missionary is secured the delay may cause the loss of the missionary, who cannot be expected to wait for months until your Agent is able to interview the Indians, whose decision, in the absence of the missionary, is likely to be influenced by the Roman Catholic priests, who have free access to all the reservations and have only to secure the head chief in order to make their influence felt in the tribe.\n\nUnder\nUnder these circumstances,- with which I feel certain you have not been made familiar, I would respectfully suggest that instructions be given your Department's officials on this coast so to interpret the rules of your Department as to permit Protestant missionaries some latitude in their endeavour to preach the Gospel to the Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nSd. M. Swartout.\n\nTo the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP.S. I have just received a letter from Mr. Oswald, in which he says: \"In an official letter to me Mr. Guillo has asked me to leave the reserve until permission to reside thereon has been granted by the Department...... I am obeying his injunction.\n\nWhen I explain that official permission cannot be expected for some months, the Indian men being nearly all absent on the B. Sea sealing cruise, you will understand the hardship of this peremptory order,- a hardship that is fully understood by the Indian Agent, to whom, both verbally and in writing, I protested against the issuance of such an order.\nTo the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nRE WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a letter written by your Department's Agent confirming my statement that your Department's officials here admit the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to a special propriety in the natives on this coast.\n\nAhousaht was occupied by the Roman Catholics many years ago for a short time. For one term - I think it was in winter of 1889-90 - they conducted a school, and then they practically abandoned the place. About five years afterwards, the Presbyterians opened a school and work has been carried on by that Church ever since. The Indian children have been taught to read and write, and the tribe, as a whole, has been much improved.\n\nNow, the priests are endeavouring to take away the little girls from the Protestant school and have them transferred to the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Claoquaht.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, this evil would be rectified by reference to the Superintendent of Indian Agencies at Victoria; but when it is understood that this official admits the claim of the Roman Catholic Church to the whole West Coast, and has, only a few days ago, at the instigation of the Roman Catholic Bishop, and without interviewing the Indians, ordered a Protestant Minister off a reservation, as a \"trespasser\" you may realize that we, Protestant missionaries, tremble for the safety of our work.\n\nI feel sure it is the wish of your Department to encourage the education of the natives, and that you will, as soon as you investigate the position of affairs on this coast, give the Protestants\nProtestants, who have been the means of securing to the Indians the opportunity to obtain an education, at least equal rights with the Roman Catholic Church, which has proven by its twenty-five years of unfruitful occupation of this coast to be incapable of elevating the Indian.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSd. M. Swartoub.\n\nFollowing is copy of letter referred to:\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY,\nAlberni, B.C. August 31/1901.\n\nDear Mr. Russell,\n\nWith reference to Columbia Swan I am writing to the Rev. Father Maurus on the matter and as soon as I receive his answer will refer the question to Mr. Vowell, sending him a copy of your letter, as the subject of receiving into schools of children of other denominations than the school management is a matter for the Superintendent's decision.\n\nWith reference to Father Maurus visiting Ahousaht or any other Reserve, to select children for his school, I consider that the Department would rule that he is in order, and if the Roman Catholics decided to recommence work in Ahousaht they would not be considered trespassers having worked in that tribe in former years.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Harry Guillod,\nAgent.\n\nJno. W. Russell, Esq.,\nAhousaht.\"\nUcluelet, B.C. Oct. 26th. 1901.\n\nR. Smith, Esq., M.P.\nNanaimo, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND:\n\nI take the liberty of enclosing copies of communications to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, regarding the action of that Department in ordering one of the Presbyterian missionaries off a reserve as a \"trespasser.\"\n\nYou will find a fairly complete statement of the circumstances in communication No. I. Mr. Oswald followed the custom in the past, and so far as I know this is the first time any objection has been taken to a temporary residence upon a reserve by a missionary. It is always understood that before buildings are erected application is to be made to the Indian Department, but even in this the rule, in the past, has tended towards leniency. But to order a missionary off a reserve, without investigating the circumstances, or permitting him to remain until the Indians could be interviewed, is, I believe, and hope, without precedent.\n\nNor is this all. The Roman Catholics, who never seriously attempted to educate the Indians before the arrival of the Protestants, have recently erected a large boarding school, and are now engaged in an effort to alienate our children from our day schools and have them transferred to their boarding school. Pressure is brought to bear upon parents, and their signatures are obtained to a document, the meaning of which they scarcely comprehend, and, later, when they do understand, there is no help for them - says Mr. Vowall - and we are forbidden to interfere.\n\nThe Indian Department, so far as the West Coast is concerned has been of little use to the natives. I have lived among the Indians for years, speak their language and know their troubles, and I know the history of the Indian Department on the coast.\n\nIn the great case of Behring Sea seizures, two crews of Indians,\nwho ought to have received at least $500.00 per man for extraordinary hardships suffered, received nothing on this account, because there was no one to represent them. The Indians did not know what was necessary to be done\u2014and that was before the days of Protestant missionaries\u2014so they suffered without recompense.\n\nWhen these Receiving Sea Seizure monies were paid, although the Indian Department claims to have endeavored to assist the Indians, yet the Dominion Government refused to recognize any heirs of deceased claimants except wives and children, in the absence of such keeping the money itself, despite the fact there were fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters who felt they had a claim to the shares of their deceased relatives. This sore is still open, having taken place only this year.\n\nWhen a crew of drunken sailors looted an Indian village in the temporary absence of the people, there was no redress. One of the culprits was caught, but was released on the most whimsical excuse that he should not be punished unless all concerned in the outrage were.\n\nWhen the somewhat celebrated case of the Ohiacht Indians vs. Schooner Victoria was in dispute officials of the Indian Department not only did not give the Indians any assistance, but their sympathies were manifestly on the side of the schooner owners who were endeavoring to avoid payment of several hundreds of dollars wages due to the Indians.\n\nAnd in all the conflicts with whiskey smugglers and other evils the Indian Department has been slow in giving material aid.\n\nI have, in fact, for the past six or seven years, been doing work that should have been done by the Indian Department, and I am, today, suffering seriously from attacks upon my character made by sympathizers of those who have been forced to respect the rights of the Indians.\n\nI may say I do not consider Mr. Guillod as the principal cause of the unsatisfactory condition of affairs. He is a kindly gentleman for whom I have always felt deep respect, as a man, but he has been altogether too weak as an official, while the system has been all wrong.\n\nIf you feel this is a case in which you can conscientiously lend your assistance, I would be very glad to have your valuable help in an\neffort not only to secure equal rights for all religious bodies working among these Indians, but also in having better administration of the Indian Department's work on this coast.\n\nI send you duplicate copies of correspondence, in case you may desire one set to Ottawa.\n\nPossibly the Superintendent General may yet reply to my letters, but I think you kindly intervention would much facilitate the matter.\n\nTrusting I am not unduly troubling you about this, I am, dear sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nNANAIMO, B.C.,\n\nNov 4 1901.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find copies of communications sent to me by a Gentleman on our west coast, will You kindly let me know what you think about it.\n\nI Am Dear Sir,\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nRead as soon as convenient.\nFriendly Cove, Nootka Sound,\n18th July, 1901.\n\nRight Rev'd dear Bishop,-\n\nThe following is an account of the arrival at Nootka of a young man representing the Presbyterian Church and of the circumstances which led to it. Let us begin with the second point:\n\nSome three years ago it was publicly known that serious difficulties and quarrels existed at the Presbyterian Home at Alberni, Bareley Sound. An investigation was made and Miss Johnson, the matron, was discharged and a married man and his wife were given charge of the Home.\n\nThis Miss Johnson, having lost her job, took the steamer and accompanied by a couple of young Indians, a boy and a girl, came to Nootka in search of a new field of labour. A number of Indians being assembled in the Chief's house she addressed them and proposed to establish a mission here. Although before so doing she had distributed to the Indians at least half a ton of articles of dress, candles, etc., etc., the Chief's reply was clear and unequivocal. He told her that she and any of her \"class were too late; that the priest had a church and a house here these many years; and that he, the Chief, and his people received all the attention they were in need of. The priest had come here\nwhen the Indians were bad, fighting and killing each other.......\n\n\"Now the Indians on the Coast were good; he could not see any use,\nin fact it would create trouble if the Indians had more than one\nguide. He did not want another \"Leflet\" - one was plenty, and he\nwould not allow any other \"Leflet\" to build on his reserve.\"\n\nMiss Johnson, expecting to get a chance to come here herself,\nmust not have reported this to the Presbyterian mission\nboard; but that board acting on her report, according to Mr. Swart-\ntout, at once tried to find a man to take charge of the Nootka In-\ndians. This man they at last secured and having him on their hands\nthey have now forced him on the Mowachat Indians.\n\nThe news of his intended arrival preceded him by several\nweeks; and Chief Maquinna, now dead, hearing of it sent a letter\nto Mr. Russell of Ahouset warning him not to send the man in ques-\ntion. However, the young missionary was to be disposed of at any\ncost.\n\nYou will remember that when you were in Hesquiot we learn-\ned the news that Russell and his men had passed off Hesquiot per\ncanoe and had been refused admittance by the Nootka Indians. This\nreport was perfectly true; for the pair having arrived late at\nnight were compelled to sleep in their canoe on the beach; and the\nfollowing day, finding that they could not even receive a hearing\nfrom the Indians, they secured a couple of men who, for a good re-\nmuneration, were to take them to Ehattisat.\" Just as they were about to leave, an Ehattisat Indian, who has the name of being very troublesome and who would not be allowed by the Indians to live here at Nootka only for his wife\u2014who is one of the \"Thee\" women of the tribe, walked down the beach and began to abuse the two Indians who were taking the missionaries away; whereupon Mr. Russell and his men accompanied this Ehattisat to the house of one of the petty Chiefs, an opposition man to the real Chief, where the opinion was expressed by a couple of young men that opposition would not be made to the presence at Nootka of the new missionary.\n\nHowever, Russell could not see his way clear, for the encouragement he was receiving amounted to very little; therefore he resolved to go to Ehattisat anyhow; but upon arriving there, finding that the Ehattisat tribe was not worth his attention, he resolved to return to Nootka.\n\nHe set to work at once to secure a suitable building for a residence of his burden, a school and church. He went from house to house, offering immense rent, but even those who he claims wanted him to stay here would not allow him to hold service in their house on the Sunday we arrived in Nootka! However, he managed to force his way into a small cabin, built by Stockham & Dewley, as a lodging-place for miners and prospectors, but since sold to a woman, known as being of very doubtful morality, and occupied by herself and her husband.\nAnd here now resides the new missionary, whose presence, to say the least, is a source of great displeasure to the young Chief and his adherents.\n\nI am told by the Indians that the day after the steamer left the young men went and began to clear land, where he intends to build, but the principal man here, after the Chief, went over to him and told him to stop; that the land belongs to the Chief and that the Chief objected to the missionary's presence here and would give him no ground to build upon!\n\nHe teaches school and has an average attendance of two and three children. The Nootkas are not a large tribe\u2014there are forty children, including newly born babies; of these about fifteen are of school age, most of whom come to my school. This is a correct statement, for I know every man, woman and child in the tribe. In a year or two quite a few will have attained the regular school age.\n\nThe young Chief, following the conduct of the old Chief, and the advice of the principal men of the tribe, is determined not to grant any land of the reserve to build upon.\n\nReally a man must be hard up for a field to exercise his zeal to come to this place of Nootka! where we have exercised the ministry since over a quarter of a century, baptized the children, and joined couples in wedlock! Where not one Indian objects\nto us on religious or other grounds! All he can do here is mischief, divide the tribe by bribing with presents and promises, bring in trouble where there was peace! I am sure that if his superiors were to know the situation they would call him back at once and appoint him to a field where his labours might be useful in their own way of looking at matters.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Signed) A. G. Erabent.\nFriendly Cove, Mootka Sound,\n23 August, 1901.\n\nRight Revd. B. Orth, D. V.\n\nRight Revd. dear Bishop,\n\nBefore I left Victoria in 1875, to permanently reside on this coast and sacrifice my life for the conversion of the Indians, the late C. J. Seghers, then recently consecrated Bishop of this diocese, enjoined on me, among other things, to be sure to respect the position of the chiefs of the different tribes, help them to keep up their rights and see that their authority is respected except when they are up to mischief and badness. I have done this so much that in some cases it has been to the disadvantage of our work. But yet, I was carrying out my orders.\n\nWhen Matkahaw, the Chief of Resquiat, had shot me I prevented the people from killing his sister; and as I learned that they wanted to do away with his boy, the future Chief, in a meeting of the whole tribe I upbraided the Indians for their evil designs, and I appointed guardians to see that the little fellow was not molested, stating at the same time that, when of age, he would be like his father the Chief of the tribe. Later on, as I discovered a \"complot\" of several men to kill [illegible] father of Matkahaw, who as everybody said had put up his son to\nshoot me - and who, after the death of that son acted as chief -\nI at once rose up in his defense and had him respected as chief\nby the whole tribe to the last day of his life.\n\nThere is not a chief on the Coast that will say that I\never interfered with his position of Chief.\n\nAnd yet I am told that unscrupulous men now scatter the\nnews and accuse me of threatening the young chief of Nootka that\nif he does do such and such a thing, I will have him deposed.\n\nAnybody who has the least knowledge of the Indians of\nthis Coast will say at once that attempting to do anything of the\nkind would be met by the utmost failure. The rank is hereditary.\nThe young Nootka chief is born \"a chief,\" and the Indians even in\nspite of all the attempts to the contrary - of Agents or Governors,\nFriends or Bishops - will always consider and hold him as such.\nDr. Powell when Sup't. of Indian affairs made the attempt in Clay-\noquat and the Indians laughed at him behind his back. Dr. Powell's\n\"chief\" remained an inferior Indian, and was treated as such by\nall the natives, and the chief by right of birth remained chief,\nand his daughter now succeeds to her father in the position.\n\nNever have I gone to an Indian reserve and after being\npolitely refused by the chief to build and settle upon such reserve\nthen, in order to carry my point, try to undo the chief's authority by asking a number of inferior Indians to sign a paper entitling me to act in spite of the chief's prohibition, and, so it were, dispossess him of his title and rights as chief. I leave it to others to act that way. Such a blunder I have never made, and such an injustice I have never attempted to commit.\n\nIt is also rumoured that I threatened the chief with regard to some cattle that run about here. The truth is the cattle are mine pure and simple, and if tomorrow I took up a gun and shot them no one could say that I shot any but my own cattle. I did not make a present of them to the old chief and he never paid for them, and they remain mine till they are paid for.\n\nThe situation of the young Chief is this: His uncle died a short time ago, and like all Indians, left different instructions to his successor. Napoleon Maquinna follows those instructions. One of these instructions is to be true to the Catholic Priest who has attended to these Indians since 1874, and to allow no division to take place by admitting ministers of other denominations. The saying of the old Chief was one \"let it be enough,\" and I am told that he got a Captain of a schooner to write this very saying to Mr. Quillod, and also he sent warning to Mr. Russell of Ahousat.\nto that effect during the Chief's last illness.\n\nAs an item of news, I may mention that the young man who represents the Presbyterian church here, since a couple of months, is packing up and will leave this place per outgoing steamer. He sees that he has been imposed upon by those who sent him here. He has no followers whatever. He has no attendance at his prayer meetings, and since the last three weeks he has had only one little boy at his school, and that boy only went so that his relatives might collect the rent of the house used as a school-room.\n\nThere are other reports about me, but I can take no notice of them. The white residents on the coast and all the Indians know me. They know that during all the many years I am a resident here I have done nothing contemptible or small. Will they say as much of my accusers?\n\nI am your Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n\"A. J. Brabant.\"\nRussell House,\nOttawa, Dec. 5th, 1901.\n\nHon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nIn our conversation of yesterday you kindly referred to the Nootka trouble. I am happy to know that it is a thing of the past. I once more thank you for your kind influence in settling the matter. Some time ago I sent to your Honour a brief statement of the trouble. Now I send you enclosed a more extensive recital of the origin of the Nootka trouble, which I hope, will throw some additional light on the subject, and will explain the correctness of my position in the matter. Asking for a continuance of your favour,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours very truly,\nWinnipeg, 6th February 1902.\n\nSchools,\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that one of the enclosed documents is not signed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSchools\n\nFEB 15 1902\nBritish Columbia\nWest Coast Agency\n\n225392\n\nAlberni\nFeb 4th 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 5th of last December 519 W 3 and referring to former letters of Nov 7th 135 W 3, July 26th 368 V 3 and July 19th 221 V 3 I have the honor to inform you that owing to my being engaged on the Dominion Census and other pressing business and the difficulty of travelling by canoe in the winter months owing to bad weather I did not meet Koottka till the 17th of December. On my arrival there the Koottka Indians showed so little interest with regard to the wish of the Presbyterian Church to give them a resident missionary and teacher that although I called a meeting particularly to consider this question no one attended and I had to take advantage of Chief Mogum's killing a beef to distribute among his tribesmen to address them on the subject. After I had explained to them the purpose of the meeting, that the Department wished to know their mind with regard to the coming of a Presbyterian missionary among them, that I was there not to take one\nside or the other but I wanted them all to speak and say what was in their heart. Chief Illowana made a speech as follows:\n\n\"I told the Presbyterian missionaries last year that I did not want a new teacher at Nootka. I am Roman Catholic and Father Brabant is my friend and the friend of my people he has known us from the time we were children and has always looked after us, we do not want another teacher. Last spring when I was sick he gave me a letter to get a good doctor in Victoria who cured me of my sickness. I do not want another teacher.\"\n\nThen asked the 2nd chief Captain Jack to speak but neither he or anyone present had anything to say except to the effect that the chief had spoken and given me their true heart.\n\nThe Nootka or Mowachat tribe number 178, of whom 86 called themselves Catholics, the rest pagans; the children number 42 of whom 20 are of school age, four of these twenty children are inmates of the Roman Catholic boarding school at Clayoquot, a few lads go sealing. The Rev. Father Brabant whom I saw at Hesquiat told me he had 12 children attending school at Nootka, a few of whom were Matchitlahs, and that he closed his school, when from some of the Indians moving from the village, the attendance did not warrant its continuance, he was intending to retire.\nto Nootka in February at Chesterfield village. At a meeting of the Matchitlakits on the 26th of December, the chief woman asked for a Presbyterian teacher and a store. The tribe numbers 63 with 14 children, 6 of whom are of school age; it is a poor village site, situated behind Black Island. Nootka sound 8 miles from Nootka village and the Indians only reside there about three months in the year. Their fishing stations are up Chuckalot arm; the tribe are allied with the Nootka's and Hesquiat's and what they know of Christianity has been learned on visits to those places.\n\nOn the 25th of January I visited Oke village, Esperanza inlet, 24 miles from Nootka village. At a meeting of the Chattivatits held here Chief Joe said they wanted the Rev. Dr. Campbell of the Presbyterian Church to give them a teacher, that if one came he, the chief, would lend a house for present purposes and give a site for a schoolhouse on the Reserve wherever the teacher saw fit, that they would give all their children to the teacher, that they wanted a school where the children could sleep when the parents were away, if food was provided all right but if not the parents would help to provide food for their children at school, the tribe were unanimous in supporting what chief Joe said. Oke is the principal village where this band\nreside in the winter months; in the summer, those who do not travel to the Fraser river & the American hop fields, stop at Chisenaus, Catala island at the mouth of Esperanza inlet, 8 miles from Ote. The Chilcotin band number 102, with 31 children of whom 16 are of school age.\n\nNoochahlt the Noochahlt village is also situated at the mouth of Esperanza inlet, 5 miles from the Chilcotin village Chisenaus. The Noochahltto number 86 with 13 children, 7 of whom are of school age - 29 of this band call themselves Catholics, the rest Pagans. The resident Roman Catholic Priest at Nyugnot pays occasional visits to these tribes.\n\nHave the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarry Guillet\nAssist.\n\nA. W.

Mr. Guilled forwarded the application to this office on the 25th of June 1901 and in turn the Agent's letter with its enclosure was transmitted to the Department by me on the 28th of the same month, No. 614. T. 3. The Department's reply thereto is dated the 11th of July 1901, File No. 215,103.\n\nIn this year's letters from this office to the Department\n\nit\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\n\nDeputy Supt. General\n\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nit will be perceived that as between the two schools - the one in the Kwawkewlth Agency, Fort Rupert, and the other at Yuquet, in the West Coast Agency - I recommended, for the reasons stated, making a grant for payment of a teacher's salary at the day school concerning which the Bishop now writes. I may state that to my letter of the 27th of last May, No. M. 4., 35, no reply was received. As the school cannot well be carried on without the assistance of the Department I would ask that the appropriation referred to be paid to the teacher at Yuquet on receipt by the Department of the usual quarterly reports.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn the key to the Estimates for the current year the question of provision for a day school at Yuquot, in the West Coast Agency, is referred to. In a footnote which states that Sup't. Vowell strongly recommends the provision of a salary for the teacher there as it would materially assist the school in its struggle for maintenance. The teacher he states is earnestly striving for the mental and physical betterment of the respective bands, but as Mr. Vowell has not stated to what denomination the school belongs, how many children attend, the Department decided to await a further report on the subject before finally making the grant. He now encloses a communication from the Right Rev. Bishop Orth of Victoria asking for this grant, and in his letter forwarding the same he refers to his recommendation for payment of the teacher's salary as the school cannot well be carried on without the assistance of the Department.\n\nThe population of the Reserve is about 169: 82 Roman Catholics and 87 Pagans, the number of children of school age about 25. The British Columbia School vote would stand this grant being made, and I think that in view of the good work said to be done, it would be advisable to accede to the Bishop's request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, 14th October, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to say that in view of your recommendation the Roman Catholic day school at Yuquot, Nootka Sound, will be recognized and the usual grant of $300.00 per annum paid for the teacher's salary. The grant will be available from the 1st July last and allowed upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. STEWART\nAssistant Secretary\n\nA.W.

But I found it closed, the teacher Rev. E. Sebray informed me that he opened the school for three weeks, but he only had an average of three, so he closed it again. There are sufficient children but the parents take no interest in their education. Mr. Sebray states that unless compulsory attendance is required a school cannot be kept going. The Indians on this coast, although the first to be visited by the white men are in a very primitive and dirty condition. I saw old Indian men cutting wood on the beach with not a stitch of clothing on, and their only object appears to be dancing and potlatching.\n\nI consider that the men who visit \"Heetka\" to take records and photographs of the potlatches and the old ways of the village (drawn to it because it was the first place visited by Captains Cook, Vancouver, and Quadra) are largely responsible for the poor condition of these Indians; the people are paid to go through all the old forms of dances, etc., and encouraged to keep them up. At the time I was there parties from the United States, with phonographs to record the old songs, and machines to take moving pictures of old weird dances. These retard progress and keep the people wedded to the old ways. There are some bright children that should be educated.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. Mr. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools, in which he states that when recently inspecting the schools in the West Coast Agency he visited the Yuquot Reserve and found the school closed. Rev. P. Sobray had opened the school for three weeks, but had only an average of three.\n\nFrom Mr. Green's report on the condition of the Indians on this reserve it would appear advisable to make arrangements to send as many of the children as possible to one or other of the Roman Catholic residential schools, and, if necessary, to enforce sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, of which you are aware. I have to ask you, therefore, to look into this matter and report.\n\nMr. Green states that there are some bright children on the reserve who should be educated and the Department quite agrees with him. If the parents will not take advantage of the day school the only alternative is to send the children to the industrial schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I know from my own observation that the present situation of the Mission on Mission Island being difficult of access for the children in bad weather militates much against the success of the school and on my last visit to Kyuquot the Indians expressed their wish to have a teacher settled on the Reserve at Acteese that the children might be able to attend school regularly.\n\nThe Tribe number about 400 with some sixty children of school age, the majority of them are claimed & acknowledged as Roman Catholics.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

The reason for this is the following: The old mission which is now falling to ruin, stands on another island called Chakwaitakel; hence the fact that we and our children have to go across the water to attend Church and School has caused a great drawback to us at times; then again nearly all of us are now living on the above said island Atteo and the future of the mission in our midst will give us a more favorable opportunity to attend than in the past.\n\n[Signatures]\n\n\u00d7 Willie Hoachle, Chief\n\u00d7 James MacKinnon\n\u00d7 Peter\n\u00d7 Russell Jettiea Smith\n\u00d7 James\n\u00d7 John Huklowoniken\n\u00d7 Geo Stans\n\u00d7 Sam Koatelet\n\u00d7 Sam Jethie\n\u00d7 Peter Shumonik\n\u00d7 Tomi Jettiea house\n\u00d7 Dick Methan\n\u00d7 Antonio Hammond\n\u00d7 Bob Campbell\n\u00d7 Peter Jethie\n\u00d7 James Beaulieu\n\u00d7 James Mathelstman\n\u00d7 Robert\n\u00d7 Sam Ta-Hoon\n\u00d7 Louis Mackwahen\n\u00d7 John Heywood\n\u00d7 Albert Kwee-it\n\u00d7 Lee Manawhik\n\u00d7 Thom Cowick\nx Nelson Howkam\nx Sam Havelki\nx Peter Kweil\nx Eli Wachemhas\nx Charlie Wachtelko\nx George Cremloft\nx Jack Tumek\nx Wintes\nx Jonatthad\nx Geo.

At the time I received your note, I was lucky enough to find all the Indians at home except one over 60 years old. I therefore can vouch for the authenticity of the signatures which I have, will be a sufficient guarantee to secure your witnessing it. I feel exceedingly sorry that your answer to my application came so late and thought at first that it would altogether upset our plans. We wished to build in time as long as Schornstein came back from the coast, and under the circumstances this is an only opportunity for doing so; for then the weather is favorable, the Indians, many of whom have promised their services, are at home & some Schornsteins have volunteered to bring a great deal of the lumber; now all this depends on the permission of the government, which, in the supposition that we adopt your suggestion as stated in letter, cannot be secured in time. It is for this reason that this written statement by the Indians must, by all means & without fail, be sent in at the very first opportunity, for our answer must be received by the beginning of next May; it was with this object in view that I took steps as early as last November. If however you think that...\nthis written Consent cannot be forwarded at once or must wait for your personal presence here in a meeting with the Indians. Kindly let me know if shall have to communicate directly with the Department.

The Roman Catholic Mission have Church, school, and residence built on their own land on Mission Island, but nearly all the Indians now reside at Aktese and have to cross the channel between the two islands by canoe to go to Church or School.

After having secured the unanimous consent of Chiefs and Indians I beg to state that I am now prepared to build my mission on the island called Atkin where nearly all the Indians are living now.

The teacher, Rev. E. Scott has lived among the Indians practically all that time and has taught school occasionally but he has not thought his work sufficient to ask for the grant. I have several times suggested his sending in a report when he had taught for part of the quarter and when the failure to keep the school open the remainder of the term due, not to his inability, but to the Indians being away but he did not seem to be willing to do so and I ceased to press the matter.\n\nHis school and work among the Indians was principally as a recruiting ground for the Pine Industrial School at Okanagan, managed by his church.\n\nSeeing that he has been working among the Indians all along I would strongly urge the Dept. will pay the grant in this case.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 8, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the grant was paid to the teacher of the Kyuquot Indian school for the December quarter, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Ashbridge Esquire,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge,\n\nThe Bishop of Victoria has asked me to write to you.\n\nYou know that His Excellency has been anxious to have a day school on the Kyuquot Reserve. At the beginning of this month, I wrote to Father Sorensen about the matter. I have just received a reply from him. In that letter he states that he has heard, apparently on good authority, that Dr. McLean of Ceepeecoo has been negotiating with Chief Emile Jules of Kyuquot with a view to opening a school....it would seem, on the Chief's land. Fr. Sorensen does not seem quite sure about the attitude of the Chief, but it would seem to have been favourable.\n\nPractically all the Indians at Kyuquot are baptized Roman Catholics. Out of the list furnished me by Fr. Sorensen, I count only 7 non-Catholics...Protestants and Pagans.\n\nIt is hardly necessary for me to mention that His Excellency is very keen to do everything he possibly can to help the Indian people in every way. The work of the Missionaries cannot help but be very much hampered by the erection of a school under the auspices of Dr. McLean.\n\nLast summer he was trying to get into Nootka, but the Cannery authorities are so appreciative of the work Fr. Sheahan is trying to do there, that they would not give the Doctor a 'pied a terre.' Now, it would seem, that having failed at Nootka Dr. McLean is going to see what can be done at Kyuquot.\n\nDr. McLean's main purpose is to counteract the work of the Catholic Missionaries; of that, personally, I have no doubt. When I was visiting the West Coast, as the Bishop's representative last spring, Henry Jack of Nootka, told me that at the beginning of the year, he had been seriously\nill and not expected to live, in Dr. McLean's Hospital at Cespecees. The good Doctor went out of his way and took no small trouble to tear the Catholic Faith from the sick man's heart.\n\nI was astounded at the Doctor, but I was more astounded at the account an Indian was able to give of the Faith that was in him. The Doctor also tried his hand with Henry's wife. That this happened and that the boy answered in the way he did, was confirmed by what Fr. Sheahan told me, but I had the story from Henry's own lips.\n\nVery much more might be said on the same line; anything might be expected from a man who would try to interfere with the Faith of someone supposed to be dying.\n\nPlease accept my best wishes for the new year. I hope that I may have the pleasure of seeing you again one of these days.\n\nVery sincerely your,\n\nJ. L.

Certain changes in the admission of pupils to those institutions;\n2. The curriculum to be followed in the instruction in the ordinary branches of education and in the training of pupils in the knowledge of industries;\n3. On the question\n\nTo the Right Honourable Sir John Macdonald, P.C., G.C.B.,\nChief Secretary of Indian Affairs.\n\n(1)\nof having Primary Schools attached to these institutions for the reception of such Indian children as might not have an opportunity of attending the day school on the Reserve;\n\n4. As to the certificates to be given pupils who have attended the day school attached to the Industrial Institution, and to boys who have completed four years at the Institution and who have remained steadily at the trade learnt thereat for one year after leaving it, the latter certificate to entitle them to apprenticeship and other privileges from the Government;\n\n5. That all institutions, including day schools, should be subject to regular Government inspection, the same as the common schools among the White population;\n\n6. That the Government inspectors should use his influence with\nwith the Indians on the different Reserves to make the children attend the day schools; so as to the most promising ones being drafted into the Industrial Institutions, and after concluding their course that they continue to follow the trade in which they have been instructed.\n\nThe Minister will observe from the views expressed by the several Principals of these institutions that a great variety of opinion exists on the different points above referred to. In view of this difference of opinion on the part of the Principals, the undersigned finds it difficult to make a recommendation, but he sees no objection to such of the Principals as approve of the proposed changes being allowed to try the same in their Institutions, and\nand, if they are found to succeed, the Department will then be in a position to recommend their adoption by the other institutions. They are approved of by the Principal of the Institution at Sainte-Marie and by the Principal of the Institution at Mount Elgin, in the Township of Caradoc, Ontario. The undersigned is himself of opinion that the changes would be decidedly beneficial and would serve to raise the standard of Indian education much higher than it is at present.\n\nI respectfully submit,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy of the\nChief, General\nIndian Affairs.\nMemorial\n\nof the members of the Baptist Ministerial Association\nof the City of Toronto,\n\nTo the Honorable Sir J. A. Abbott, K.C., M.P.,\nPrime Minister of the Dominion of Canada:\n\nSir:\n\nWe, the undersigned members of a special commit-\ntee, appointed by the Baptist Ministerial Association\nof this City, respectfully ask, as Citizens of Canada,\nyour attentive consideration of the following state-\nments and protest:\n\nHaving learned from reports appearing in the\npublic press that, on a recent occasion, replying to his\nrepresentations of a deputation composed of the Methodist\nmembers of the Senate and the House of Commons, who\nwaited upon you to ask an increase of the appropriations\nfrom the Dominion Treasury, in aid of the Mission\nschools under the care of the Methodist Church among\nAmong the Indians of the North West, you intimated that the Government had in contemplation a new and improved system in accordance with which appropriations in aid of denominational schools among the Indians of Canada would henceforth be made on a \"per capita\" basis, we beg leave, on behalf of the Association for which we operate, to say\u2014\n\n(1) We, as members of a body of Christians who have been among the most zealous in the establishment and carrying on of modern missions among the heathen in foreign lands, are in hearty sympathy with every properly directed effort for the civilizing and evangelizing of the Indian tribes of Canada.\n\n(2) Though the Churches of the denomination with which we are connected, have not done so much as we could have wished in aid of this good work, which we recognize as a duty solemnly binding upon the Christian Churches of the Dominion, they have for a number of years been engaged in missionary work on\nBrant Reserve, and have at present an ordained minister with several assistants, successfully employed on that Reserve. They have also, during the past year, been engaged in mission work on the Reserves around Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, and are now organizing for more extensive work in that region. This will show that the Baptists are not indifferent to the religious welfare of the aborigines of the Dominion and that they are prepared to do what they can for their evangelization, in harmony with their cherished and time honored principles, viz.: absolute voluntaryism in religious institutions and operations.\n\n(3) We, as Baptists, who have in days past suffered proscription and persecution for conscience' sake, in consequence of the union of Church and State in systems of Government, regard any and every appropriation of funds derived from taxation of the whole people for purposes of civil administration in aid of the denominational or sectarian schools or institutions of any kind under denominational...\ndenominational control, as not only demonstrating in principle and unjust, but as a violation of the fundamental principle of absolute separation of Church and State, which has been agreed upon, tacitly at least, as one of the cornerstones of our constitutional system.\n\nThe provisions of the British North America Act in the interest of Separate Schools in Ontario and Quebec will surely not be pleaded in support of practices adapted to weaken and contravene throughout the Dominion at large this most important feature of our Constitution.\n\n(4) We, therefore, as Baptists, beg leave respectfully, but most earnestly to protest against the establishment of such a system of distribution of public funds in aid of denominational Indian Schools, as that said to be contemplated by your Government, and to submit that whatever changes are made in the matter should be in the direction of discontinuance of any such grants at the earliest practicable moment. In support of this protest and Memorial permit us to urge, in addition to the foregoing...\ngoing, the following considerations:\n\n(a) - The inherent absurdity, if you will pardon the expression, of such a method. We are well assured that in this matter the Government are sincerely anxious of promoting the moral and religious welfare of the Indians. But consider how ineffectual and even harmful such a system must be in relation to their very designs. The Methodists, for instance, in common with other denominations called \"Evangelical,\" firmly believe that the doctrinal teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are based on deadly error and tend directly to foster ignorance, superstition, and moral and spiritual darkness in the minds of those who are brought under their influence. The Roman Catholics, in their turn, hold substantially the same views, and if possible even more strongly, with regard to the fruits and effects of Evangelicalism. And yet the Government hopes to christianize the Indians by having Methodists for the propagation of Roman Catholic teachings and Roman\nRoman Catholics, for the propagation of Methodism,\nand Baptists and many others who are neither Methodists\nnor Roman Catholics for the propagation of the\nviews of both.\n\n(b) - The mischievous and dangerous tendency\nof such a system putting, as it does, a premium\nupon mere numbers in the rival schools, instead,\nif not to actual misrepresentations, at least to un-\ndesirable and vicious methods of competition; and\nthe holding out of wrong and demoralizing induc-\nments to Indian parents to permit their children to be\nenrolled in the respective schools. We think that the\nGovernment cannot be wholly unaware that already\nmissionaries representing rival schools sometimes\nsuspect and accuse each other of resorting to\nunworthy tricks and other expedients in order to\nenlarge their rolls. The moral effects of such rivalries\nupon the minds of the Indians themselves may be readily\nimagined.\nThe system lacks completeness and finality. All admit that it is in the highest degree desirable that such a system should be adopted as will effect the complete civilization and enlightenment of the Indians, not simply ultimately but within the briefest possible period. Now, though some very encouraging progress is reported from time to time in the industrial training of the North West Indians, the most sanguine friends of the present methods can hardly hope to see the 17,000 or 18,000 Indians in the North West, to say nothing of those in British Columbia and other Provinces, transformed into intelligent and industrious citizens within the next half Century. It is not to be hoped for, that under any system of state aided sectarian schools that can be devised, the work of educating the young Indians as a whole, will be carried on in a century, to say nothing of their moral and religious transformation. But if this be so, it follows that the establishment of the system proposed would really fail.\ntake on the characteristics of perpetuity, ineffec-\ntiveness, and hopelessness so far as any complete\nor satisfactory results are concerned.\n\nIf it be said that some progress is better than\nnone, and that the adoption of the view we advocate\nwould lead to a falling off in the amount of work\nwhich is now being done for the uplifting of the\nIndians, we make bold to reply:\n\nThat it would be a poor compliment to\nthe zeal and liberality of Canadian Christians to believe\nthat their efforts for the moral and spiritual welfare\nof the aborigines in their own land are dependent\nupon the aid derived from compulsory taxation\nby the state. We have such faith in voluntarism\nin religious work, a belief well founded upon what\nis now being done in foreign lands, that we feel sure\nthat the withdrawal of the aid hitherto granted by the\ngovernment would lead to redoubled liberality and\nzeal in the work of Indian missions.\nAs to the educational work which properly belongs to the State, we ask whether the time is not come when very much more should be done than has hitherto been done in this direction. May we not, without presumption, direct the attention of the Government and all friends of the Indian to the great work that is now being done in the United States?\n\nAfter having for a century tried methods somewhat similar to those now employed in Canada, the United States government has at last, as is well known, adopted vigorous and hopeful measures for the final and complete solution of the whole Indian problem within a generation. Acting on the advice of the Lake Mohawk Conference, a society representing the statesmanship, philanthropy and religious intelligence and zeal of the friends of the Indian in the Republic, the Indian Department is now, with every prospect of success, following out a radically new departure in its treatment of the Indians.\n\nThe two great principles underlying this new policy\npolicy are Universal Compulsory Education of Indian Children and Youth, at the earliest practicable moment, and the breaking up of the Reservation, and with it, as a not remote consequence, of the tribal system, and the distribution of the land to the Indians in personalty. They are, in short, to be clothed with the duties and responsibilities, and with all the privileges too, of Citizenship, under such Conditions as may seem best adapted to make citizens of them, at the earliest possible moment. The work of christianizing them will, of course, be left with the Churches where it properly belongs. If the Provinces of Canada find it advisable and expedient, as a matter of self-interest, to provide for the Compulsory elementary education of all the children who are to become their future citizens, ought not the Dominion itself, \"a folk-union,\" to do no less for the children of the Indians who are her wards? Let the Government thus settle the Question of Indian Education, and the Churches may safely\nsafely be trusted to do the work of Christianization.\n\nBut the other day, the Methodist Conference of the United States assembled at Omaha, unanimously decided that the General Conference should henceforth \"decline either to make a Petition to or to receive from the National Government, any moneys for educational work among the Indians.\" We are sure the Methodists of Canada will not be slow to emulate so good an example. In fact, some of them are already doing so.\n\nWhile the members of the Ministerial Association whom this Committee represents make no claim to speak for anybody but themselves, they are warranted by the whole history of Baptist principles, and by their general knowledge of the sentiments of their brethren all over the Dominion in their conviction that they voice the minds of the whole body of Canadian Baptists. Steps are being taken to have the question submitted to the various local\nlocal Associations shortly to meet, and also to the\ngeneral Convention of the Baptists of Ontario and\nQuebec, which meets in October. We have no doubt\nthat the protest will be heartily concurred in by all\nthese representative bodies.\n\nWe deem it proper to forward printed copies\nof this memorial & Protest to the members of the\nHouse of Commons and Senate.\n\nWe are Sir, with great respect,\n\nyour obedient servants\n\nToronto May 27, 1894.\n\n[Signature]\nTheodore H.

C. Abbott, K.C.M.G., Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada:\n\nSir,\u2014We, the undersigned members of a special committee, appointed by the Baptist Ministerial Association of this city, respectfully ask, as citizens of Canada, your attentive consideration of the following statements and protest\u2014\n\nHaving learned from reports appearing in the public press that, on a recent occasion, applying to the representations of a deputation composed of the Methodist members of the Senate and the House of Commons, who waited upon you for an increase of the appropriations from the Dominion Treasury in aid of the Mission schools under the care of the Methodist Church among the Indians of the North-West, you intimated that the Government had in contemplation a new or improved system in accordance with which appropriations in aid of denominational schools among the Indians of Canada would henceforth be made on a per capita basis, we beg leave, on behalf of the association for which we speak, to say:\u2014\n\n(1.)

The Roman Catholics, in their turn, hold substantially the same views, and if possible even more strongly, with regard to the tenets and effects of Evangelicalism. And yet the Government hopes to christianize the Indians by taxing Methodists for the propagation of Roman Catholic teachings and Roman Catholics for the propagation of Methodism, and Baptists and many others who are neither Methodists nor Roman Catholics for the propagation of the views of both.\n\n(b.) The mischievous and dangerous tendency of such a system putting as it does, a premium upon mere numbers in the rival schools, to lead, if not to actual misrepresentations, at least to undesirable and vicious methods of competition, and the holding out of wrong and demoralizing inducements to Indian parents to permit their children to be enrolled in the respective schools. We think that the Government cannot be wholly unaware that already missionaries representing rival schools sometimes suspect and accuse each other of resorting to unworthy bribes and other expedients in order to enlarge their rolls. The moral effects of such rivalries upon the minds of the Indians themselves may readily be imagined.\n(c) The system lacks completeness and finality. All admit that it is in the highest degree desirable that such a system should be adopted as will effect the complete civilization and enlightenment of the Indians, not simply ultimately but within the briefest possible period. Now, though some very encouraging progress is reported from time to time in the industrial training of the north west Indians, the most sanguine friend of the present methods can hardly hope to see the 17,000 or 18,000 Indians in the North-west, to say nothing of those in British Columbia and other provinces, transformed into intelligent and industrious citizens within the next half century. It is not to be hoped for, that under any system of State-aided sectarian schools that can be devised, the work of educating the young Indians as a whole, will be overtaken in a century, to say nothing of their moral and religious transformation. But if this be so, it follows that the establishment of the system proposed would really take on the characteristics of perpetuity, ineffectiveness and hopelessness so far as any complete or satisfactory results are concerned.\n\n(b) If it be said that some progress is better than none, and that the adoption of the view we advocate would lead to a falling off in the amount of work which is now being done for the uplifting of the Indians, we make bold to reply:\n\n(1.) That it would be a poor compliment to the zeal and liberality of Canadian Christians to believe that their efforts for the moral and spiritual welfare of the aborigines in their own land are dependent upon the aid derived from compulsory taxation by the State. We have such faith in voluntaryism in religious work, a belief well founded upon what is now being done in foreign lands, that we feel sure that the withdrawal of the aid hitherto granted by the Government would lead to a resembled liberality and zeal in the work of Indian missions.\n\n(2.) As to the education work which properly belongs to the State, we ask whether the time is not come when very much more should be done than has hitherto been done in this direction? May we not, without presumption, direct the attention of the Government and all friends of the Indian to the great work that is now being done in the United States?\n\nAfter having for a century tried methods somewhat similar to those now employed in Canada, the United States Government has at last, as is well known, adopted vigorous and hopeful measures for the final and complete solution of the whole Indian problem within a generation. Acting on the advice of the Lake Mohawk Conference, a society representing the statesmanship, philanthropy and religious intelligence and zeal of the friends of the Indian in the Republic, the Indian Department is now, with every prospect of success, following out a radically new departure in its treatment of the Indians.\n\nThe two great principles underlying this new policy are universal compulsory education of Indian children and youth, at the earliest practicable moment; and the breaking up of the Reservation, and with it, as a not remote consequence, of the tribal system, and the distribution of the land to the Indians in severalty. They are, in short, to be clothed with the duties and responsibilities, and with all the privileges too, of citizenship, under such conditions as may seem best adapted to make citizens of them, at the earliest possible moment. The work of Christianizing them will, of course, be left with the churches where it properly belongs. If the Provinces of Canada find it advisable and expedient, as a matter of self-interest, to provide for the compulsory elementary education of all the children who are to become their future citizens, ought not the Dominion itself, a fortiori, to do no less for the children of the Indians who are her wards? Let the Government thus settle the question of Indian education, and the churches may safely be trusted to do the work of Christianization. But the other day the Methodist Conference of the United States, assembled at Omaha, unanimously decided that the General Conference should hereafter \"decline either to make a petition to or to receive from the National Government any moneys for educational work among the Indians.\" We are sure the Methodists of Canada will not be slow to emulate so good an example. In fact, some of them are already doing so.\n\nWhile the members of the Ministerial Association whom this committee represents make no claim to speak for anybody but themselves, they are warranted by the whole history of Baptist principles, and by their general knowledge of the sentiments of their brethren all over the Dominion in their conviction that they voice the minds of the whole body of Canadian Baptists. Steps are being taken to have the question submitted to the various local associations shortly to meet; and also to the General Convention of the Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, which meets in October. We have no doubt that the protest will be heartily concurred in by all these representative bodies.\n\nWe deem it proper to forward printed copies of this memorial and protest to the members of the House of Commons and Senate.\n\nWe are, Sir, with great respect,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nTHEODORE H. RAND,\nOf McMaster University.\n\nB. D. THOMAS,\nPastor of Jarvis St. Church.\n\nO. C. S. WALLACE,\nPastor of Bloor St. Church.\n\nJAMES GRANT,\nPresident Association, pro tem.\n\nP. CLIFTON PARKER,\nSecretary Association.\n\nTORONTO, May 27th, 1892\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE MINISTER.\n\nA few remarks might not be out of place in regard to the \"Memorial\" forwarded to the Government by the Members of the Baptist Ministerial Association of the City of Toronto.\n\nThere are only two paragraphs that call for consideration, viz., \"4\" and Sub-section Two of \"5\".\n\nParagraph 4 says:\u2014\"We therefore as Baptists beg leave respectfully, but most earnestly, to protest against the establishment of such a system of distribution of public funds in aid of denominational Indian Schools as that said to be contemplated by your Government.\"\n\nIn regard to the above it may be stated that the Department in inaugurating the system of granting aid to Day Schools did not take the matter of religious education into consideration at all. It is true that when some of the Treaties were made the Indians on several occasions asked to be supplied with a Minister and School Teacher of whatever denomination we belong to.\" (Page 215 Morris' Book). The Lieut. Governor in reply, (Page 217) said:\u2014\"You ask for School Teachers and Ministers. With regard to Ministers I cannot interfere. There are large Societies formed for the purpose of sending the Gospel to the Indians. The Government does not provide Ministers anywhere in Canada. I had already promised you that when you settled down and there were enough children, schools would be maintained.\"\n\nLet us look at the beginning of the granting of aid to Day Schools in the North West.\n\nIn Manitoba and the North West Territories the following\nTreaties were made:\n\nManitoba.\n\nTreaties Nos. 1 & 2 August 3rd, 1871.\nTreaty 3 October 3rd, 1873.\nTreaty 5 September 20th, 1875.\n\nNorth West Territories.\n\nTreaty No. 4 September 15th, 1874.\nTreaty 6 August 23rd, 1876.\nTreaty 7 September 22nd, 1877.\n\nThe clause in the Treaty referring to education reads thus:\n\n\"And further, Her Majesty agrees to maintain a school on each Reserve hereby made whenever the Indians of the Reserve should desire it.\"\n\nAnd the Indian Act provides that the Chiefs in Council may regulate \"as to what religious denomination the teacher of the school established on the Reserve shall belong to, provided always that he shall be of the same denomination as the majority of the Band, and that the Protestant or Catholic minority may likewise have a separate school, with the approval of and under regulation made by the Governor in Council\".\n\nIt would appear that certain Christian Denominations had been carrying on work among the Indians some time prior to the Treaty being made with them. They had started some Day Schools, and doubtless finding that the Government was bound by Treaty to educate the Indians they applied for assistance in their Educational work.\n\nThe first vote made by the Dominion Parliament for Indian education in Manitoba and the North West Territories was in 1873-4, when between $2,000 and $3,000 were passed, and the first appli-\n\n(2)\ncation which the Government appears to have had for assistance toward Day Schools was from the late Rev. Enoch Wood, who was then General Secretary of the Wesleyan Missionary Society. This was in October 1873. The application was made to the Government through the Hon. J. C. Aikens, then Secretary of State, and was \"for assistance to carry on Educational work among the Indians of the North West.\" The Methodist Church had then a Day School at Seron's River, one at Norway House, and one at Oxford House. They also had in operation in the Saskatchewan country a Day School at Victoria, one at White Fish Lake, and one at Edmonton House, and they proposed establishing in the Spring of 1874 one at Woodville and another at Morleyville, and also to do some work among the Blackfeet. The following are the words of the Rev. Mr. Wood's appeal:\u2014\"We cannot but be moved by the earnest and repeated requests made by the Indians on behalf of their children, the parents of whom are exceedingly anxious for them to be instructed.\n\nx x x \"Understanding that the Dominion Parliament has voted a certain amount of money to be expended for educational purposes among the Indians in this newly acquired Territory, we consider that these Day Schools are legitimately entitled to the favourable consideration of the Dominion Parliament.\"\n\nMr. Wood also mentioned in his letter the name of the Rev. J. B. Armstrong, who, he said, visited the Saskatchewan Territory, and, \"became so impressed with the desire of the Indians in that Northern country to have their children educated that, of his own accord, he petitioned His Honour Governor Morris for financial assistance to establish Day Schools among them.\"\n\n(3)\nUpon these representations an Order in Council was passed, dated October 1873, authorizing the payment of $300 per annum towards the maintenance of Day Schools on Indian Reserves, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, provided sixty pupils were in attendance. A further Order in Council was passed in April 1874, on the recommendation of the Hon. David Laird, on substantially the same lines, the difference being that the attendance was reduced from 60 to 25 pupils.\n\nThe Department, in advising the Rev. Mr. Wood of the decision of the Government to aid Day Schools to the extent of $300 per annum, stated that \"the Government was gratified to learn of the efforts which the Wesleyan Missionary Society were making for the education of the Indians in the North West, and of the success which was attending their efforts.\" The Department at the same time notified Bishop Grandin that similar aid would be granted to Day Schools in his Diocese.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the grants were made to aid in the work of secular education among the Indians, and that no reference whatever was made to Mission work.\n\nThe payments in many cases it is true were made to Teachers who had been sent in by Church Societies, but they were the only available Teachers in the country. They knew the Indians, and were likely to be much more successful in carrying on the schools than new comers. The Indians had a very strong aversion to sending their children to school, and it required a long acquaintance with them, and a great deal of tact to succeed in keeping up an attendance of children.\nThe experience of the Missionaries and their knowledge of the Indian character rendered them most useful Teachers and well qualified to do the work of opening new schools.\n\nAs the work of education among the Indians advanced it was considered to be in their interests that the methods of education should be somewhat changed. It was desirable to secure more regular attendance at the schools, and a higher class of education was becoming incumbent, as the mind of the child developed it was only right that it should be advanced in its studies, and in the case of pupils who had distinguished themselves by their intelligence and progress in the Day Schools that they should be drafted into schools of a higher order, such as\u2014\n\nBoarding Schools\n\nwhere they could be trained more thoroughly in all kinds of knowledge. Then began the establishment of Boarding Schools. The cost of the system was fully considered. There was a legal obligation on the part of the Government to educate the Indian youth. There was also a strong moral obligation. It was contended that if the children were to be elevated from the paths in which their parents had walked a competent education would tend more largely than anything else to do it. It was looked upon as due to the rising generation to afford them an equal chance of success in life with their white brethren, by whom they were, it might be said, replaced; and even from an economic point of view the expenditure incurred in educating and training the children was regarded as a good investment, one that would repay to the country large interest, by the conversion of the descendants of a people a large number of whom were then a source of expense, into profit-\n\n(5)\nable citizens, who, instead of being supported from the revenue of the country, as their parents were, would contribute largely to it.\n\nThis developed into Industrial training, and in 1883 the first Industrial Schools in the North West were established, namely, one at Bathford, one at Qu'Appelle, and one at High River. These have increased largely since, and we have now some nine or ten under weigh now, seven or eight of which are in full operation.\n\nThe valuable work done in Industrial Schools in the United States was, to a great extent, an incentive to try similar work in Canada for the benefit of the Indians. In the United States the Industrial School system was inaugurated in 1869, during President Grant's term of office. About that time the policy of grouping the Indians and placing them on permanent Reservations, abolishing the \"community\" system, and allotting the land in severalty, was introduced. Those who had the interests of the Indians at heart thought that an effort should be made, and they considered it the duty of the Government to endeavour to make the Indian a citizen of the United States, and in order to accomplish that end education in Industry, and in the arts of Civilization, was necessary, consequently from 1869 forward a good system of education was pursued.\n\nIndustrial Boarding Schools were considered in the U.S. to be the best for educating the Indian youth. The Day Schools did good work as stepping-stones, but, as a writer on the subject put it, \"Little can be done with the adult Indian. He can be taught to do a little at farming, and at stock raising, and to dress in a more civilized manner, but that is all. The child, again, who\n\"Go to a day school learns little, and what little he learns is soon forgotten, while his tastes are fashioned at home, and his inherited aversion to toil is in no way combatted.\"\n\nOur experience is the same. The children must be entirely removed from their homes, and from the influence of their parents and surroundings, in order that the benefits of their school training may be lasting.\n\nThe United States has had in operation from that time up to the present a great many Industrial Schools under what they call the \"contract\" system. A contract was made with, for instance, the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, the Presbyterian, the Baptist, or the Methodist Churches, and they were paid a per capita sum towards the maintenance of the pupils. They have also non-denominational schools, managed by the Government, and schools conducted by Church Societies, the expenses of the latter being paid by the State.\n\nThe Industrial Schools in the North West are of two classes; one class being managed by the Church authorities, and aided on the per capita system; the other conducted under the auspices of a Denomination, the cost of which is paid by the Government. At these schools all kinds of trades are taught, and when a boy graduates employment at his trade or profession either on the Reserve or among white people is obtained for him. The female pupils are taught all sorts of domestic work, and other useful mechanical arts, and they, in turn, when their length of time is up at a school, are procured situations and gradually they become merged in the white population.\n\nThe system of Indian education has been a success in Manitoba.\nand the North West Territories. The following table will show\nthe advances that have been made from 1873 to date:\n\n| Year | Number of Schools | Attendance |\n|------|------------------|------------|\n| 1873 | 2                | 120        |\n| 1874 | 4                | 150        |\n| 1875 | 13               | 460        |\n| 1876 | 3                | 106        |\n| 1877 | 11               | 415        |\n| 1878 | 16               | 501        |\n| 1879 | 17               | 590        |\n| 1880 | 16               | 517        |\n| 1881 | 26               | 971        |\n| 1882 | 29               | 762        |\n| 1883 | 36               | 1180       |\n| 1884 | 44               | 1261       |\n| 1885 | 62               | 1583       |\n| 1886 | 77               | 2356       |\n| 1887 | 86               | 2687       |\n| 1888 | 102              | 2941       |\n| 1889 | 110              | 3206       |\n| 1890 | 117              | 3268       |\n| 1891 | 134              | 3856       |\n\nIt might be here remarked that the Baptists have no missions\namong the Indians in Canada, so far as assisting the Government in\nthe education of the Indians is concerned.\n\nIn regard to Paragraph 5, Sub-section 2 of the Memorial,\nwhich reads:\u2014\"The two great principles underlying this new\npolicy are universal compulsory education of Indian children and youth at the earliest practicable moment, and the breaking up of the Reservation, and with it, as a not remote consequence, of the Tribal system, and the distribution of the land of the Indians in severalty.

One of the great sources of trouble to the United States, and from which Canada has been free, is compulsion of the Indians. Those who recommend such a course do not understand the Indian character.\n\nFor years back the Department has been pursuing the policy of breaking up the community system, and endeavouring to induce the\nIndians to take up their holdings in security.\n\nEvery effort is being made, and it may be safely said, with a very much greater degree of success than has attended the efforts of the United States, to clothe the Indians with the duties and responsibilities and all the privileges of citizenship.\n\nThe work of Christianizing them is entirely left with the Churches, where it properly belongs, and the Government is doing its duty in the direction of imparting to its Indian wards a liberal education.\n\nJune 18th\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: June 18th]\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1892-93 the Department proposes to have in operation in Manitoba and the North West Territories 153 schools, with an average attendance of 3000 scholars.

H. Kent, D.D.L., in the Secretary's Office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nUNDER SECRETARY OF STATE.\nThe following is a copy of the Order-in-Council of the 2nd October, 1892, providing for the carrying on of Industrial schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories:\n\n\"On a report dated 17th of October, 1892, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs stating that it is advisable to make a change in the manner of carrying on these Industrial schools in the North West that are wholly supported by the Government. The cost of these institutions is larger, it is thought, than that for which they might be conducted, and with a view to more economical management it is advisable and necessary to adopt some method which would relieve the press of the present expenditure and at the same time keep up the schools to an equal standard of efficiency and usefulness.\"\n\n\"The Minister considers that when the whole cost of an Institution is directly borne by the Government, the same economy by those in immediate charge is not used as would be employed under other conditions. Demands, under the present system, are frequently made for articles and supplies whereas, if the amount to be expended were to take the form more of an annual per capita grant, more effort in the way of economizing would be made.\"\n\n\"The Minister states that the actual cost to the Government, as shown under the head of Industrial schools does not represent the total expenditure which the present system entails, as there is a small expense in the purchasing and inspection of supplies to be added.\"\n\n\"The accounts for the past year (1890-91) show...\"\n\"that the per capita cost of each child at the Industrial schools under consideration was:\n\n\"Qu'Appelle $184.67\n\"Battleford 179.43\n\"High River 165.00\n\n\"The rate per capita, it is thought, is higher than it would be if a forced system of economy were exercised, and that the best way to effect the desired decrease would be to place the schools under a per capita grant system similar to that now in operation at Elkhorn and St. Paul's under Church of England authorities, St. Boniface and Kootenay under Roman Catholic Church authorities. The per capita system under which these schools are operated by the religious bodies has been found to work satisfactorily.\"\n\n\"The Minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to the Industrial schools in operation in the North West Territories, and to such other similar institutions as may hereafter be established, as soon as, in the opinion of the Indian Department, said institutions are in proper running order, at rates to be fixed upon as being fair and just, viz:\n\n\"The buildings are to be kept in repair jointly by the Government and the management, the former to furnish the material and the latter to perform the labor;\n\n\"All books and appliances, that is, maps, globes, &c., for educational purposes, to be furnished by the Government;\n\n\"All charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses to be paid by the management, out of the per capita grant;\n\n\"The management not in any event to charge child...\"\n\"children or their parents for being allowed to attend\n\"such institutions:\n\n5. \"The Government to pay to the management an an-\n\"nual grant for each pupil up to the number authorized\n\"by the Indian Department, as represented by the Com-\n\"missioner, at the following rates:-\n\n\"On'Appelle 118.00\n\"Regina 120.00\n\"Battleford 140.00\n\"High River 130.00\n\n\"For this consideration the same grant shall\n\"agree to conform to the rules of the Indian Department,\n\"as laid down from time to time, and to keep the schools\n\"at a certain standard of instruction, dietary and dom-\n\"estic comfort, and that the inspectors and officers of\n\"the Indian Department may at any time inspect and re-\n\"port upon the institutions.\n\n7. \"Payment to be made only for children authorized\n\"by the Commissioner to be admitted, and in accordance\n\"with the scale now governing payments to schools under\n\"the per capita system, which may be altered from time\n\"to time to suit circumstances, and no children, white or\n\"Indian, are to be admitted save under authority of the\n\"Commissioner.\n\n\"The Minister deems it desirable to put this\n\"system into operation after a reasonable time is given\n\"to the Church authorities, and he recommends that the\n\"first of July, 1893, be fixed as the date upon which\n\"the per capita allowances shall commence to be payable.\n\n\"The Committee submit the above for Your Excell-\n\"ency's approval.\"\n\nIn addition to the per capita grant, the follow-\ning concessions have been made to schools established\nunder the above Order-in-Council:-\n\n1st.\n1st. That account books, stationery and an allowance for postage will be given those institutions.\n\n2nd. That strict accounts of all expenditure incurred on behalf of each school, supported by Vouchers, will be required by the Department to be kept in each institution, and at the expiration of each year, a revision of the rate of capitation may be made, should it appear that such a step is considered necessary.\n\n3rd. In the event of pupils over and above the number already authorized and estimated for on the capitation system, being admitted into a school, and for whom no provision has been made, beds for occupation by such additional pupils are to be given by the Department, if they cannot be made in the Institution.\n\n4th. In the event of the erection of new buildings at the expense of the Department becoming necessary, the cost of the heating apparatus to be included in such cost.\n\n5th. Agricultural and other implements, when considered by the Department as being unfit for further use, may be dispensed of by the officers of the Institution in such manner as may be thought proper by them.\n\n6th. The Department will agree to provide sufficient grazing land for the use of each Institution.\n\n7th. The Department agrees to provide sufficient fencing material for the first enclosures required, but the fences must be removed at the expense of the Institution.\n\n8th. Medical attendance as directed by the Commissioner for the pupils of each Institution will be provided and paid for by the Department.\n\n9th. An advance of a sum to be agreed upon will, until further advice, be made by the Department to each Institution at the commencement of each quarter, to meet or the current expenses of that quarter being defrayed.\nMEMORIAL\n\nOF THE\n\nMEMBERS OF THE BAPTIST MINISTERIAL ASSOCIATION OF THE CITY OF TORONTO.\n\nTo the Honorable Sir J. J. C. Abbott, K.C.M.G., Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada:\n\nSIR,\n\nWe, the undersigned members of a special committee, appointed by the Baptist Ministerial Association of this city, respectfully ask, as citizens of Canada, your attention and consideration of the following statements and protest:\n\nHaving learned from reports appearing in the public press that, on a recent occasion, replying to the representations of a deputation composed of the Methodist members of the Senate and the House of Commons, who waited upon you to ask an increase of the appropriations from the Dominion Treasury in aid of the Mission schools under the care of the Methodist Church among the Indians of the North-West, you intimated that the Government had in contemplation a new or improved system in accordance with which appropriations in aid of denominational schools among the Indians of Canada would henceforth be made on a per capita basis, we beg leave, on behalf of the association for which we speak, to say:\n\n(1.) We, as members of a body of Christians who have been among the most zealous in the establishment and carrying on of modern missions among the heathen in foreign lands, are in hearty sympathy with every properly directed effort for the civilizing and evangelizing of the Indian tribes of Canada.\n\n(2.) Though the churches of the denomination with which we are connected, have not done so much as we could have wished in aid of this good work, which we recognize as a duty solemnly binding upon the Christian churches of the Dominion, they have for a number of years been engaged in missionary work on the Brant Reserve, and have at present an ordained minister with several assistants successfully employed on that reserve. They have also, during the past year, been engaged in mission work on the reserves around Lake Winnipeg, in Manitoba, and are now organizing for more extensive work in that region. This will show that the Baptists are not indifferent to the religious welfare of the aborigines of the Dominion, and that they are prepared to do what they can for their evangelization, in harmony with their cherished and time-honored principle, viz., absolute voluntarism in religious institutions and operations.\n\n(3.) We, as Baptists, who have in days past, suffered persecution and prosecution for conscience sake, in consequence of the union of Church and State in systems of government, regard any and every appropriation of funds derived from taxation of the whole people for purposes of civil administration in aid of denominational or sectarian schools or institutions of any kind under denominational control, as not only demonstrably wrong in principle and unjust, but as a violation of the fundamental principle of absolute separation of Church and State, which has been agreed on, tacitly at least, as one of the corner stones of our constitutional system. The provisions of the British North America Act in the interest of Separate Schools in Ontario and Quebec will surely not be pleaded in support of practices adapted to weaken and contravene throughout the Dominion at large this most important feature of our constitution.\n\n(4.) We, therefore, as Baptists, beg leave respectfully, but most earnestly, to protest against the establishment of such a system of distribution of public funds in aid of denominational Indian schools, as that said to be contemplated by your Government, and to submit that whatever changes are made in the matter should be in the direction of discontinuance of all such grants at the earliest practicable moment. In support of this protest and memorial permit us to urge, in addition to the foregoing, the following considerations:\n\n(a.) The inherent absurdity, if you will pardon the expression, of such a method. We are well assured that in this matter the Government are sincerely desirous of promoting the moral and religious welfare of the Indians. But consider how ineffective and even harmful such a system must be in relation to these very designs. The Methodists, for instance, in common with other denominations called \"Evangelical,\" firmly believe that the doctrinal teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are based on deadly error and tend directly to foster ignorance, superstition, and moral and spiritual darkness in the minds of those who are brought under their influence. The Roman Catholics, in their turn, hold substantially the same views, and if possible even more strongly, with regard to the tenets and effects of Evangelicalism. And yet the Government hopes to christianize the Indians by taxing Methodists for the propagation of Roman Catholic teachings and Roman Catholics for the propagation of Methodism, and Baptists and many others who are neither Methodists nor Roman Catholics for the propagation of the views of both.\n\n(b.) The mischievous and dangerous tendency of such a system putting as it does, a premium upon mere numbers in the rival schools, to lead, if not to actual misrepresentations, at least to the most unfair and vicious methods of competition, and the holding out of wrong and demoralizing inducements to Indian parents to permit their children to be enrolled in the respective schools. We think that the Government cannot be wholly unaware that already missionaries representing rival schools sometimes suspect and accuse each other of resorting to unworthy bribes and other expedients in order to enlarge their rolls. The moral effects of such rivalries upon the minds of the Indians themselves may readily be imagined.\n(c.) The system lacks completeness and finality. All admit that it is in the highest degree desirable that such a system should be adopted as will effect the complete civilization and enlightenment of the Indians, not simply ultimately but within the briefest possible period. Now, though some very encouraging progress is reported from time to time in the industrial training of the north west Indians, the most sanguine friend of the present methods can hardly hope to see the 17,000 or 18,000 Indians in the North-west, to say nothing of those in British Columbia and other provinces, transformed into intelligent and industrious citizens within the next half century. It is not to be hoped for, that under any system of State-aided sectarian schools that can be devised, the work of educating the young Indians as a whole, will be overtaken in a century, to say nothing of their moral and religious transformation. But if this be so, it follows that the establishment of the system proposed would really take on the characteristics of perpetuity, ineffectiveness and hopelessness so far as any complete or satisfactory results are concerned.\n\n(d.) If it be said that some progress is better than none, and that the adoption of the view we advocate would lead to a falling off in the amount of work which is now being done for the uplifting of the Indians, we make bold to reply:\n\n(1.) That it would be a poor compliment to the zeal and liberality of Canadian Christians to believe that their efforts for the moral and spiritual welfare of the aborigines in their own land are dependent upon the aid derived from compulsory taxation by the State. We have such faith in voluntaryism in religious work, a belief well founded upon what is now being done in foreign lands, that we feel sure that the withdrawal of the aid hitherto granted by the Government would lead to redoubled liberality and zeal in the work of Indian missions.\n\n(2.) As to the educational work which properly belongs to the State, we ask whether the time is not come when very much more should be done than has hitherto been done in this direction? May we not, without presumption, direct the attention of the Government and all friends of the Indian to the great work that is now being done in the United States?\n\nAfter having for a century tried methods somewhat similar to those now employed in Canada, the United States Government has at last, as is well known, adopted vigorous and hopeful measures for the final and complete solution of the whole Indian problem within a generation. Acting on the advice of the Lake Mohonk Conference, a society representing the statesmanship, philanthropy and religious intelligence and zeal of the friends of the Indian in the Republic, the Indian Department is now, with every prospect of success, following out a radically new departure in its treatment of the Indians.\n\nThe two great principles underlying this new policy are universal compulsory education of Indian children and youth, at the earliest practicable moment, and the breaking up of the Reservation, and with it, as a not remote consequence, of the tribal system, and the distribution of the land to the Indians in severalty. They are, in short, to be clothed with the duties and responsibilities, and with all the privileges too, of citizenship, under such conditions as may seem best adapted to make citizens of them at the earliest possible moment. The work of Christianizing them will, of course, be left with the churches where it properly belongs. If the Provinces of Canada find it advisable and expedient, as a matter of sentiment, to provide for the compulsory elementary education of all the children who are to become their future citizens, ought not the Dominion itself, a fortiori, to do no less for the children of the Indians who are here already? Let the Government thus settle the question of Indian education, and the churches may safely be trusted to do the work of Christianization. But the other day the Methodist Conference of the United States, assembled at Omaha, unanimously decided that the General Conference should hereafter \"decline either to make a petition to or to receive from the National Government any moneys for educational work among the Indians.\" We are sure the Methodists of Canada will not be slow to emulate so good an example. In fact, some of them are already doing so.\n\nWhile the members of the Ministerial Association whom this committee represents make no claim to speak for anybody but themselves, they are warranted by the whole history of Baptist principles, and by their general knowledge of the sentiments of their brethren all over the Dominion in their conviction that they voice the minds of the whole body of Canadian Baptists. Steps are being taken to have the question submitted to the various local associations shortly to meet, and also to the General Convention of the Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, which meets in October. We have no doubt that the protest will be heartily concurred in by all these representative bodies.\n\nWe deem it proper to forward printed copies of this memorial and protest to the members of the House of Commons and Senate.\n\nWe are, Sir, with great respect,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nTHEODORE H.

By whom said monies were spent, that is whether by the church or the Government, and if partially by one and partially by the other, the amount spent by each to be separately shewn.\n4. The exact terms upon which each school is conducted, and the instances in which the same have been departed from, and the nature and reasons for such departures.\n5. The yearly expenditure by the Government on Indian education, shewing in brief the yearly amount paid to schools grouped under the names of the churches controlling them.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, 24th February, 1897.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit the accompanying statement, which shows:\n\n1. All the Day, Boarding and Industrial schools in the Dominion, grouped by Provinces according to the different religious denominations under whose charge such schools are conducted, as well as the undenominational schools:\n\n2. The money spent on buildings and sites and for management and maintenance in each case, shown separately, and the total amount expended by the Government for each school from the 1st July 1877 to the 30th June 1896.\n\nIn treating of the relations which the different Churches bear to the Government in regard to Indian education, it is to be borne in mind that the present Indian school system is the offspring of the missionary efforts of the following\nfollowing religious denominations: the Roman Catholics, Church of England, Methodists, Presbyterians, Moravian Society, Society of Friends and the New England Company. Schools were first established at the principal Indian missions, supported partly by the missionaries and partly by the Indians themselves, and without any direct aid from the Government. The first Government grant was made to Indian schools established in Quebec out of Lower Canada Funds, and in 1864 there were only two schools drawing this grant.\n\nIn 1847 the Rev. Dr Egerton Ryerson submitted, at the request of the Government, a report (copy herewith) embodying suggestions as to the best method of establishing and conducting Industrial schools for the benefit of the aboriginal Indian tribes, and it was apparently as a result of Dr Ryerson's report that two Industrial schools were established: one at Alnwick, near Coburg, and the other at Muncey, called Mount Elgin, after Lord Elgin, its founder, and placed in charge of the Methodist Missionary Society. Both schools were mainly supported by voluntary contributions from the tribes in Ontario (Upper Canada) each of which devoted one-fourth of their Annuity to this object, with the exception of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte, whose village schools were then\nthen in a very flourishing condition; the Wyandottes of Anderdon, who received no annuity, and the Six Nations, whose educational wants were entirely provided for by the New England Company.\n\nAs far back as 1854, the Superintendent General, Mr Oliphant, called the attention of the Government to the advantages of a well defined educational system, and to how highly desirable it was that, if possible, the Department should exercise some authority in enforcing the attendance of children.\n\nThe Alnwick school was afterwards closed and merged into the Mount Elgin school, the policy of centralization of these two establishments having been suggested by Lord Bury in 1855, when Superintendent General.\n\nThe religious denominations, having in the first instance established schools among the Indians, they have continued to be recognized as exercising more or less control in their management, varying in degree in the case of the different denominations and schools, so that at present the recognized footing upon which they are conducted is as follows:\n\nAs regards Day schools: Roman Catholic. The full salary of the teacher, where salary is paid, is paid wholly, or in part, from the school vote or the funds of the Band for whose benefit the school is carried on. In most cases buildings are provided\nprovided by the Government or the Band, but repairs, fuel and school material are furnished by the Department or the Indians, and in the older Provinces the cost of inspection by the Separate or Public School Inspectors is paid for from the same source, and the Department has, until recently allowed the Church the privilege of nominating and appointing the teachers. This privilege has, however, lately been curtailed, the Department requiring that when practicable the nominees shall be possessed of teacher's certificates, recognized by the Provincial school system. The reason for not making this requirement obligatory is, that duly certificated teachers cannot always be had when a vacancy occurs, who are willing to accept the remuneration offered for the work required of them.\n\nBesides the Day schools the Roman Catholics have established Mission Boarding schools on or in the vicinity of Indian Reserves in Ontario and the Western Provinces, which are directly in charge of members of the different religious orders of the Church. Such schools in Manitoba and the Territories are now paid a per capita grant of $72 per pupil up to the authorized number of pupils, such grant to cover the cost of tuition, management and maintenance, with the exception of school material. In Ontario and British Columbia the Government grant\ngrant is $60 per annum. The buildings have, in all cases, been provided by the Church with, or without the assistance of the Government. The statement shows to what extent the Department has made contributions for this purpose. These schools have in some instances superseded day schools on Reserves and receive day pupils, whose tuition is paid for at the rate of $12 per capita per annum. Such schools conform to the Regulations of the Department as to the course of study, dietary, clothing, admissions and discharges, and are subject to inspection by authorized officers of the Department. Special grants have, from time to time, been made for repairing, enlarging and equipping these schools.\n\nThe Roman Catholics are now in charge of 7 out of the 16 Industrial schools distributed as follows: one in Manitoba at St Boniface, two in the N.W.T. at Qu'Appelle and High River, and four in British Columbia, at Kootenay, Kamloops, Williams Lake and Kuper Island. These schools are all carried on under the per capita system, the grant varying according to the locality in which the school is situated. The following is a copy of the Order-in-Council of the 22nd October 1892, providing for the carrying on of Industrial schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories:\n\n\"On a report dated 17th of October 1892, from the Superintendent General...\"\nGeneral of Indian Affairs stating\nthat it is advisable to make a\nchange in the manner of carrying on\nthose Industrial schools in the\nNorth West that are wholly support-\ned by the Government. The cost of\nthese institutions is larger, it is\nthought, than that for which they\nmight be conducted, and with a view\nto more economical management it is\nadvisable and necessary to adopt\nsome method which would relieve the\npressure of the present expenditure\nand at the same time keep up the\nschools to an equal standard of\nefficiency and usefulness.\n\nThe Minister considers\nthat when the whole cost of an In-\nstitution is directly borne by the\nGovernment the same economy by those\nin immediate charge is not used as\nwould be employed under other con-\nditions, demands, under the present\nsystem, are frequently made for arti-\ncles and supplies whereas if the\namount to be expended were to take\nthe form more of an annual per cap-\nita grant more effort in the way of\neconomizing would be made.\n\nThe Minister states that\nthe actual cost to the Government, as\nshown under the head of Industrial\nschools does not represent the total\nexpenditure\n\"expenditure which the present system entails, as there is a small expense in the purchasing and inspection of supplies to be added.\n\n\"The accounts for the past year (1890-91) show that the per capita cost of each child at the Industrial schools under consideration was:\n\n\"Qu'Appelle $134.67\n\"Battleford 175.45\n\"High River 185.55\n\n\"The rate per capita, it is thought, is higher than it would be if a forced system of economy were exercised, and that the best way to effect the desired decrease would be to place the schools under a per capita grant system similar to that now in operation at Elkhorn and St Paul's under Church of England authorities, St Boniface and Kootenay under Roman Catholic Church authorities. The per capita system under which these schools are operated by the religious bodies has been found to work satisfactorily.\n\n\"The Minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to the Industrial schools in operation in the North West Territories, and\nand to such other similar Institutions as may hereafter be established, as soon as, in the opinion of the Indian Department said institutions are in proper running order, at rates to be fixed upon as being fair and just, viz:\n\nThe buildings are to be kept in repair jointly by the Government and the management, the former to furnish the material and the latter to perform the labor:\n\nAll books and appliances, that is, maps, globes &c for educational purposes, to be furnished by the Government:\n\nAll charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses to be paid by the management, out of the per capita grant:\n\nThe management not in any event to charge children or their parents for being allowed to attend such Institutions:\n\nThe Government to pay to the management an annual grant for each pupil up to the number authorized by the Indian Department, as represented by the Commissioner at the following rates:\n\nQu'Appelle\nQu'Appelle $115:00\nRegina 120:00\nBattleford 140:00\nHigh River 130:00\n\nFor this consideration\nthe management shall agree to conform\nto the rules of the Indian Department, as laid down from time to time,\nand to keep the schools at a certain\nstandard of instruction, dietary and\ndomestic comfort, and that the Inspectors and officers of the Indian\nDepartment may at any time inspect\nand report upon the Institutions.\n\nPayment to be made only for\nchildren authorized by the Commissioner to be admitted, and in accordance with the scale now governing\npayments to schools under the per capita system, which may be altered\nfrom time to time to suit circumstances, and no children, white or\nIndian, are to be admitted save under authority of the Commissioner.\n\nThe Minister deems it desirable to put this system into operation after a reasonable time is given to the Church authorities, and he recommends that the first of July 1893 be fixed as the date upon which the per capita allowances shall commence to be payable.\n\nThe Committee submit the above for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nIn\nIn addition to the per capita grant, the following concessions have been made to schools established under the above Order-in-Council:\n\n1st. That account books, stationery and an allowance for postage will be given those institutions.\n\n2nd. That strict accounts of all expenditure incurred on behalf of each school, supported by Vouchers, will be required by the Department to be kept in each institution, and at the expiration of each year, a revision of the rate of capitation may be made, should it appear that such a step is considered necessary.\n\n3rd. In the event of pupils over and above the number already authorized and estimated for on the capitation system, being admitted into a school, and for whom no provision has been made, beds for occupation by such additional pupils are to be given by the Department, if they cannot be made in the Institution.\n\n4th. In the event of the erection of new buildings at the expense of the Department becoming necessary the cost of the heating apparatus to be included in such cost.\n\n5th. Agricultural and other implements, when considered by the Department as being unfit for further use, may be disposed of by the officers of\nII\n\nof the Institution in such manner as may be thought proper by them.\n\n6th. The Department will agree to provide sufficient grazing land for the use of each institution.\n\n7th. The Department agrees to provide sufficient fencing material for the first enclosures required, but the fences must be renewed at the expense of the Institution.\n\n8th. Medical attendance as directed by the Commissioner for the pupils of each Institution will be provided and paid for by the Department.\n\n9th. An advance of a sum to be agreed upon will, until further advice, be made by the Department to each Institution at the commencement of each quarter, to admit of the current expenses of that quarter being defrayed.\n\nThe distinction between Boarding and Industrial schools is more in evidence in the amount of the grant allowed than in any other particular, although the latter are considered as belonging to a higher class. The Industrial schools were originally designed to give instruction in trades, two in addition to farming being required to be taught. The instruction given at Industrial schools is supposed to fit the\nthe pupils for earning their own living, and\nthe following extract from the last Annual\nReport indicates the policy hitherto pur-\nsued by the Department in regard to the\nretention of pupils and their final dis-\ncharge:\n\n\"The policy of the Department, as\nto the retention of pupils has been,\nthat the boys should remain at the\nindustrial schools until they attain\nan age at which, in addition to their\nhaving obtained a rudimentary edu-\ncation and some trade or calling, or\nat least some knowledge of carpentry\ntheir characters shall have been\nsufficiently formed as to ensure\nas much as possible against their re-\nturning to the uncivilized mode of\nlife. In the event of a boy returning\nto his Reserve, and for the majority\nfor the present at least, there ap-\npears to be no alternative - leave of\nabsence is granted; a suitable loca-\ntion of land is selected, if proper\nprovision is not otherwise made a\nhouse is built by the boy himself,\nand some simple furniture, made while\nhe is still a member of the Institu-\ntion is given him. In addition to\nthis, if these are not had through the\nparents, cattle and implements are\nprovided to enable the young fellow\nto continue in the course followed\nat the institution from which he\ncomes\ncomes. It is considered advisable,\nwhere pupils are advanced in years\nand capable of providing for them-\nselves, to bring about a matrimonial\nalliance, either at the time of being\ndischarged from the school, or as\nsoon after as possible; this course\ncommends itself for various reasons.\n\nThe foregoing remarks, having\nreference to the manner in which the\nday, boarding and industrial schools are\ncarried on by the Roman Catholic Church,\nare also applicable to schools of the same\nclass carried on by other religious denom-\ninations engaged in missionary and edu-\ncational work among the Indians, and give\nan outline of the general plan followed by\nthe Department in dealing with its schools,\nand the relations existing with the differ-\nent religious denominations engaged in\nIndian school work.\n\nThe accompanying statements\nshow the number of Indian schools conducted\nby the different religious denominations,\nwhere situated, by what denomination carried\non, salary or grant provided, from what fund\npaid, the amount contributed by each den-\nomination towards the salary, the atten-\ndance at each class of school by Provin-\nces and according to Denominations.\n\nNo Regulations have been\nadopted or issued by the Department appli-\ncable to all its schools, as has been done\nby the Provincial Governments and by the\nSuperintendent.\nSuperintendent of Indian schools in the United States, nor are such Rules and Regulations absolutely necessary under the present school system. Several schemes have been suggested, some of which have been submitted to Council, but none have been adopted, with the exception of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children (compulsory attendance at school) which, although approved by Council, have not as yet been enforced.\n\nIn connection with the above the undersigned begs respectfully to submit the following remarks in regard to Indian school matters:\n\nThe Census shows that the Indians are not decreasing in numbers. They are here to stay and the question naturally arises, what are we to do with them? and what obligations devolve upon the Government in regard to providing means for their advancement and civilization? Are they always to remain a charge on the country, or shall we, by educating the rising generation, endeavor to make them self-supporting and fitted for the duties and privileges of civilized life? The Department, recognizing its responsibility in regard to the future welfare of its Indian wards, has established and is now providing for and carrying on three classes of Indian schools.\n\nApart\nApart from what is being done in the United States for Indians, the undersigned finds that in all the British colonies, where a native population still remains, steps have been taken for the establishment of Industrial Training schools which are supported wholly, or in part, by the Government, and it is now universally conceded that such Institutions afford the best known means of training the aborigines in habits of industry and the formation of character.\n\nThe Indian population of the Dominion is stated as about 100,000, which would give, according to the Census, a school population of from 20,000 to 25,000 (It might be mentioned here that the number of Treaty Indians in the Dominion does not exceed 65,000).\n\nThere are close upon 10,000 Indian children now upon the school enrollment with an average daily attendance of over 5,000, or about 20% of the total number of school age, leaving about 75% to 80% who are deriving no benefit from the present school system.\n\nTo reach the greatest number, day schools have been established on nearly all Reserves where enough children of school age to attend could be found, but the indifference of Indian parents to education, their nomadic habits and poverty and want of proper clothing prevent much advance being made at present.\n\nIrregular attendance is the greatest\ngreatest drawback, while the inefficiency and listlessness of teachers and lack of interest displayed by some of the Agents is another.\n\nThe Indians in some localities, while showing little interest in sending their children to school regularly are not averse to having them educated, and the correspondence on file in the Department will bear me out in saying that they are now awakening to the necessity for having schools in their midst.\n\nThe Regulations for Compulsory Education, lately passed, will when enforced as needed, have a most salutary effect in increasing the attendance and making it more regular and will the undersigned be convinced, dispel the idea that has hitherto been prevalent amongst them that it mattered little whether they took advantage of the educational facilities offered them by the Government or not.\n\nOur Agents should evince a livelier interest in education,\u2014many of them look upon the work now required of them in connection with school matters as an extra duty which is performed in a very perfunctory manner,\u2014especially in the cases of schools conducted by religious bodies. They should be informed that it is useless for the Department to expend large sums of money for the maintenance of schools unless its local officers bestir themselves in the matter of Indian education and render the Department every assistance.\nassistance in their power, as without their hearty co-operation, good and lasting results cannot be obtained. A word in seasons from our Agents should have great weight with teachers, parents and children alike. They should not content themselves with making merely a hurried visit to the schools periodically, but when on the Reserves they should visit the homes of parents and explain what the Department is doing and requires them to do in the matter of education.\n\nThe Missionaries too, might do much to improve the present state of affairs. At one of the day schools visited by the undersigned, he saw an example of what could be done by a zealous missionary for the cause of education; he refers to Roman Catholic school on the Garden River Reserve, where there were 42 children present on the day of his inspection, while only three pupils were at the Church of England school on the same Reserve, they having no resident missionary. About an equal number of children of school age belong to both denominations.\n\nIt has been suggested that the granting of a small prize for regular attendance of pupils would have a good effect. This suggestion is worthy of consideration and should, if possible, be arranged for. The money prizes given by the Mississaugas\nMississaugas of the Credit are a great incentive to the pupils, both in regard to regularity and proficiency.\n\nOur schools are chiefly denominational and receive assistance from various religious bodies, while others have been established and are carried on wholly by the Government under Section 76 sub-sec: \", which reads as follows:\n\n\"76: The Chief or Chiefs of any Band in Council may frame, subject to confirmation by the Governor in Council, rules and regulations in respect of the subjects following that is to say:\n\n\"(A) As to what religious denomination the teachers of the school established on the Reserve shall belong to: Provided that he shall be of the same denomination as the majority of the Band; and that the Protestant minority may likewise have a separate school, with the approval of and under the regulations made by the Governor in Council\".\n\nThe Church authorities have up to the present, with few exceptions, exercised full control in the appointment of teachers and they fixed the course of study also. The teachers appointed by the various religious bodies engaged in the work of Indian education, are not as a rule\nrule well fitted for the work of teaching, not so much from want of scholarship as from the lack of ability to adapt their instruction to the children's needs, owing to their not having received the proper training. Many of these teachers are no doubt earnest workers, who have at heart the spiritual welfare of those under their charge and would, if qualified, render efficient service to the Department. In addition to their lack of professional training and experience, many of the present teachers have their missionary duties to perform, which take up their time and attention.\n\nAs a remedy the undersigned would suggest that communication be had with Normal School Principals, and the insertion of an advertisement in the educational journals published in the different provinces, describing the kind of teachers desired for Indian work, giving localities of Reserves, salaries to be paid and such other information as would enable the intending applicant to decide whether he or she would care to enter upon the work and requesting such Principals to endeavor to induce suitable persons to apply for positions in the school service. Applications for positions should be submitted to the Department, with testimonials and certificates of qualifications and no unqualified teacher should be employed. No changes should be made in teachers without consulting the Department.\nDepartment and receiving its sanction.\n\nMany of the Indians on the outlying Reserves in Ontario and the Lower Provinces are necessarily away from the vicinity of their schools for long periods at certain seasons of the year, taking their families with them. These absences which cannot well be avoided, seriously interfere with the progress of the pupils, as by the time they return to school, they have lost nearly, if not all, they had previously acquired. Teachers are not to blame for this, and the undersigned does not well see how it can be remedied so long as these periodical migrations continue.\n\nSchools are established on some Reserves where the number of children of school age is small and the average attendance is not such as to justify the continuance of a school, but the closing of a school so situated would cause dissatisfaction, and the only remedy that suggests itself to the undersigned would be to provide for an increased number of pupils at some of the existing Boarding schools then and the closing of such schools. The undersigned would suggest that the lowest average attendance that should entitle a school to be continued should be placed at 6 or 7 pupils, as that number could be provided for at a boarding school for about what it costs to maintain a day school.\n\nMost\nMost of the Indians so situated are Roman Catholic and there is only one Industrial school conducted by that denomination east Winnipeg at Wikwemikong, at which accommodation could be found for 150 to 200 pupils, 90 pupils being provided for at present. The Fort William school also has room for more pupils than are now provided for.\n\nThe Indians of Quebec and the Lower Provinces have no facilities provided for their industrial training. The attendance and progress at most of the schools in these Provinces is very discouraging. The Indians are poorly off and could contribute nothing towards the establishment of a suitable training school, but the necessity for such a school is felt by the intelligent members of the different Bands, and if, in the future, anything could be done in the direction of securing the advantages of an Industrial school, it would be a step in the right direction. A large amount of money is contributed annually for the purchase of supplies for destitute Indians and for seed grain for the Indians of these provinces, most of which could be spent much more advantageously in obtaining industrial training for the rising generation.\n\nReturning to the question of day\nday schools and the teachers engaged at such schools the undersigned begs to remark that the salaries paid are not sufficient to induce the right kind of persons to look for such employment, and most of these who seek such situations are generally unfitted for the work, being either lacking in energy or qualifications. This does not, however, in many instances apply to the female teachers, who are as a rule contented to receive even the small salaries offered by the Department. The question of salaries is hard to arrange and is not now in a satisfactory condition. Teachers having large, well conducted schools receive no more than those in charge of schools where the average attendance is so small as to scarcely justify the school being kept open and where little if any good results from their teaching. The undersigned thinks that steps should be taken to remedy this evil, and would suggest that teachers of schools where the average attendance is over a certain number, say 25 as in the North West and Manitoba, they should be paid an additional fee of $12 per annum for each pupil over that number and up to a maximum of 42; and that teachers of such schools, where the average for the year has been below 12 should be paid a smaller salary than many of them are now receiving, viz $300. At present, however\nthe money available for school purposes does not admit of any such changes being made.\n\nIn some cases the small average attendance is beyond the control of the teacher, but such instances are the exception, and the low average is generally attributable to their lack of interest or inability as well as to the indifference of parents. Energetic, painstaking teachers are nearly always successful in securing the attendance of a large percentage of the children of school age who live within a reasonable distance of the school.\n\nPoverty is another great drawback which some of our schools have to contend with. The Indians on some Reserves are so badly off that the children are only half clothed and fed. They often have to go a considerable distance to school, arriving there wet and hungry, and when school is dismissed in the morning they have to return home, having brought nothing with them for lunch, and do not come back in the afternoon and perhaps not for some days. If a certain sum could be set apart to purchase a small quantity of biscuits or pork, peas and flour for making soup, so that each child that went hungry to school in the morning might have a bowl of hot, nourishing soup at noon, regular attendance would be sure to follow. The undersigned has seen this experiment successfully tried at a school he visited on the North Shore.\nShore of Lake Superior, and at the Garden River Roman Catholic school. Biscuits are supplied in Manitoba and the North West, to school children, and at many of the poor schools in Great Britain and on the continent, a warm meal is provided, and in such schools in Paris, breakfast is also given. Education has no charms for the hungry.\n\nAccommodation should, if possible, be provided for teachers of Indian schools on Reserves which are isolated, as no suitable lodging can be had in such localities. Two rooms at least should be added to the school building and small plot of ground should be fenced off and set apart for a garden. This would be an object lesson for the pupils who could attend to it. There is no reason why some industrial training might not be given even at the day schools, as is done at some of the schools in the North West.\n\nSome of the Bands whose schools now receive a grant have sufficient capital to pay liberally for the education of their children. If this were done, funds would then be available when required for the establishment of new schools if necessary, or for increasing the salaries of deserving teachers, or procuring additional assistance.\n\nOf the religious bodies which are engaged in educational work, among the Indians, the Methodists as a class contribute most liberally towards that\nthat object, paying one-half the salaries of the schools conducted under their auspices. The Church of England in most cases does the same, while the Department has no official knowledge of what the Roman Catholics do in such cases. A few schools are carried on wholly by religious sects without any aid from the Department, save occasionally a moderate supply of school material or a small outlay for repairs and furniture.\n\nWhen denominational schools were first established too much power and control was placed in the hands of the Church authorities, and it will require the exercise of considerable tact to curtail these powers and withdraw some of the concessions made to them. Under the old system, all that the Department required was that quarterly returns showing the attendance should be sent in, and the grants were frequently paid even without compliance with this rule. They are all now complying with the regulations of the Department as regards the various returns which are called for, but the question of the appointment of teachers remains to be settled. Teachers until lately were removed and replaced without consulting the Department, and complaints of incompetency were made without action being taken by them. This is being remedied, but it has led to very unsatisfactory results and seriously interfered with the educational policy of the Department.\nThe system of inspection, as now carried on by the Public School Inspectors is, compared with its cost, of little if any practical value to the schools visited or to the Department. The annual expenditure for this service is close upon $1000.\n\nThe undersigned expressed his views already in regard to this matter and he begs to call your attention to it again and to state that although certain contingencies might arise when it would be well to call upon a Public School Inspector for a report upon a particular school, he considers that the semi-annual visits of the Provincial officers who only take a cursory glance at the school, could with advantage be discontinued on the score of economy, reserving the privilege of calling upon an inspector to make such special visit as above referred to. The following is the text of the Memo referred to with the notes of the Hon. Mr Daly thereon:\n\nOTTAWA 28th June 1895\n\n\"The undersigned begs to submit the following remarks in reference to the inspection of Indian schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces by the Public School Inspectors of these Provinces.\n\n\"In October 1880 an Order-in-Council was passed authorizing negotiations to be opened up with the Local Government of each of the above Provinces through the Secretary of...\"\nof State, having for their object the securing for the Indian schools in such Province the same system of inspection at the hands of the local Government officers as the Public schools of the Province undergo. The results of such negotiations being that Orders-in-Council were passed by the different local Governments fixing the terms and conditions upon which such inspections were to be made semi-annually and the Inspector was to make a visit and report state the condition of the school and the progress of the pupils and offer any suggestions and recommendations relative to the future management of the school, which he considered desirable.\n\nRegulations on the subject of Indian schools were approved by the Minister of Education for Ontario and this Department, which read as follows:-\n\n\"The Department of Indian Affairs for the Dominion having expressed a desire to place the Indian schools in Ontario under the inspection of the Public School Inspectors for the Province, the following Regulations have been adopted:\n\nI. The teachers are required to have a speaking acquaintance with\n\"with the Indian language and are consequently likely in most cases to be Indians; but the instruction should as soon as possible be given in English.\n\n\"II. Teachers shall receive their certificates from the County or District Board of Examiners, which shall be granted discretionary powers as to the attainments required: It will be found however, for some time to come that the standard of \"High School Entrance\" will be as high as is attainable.\n\n\"III. The subjects of study in these schools need not at present embrace more than the following, viz: reading, writing, object lessons, elementary drawing (from cards) elementary arithmetic (the four simple rules) elementary geography (the maps of the World and Dominion of Canada) spelling and grammar (formation and analysis of simple sentences).\n\n\"IV. The Indian Department will furnish all text-books and apparatus for use in the schools.\n\n\"V. The schools shall be placed under the inspectorial supervision of the County Inspectors, in conjunction with the Indian Agent, who shall together also have a controlling influence in the selection of\nof teachers, except in the case of\n\"such schools as are established by\n\"any religious denomination under the\n\"regulations of the Department of\n\"Indian Affairs, and in such schools\n\"the selection of teachers shall con-\n\"tinue to be made as heretofore; but\n\"each of the Inspectors shall state in\n\"his reports of inspection, his opin-\n\"ion upon the competency of the\n\"teacher of each denominational\n\"Indian school inspected by him\".\n\"A fee of six dollars shall\n\"be paid the Inspectors and legitim-\n\"ate travelling expenses allowed for\n\"two visits per annum.\"\n\n(SGD) Geo:W:Ross\nMinister of Education\n\n\"It will be seen from these\nRegulations that the Programme of\nStudies as then laid down was much\nlower than that at present called for\nand that the qualification for teach-\ners was correspondingly low.\n\n\"At the time the negotiations\nwere entered into with the various\nlocal Governments for the inspection\nof Indian schools by their Public\nSchool inspectors, the Department had\nnot much experience in the management\nof Indian schools. Although many of\nits schools had for a long time been\nin operation, they were nearly if not all\nall conducted by the various religious denominations. Quarterly school returns were called for and received very irregularly in most instances. Payment of the teachers' salaries was not being, as now, contingent upon the receipt of such return. The Agents of the Department were not then required to make periodical visits and reports on the schools in their Agency, and no such reports were received; the only mention then made of them was a short sentence or paragraph sometimes occurring in their Annual Report on the affairs of their Agency. Appropriations were annually made for school purposes, salaries paid, material supplied, buildings put up and repaired and fuel provided but the Department had little if any knowledge as to what good was resulting from such outlay.\n\nThe present system of inspection has been in force for 13 years in some of the Provinces and in all for more than 10 years. The expenditure for these semi-annual inspections has been close upon $1000 a year for Ontario and Quebec alone, or all of the money voted by Parliament for the cost of inspection, fuel, cleaning, books and maps for the whole of the schools of the two Provinces, while nearly, if not all of the information...\ninformation in the Inspectors reports\nis now received by the Department\nthrough its Agents under the new\nRegulations, which require them to\nvisit and inspect our schools, and\nfrom other sources, long before the\nInspector's reports reach the Depart-\nment, the Reports of some of the\ninspectors being delayed frequently\nfor months, so that when received, it\nis too late for the requisite action\nto be taken. Most of their suggestions\nrelate to the repairs to schoolhouses\nand outbuildings and the supply of\nschool material, and should be forward-\ned immediately after their inspection.\n\nPublic school inspectors\nreports on the qualifications of\nteachers and progress of the pupils are\nalso of slight value to the Department\nas many of our schools are so remote\nand the salaries so small it is diffi-\ncult to obtain properly qualified\nteachers to take positions, while the\nirregular attendance of children at\nsuch schools is greatly against their\nprogress. The Public school inspectors\nhave so far failed to better the con-\ndition of affairs, and improvement can\nonly be looked for by the exercise of\nvigilance and energy on the part of\nthe Department and its own officers, and\nnot from the paid officials of other\nGovernments over whom the Department\nhas\nHas no control. The undersigned is confident that one visit from an official from headquarters who knows the requirements of the Department in regard to Indian schools would be productive of better results than any number of inspections by an Inspector who is not even allowed to communicate directly with the Department, and who takes his orders from his own Government. This Department has no power to command the services of these Inspectors and they only make their inspections when it suits their convenience or that of their Government.\n\nThe most we can at present expect is that our teachers should use their best endeavors to instruct the children in the elementary branches, and that this instruction be given in English, and that they should use every means in their power to induce parents to send their children to school. The chief fault with our teachers is their neglect of duty, where they are interested in the work, good results are obtained, both as regards progress and attendance.\n\nThe class of work done by our schools does not call for Inspectors holding Provincial Certificates. Any of our Agents of ordinary education and intelligence are competent, on hearing\nhearing the school children go through their exercises, to give an opinion as to whether they are deriving any benefit from their attendance or not, and they should also be able to report on the fitness of the teacher for the position. In addition to this the undersigned begs to state that it is only through the officers of the Department it can look for any improvement. They are now aware that school matters form one of their most important duties and with very few exceptions are attending regularly and carefully to this duty.\n\nAs an instance of the cost of inspection the undersigned would refer to Mr Separate School Inspector White's account for inspecting the Catholic Schools from Manitoulin Island up to Fort William, which with visits to two schools in Eastern Ontario, amounted to $188, or $376 for the year. Inspector Kelly's account for visiting the Six Nations and New Credit schools, comes to $75 or $152 for the year, while Mr McCaig, who visited two Protestant schools on Manitoulin Island and Shingwauk Home, renders a bill of $34.50. The cost of these inspections foots up to $300 for the half year. The teachers of the denominational schools are appointed by the various denominations and the department.\n\"Department has been in the habit of approving of their nominees. Very few of these teachers hold anything higher than a Permit and in many instances even that qualification is lacking.\n\n\"Some of the teachers are Indians with only an imperfect knowledge of English, who find it easier to give their explanations in the Indian language than in English, which will account for the slow progress in English made by the pupils, who although able to repeat sentences in English off their book, do not understand what they read.\n\n\"The Public School Inspectors no matter how painstaking their examination and inspection cannot remedy these defects and both teachers, parents and pupils are well aware that they are not officers of the Department and they have little to fear from their reports. What they do require to feel is that the Department is taking a personal interest in their work and its results and that good work will be appreciated and that carelessness will lead to dismission or the closing of the schools. This can only be taught by the Department itself through its officers.\n\n\"Other disadvantages also exist in the present system. The inspections in many instances are made too...\"\ntoo early in the fall and too late in\nthe spring for Indian schools, as they\nwere not fairly in operation at such\ntimes. The Indians in some cases mi-\ngrate in the spring long before the\nPublic schools close and do not re-\nturn until some time after they are\nre-opened in the fall, and the Inspec-\ntors rarely, if ever, make a special vis-\nit for the purpose of inspecting\nan Indian school, but take them in\ntheir regular round of duty as Pro-\nvincial Inspectors and charge this\nDepartment, in most instances, with full\ntravelling expenses. These inspection\nreports are published in the Depart-\nmental reports of the Ontario Govern-\nment, and most likely in the other Pro-\nvincial Blue books, -this the under-\nsigned considers to be unfair to our\nDepartment as our schools cannot be\nexpected to compare favorably with the\nOntario schools or the Public schools\nof other Provinces.\n\nTwo sets of Inspectors are\nrequired now, -the Public School and\nSeparate school Inspector both going\nover the same ground, but visiting\nonly their own schools, while if an\nofficer of the Department were to\nmake a visit, neither denomination\ncould object, as they all recognize\nof the Department\nthe right to make any inspection it\nconsiders necessary.\n\nWith\n\"With regard to the inspection of Industrial schools, the undersigned begs to repeat that very little, if any benefit to the Department is derived from such inspection, as the Inspector merely makes a hurried examination of the pupils in their studies and does not make the minute examination into the details connected with the management of such Institutions which the Department requires and ought to be furnished with.\n\n\"The Inspectors's reports appear to be written solely with a view to brevity, very few of them making any remarks, and when they do so, only repeating their previous suggestions, many of which are wholly impracticable for Indian schools.\n\n\"If, however, it is not considered expedient to dispense with the services of the Public school Inspectors altogether the undersigned is of opinion that they should be more under the immediate control of the Department than they are now, and that they should not only visit the schools when instructed by the Department to do so. If this concession could be obtained a great deal of unnecessary expense and many useless trips would be avoided.\"\nOTTAWA 13th July 1895\n\nMemo: for the Minister\n\nI think we should be very careful before taking the step you advocate. Although we may save some money by the transaction that is not everything to be considered. We have the general public to consider and the necessity for our affairs being conducted as a close corporation is not apparent. There must have been good and grave reasons moving the Dept: when the present arrangement was made and I would not like to disturb them without consulting Council in the matter.\n\nSgd T.M.D.\n\n17-6-95\n\nIn connection with the Memorandum of the 25th ultimo herewith relative to the present system of inspection of Indian schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces by the Public School Inspectors of those Provinces, the undersigned would respectfully recommend that for the reasons set forth in the Memorandum above referred to, the semi-annual inspections by the Public School Inspectors be discontinued and that they should visit our schools only when called upon to do so by the Department.\n\nAfter a further experience of three years, the undersigned is still of the same opinion in regard to the system of Inspection followed by the Public school inspectors.\n\nIn Manitoba and the North West many of the schools are visited by the Inspectors of Agencies and Reserves, and Mr Betourmay; while some schools cannot possible be visited by these officers, owing to the distance they would have to travel and the other work they have to perform. All the schools on Reserves are however\nhowever, visited periodically, once a month being the rule, by our Agents. The undersigned is, however, inclined to think that Agents as a rule are opposed to make an adverse report on a school if there is any way of avoiding it, it being more than likely that such action would bring them into collision with the Missionaries and interfere with their authority among the Indians. The undersigned knows of instances where unfavorable reports have led to charges being made against the officers making them, and for this reason he considers it would be better if the principle schools, boarding and industrial, could be visited more frequently by Departmental inspectors, or some other officer detailed specially for that service.\n\nThe undersigned considers that when our inspectors do visit a school they devote too much time and attention to minute details, such as inventories, statements, returns, accounts &c and pass lightly over such high matters as the general progress, management and results obtained. An Inspector should be able to tell at a glance if proper order and discipline obtains and whether the school is well managed or not. The undersigned is convinced that the success or failure of a school depends entirely upon the executive head and not upon subordinates or surroundings. A thoroughly competent Principal will make a success of a school while\nwhile a man lacking the ability to direct and manage, no matter how well educated, will fail or be content to work on and trust to luck. When an Inspector finds an unsuccessful man in charge he should say so plainly and not leave it to the Department to try and discover where the defects exist.\n\nThere are no Inspectors for British Columbia, although the Superintendent visits as many of the Reserves as his time will allow. The schools in that Province are also visited by our Agents who no doubt have the same hesitancy as its Agents elsewhere in making too critical reports.\n\nThe undersigned cannot help expressing the opinion that he considers it at least unfortunate for the school and the Department, that Boarding and Industrial schools are not inspected at least once a year by some other officer than the Agent.\n\nThere is no one in the Department who has ever seen more than a few of our principal schools or knows how they are carrying on the work best suited to the wants of the Indians, or whether the training given is required for any particular locality. The different conditions of the Indians scattered over the Dominion call for different methods of Industrial training. In Central Ontario, attention is only given\ngiven to farming. On the Georgian Bay and North Shore of Lake Superior, farming alone would not support the Indians on most of the Reserves. In Manitoba and the North-West stock raising and fishing will be the chief means of support according to the location of the Reserves, while in British Columbia there can be little or no farming for Indians, small garden plots being about all the land they can have, but at fishing and labor, either mechanical or common, there is plenty of employment to be found. These considerations should be taken more largely into account in fixing on the industrial training to which a school is to devote more particular attention.\n\nAs previously stated the difference between boarding and industrial schools is more a matter of money than anything else, boarding schools receiving in most cases a much lower rate of Government assistance than is allowed for Industrial schools, viz: $60 to $72 per capita per annum. There is no reason why the results aimed at by Industrial schools could not be achieved by boarding schools. In some cases equally good work is done in the way of teaching and industrial training.\n\nBoarding schools were established as an advance on Reservation Day schools, where children could be removed from home influences and have the benefit of civilized surroundings without being taken...\ntaken away from their parents sight, to which many Indians made strong objections at first. A well conducted boarding school on a Reserve should have a powerful influence for good.\n\nThe policy of the American Government in regard to education is apparently to encourage Reservation Boarding schools, while our efforts have been, in the past, chiefly directed towards the establishment of Industrial schools, as it was thought much better results would be obtained from the latter class of school, which in all cases are situated off Reserves. It has been found from experience in some cases, that the progress made at Reservation schools is more or less interrupted by the proximity and influence of the Indians on the Reserve, who for very trivial reasons frequently wish to remove their children, and even, if unsuccessful in their efforts the children become unsettled.\n\nMany, if not all of the Boarding schools are in receipt of outside aid, the exact amount of which the Department has, at present, no means of knowing, as the Principals are decidedly averse to furnishing such information. The Department has, however, lately called upon them for a return of all amounts received in money and in kind by such schools, as it is very necessary that it should have reliable information on this point so that it may be able\nable to judge of the ability of the Church authorities to successfully carry on any particular school. It may be here stated that some of the religious bodies heretofore refused to furnish this information or even to state for publication the salaries paid by them to employees at the schools.\n\nThe Reservation Boarding school should be used as a feeder for the Industrial schools, where young children should be sent and trained until they arrive at a suitable age for the Industrial school. At present children are admitted to Industrial schools at ages varying from 4 to 18 or 20 years. The admission of very young children to Industrial schools should, the undersigned thinks be discontinued for very many reasons. First the cost of maintaining a child at a boarding school is from $60 to $75 only, while at an Industrial school the cost to the Government is all the way from $110 to $145 a year, and a child of 4 years would have to remain about 15 years in the latter Institution before its discharge, costing the country all the way from $1650 to $2175, making Indian education a very costly experiment. There are pupils at present in some of the Industrial schools who have cost the country this amount, if not more.\n\nAn age limit should be fixed for the admission of pupils to Industrial schools and they should not be allowed to remain beyond\nbeyond a certain time. If pupils were in the first instance drafted into Industrial schools from boarding or day schools at a suitable age and after having reached a certain standard of proficiency in their studies, such schools could be more easily managed and at less expense than at present; besides which the mingling of very young children with grown up boys and girls is not the best training they can receive, and the Department is aware of many instances where this practice has produced many pernicious results, while the admission of boys nearly or over 16 is equally disastrous to the morals and discipline of the school. A case in point is that of a boy over 16 admitted to Calgary school, who is now under arrest for criminal assault on one of the female employees of that Institution.\n\nIf young children were excluded from Industrial schools more time and attention could be given to Industrial training and pursuits. A stronger and healthier class of pupils could be obtained, as evidences of hereditary complaints would have become apparent before their transfer and the cost of maintenance of sickly pupils would be avoided.\n\nThe undersigned considers that if the above plan of recruiting for Industrial schools were followed, that 14 years would be about the proper age for receiving pupils who should be ready for their discharge when they arrive at 16 years.\nyears, this being the limited age to which they can be retained at such schools under the Regulations relating to the Compulsory education of Indian children, and any pupils taken under the prescribed age should be paid for at only at Boarding School rates. Four years residence at an Industrial school, after a previous training at a day or boarding school should be long enough to furnish them education and manual training. It is longer than most white children receive. When the Industrial and Boarding schools were first opened, it was difficult, owing to the aversion that parents had to parting with their children, to obtain pupils who were in every instance physically sound, and in consequence of the hereditary ailments of many of these children, the death-rate has been higher than otherwise; but it is a source of pleasure to say that the Indians are recognizing the benefits which their children receive at these Institutions and applications for admission are constantly coming in, which are (for some of the schools greatly in excess of the accommodation provided, and out of which the Department is enabled to select a much more healthy class of pupils, and instructions have already been given to admit none but those who are able to pass a medical examination.\n\nThe establishment of an Industrial school near a thriving town is thought to be a step in the right direction, as pupils at such schools are brought\nbrought into closer contact with the white population, and from their association and environment more readily acquire civilized habits. There is also this additional advantage\u2014pupils can be taught trades and have freer scope for the exercise of any particular aptitude they may exhibit for one or other of the trades taught at the school, as they can be and often are apprenticed to local tradesmen who are always glad to secure their services, but generally without remuneration, and by whom they are well cared for and instructed. Printing, tinsmithing and harness making are thus acquired by pupils, while some are clerks, who if placed in a school on a Reserve, would not have similar opportunities and advantages.\n\nThe Industrial school system which is intended for the higher education and manual training of Indian youth, has to a large extent been adopted from the older established Industrial schools in the United States, principally the Carlisle Institute in Pennsylvania, which is the largest and most successful school of the kind on this continent. The policy followed by Captain Pratt, who has had charge of the school since its inception, is to so civilize and educate his pupils, that they cease, for all practical purposes to be Indians, being absorbed by the white population, as none of his pupils are returned to their Reserves. This policy has its adherents.\nadherents among the Principals of our Industrial schools. While this scattering of the clans may be possible in the thickly populated portions of the United States it is impracticable for our Western Indians as great difficulty is found in obtaining steady work at living wages for pupils who have learned trades at any of our schools.\n\nThe question therefore presents itself,-what is ultimately to become of pupils who have finished the prescribed course at our Industrial schools, and what is to be their civil status? Are they still to remain Indians in the eye of the law, or is their graduation from an Industrial school to be recognized as a preliminary step towards their ultimate enfranchisement? Are they to be returned to their Reserves, or to have Crown lands assigned to them, either in block so as to form an advanced Indian settlement, or are they to be allowed to take up lands like white settlers? All these schemes have their advocates, some suggesting that allotments on Reserves, laid out on the cart-wheel system, should be given them; while others would prefer the formation of separate colonies on Government lands near the Industrial schools. A definite policy of dealing with ex-pupils still remains to be settled upon. There are at present a number of youths of both sexes who should, on account of age and length of time spent in such schools, at once be discharged, but\nthis cannot be done until suitable arrangements have been made for their final disposition.\n\nAnother question which presents itself is, have our schools been a success in the past? Judging from reports received on the status of discharged pupils, they cannot be said to have been a success. Who or what has caused this apparent failure? Such failure is partly due to their selection in the first instance, to the superficial work done at the school, from which they returned and to the want of proper arrangements for their return.\n\nAgents although requested to have a special care for discharged pupils, cannot fairly be held responsible for their having failed to reach such a state of civilization as would assure success in their future career. The English Government, which has about 190 Reformatory and Industrial schools throughout Great Britain for youthful criminals and waifs and strays, adopts this plan of dealing with schools that fall below the prescribed standard of excellence.\n\nIt may be said that nearly all these schools are carried on under contract with religious bodies, like our per capita grant system. If the Inspector of these schools reports unfavourably of any particular school it is warned and if in his subsequent report the management is still unsatisfactory a certain reduction in the grant follows. This is said to have the desired effect.\nand does away with a great deal of unnecessary correspondence. This plan is worthy of consideration.\n\nThe American Reports do not show how they deal with such cases, but judging by the frequent change of Principals at many of the schools, they have similar difficulties to contend with. Such changes do not follow changes of Government, as Indian school employees come under the Civil Service rules.\n\nJudging by the difficulty experienced and time expended in the preparation of the Financial Statement accompanying this report, the undersigned is of opinion that a change in the method of dealing with Indian school accounts is most desirable.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nIn addition to the Statement and report asked for showing the cost and condition of Indian schools, I beg to make the following remarks:\n\nThe chief desirability in selecting a site for an Industrial or Boarding school should be good land, suitable for mixed farming. Where have such schools in Manitoba and the North West been placed? In most cases they have not enough good farming land attached to them to be of any real benefit. A well selected site would materially lessen the cost of maintenance.\n\nWhat do we find? Hay and grazing land some miles away from the school, water supply altogether inadequate, no timber or wood land. These mistakes were made when the schools were built, but the Department is the looser by the want of proper foresight in the selection of sites. Expensive appliances have had to be furnished to provide water, extra expenditure has had to be incurred for fuel, and loss of time incurred in the cutting and hauling of hay for stock.\nstock. No private individual could carry on farming operations under similar circumstances.\n\nIn connection with the unsuitable sites, the location of the buildings has, in many instances, evinced a greater want of judgment; buildings have been put up where drainage is well nigh impossible and without any attention or consideration being had for ordinary sanitary laws, and in the most exposed situations. The buildings have been put up without due consideration of the purposes for which they would be required, hurriedly constructed of poor material, badly laid out, without due provision for lighting, heating or ventilation.\n\nIn all modern school architecture, great stress is laid on lighting, heating and ventilation, as it is recognized that the health of the pupils is to a great extent dependent upon good light, equable temperature and pure air, the last of which is of the greatest importance.\n\nWhat do we find in our schools? Ventilation wholly disregarded, or in the few instances where any attempt has been made to provide for it, that an entire disregard of all scientific principles has been shown. Outlets for the escape of foul air are provided in some rooms at a few schools but without adequate provision for the ad-\nmission of fresh air, and it is scarcely any wonder that our Indian pupils who have an hereditary tendency to phthisis, should develop alarming symptoms of this disease after a short residence in some of our schools, brought on by exposure to draughts in school rooms and sleeping in overcrowded, over-heated and unventilated dormitories.\n\nThis subject of ventilation or the want of ventilation was brought home so forcibly to the Department that it has been making close enquiry into the subject, and I regret to say that in almost every instance I find that it has been totally overlooked in the past, and that to improve it will entail heavy expense on the Department. I have consulted several prominent architects and visited all the public institutions here in Ottawa and in Toronto and I find that the proper ventilation of overcrowded sleeping rooms is absolutely essential to the health of the inmates. I have seen several devices for the improvement of the ventilation of old buildings and I consider the one placed in the St Patrick's Orphans Asylum here the cheapest and best.\n\nOn the subject of dormitories I have no hesitation in saying that large dormitories are unsuited to our schools. The best equipped institutions I have read of or seen, provide for smaller numbers and more isolation. At the Alexandra\nIndustrial school for girls in Toronto, each girl has a separate apartment. At the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, four girls are in each compartment, while in the United States Indian schools, they recommend separate rooms to accommodate three pupils. I know that it would not be possible to make such arrangements in our schools, but I see no reason why smaller rooms, with partitions could not be had. It would ensure a proper classification of pupils as to age and provide a certain amount of privacy which is now entirely lacking.\n\nIntimately connected with the subject of ventilation, is the question of closets. In all our larger Institutions these are placed in the main building, which I maintain is entirely wrong, no matter what system is adopted. The Smead Dowd system is exclusively used and has proved, from different causes to be a failure and a menace to the health of the pupils. The Principal of the Mimico Industrial school, where the system is placed in some of the cottage homes, told me that he had more sickness in the cottages where it was used than in the others and he disapproved of it and was doing his best to have it removed. We have been obliged to do away with it at Rupert's Land. The Principal of the Brandon school is constantly complaining of foul air arising from these closets. Experts have examined the construction and working of these\nclosets and have pronounced against them. The flush closet is also, in my opinion, open to objection as there is always a likelihood of something getting out of order, clogging of drains, traps, etc. Cess Pools have, in nearly all cases, to be provided in connection with flush closets, and these at the best are most unsavory places and entail a lot of disagreeable work in connection with keeping them fairly clean.\n\nThe system most highly spoken of and which gives the best satisfaction is the dry earth closet. This is recommended by the New York Board of Health and School Board. It is in use at the Mohawk Institute and gives perfect satisfaction. Even in a cold climate like the North West there is no absolute necessity why the closets should be inside the main building. A covered way leading to dry earth closets at a distance would be far preferable, and a dry earth commode could be placed near the dormitories for night use in case of necessity.\n\nThe dry earth closet is the most simple and easily managed closet known while the Smead-Dowd system requires a skilled mechanic to look after it, and only work fairly well at certain seasons and stages of the wind.\n\nThe water supply is a constant source of trouble and expense.\nWindmills do not answer. Hot-air pumping engines are apparently hard to manage, while a steam pumping plant is very costly and intricate.\n\nThe ages of pupils vary all the way from four to twenty years and over and little if any distinction is made among pupils of the same sex as regards food, clothing, study, work, recreation, moral and religious training, rest and sleep. The time table for the day generally covers 15 hours or more, for study work and play, and the balance of the time for sleep. A days routine at a school is a wearisome grind for teacher and pupil and should in most cases be shortened considerably. There is time allowed for rest, unless change of occupation is considered to be rest. The half day system, although in use generally in schools of the kind, is very trying for any but the grown up pupils. Say a boy works all the morning on the farm, at his trade or about the house and barns, he is pretty well used up by noon, and then after dinner he has to put in four or five hours in class and study. I am inclined to think that the half-day system should occasionally be changed and that work and study should be taken up alternately, monthly or oftener.\n\nThe dietary scale provides for an ample supply of plain food, but variety and skill in its preparation is not\ninsisted on. The bill of fare is decidedly monotonous and makes no allowance for peculiarities of taste or constitution. What is one man's meat is said to be another man's poison, but at our schools it is die dog or eat the hatchet. In almost every instance when meals are mentioned by inspectors they are said to be well cooked.\n\nI doubt very much whether they ever took a full regulation school meal of bread and dripping, or boiled beef and potatoes. Cooking is one of the civilized arts and should be practised and taught at our schools.\n\nAs nearly all our schools are now on the per capita system the supply of clothing rests with the schools. Better foot wear should be provided for winter, especially for boys working about the barns. Discharged pupils should receive a new outfit and not be obliged, as is at present the case, at some schools, to return their clothes and take any old worn out garments that come to hand.\n\nChildren should be classified according to ages, the very young children in a separate room. Double beds should in all cases be done away with and not allowed in any school. Straw ticks, even when charged frequently, are not suitable for crowded rooms, or for young children. The dormitories are well over-heated in most\ncases, so they are not required for warmth, and on the score of cleanliness they should be dispensed with. Nearly all the schools have been supplied with modern spring mattresses and if they had a thick felt or rag mat spread over them, they would be quite warm and comfortable and could be easily aired and cleaned. They are manufacturing felt at Qu'Appelle and could no doubt supply such mats at a reasonable price. They are made at Central Prison, Toronto and are used by the Ontario Government schools.\n\nThe question of overcrowding should be particularly looked into. In many of the schools ablutions are performed in the dormitories. This causes a good deal of work and makes a great mess and confusion. A well arranged lavatory with plenty of basins and separate towels for each pupil should be provided for both boys and girls. The bath tub in a large Institution is of very little use and wastes a lot of water, which is slopped about the floor. In all modern institutions and gymnasiums a large concrete space with a raised run of 10 inches to a foot is made and supplied with a hot and cold shower; bathing can be done quickly by this means with clean water. I have seen eight or ten boys run through the same water in an ordinary bath tub, water being scarce but very dirty at the last. A teacher should occupy a room looking into\nand having communication with each dormitory.\n\nThe heating is nearly all done by stoves and hot air furnaces, and the consumption of fuel is enormous even for the coldest climate. There are no thermometers in most of the schools and a well regulated temperature cannot be maintained. When Lord Aberdeen visited Brandon in the fall of '95, he complained of the excessive heat of the rooms and recommended that thermometers be supplied, six of which were sent that school. Have seen no mention of any appliances being used to moisten the atmosphere, which must be hot dry and stifling.\n\nIn connection with the internal economy and management of a well-organized school, I would refer you to my report on the Mohawk Institute, which gives full details regarding that well conducted school.\n\nI will now refer to the organization of our schools. All the denominational schools are in charge of the clergy, but it is a question whether priest or parson is best fitted by education, training or profession to assume the direct control and management of such institutions. Frequent changes in the staff of some of the Boarding schools handicap their work while the constant bickering and petty jealousies at other\nschools have had an equally bad effect on some of the larger Institutions. I have already pointed out what I consider the only remedy for this state of things.\n\nThe education and civilization of the Western Indians is still in its infancy and we should be content to let them creep for a time before they attempt to walk. It is only a few years since they were wild untamed savages, living by the chase, hunting in small bands or families. Now that game is not to be had, they must, of necessity, turn to the soil for their subsistence. Necessity will be their best civilizer. The Government is assisting in every way to make them farmers, farmers first, then citizens. Then they can do what they like with their children. If the Government succeeds in making farmers and settlers of the rising generation, it will have carried out its obligations. I do not see that it is called upon to make them all mechanics, merchants, teachers or clerks. The first thing to do is to teach them how to get their living from the soil, give them locations and assistance at the start. When they have learned this all the rest will be easy. We should go steadily to work with this end in view, instead of trying to over-run the country with a lot of half-trained and half-educated so-called Industrial pupils. The needs of the country do not call for all the different trades pupils even if they\nwere turned out as finished workmen. The use of ordinary carpenter's tools and some knowledge of blacksmithing should be acquired by all the boys as these would be useful to them\u2014but what opening is there for printers, shoemakers, tailors and several other trades that are now taught at a loss of time, wages and material at some of the schools.\n\nThe chief ambition of an Industrial school is to possess a Brass Band and a printing press. Music has charms, but enough money has been expended upon brass bands to place a musical instrument, such as a piano or organ in nearly every school in the country. The Brass Band and newspaper are outward show and help to advertise the school. More solid comfort and enjoyment could be had with the other kind of music in which all could join.\n\nThere are ten Industrial schools in Manitoba and the North West with accommodation for about 1400 pupils, more than one-half of whom are boys, not more than one-half of whom, under the system lately pursued, would know anything of farming, while the other half would be supposed to be taught trades. Where could the Government expect to find employment for 200 apprentices annually\u2014for they would still have to serve an apprenticeship before they could join the Union. The religious denominations do not bestir themselves, so far as I am aware, to secure\nemployment for ex-pupils of their schools.\n\nIf all these boys could be placed in civilized countries, what is to become of the educated Indian maiden, \"tempestiva vir\u014d\" is she to be provided with a civilized husband by a fostering Government, or is she to return to the Reserve and become the bride of some untutored savage. I think that for some time at least, it would be better not to be ambitious but to restrict our energies to the only field that at present presents a prospect of success.\n\nContrasting the suggestions contained in Dr Ryerson's report of 50 years ago with the elaborate scheme adopted by our schools and copied from the Carlyle, on the strength of Mr Davin's report made in 1879, it must be admitted that Dr Ryerson's idea of industrial training is the one best suited to the present generation of Indians. In the hereafter, probably 40 years hence, the more elaborate training might be successful, but by that time I trust the Indians will be able to support such high class Institutions themselves.\n\nThe prescribed Programme of Studies for Indian schools is very similar to that used in the Public schools, with more stress laid on the teaching of English. The Superintendent of Indian schools Washington D.C. has issued a Syllabus of Language work and suggestions to teachers.\ncontaining lessons in speaking, reading, writing, spelling and grammar for use in Indian schools. Our teachers have no similar aids provided, and as in most instances they are not skilled in teaching methods, the acquisition of the English language by Indian pupils is an exceedingly slow process. What we most require is a better qualified class of teachers and a more improved primary system. Teachers should possess the true missionary spirit and be the best all round men and women. Ignoramus, idlers, time-killers and salary grabbers should not be employed.\n\nThe Kindergarten is now recognized to be the means for interesting and instructing children and in the few schools where it has been introduced, its beneficial influence is shown in many ways and especially in the easy acquirement of English. It should certainly be introduced where there are young children, as well as object lesson cards, maps and the more general use of the blackboard. A visit to a Kindergarten class will convince the most sceptical of the benefits conferred by this system. Willing and efficient teachers will make a success of any school and be an acquisition to any Indian settlement.\n\nI think the number of Industrial schools is greater than at present called for. The Churches carrying them on look after them as part of their missionary work, while the Government pays the shot. If the designation of some of the\nso-called Industrial schools were changed to Manual Training or Sloyd, it would be nearer the mark. We have few, if any, Industrial or technical training schools properly so-called. Four or five of the latter class of school would more than supply all the technical training required. There is always likely to be a certain percentage of Indian boys who will show some special fitness for technical work and these might have the benefit of proper training, but I consider it a waste of time and money to force a trade on a boy who is not likely to make a success of the opportunities afforded him.\n\nIn British Columbia the Industrial schools are the rule, there being no less than seven of these institutions, each allowed an annual grant of $130 per pupil, which is higher in proportion, considering climate and cost of living, than the grant to any other schools.\n\nThe distinction between Industrial schools in British Columbia is even less noticeable than in Manitoba and the Territories. There is a Roman Catholic school at the Mission on the Lower Fraser which has been in existence for a number of years and draws $60 per cap per annum, while the Methodist school at Coqualeetza, a few miles further down the River receives $130 per pupil. The amount\nof the grant is the only distinction between the two schools.\n\nOpenings for Indian boys in British Columbia are, if anything, harder to find than in Manitoba and the Territories. The condition of the B.C. Indians is very different from those of the North West. They mix more with whites and have always been able to support themselves and need not be to any great extent a charge upon the Government. Education of the right kind will of great use and assistance, but high class industrial training will do them very little good and be of very little practical value.\n\nThe B.C. Indians are all experts in the industries and pursuits they are engaged in, and the time spent in these schools will not help to fit them for their after work. These remarks apply to the Coast Indians who are all engaged in fishing for their livelihood. The Indians of the interior will have to work in the mines or on the railroad, raise stock or become farmers, and manual training will be a great help to them, but technical or industrial training is not needed to any extent. One school of the latter class would more than supply the requirements of British Columbia.\n\nI have referred to the difficulty of obtaining employment for graduates from our Industrial schools and when\nwork is found, to keep them at it. As an instance I will mention the case of Gilbert Bear, ex-pupil of the Battleford Industrial school, a printer by trade. Gilbert was a \"star pupil\", spent three months at the World's Fair, returned to the school, was foreman of the school paper and a good specimen of the Industrial school pupil. When the time for discharging Gilbert arrived, it was difficult to know what to do with him. Happy thought, bring him to Ottawa. He arrived here nearly two years ago and has had steady employment at night work in the Citizen office. His wages for the first year and a half were $3.50, lately raised to $4 a week, not enough to pay for his board and clothes. Although he is admitted to be a good printer, he cannot get more wages. He does not belong to the Union and is merely a printer's devil. Now Gilbert had some difficulty with the foreman about working over-time and was discharged on Saturday last. He says he is not fairly treated, while the foreman contends that he would not obey orders. I have had to see the proprietor of the Citizen twice and hunt up Gilbert, take him to the office to try and settle the dispute and get him taken back. Since the close of the Session printers are plentiful and Gilbert is back as a favor. Trouble is likely to occur again as Gilbert is dissatisfied, hates the night work, and if the truth were told, would rather be back home on the Reserve and end his brilliant career of letters. This is my experience of\nIndustrial school training and I cannot say that I consider it very encouraging.\n\nWe have another class of school which has not cut much of a figure in the past. This is the Reservation day school.\n\nIt must be confessed that the ordinary Indian day school on outlying Reserves does no appreciable good as a civilizer or educator. It would seem to have been instituted to afford a resting place for some lazy, incompetent individual with just sufficient energy to draw a small salary. I think that a well conducted day school, in charge of a practical man or woman, who knows a good deal outside the text-books, and who would be ready and willing to do anything useful and right, and who was eager to find something to do for the real good of the people, would be the greatest blessing that could fall to the lot of the Indians. I am confident that there are such people and that they could be found if properly sought for and appreciated when discovered.\n\nMr William Duncan, who founded the Indian Colony at Metlakahtla in British Columbia, was such a man. He first settled as a lay missionary among the Indians at Fort Simpson. These Indians are described as then being all pagans and the most debauched and demoralized Indians on the Coast. After a few years the settlement at Metlakahtla, to which he and the\nIndians had removed, was admitted to be a model of Christianity, civilization and good government. All this was achieved through the unaided efforts of one earnest Christian worker.\n\nIn conclusion I think I may fairly say that during the four years I have been connected with the school work of the Department, I have given the subject of Indian education most careful attention and study and have endeavored in every way possible to fit myself for the responsibilities this work entails, and my only regret is that I have not had an opportunity of becoming more intimately acquainted with our schools as they are and of meeting more people engaged in this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Maclean\nActing Secretary\nDepartment of J. Dunn McLean\nOttawa, 20th July, 1897.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the Minister's memo. of the 24th February last addressed to the late Deputy Superintendent General requiring a statement showing fully, clearly and exhaustively the relations which the different churches bear to the Government in the matter of Indian education, which statement was to include,\u2014\n\n1. All day, boarding and industrial schools in the different parts of Canada, grouped according to the churches which have them in charge.\n\n2. All moneys spent on buildings and sites in each case.\n\n3. By whom such moneys were spent; that is, whether by the church or the Government, and if partially by one and partially by the other, the amount spent by each to be separately shown.\n\n4. The exact terms upon which each school is conducted, and the instances in which the same have been departed from, and the nature of and reasons for such departures.\n\n5. The yearly expenditure by the Government on Indian education, showing in brief the yearly amount paid to schools, grouped under the names of the churches.\nchurches controlling them,\u2014the undersigned begs to submit herewith a statement prepared by the clerk in charge of schools, giving the information asked for, in the form of four statistical statements, marked \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", & \"d\",\u2014 \"a\" showing the expenditure for the last twenty years ending the 30th June, 1896, of all schools in the Dominion, grouped according to the churches which have them in charge;\n\n\"b\" showing the total cost of the different Industrial Institutions in Man., the N.W.T., and B.C.;\n\n\"c\" showing the total cost of the different boarding schools in the N.W.T., Man., and B.C., with summary of the entire expenditure of all classes of schools in these three Provinces named.\n\n\"d\" showing the number of industrial, boarding and day schools in operation during the year ended 30th June, 1896, with enrollment, attendance, appropriation, &c., grouped under the different churches which have them in charge.\n\nAlso a memo. from Mr. Benson showing the relationship the Department sustains to the schools in question;\n\nAnd a semi-official report addressed to the undersigned, in which Mr. Benson expresses his views in detail.\n\nIn connection with the foregoing, the undersigned would state that in 1879 Mr. Nicholas Flood Davin made a report on the working of industrial schools for the education of Indians and mixed bloods in the United States and as to the advisability of establishing similar institutions in the North West Territories of Canada\u2014a copy of which report the Minister\nMinister already has before him.\n\nThe result of Mr. Davin's report was, that in 1884 the Industrial Schools at Battleford, High River and Qu'Appelle were established in the North West Territories. Since the date of Mr. Davin's report there has been no other printed report dealing with the school question, except a confidential report made by Mr. Vankoughnet to Sir John Macdonald in 1887\u2014a copy of which report the Minister has likewise before him,\u2014and which provided for a large increase of expenditure, by raising the salaries of the teachers, providing houses for a number of them, and a midday meal for the pupils. The additional cost to be incurred in the first place if Mr. Vankoughnet's report had been adopted would have been $892,620.63 and a further yearly cost of $545,206.60, as contrasted with the present expenditure, which is in the neighborhood of $400,000. Mr. Vankoughnet's report, however, was not adopted in toto, but the Department has provided for the Indian attendants of schools in Manitoba and the North West a mid-day meal; but no such provision is made for the pupils attending schools in the other Provinces. The salaries paid the teachers have not been increased. The Department pays in the North West and British Columbia at the rate of $300, with a possible increase up to $504; that is, for any school that has an average attendance of over 25 and up to 42, $12 per capita per annum is paid.\n\nIt will be seen on reference to Mr. Benson's memo., page 5, et seq., that by an Order in Council of the\nthe 23rd October, 1892, a basis was arrived at by the Department for carrying on Industrial Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories under the per capita system; and on page 10 of his report the Minister will see the concessions that have been made by the department in dealing with such schools. In view, therefore, of the Order in Council of the 23rd October, 1892, and the Departmental concessions as stated in Mr. Benson's memo., the undersigned considers that the basis of dealing with these Industrial Schools is almost as definite as if the Department had a special agreement with each institution. In the case of the Brandon School, recently handed over, the arrangement come to was virtually in accordance with the conditions already indicated. According to Statement \"D\" it will be seen that there are 15 Industrial Schools in the Dominion. This statement deals with the schools to the 30th June, 1892. Since then the Coqualeetza School, in British Columbia, has been recognized as an Industrial School, which makes the number sixteen instead of fifteen, as given in Statement D. The same statement shows that there are 84 Boarding Schools and 230 Day Schools. As pointed out in Mr. Benson's memo., there is not a great deal of difference between the present Boarding and Industrial school as regards what is taught in each, the chief difference being in the grant made by the Department, only $78 being paid per pupil in the case of Boarding Schools, and from $110 to $145 in the case of Industrial. In each the girls get the same instruction; but more trades are taught the boys in some of the Industrial Schools. The boarding school takes the place of what the Americans call the \"Reserva-\n\"Reservation Boarding School,\" they being on reserves and the Industrial Schools being off reserves.\n\nIt would appear necessary that the Department should have the three grades of schools; but the undersigned considers that it would be well to lay down the rule that pupils should not enter the Boarding Schools unless under exceptional circumstances, under the age of 8 years and not remain in these schools longer than six years, which would bring them to the age of 14, making the age from 8 to 14 for Boarding Schools. And from the Boarding School they could be drafted into the Industrial Schools, where they might remain from 14 to 18. The undersigned considers that in the case of pupils entering Boarding and Industrial Schools, they should be required to pass a medical examination, and none but the healthiest children should be educated thereat.\n\nAs regards the intellectual training at such schools, the object should be to give a plain English education, adapted to the needs of the working farmer and mechanic.\n\nAs indicated in Dr. Ryerson's report of 1847\u2014a copy of which is sent herewith\u2014the undersigned does not consider it advisable that extra efforts should be made to train the Indian youths as carpenters, cabinet makers, shoemakers, tailors, &c., as there is not much likelihood, for many years to come, of Indians so trained being capable of earning a livelihood at such trades in competition with others. The chief aim should be to train the Indian youths how to earn a livelihood when they return to the reserves, and it seems altogether out of the question for the Department to undertake to educate\neducate a large number of Indians with the idea of making them equal to white men by the process of education. The result of such course is, that the Indian pupils have still to be provided for by the Department after they leave school; and thus a double responsibility is undertaken, namely, that of educating them and then of providing them the means afterwards of obtaining a livelihood: Whereas if the Indians were educated simply with the idea of obtaining their livelihood as Indians and assuming the status of white men as soon as they might have the means to do so, they would be better prepared to go back to their reserves and set an example to other members of the band. It might be advisable, however, in the case of graduates of Industrial Schools to provide for their ipso facto enfranchisement, and give them locations on their reserves as enfranchised Indians.\n\nWith regard to the question of inspection of Indian Schools, the Minister will see from Mr. Benson's memo, that the Department has its schools inspected in the older Provinces by the Public School Inspectors of the Province; but this is not done in the North West and British Columbia, where the inspection is made by the Department's own officials. The Minister might consider it necessary to do away with this inspection by the School Inspectors in the older Provinces, as so far it must be confessed such inspection has not resulted in much good and has entailed considerable expense.\n\nWith regard to the concluding part of Mr. Benson's\nBenson's report, in which he suggests some change in the manner of dealing with Indian School accounts, the undersigned would state that he has looked into this matter, and he considers that there is no particular need for any change in the present system. He finds that a separate account is kept with each Industrial School in Manitoba and the North West Territories and British Columbia, and the expenditure of each can be ascertained from the Ledger without any difficulty whatever. Moreover, an account is kept with each Agency in these Provinces of expenditure for Day Schools in the Agency, from which can always be taken the total expenditure under that head and with very little trouble. There is also a general account, in which appears the total expenditure on account of schools in these Provinces.\n\nAs regards the schools in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces, one account is kept, but there is no difficulty whatever in ascertaining the expenditure on each, as the Ledger is divided into sub-heads, by which can be told at a glance the expenditure on each. The undersigned is satisfied that if the Minister were to see the books he would not be disposed to suggest any change.\n\nThe undersigned would add that although the expenditure upon Indian Schools for the past 30 years has been large and the appropriation for such purpose is still large, it is questionable after all whether the expenditure has not been justified considering the advance the Indians of the North West have made during that time; and it is difficult, of course, to tell to what\nwhat extent this expenditure has been a factor in helping the Indians forward. The true policy would, however, seem to be to keep this expenditure as much within bounds as possible and not to extend our Industrial School system, unless such extension becomes an absolute necessity. It might even be possible to change some of the present Industrial Schools into Non-Reservation Boarding Schools and give a smaller grant than they are now receiving.\n\nThe undersigned considers that more responsibility should be thrown on the denominations which have charge of Indian Schools to provide employment for the Indian pupils. As it is now, the onus appears to be altogether on the Department, and it seems only fair that, as co-workers with the Department, the denominations should be made to realize their responsibility in this direction. They have constituencies in which, no doubt, a large number of the Indian pupils who graduate could obtain employment if the denominations exerted themselves to provide such for the Indian pupils.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nActing Secretary.\nOttawa, 27th June, 1898.\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nWith reference to attached statement the Minister instructs that it should be printed in the form of a small book with report of Dr. Ryerson as appendix.

The only reliable way to arrive at the cost of Indian education is to take the actual enrollment and the expenditure for each class of school.\n\nThere were 287 schools in operation that year:-226 day, 39 boarding and 22 industrial with a total enrollment of 9634 pupils and an average attendance of 6193. The total cost of all schools was $365,933.27.\n\nI have prepared a statement showing the cost calculated in the above manner which you will find herewith marked Statement \"A\".\n\nOf the 38,651 Indians claimed by the Roman Catholics as belonging to their faith, 11,456 are included in the census of Quebec and the Lower Provinces, for which only day school accommodation is provided,-there being 34 such schools to meet this demand, 28 of which are conducted under the auspices\nof the Roman Catholic church, two are undenomination-\nal and paid for by the Indians, three are carried on\nby the Methodists, who pay half the salaries and one\nis Church of England.\n\nThere are also 4,607 Roman Catholic Indi-\nans shown in the census above referred to as being\noutside of Treaty Limits.\n\nOf the 11,838 Roman Catholic Indians in\nBritish Columbia, it may be said that most of them\nare so migratory in their habits and their reserves\nare so small and scattered that it is next to im-\npossible to provide them with day schools, while it\nhas been considered that it would be a useless out-\nlay to increase the number of boarding and indus-\ntrial schools in that province to any large extent\nas residence in such institutions would tend to un-\nfit pupils from earning their livelihood in the\noccupations they will have to follow in later life.\n\nI have also prepared a statement marked \"B\"\ntaken from the current year's estimates, showing the\nnumber of boarding and industrial schools conducted\nby the different denominations by provinces, with the\nnumber of pupils provided for and the amount of the\ngrant for maintenance, from which you will see that\nthe Roman Catholics are receiving as much as the\nProtestant denominations all put together, both in\nmoney and numbers.\nSir:\n\nIndian Cheque No. 246, 1903-04 (Ontario and Quebec) is for a payment of $700 to Shingwank Home to defray a portion of the deficit incurred by that Institute.\n\nKindly inform me as to the amount of the deficit and if there was an examination of the accounts in connection with this deficit made by your Department. I should like to know also your reason for making this payment when the school receives a per capita grant.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs Department.\nEx'd.\n\nOttawa, 9th November, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant regarding cheque No. 346 charged against the Ontario and Quebec Indian vote for the year 1903-04, being a payment of $700.00 to the Shingwauk Home on account of the deficit incurred by that Institution, I beg to inform you that the total amount of the deficit of that Institute on the 30th September 1903 as shown by its books which were audited by Mr. Dalton of this Department in November of that year was $1,552.98. The accounts making up this sum are enclosed herewith. The reason for assisting this Institution was owing to the fact that the deficit had not occurred through extravagant management and that the per capita grant was not sufficient to maintain excessively pupils and at the same time to keep the buildings in repair; and to refuse to assist the Institution at that juncture would have meant to close the school. It was ascertained also that a considerable portion of the grant for maintenance of pupils had been expended in repairs to buildings and for furniture &c., which was not originally intended should be paid from the per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nSir:\n\nLet me ask your attention to my letter of Nov. 7th last with reference to the payment of a part of the deficit incurred by the Shingwauk Home, and to your reply thereto (file No. 152067-1).\n\nOn account of the various deficits which the Government has, from time to time, been called to pay, I am of opinion that it would be advisable to slightly modify the system of paying the per-capita grants to the various Industrial and Boarding Schools.\n\nIn the first place an Order-in-Council should be obtained fixing the amounts of the grants to the various schools; this Order-in-Council should also specify clearly what expenses are supposed to be covered by the grant and what expenditure the Government is prepared to pay in addition to the grant, which should be of the same nature for all the schools, and under what conditions this extra expenditure will be recognised.\n\nIn the second place, the grants being fixed at a fair figure, based on the requirements of each individual school, the different denominations, controlling the various schools, should be given to clearly understand that in the future no claims for deficits will be entertained by the Government.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs.\nIn the third place, a uniform and adequate system of bookkeeping should be imposed on every school receiving a Government grant, which books should at all times be open for examination by a duly authorized Government inspector. A rigid inspection of the financial affairs of each school should be made on behalf of the Government at least once a year; the report of such inspection to be made in a form, uniform for every school, such as to show clearly the financial state of the school at the time of inspection. Should however the inspector find anything out of the ordinary or requiring special comment, this should be included in a special report.\n\nI should like to have your opinion on the above suggestions.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 16th Decr., 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:-\n\nA further communication has been received from the Auditor General with reference to the payment of a part of the deficit incurred by the Shingwauk Home in which he expresses his opinion that it would be advisable to modify the system of paying the per capita grants to the various Industrial and boarding schools. This letter of the Auditor's was written in acknowledgment of a letter from the Department of the 9th ultimo, giving him certain information for which he asked regarding this payment.\n\nIt is a question for the Department to decide how far it is to be guided by the Auditor's opinion in the management of its schools.\n\nThe Order-in-Council of the 22nd Oct. 1892 on file No. 91,883 herewith outlines the system adopted for the maintenance and management of industrial schools on the per capita basis.\n\nThe question of not recognizing deficits is correct in theory but difficult of practice, as there are many unforeseen circumstances that may prevent a school from drawing the full grant allowed, in which case deficits are bound to occur.\n\nThe system of book-keeping is, I understand, supposed to be uniform and instructions have already been issued to the Indian Commissioner to have inspections made of these schools every six months.\nThe Department is in receipt of detailed reports of such inspections, upon which any necessary action is taken.\n\nI understand that it is the intention of the Minister to go thoroughly into the organization of our schools at an early date, and until this is done, I do not see that the Auditor's suggestions can be dealt with.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General of I.A.\n\nI have read the Auditor's letter of Sept. 7th, making certain suggestions in the way of regulations to govern Industrial School expenditure. The subject is too difficult to be satisfactorily dealt with in the way that the Auditor suggests. As a matter of fact there is nothing essentially new in what he suggests. The point is that he wants us to be bound by an Order-in-Council to which he can refer as authority if we happen to pay any deficits after it became operative.\n\nI think we ought to be wise enough to avoid being placed in that position and it would be just as well, as a matter of policy, to refrain from giving any opinion upon his suggestions, at least for the present, as we might be involved in a correspondence in which general principles would have to be stated which might not in the future conform to particular occasions.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOTTAWA, February 6th\u20141904.\nOttawa, February 15th, 1905.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe Accountant.\n\nWhile it may be inadvisable to have an Order in Council, such as is mentioned in your memorandum, there is the point mentioned in the second last paragraph of the Auditor General's letter that might be dealt with if not already covered by the system now in vogue.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nEx'd.\n\nOttawa 17th February, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th December last; and in reply I beg to say that the subjects dealt with therein in connection with the administration of Industrial Schools have for some time occupied the attention of the Department. Your suggestions have been noted and will receive careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1907.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe Accountant.\n\nWill you please let me have a classified statement, as soon as possible, showing the expenditure on boarding and industrial schools in Manitoba and the district operated from there, Saskatchewan and Alberta, since 1900, by per capita grant, deficits, buildings, additions, repairs, and miscellaneous (showing what this is).\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\n### Industrial Schools Financed by the Government\n\nNote - The expenses of these three schools are met wholly by the Department.

The Representatives of the Various churches were:-\n\nEnglish Church:- The Very Rev. The Archbishop of Rupert's Land, Rev. Arch-\ndeacon Phair, Rev. E. A. Cowley, W. A. Sweatman Rev and Rev W. A. Burman.\n\nMethodist Church:- Rev Dr Woodsworth, Rev J. H. Morgan and Rev T. Ferrier\n\nPresbyterian Church:- Rev Dr Hart, Rev Dr Patrick, Rev Dr Baird and Rev Dr\nParquharson.\n\n(1) That the Government be requested to create an Advisory Board of Indian\nEducation to which all churches and organizations engaged in Indian work shall\nhave the privilege of nominating representatives.\n\n(2) That in addition to the elements of an English education the Indian\nboys shall be trained in agricultural pursuits in their different branches as\nmay be possible where the school is situated, and also in such manual pursuits\nas may be useful to them in an outdoor life in the district to which they belong.\n\nSimilarly with the girls that they be trained for Domestic life and\nelementary nursing.\n\n(3) That the present system is not the best possible to attain the needs\ndesired. Instead of there being three distinctive institutions, Industrial\nInstitutes, Boarding schools and Day schools there be but two classes. First:-\nThe Industrial Boarding school, to be so constituted, equipped and conducted\nthat the policy briefly outlined in the above clause may be most perfectly\nrealized. Second:- The Day school, for which the Government wherever it regards\nthis class of schools preferable should provide a suitable building and equip-\nment and an adequate salary for the teacher.\n\n(4) That pupils as a rule shall be discharged at the age of eighteen, but\nit should be arranged that in exceptional cases pupils may be retained longer on\nthe recommendation of the Church in charge of the school and with the consent of\nthe Indian Commissioner. Also it should be made possible for especially promi-\nnent pupils to receive extra training for any special vocation at the expense of\nthe Government, such pupils meantime to be under the supervision of the school.\n\n(5) While realizing the difficulties of administrating a policy of com-\npulsory education we are convinced that such a principle is in the best inter-\nests of all concerned,- of the parents, of the children and of the State-\nand should be enforced so far as can be wisely and rightly done. If this become\nthe accepted policy of the Government it is not too much to expect that the\ninfluence of Government employes be brought to bear in the\nThe policy of funding the Treaty money for children attending Boarding or Industrial schools having been found to operate against securing pupils for these schools, should be discontinued and all Government donations in excess of Treaty obligations should be withheld from such parents as refuse to send their children to school.\n\n(6) That whereas the Indians are wards of the Government, and their education at least in part secured by Treaty, it is only reasonable that the Government should bear all expenses involved in such training as is contemplated in Industrial Boarding schools, except perhaps that which naturally falls within the sphere of the church obligations. The churches willing and anxious to continue to cooperate with the Government in the civilisation and christianization of the Indians are convinced that the moral and spiritual side of education cannot be hoped for except by the appointment of teachers in every way qualified for a work so peculiar and important. The request is therefore made that the appointment of teachers be entrusted to the churches that are willing to pay a reasonable amount of money towards the expense of what may be termed religious instruction as distinguished from secular education. The details as to amount chargeable to the church could be hereafter agreed upon; perhaps the salary of the Principal or a percentage of the annual expenditure for maintenance, or a that the Church be responsible for all expenses in excess of a reasonable per capita grant. Any one of these might constitute a basis of agreement between the Government and the Church.\n\n(7) That sanitarium equipment be provided in central or suitable locations for the treatment of tubercular and other contagious diseases.\n\n(8) DEMANDING: We would ask that the clauses of the Indian Act of the Indian Treaties or of regulations of the Indian Department forbidding dances of Indians known as the War-dance, the Sun-dance, the Ghost dance and other similar ceremonies having reference to the old and evil tribal customs, should be as far as possible strictly enforced on the Reserves as being detrimental to morals and progress.\n\nThey should be absolutely forbidden to Treaty Indians outside of their own Reserves and especially as attractions at Public gatherings. It is scarcely necessary to point out the inconsistency of Public officials and Community at large in devoting labor and spending Public Funds in the effort to civilize the Indians and make them good citizens while encouraging them at the same time to keep up customs which tend only to degradation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Ferrier, Chairman\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith I send you the resolutions passed at a joint conference on Indian Education held in Winnipeg, Dec. 1st., 27th and 28th, 1906.\n\nThese resolutions were considered by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church and generally approved.\n\nAt the request of the Secretary of the Winnipeg Conference and by the instruction of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church I am transmitting them to you in order that you may lay them before the Department of the Interior.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nMEMO OF RESOLUTIONS.\n\nAgreed upon by a Joint Committee representing the Methodist Presbyterian and Anglican Churches, and presented to the Government by a Joint Delegation in the month of April 1907.\n\n1. That the Government be requested to create an Advisory Board of Indian Education to which all churches and organizations engaged in Indian work shall have the privilege of nominating two representatives each.\n\n2. That in addition to the elements of an English education the Indian boys shall be trained in agricultural or such other pursuits in their different branches as may be possible where the School is situated, and also in such manual pursuits as may be useful to them in an outdoor life in the district to which they belong. Similarly with the girls that they be trained for domestic life and elementary nursing.\n\n3. That all the schools, resident and non-resident, shall be so constituted, equipped and conducted that the policy briefly outlined in the above clause may be most perfectly realized, and that the Government shall provide suitable buildings and equipments therefor.\n\n4. That pupils, as a rule, shall be discharged at the age of eighteen, but it should be arranged that in exceptional cases, pupils may be retained longer on the recommendation of the Church in charge of the school, and with the consent of the Indian Commissioner. Also it should be made possible for especially promising pupils to receive extra training for any special vocation at the expense of the Government, such pupils meantime to be under the supervision of the school.\n5. \u2014 While realizing the difficulties of administering a policy of compulsory education, we are convinced that such a principle is in the best interests of all concerned\u2014of the parents, of the children, and of the State, and should be enforced so far as can be wisely and rightly done. If this becomes the accepted policy of the Government, is it too much to expect that the influence of Government employees be brought to bear in the kind but firm enforcement of the law?\n\nThe policy of funding the treaty money for children attending Boarding or Industrial Schools, having been found to operate against securing pupils for these schools, should be discontinued, and all Government donations in excess of Treaty obligations should be withheld from such parents as refuse to send their children to school.\n\n6. \u2014 That whereas the Indians are wards of the Government, and their education, at least in part, secured by treaty, it is only reasonable that the Government should bear all expenses involved in such training as is contemplated, which would include a larger per capita grant. The Churches anxious and willing to continue to co-operate with the Government in the civilization and Christianization of the Indians are convinced that the moral and spiritual side of education cannot be hoped for except by the appointment of teachers in every way qualified for a work so peculiar and important. The request is therefore made that the appointment of teachers be entrusted to the Churches on terms to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n7. \u2014 That sanitarium and medical equipment and nurses, and medical attendance, be provided in central or suitable locations for the treatment of tubercular and other contagious diseases.\nAt a further interview on the 25th October, the following additional recommendations were submitted:\n\n8. - The salary for a day school teacher to be $500. The Church to appoint teachers who have Provincial certificates.\n\nWe agree to manage residential schools in Ontario at a per capita grant of One Hundred Dollars, and One Hundred and Thirty Dollars per pupil in all such schools West of the Great Lakes.\n\nThis grant not to include the cost of material for the plant, nor anything that may be regarded as a fixture in the building, such as any plumbing or heating apparatus, etc.\n\nAny deficits in the cost of management to be met by the Church managing the school. The Department to make the buildings of residential schools thoroughly sanitary and with sufficient ventilation, supplying medical men and nurses wherever necessary.\n\nAs the suggested changes may involve larger financial outlay, attention is called to the fact that at present there are more residential schools than are necessary to supply the needs of the territory occupied, and that it might be a wise policy to reduce the number or to transfer some of them to more needy localities.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentatives of the Anglican Church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentatives of the Presbyterian Church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentatives of the Methodist Church.\nThis came under\ncover with personal\nletter from Rev\nSutherland, and\nhas been acknowledged.\n\nPlease return to\n\nJ.M. Scott\nPRIVATE.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Oliver:\n\nThinking over the conversation which took place in Ottawa when you were kind enough to receive the Deputation of the Joint Committee of the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, on the subject of Indian Education, you made a remark to the effect that in propositions now submitted we were completely changing our relation to the Government on this question. I have been turning that remark over in my mind on several occasions since, and feel constrained to say, that I cannot quite understand the matter in the light which you appear to do. The principal changes that we ask for may be reduced to two in number. First, an increase in the per capita grant for Boarding Schools, and secondly that the Department provide the necessary plant in the way of buildings and equipment. This they have done in the past in regard to the Industrial Institutions, and, therefore, our request respecting the Boarding Schools is exactly on the same lines.\n\nEarnestly hoping that this matter may receive your favorable consideration, and that steps may be taken at the approaching session of Parliament to relieve us, in part at least, of a burden that is becoming unbearable,\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\nThe Honourable Frank Oliver,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, March 31st., 1908.\n\nReverend and dear Sirs,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the Memorandum of resolutions agreed upon by a Joint Committee representing the Methodist, Presbyterian and Anglican Churches in the month of April 1907 with additions made on the 29th of October; comprising altogether eight sub-heads.\n\nThese resolutions embody certain recommendations which you have thought proper to submit to the Department on the subject of Indian education, and since their receipt they have been the subject of careful consideration. Before dealing with the present position occupied by the question of Indian education it seems desirable to give a short review of the whole subject in order that it may be seen how the existing establishment has arisen, and why it is maintained.\n\nIt is self evident that the prime purpose of Indian education is to assist in solving what may be called the Indian problem, to elevate the Indian from his condition of savagery, to make him a self-supporting member of the state, and eventually a citizen in good standing. The work of Indian education from the earliest times has always been experimental, having this object in view, and if these methods have been open to criticism in some important particulars, yet it can safely be said that the general effect of the policy has made for the betterment of Indian conditions throughout the country.\n\nThe first efforts to educate the Indians were undertaken by the early missionaries to this country. Probably the first regular school established was at the Grand River, after the Six Nations had been settled there by Governor Haldimand. The imperial authorities under whose direction Indian affairs were administered up to the year 1860 did not make any special grant for education. The first funds set apart for these purposes arose from the commutation made by certain\ntribes of their annual distribution of ammunition. This formed the nucleus of what was called the Indian school fund, an account which was held as part of the Indian Trust Fund. This contribution began in 1848 and ended on the 30th June 1862. This Indian School Fund maintained Industrial schools at Mount Elgin and Alderville which were conducted by the Methodist Church upon a per capita grant. Thus, at the inception of the Indian School question, we find two main characteristics which have ever since continued, i.e., the principle of the per capita grant and the denominational interest. The Indian School Fund remained the sole financial aid to Indian education until 1875-6 when a grant to assist it was made by the Parliament of Canada. This financial aid enabled the Department to open day schools on various reserves in the Maritime Provinces and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Trust funds of the Indian bands also began to be made use of to a certain extent as the interest of the Indians themselves in education increased. The early Treaties or Surrenders by which the Indians ceded territory to the Crown did not stipulate for education as one of the considerations for this cession. The first mention of education as an obligation to be met by the Government appears in the Indian Treaty known as Treaty No. I, which was signed in the year 1871. This provision for education was included in the subsequent treaties and it is in part owing to the endeavor of the Department to carry out these Treaty stipulations that the large expenditure has arisen. But these Treaty stipulations have been more than fulfilled. As a rule the educational clauses of the Treaties simply state that teachers shall be provided when the Indians desire them. The inception of an educational policy was thus left to the Indians but has been initiated solely by the Government with a view to advance their general interests.\n\nThe first grant by the Dominion Government towards Indian schools was made as an assistance to be given in a lump sum to the\nIndian School Fund. The first vote was taken in 1875-6 and amounted to $2000.00. It was not until the year 1879-80 that any appropriation was made for Indian education in Manitoba and the North West Territories and in that year the sum of $11,000.00 was granted. The Indians of British Columbia received no educational benefits from Dominion expenditure until the year 1874-5 when $2474.47 was spent from the general appropriations. In 1878-9 the question of establishing Indian Industrial Schools in the West was first taken up.\n\nThe first industrial school was established at Battleford in 1883. The Department adopted the principles which had long governed Indian education in the older Provinces and this school was conducted by the Church of England. In the following year industrial schools were established at Qu'Appelle and High River under the guidance of the Roman Catholic Church. The principle of the per capita grant was extended to the schools in the new district in the year 1891 as a step in the direction of economy. It may, therefore, be said that the Department in establishing these schools merely extended the system already in vogue in the Eastern Provinces. In the year 1887 the Department inaugurated the policy of expansion which resulted gradually in a very large increase in expenditure. New principles of action were however adopted and the schools were conducted practically under the same rules and regulations and systems of payment. In the year 1878-79 the whole school appropriation for Canada was $16,000.00; in 1888-89 the expenditure was $178,980.98; for the year 1908-9 the appropriations will be $445,837.00. In addition to this expenditure from Consolidated Revenue the Indians themselves contributed an annual amount of over $10,000 from their own funds for the maintenance of day schools on their reserves, making a grand total of $456,000.00.\n\nIn the interval between 1862 and 1898 the Department had also completely wiped out the Indian School Fund, capital $39,142.85, and\ninterest, and the account was accordingly closed on the 1st July 1896.\n\nThis large expansion in expenditure has been accompanied by increased educational facilities. In 1888 there were about 30 schools in operation; at the present time there are 236 day schools, 55 boarding schools, and 22 industrial schools distributed as follows:\n\nDay Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Ontario           | 75     |\n| Quebec            | 19     |\n| Nova Scotia       | 10     |\n| New Brunswick     | 6      |\n| Prince Edward Island | 1    |\n| British Columbia  |        |\n| Manitoba          |        |\n| Saskatchewan      |        |\n| Alberta           |        |\n| Outside Treaty    |        |\n\nBoarding Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Ontario           | 3      |\n| British Columbia  | 8      |\n| Manitoba          | 9      |\n| Saskatchewan      | 14     |\n| Alberta           | 16     |\n| North West Territories | 3   |\n\nIndustrial Schools.\n\n| Province          | Number |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Ontario           | 5      |\n| British Columbia  | 9      |\n| Manitoba          | 2      |\n| Saskatchewan      | 3      |\n| Alberta           | 3      |\n\nThe following is an abstract of the whole expenditure from Consolidated Revenue from the 1st of July 1877 to the 30th June 1906:\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\n| Type              | Total Cost |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Industrial Boarding Day | $1,788,852.34 |\n|                   | $632,367.07 |\n|                   | $992,444.51 |\n|                   | $2,765,063.92 |\n\nChurch of England.\n\n| Type              | Total Cost |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Industrial Boarding Day | $1,383,115.60 |\n|                   | $279,631.38 |\n|                   | $409,680.30 |\n|                   | $2,072,447.28 |\n\nPresbyterian.\n\n| Type              | Total Cost |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| Industrial Boarding Day | $311,049.79 |\n|                   | $179,726.29 |\n|                   | $33,672.35 |\n|                   | $524,448.43 |\n\nCarried Forward...$5,361,959.69\n| Denomination       | Total Cost |\n|--------------------|------------|\n| Methodist          |            |\n| Industrial Boarding| $603,586.19|\n| Day                | $117,896.47|\n| Undenominational   |            |\n| 42 Day Schools     | $213,358.24|\n|                    | $984,780.90|\n| Grand Total        | $6,327,374.57|\n\nIn addition to this large expenditure from Consolidated Revenue and Indian Trust Funds the religious denominations interested in the welfare of the Indians and the development of educational facilities have provided large sums of money to assist in the work. The exact amount so spent is not available, but is doubtless known to the financial agents of the Churches interested. From statements furnished during the eight years ending the 30th June 1906, published in the Report of the Department, it is gathered that the denominations contributed during that time at least $435,000.00 toward this end; and from this amount some idea may be formed of the aggregate of the expenditure during the whole term. This outlay has principally taken place in connection with Boarding Schools which were for the most part established by the Churches, erected by them, and supported to a large extent from Church funds; the Department contributing relatively small amounts for buildings and equipment, and an even per capita grant of $60.00 and $75.00 per annum.\n\nThe growing inability of the religious denominations to finance the claims made by the Institutions which they have been largely responsible in establishing has led to the demands for increased grants and for a re-consideration of the educational methods referred to in your memorandum.\n\nThe financial aspect of the question is important as without\na very large increase in appropriations the present establishment could not be maintained; the number of pupils at present on the roll could not be provided for, nor the buildings at present occupied could not be rebuilt, enlarged or improved. If the policy outlined in the joint memorandum were to be adopted without any effort at rearrangement or retrenchment a moderate estimate of the necessary appropriation would be $381,979.00.\n\nIf there had been no doubt that the educational system heretofore maintained was best calculated to further the civilization of the Indians, the increased appropriations might be justified and probably an extension of educational work along the same lines, but it is clear that the present system with its large expenditure has not operated as was expected towards the civilization of the aborigines. The high death rate in the schools and the adverse influence of the reserve environment on discharged pupils has tended with other causes to minimize the effect of educational advantages. These influences have always been known to the Department and have been accepted as one of the inherent difficulties of the problem.\n\nThe Department has by regulations, enforced by medical officers, endeavored to prevent the admission to the schools of pupils tainted with tubercular diseases or children unhealthy in any other respect; and considering the extent to which disease is rife amongst the Indians, it may be stated that a fair measure of success has followed the efforts to select only healthy pupils for residence in the schools.\n\nThe Department has endeavored also to maintain an interest in pupils discharged from the schools, as it was early recognized that one of the great difficulties to be overcome was to prevent whatever degree of improvement had been received during the school life from being lost the moment it came in contact with the relatively savage life of the reserve. To this end the Department has assisted the most promising graduates with gifts of agricultural implements, cattle, seed\ngrain and material to build houses, and has endeavored to separate as far as possible promising young Indians from the influences of the ordinary Indian life; and these efforts have been reasonably successful. But despite all this official care and the interest manifested by the religious denominations it is open to question whether the very large expenditure from all sources has been justified by the result; whether as regards the Indians of the plains and British Columbia the system was not in advance of the needs of the case, and whether a better plan would not have been to proceed on a less extensive scale and to postpone the more elaborate system of residential schools until such a time as the Indian has become more or less civilized by the pressure of influences from without, and had shown the improving effect of the instruction and supervision in agricultural pursuits freely given by the Government.\n\nIt would seem to be good policy at this juncture to attempt to devise a better system of Indian education, applying to each locality methods which would best achieve the desired result and at the same time while not increasing the financial obligations of the Government would remove from the Churches a burden which they do not now find themselves able to bear. With these preliminary remarks the sections of your memorandum may be considered seriatim.\n\n(I) That the Government be requested to create an Advisory Board of Indian Education to which all churches and organizations engaged in Indian work shall have the privilege of nominating two representatives each.\n\n(I) - There would appear to be no objection to the Churches creating an Advisory Board, having two representatives from each Church, for the purpose of consulting with the Department on educational questions in which the Churches are interested.\n\nThe Department has at all times been willing to give full\nconsideration to the representations of the churches, but it has been found confusing to deal with a large number of persons in authority who are interested in the Indian work.\n\n(2) That in addition to the elements of an English education the Indian boys shall be trained in agricultural or such other pursuits in their different branches as may be possible where the School is situated, and also in such manual pursuits as may be useful to them in an outdoor life in the district to which they belong. Similarly with the girls that they be trained for domestic life and elementary nursing.\n\n(2) -- This has always been the policy of the Department with reference to Indian education in residential schools. Often from the difficulty of collecting pupils from districts where the curriculum of the school can be of direct benefit to them it has not been carried out, but as the future policy of the Department and the contemplated rearrangement of residential schools would have in view a closer relation to the policy, it is hoped that it may be carried out with greater strictness with better results.\n\n(3) That all the schools, resident and non-resident, shall be so constituted, equipped and conducted that the policy briefly outlined in the above clause may be most perfectly realized, and that the Government shall provide suitable buildings and equipments therefor.\n\n(3) -- This clause is germane to No. 2, and it follows wherever day schools or residential schools are established suitable buildings and equipment should be provided. The general management of the school should reflect as closely as possible the policy to be adopted.\n\n(4) That pupils, as a rule, shall be discharged at the age of eighteen, but it should be arranged that in exceptional cases, pupils may be retained longer on the recommendation of the Church\nin charge of the school and with the consent of the Indian Commissioner. Also it should be made possible for especially promising pupils to receive extra training for any special vocation at the expense of the Government, such pupils meantime to be under the supervision of the school.\n\n(4) - The existing rule is that pupils should be discharged at the age of 18, and, until it is clear that some other age limit could be established with advantage, that age may be allowed to stand. Exceptional cases should be considered on their merits, and the recommendation of the advisory board would be considered when the question for the further education of promising pupils comes up for consideration.\n\n(5) While realizing the difficulties of administering a policy of compulsory education, we are convinced that such a principle is in the best interests of all concerned - of the parents, of the children, and of the State, and should be enforced so far as can be wisely and rightly done. If this becomes the accepted policy of the Government, is it too much to expect that the influence of Government employees be brought to bear in the kind but firm enforcement of the law?\n\nThe policy of funding the treaty money for children attending Boarding or Industrial Schools, having been found to operate against securing pupils for these schools, should be discontinued, and all Government donations in excess of Treaty obligations should be withheld from such parents as refuse to send their children to school.\n\n(5) - The question of compulsory education will receive at once full consideration. Sections 9, 10 and II of the Indian Act, Chap. 61 of the Revised Statutes, empower the Governor in Council to make regulations to secure the compulsory attendance of children at school, and under a previous enactment, Chap. 32, 57, 58 Vict., regulations governing the education of Indian children were passed by His Excellency in Council on November 10, 1894. These regulations are still in force and go as far as was deemed advisable, as it was not considered that attendance at boarding and industrial schools could be made compulsory, and that no rule should be adopted which would provide for the arbitrary separation of parents and children. It has always been the wish of the Department that\nofficials and employees should give their active influence in furthering the educational policy, and the attention of Agents generally will be again directed to this very important phase of their general administrative duties.\n\nThe funding of treaty money for children who attend boarding and industrial schools (which were undertaken in order that, on leaving school, they might have a small amount of cash to expend in the purchase of some necessary articles to begin life on the reserve) might be discontinued. It has often been questioned whether the trouble which the administration of these small accounts entails was compensated by any genuine benefit to the mass of depositors, and if the withholding of annuity money from parents operates against the securing of pupils it may be thought well to reconsider this question.\n\nThe suggested step of withholding Government aid in excess of treaty obligations could hardly be adopted as part of a general educational policy. In very few agencies are donations given beyond treaty obligations and these are principally extended to destitute Indians, and it is necessary not to permit any harshness to Indians who cannot well provide for themselves.\n\nThat whereas the Indians are wards of the Government, and their education, at least in part, secured by treaty, it is only reasonable that the Government should bear all expenses involved in such training as is contemplated, which would include a larger per capita grant. The Churches anxious and willing to continue to co-operate with the Government in the civilization and Christianization of the Indians are convinced that the moral and spiritual side of education cannot be hoped for except by the appointment of teachers in every way qualified for a work so peculiar and important. The request is therefore made that the appointment of teachers be entrusted to the Churches on terms to be mutually agreed upon.\n\nThe increased per capita grant suggested in Clause 8, if adopted, will virtually place the Government in the position of bearing all expenses involved in Indian education. The present establishment includes schools which while recognized by the Govern-\nment were established in the first instance by the Churches, and it is thought that a rearrangement of these schools and the adoption of a new type of school would further the interests of Indian education and at the same time render it unnecessary to apply to Parliament for an increase in the gross appropriation. The expression of willingness on the part of the Churches to co-operate with the Government is noted with pleasure; and it is most important that teachers well qualified for the work should be appointed.\n\n(7) That sanitarium and medical equipment and nurses and medical attendance be provided in central or suitable locations for the treatment of tubercular and other contagious diseases.\n\n(7) As you are no doubt aware the Department has a system of medical attendance which is intended generally to provide for this branch of the Indian work throughout the country. At a very early date it was recognized that this class of relief was one which would largely devolve on the Dominion Government and Parliamentary appropriations have since Confederation been obtained for this purpose. Of late years hospitals have also been established and in the older Provinces the hospitals for white communities have been made use of by the Indians. For the approaching fiscal year the Department has asked Parliament to vote the following sums for medical attendance, medicines and hospitals:\n\n| Medical Attendance and Medicines |\n|----------------------------------|\n| Quebec,                          | $2400.00 |\n| Ontario,                         | 2000.00  |\n| Nova Scotia,                     | 3700.00  |\n| Carried Forward                  | $9100.00 |\nCarried Forward, $9100.00\n\nNew Brunswick, 4000.00\nPrince Edward Island, 650.00\nBritish Columbia (including 5 Hospitals $4450.00) 27450.00\nManitoba and the North West Territories &c. (including Hospitals $12,781.00) 40827.00\n\nTotal, ...... $82,027.00\n\nWithin the last few years the experiment has been made of establishing tent hospitals for the treatment of tubercular diseases; one at Saddle Lake, one at Touchwood Hills, and one at Birtle, also a well equipped small hospital at Morley for the same purpose for the use of the Story Indians and the pupils of the McDougall Orphanage. In British Columbia the Department has assisted in the establishment of five hospitals where Indian patients may be treated. It will be understood from these facts that it will be necessary simply to extend the present provisions of the Department if thought advisable; no initiative is needed as would seem to be implied in this clause of the joint memorandum.\n\nIt might be wise however to test the results of the hospitals already established before increasing their number. Wherever well equipped hospitals are provided by municipalities which could be used by Indians it would seem a good policy to use these for treatment instead of multiplying the number of small hospitals intended solely for Indians; and this system the Department is following wherever the conditions warrant.\n\nIn addition to this professional attendance and supply of medical accessories the Department makes as large a use as possible of professional knowledge with reference to contagious diseases, tuberculosis, and sanitary measures generally. It issues to its Agents positive instructions in all matters of sanitation on the reserves and places them in possession of the\nsimple and obvious methods of preventing the spread of tuberculosis; and they are made clearly to understand that a principal part of their duty is to enforce these regulations, and to keep constantly before the Indians the desirability of practising such preventive measures.\n\nThe question of nurses will be dealt with in remarks to be made on clause No. 8.\n\n(8) The salary for a day school teacher to be $500. The Church to appoint teachers who have Provincial certificates.\n\nWe agree to manage residential schools in Ontario at a per capita grant of One Hundred Dollars, and One Hundred and Thirty Dollars per pupil in all such schools west of the Great Lakes.\n\nThis grant not to include the cost of material for the plant, nor anything that may be regarded as a fixture in the building, such as any plumbing or heating apparatus, etc.\n\nAny deficits in the cost of management to be met by the Church managing the school. The Department to make the buildings of residential schools thoroughly sanitary and with sufficient ventilation supplying medical men and nurses wherever necessary.\n\nAs the suggested changes may involve larger financial outlay, attention is called to the fact that at present there are more residential schools than are necessary to supply the needs of the territory occupied, and that it might be a wise policy to reduce the number or to transfer some of them to more needy localities.\n\n(8) This clause deals with the financial side of the question.\n\nAs stated in my preliminary remarks, if the present educational system could be shown to have justified the expenditure upon it, it might not be difficult to ask for increased appropriations; but as the consensus of opinion seems to be that such is not the case, I would find it difficult at present to justify the increase which would be necessary if the augmented scale of per capita allowances and teachers' salaries was to be adopted for the present enrollment; and if any change were to be made it would involve an increase as before shown of about $186,142.00 and a capital expenditure of about $350,000.00.\n\nAt the outset it might be remarked that the question is complicated by the fact that the Roman Catholic Church while equally\ninterested with the Protestant denominations in the evangelization and education of the Indians has not asked for any generally increased grants, and do not seek more favorable terms. You will recognize the impossibility of dealing with the question at all and overlooking the rights of a Church so largely interested in the work to treatment equally favorable.\n\nThe educational needs of the Indians vary in different Provinces and it would seem to be advisable to divide the subject into several classes geographically, and to deal with each separately:\n\nNOVA SCOTIA, NEW BRUNSWICK, PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND,\nQUEBEC, ONTARIO.\n\nThe day schools throughout Indian reserves in these Provinces are usually more or less in touch with surrounding civilization and as the Indians themselves are more or less civilized the conduct of the schools should approximate as nearly as possible to conditions which appertain amongst white people. It might be laid down as a rule that the teachers of Indian schools who are well qualified for the special work should be paid a salary of from $300.00 to $500.00, and the principle of annual increases should be resorted to in order to give an incentive for diligence and application; and that the interest of teachers and pupils should be stimulated in every possible way in order to increase the average attendance.\n\nThe residential schools in Ontario situated in settled districts and drawing their pupils from Indians that are already well advanced in civilization should be useful factors in improving the standard of Indian life. The increase in the grant from $60. to $100. per capita does not seem to be excessive, and I would feel inclined to recommend the Government to increase the grant at\nthese schools to that rate; if it were found possible to carry out the changes which will be mentioned later on and if the increase does not involve a general increase in the appropriations.\n\nIt may be remarked, however, that these schools within the next few years should prove their usefulness as it might be better to allow the day schools on the reserves to furnish whatever would be required in the way of literary education and to give more attention to the improvement of general agricultural conditions throughout the older Provinces, as they are by no means in as forward a condition as they should be. After the increased grant has been paid for a year or two an inspection of the school accounts will show whether it was larger than required.\n\nMANITOBA, SASKATCHEWAN, ALBERTA AND NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nIt is probably the fact that the educational system adopted for use in the unorganized territories in the year 1883 was in advance of the real needs of the case; that a more permanent influence for good would have been exerted by Industrial education carried on upon the reserves, and made up not only of tuition at day schools but of the generally civilizing influence of instruction given to adults in agricultural, ranching and domestic pursuits. It must not be lost sight of that in several districts of the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta the Indians are practically self-supporting, and as a basis of material progress is always necessary before education can have any lasting value, it may be said that the best interests of the Indians have been served by instruction carried out upon the reserves and not by the elaborate system of education. It would seem to be advisable to get back to these first principles and to expend whatever appropriations are placed at the disposal of the Department largely in improving conditions on reserves.\n\nIn line with the foregoing remarks it would seem to be admirable\nto close certain residential schools which have been for some time in operation. The Industrial School at Calgary has been abolished, the St. Paul's Industrial School at Middlechurch was not rebuilt after the late fire, and in considering a further reduction in the number of Industrial Schools it occurs that either the Brandon or Elkhorn School might be done away with, as well as the School at Regina. The Brandon School, while well conducted, has not served the purpose for which it was established, as the pupils are drawn from districts where agriculture cannot extensively be carried on. The Elkhorn School while it is also well conducted is an expensive institution. The School at Regina while it draws its pupils from an agricultural district has been a source of considerable unforeseen expense to the Department and of late years has not been very successful.\n\nThe closing at the end of the present fiscal year of the following Boarding Schools might also be carried out:\n\nCrowstand, Emmanuel College,\nFile Hills, Gordon's,\nRound Lake, Onion Lake,\nPeigan, Morley,\nOld Suns, Bloods,\nSarcee,\n\nOn the reserves which have heretofore been served by these Schools an improved type of day school might be established. The staff would consist of a married teacher, and, on the large reserves, of a nurse also; and a nutritious and simple noonday meal might be served to the pupils at the school. The nurse might be occupied in house and tent visitation, directing sanitary measures, and the wife of the teacher should have domestic qualifications which would make her useful in instructing the Indian women in the ordinary domestic employments. Such a system might\nbe given a trial for four or five years. Children of whose strong constitutions and general health there could be no reasonable doubt could be drafted into the existing Industrial Schools which would be placed in a thoroughly sanitary condition and the tuition at which would be specially designed for the localities where they are situated. The experience of the Department with the best Day Schools under its control has shown conclusively that most efficient work may be done through this medium. The best Day Schools in the older Provinces are doing an excellent work. Those at Lorette, St. Francois, Caughnawaga and the Six Nation Reserve may be specially cited; and in dealing with the school on Mistawasis Reserve, in the Province of Saskatchewan, the Indian Commissioner felt called upon to remark that the report shows the school to be in a highly creditable condition. If we had Day Schools like this, our Boarding Schools might be dispensed with.\n\nThe experience of the United States Indian Department also shows that the Day Schools as conducted in that country, which include gardens and substantial hot lunches for the children, are considered the strongest civilizing influence that can be brought to bear upon the Indian. If it is to be considered any disadvantage that the children should remain with parents living a semi-civilized life, against this disadvantage must be weighed the positive gain which would result from the children being brought up surrounded by the conditions under which they must gain their livelihood.\n\nAs the sanitation of Indian dwellings is gradually improved, the Indian children who are tainted with tuberculosis will have a better chance to overcome the disease than if they were closely housed in Boarding Schools or sanitariums, and the danger to other pupils would be minimized. If this change was carried out with\nreference to the Protestant schools just mentioned and certain Roman Catholic schools as well it would enable the Department to pay the increased grant to the industrial and boarding schools to be maintained in the future without asking Parliament for largely increased appropriations.\n\nSchools in unorganized districts which draw their pupils from the reserves where the Indians maintain themselves by hunting might be allowed for the present to continue, but it is thought that the number of pupils in residence should not be increased beyond the present provisions. As the Indians settle upon their reserves and as new conditions arise these schools might also be abolished and the new type of school substituted.\n\nIt will be observed that the new departure consists of maintaining Residential Schools in the unorganized districts, where Indians spend their winter on their hunting grounds and are not settled on the reserves, and the provision of an improved type of Day School, with a few large residential schools for Indians who have already settled on the reserves and are supporting themselves to a greater or less extent by agricultural pursuits and ranching.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nThe situation in British Columbia requires special attention and it would not seem to be advisable to authorize the large capital expenditure which would be necessary if the establishment is to be maintained as at present, until the needs of each locality are carefully enquired into and the necessity of each existing school demonstrated. In some localities where the question of entirely rebuilding or enlarging and improving certain school buildings would have to be immediately considered it might be found advantageous to establish Day Schools. The location of several of the Boarding Schools was not considered with sufficient\ncare when the buildings were erected, and it would seem hardly advisable to spend any considerable amount on their improvement.\n\nThe closing of the Metlakatla Industrial School and the maintenance of an efficient Day School at that point will be necessary to spend in the neighborhood of $30,000.00 to put the present buildings in a satisfactory condition. There are only 18 boys in attendance and the school accounts show a deficit. As all the pupils are drafted from Metlakatla it would not seem to be necessary to continue the large expenditure for this institution. It should be remembered that the British Columbia Indians are practically self-supporting, and the policy of removing the children from their parents and separating them from the ordinary vocations by which in their future lives they must obtain a living is questionable. From these general causes it seems advisable in this province to proceed with a good deal of circumspection before large expenditures are incurred which would tend to perpetuate the present system. It is therefore not at present proposed to extend the increased per capita grant to the Schools in this Province, or to provide for augmented capital expenditure.\n\nIf these changes were carried out the residential schools to be maintained would be thoroughly overhauled and increased ventilation and improved sanitation would be provided for. As the Department now provides medical attendance and medicines for the schools, no change is necessary in that regard, and the question of the possibility of engaging nurses as instructors would be considered. The increased grant to be paid to the Schools would carry with it the obligation on their part to meet all deficits, and to provide whatever labor for repairs etc is necessary; as at present.\n\nThe following statement shows the financial provision\nCopy of this letter sent to\n\nHon.

H. BLAKE\nON TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, THE\n24th, 25th, 26th and 27th days of March, 1908.\n\nThe members duly appointed by the Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist Churches to represent them in conference with the Superintendent of Indian affairs on the subject of Indian education beg to acknowledge the receipt of two letters from the Superintendent dated the 14th and 28th of last January and a communication from the Deputy Superintendent of date the 21st of this present month, all of which have been carefully considered by the Committee appointed as above mentioned.\n\nThe Committee begs to acknowledge the satisfaction with which it has perused these three documents, prepared with evident care, setting forth the salient facts connected with this most important question, dealing in detail with the resolutions presented to the Department dated April and October 1907, and making suggestions as to all the matters laid before the Superintendent by the Committee, which will now be dealt with seriatim in as few words as possible.\n\n1. The Committee agrees with the statement of the Department that \"the work of Indian education from the earliest times has always been experimental\", and recognizes that the time is now ripe, acting upon the experience of the many years\npast, to take a forward movement all along the lines and\nto introduce such modifications and improvements as are clearly\ncalled for.\n\n2. The Committee recognizes the importance of the fol-\nlowing conclusions of the Department:\n\n(a) \"The financial aspect of the question is important\nas without a very large increase in appropriations the present\nestablishment could not be maintained. If the policy outlined\nin the joint memorandum were to be adopted without any effort\nat re-arrangement or retrenchment a moderate estimate of the\nnecessary appropriation would be $81,979.00;\n\n(b) If there had been no doubt that the educational sys-\ntem heretofore maintained was best calculated to further the\ncivilisation of the Indians, the increased appropriations\nmight be justified and probably an extension of educational\nwork along the same lines, but it is clear that the present\nsystem with its large expenditure has not operated as was ex-\npected towards the civilisation of the aborigines. The high\ndeath-rate in the schools and the adverse influence of the\nreserve environment on discharged pupils has tended with other\ncauses to minimise the effect of educational advantages.\nThese influences have always been known to the Department and\nhave been accepted as one of the inherent difficulties of the\nproblem;\n\n(c) The Department has by regulations enforced by medical\nofficers endeavored to prevent the admission to the schools\nof pupils tainted, &c.,\n\n(d) The Department has endeavored also to maintain an\ninterest in pupils discharged from the schools;\n\n(e) It is open to question whether the very large\nexpenditure from all sources has been justified by the results.\"\n\nThe Committee while recognizing the wisdom of the\nregulations made by the Department and its sincere desire\nthrough its agents to better the pupils, would ask that by a\nmore complete system of supervision the Department would in-\nsist that its agents more thoroughly carry out the instructions\ngiven to them.\n3. The Committee concur heartily in the following general statement which precedes the dealing with the matters in detail by the Department: \"It would seem to be good policy at this juncture to attempt to devise a better system of Indian education, applying to each locality methods which would best achieve the desired result and at the same time while not increasing the financial obligations of the Government would remove from the Churches a burden which they do not now find themselves able to bear\".\n\n4. We note the concurrence in the proposal made by the Committee for the formation of \"an Advisory Board\" on Indian education of two members from each of the three above named Churches, which has been already acted upon. This Board will be ready at all times to co-operate with the Department.\n\n5. It is satisfactory to find how completely the Department assents to the following proposal:\n\n(a) \"That in addition to the elements of an English education the Indian boys shall be trained in agricultural or such other pursuits in their different branches as may be possible where the school is situated, and also in such manual pursuits as may be useful to them in an outdoor life in the district to which they belong. Similarly with the girls so that they may be trained for domestic life and elementary nursing;\n\n(b) That all the schools, resident and non-resident shall be so situated, equipped and conducted that the policy briefly outlined in the above clause may be most perfectly realized and that the Government shall provide suitable buildings and equipments therefor\".\n\nAs to which the Department replies:\n\n(a) \"As the future policy of the Department and the contemplated re-arrangement of residential schools would have in view a closer relation to the policy, it is hoped that it may\nbe carried out with greater strictness and with better results;\n\n(b) It follows wherever day schools or residential schools are established suitable buildings and equipment should be provided. The general management of the school should reflect as closely as possible the policy to be adopted.\"\n\n6. The Department concurs in the view of the Committee that while eighteen as the age limit may be allowed to stand, exceptional cases should be considered on their merits and dealt with as to further education when they arise.\n\n7. On the request made by the Committee to introduce more largely the principle of \"compulsory education\", it is glad to receive the answer that \"the question of compulsory education will receive at once full consideration\". The reasons why a different rule should apply as to compulsory attendance in the case of industrial and boarding schools and the case of day schools is obvious, and the reasonableness of the conclusion \"that no rule shall be adopted which would provide for the arbitrary separation of parents and children\". The Committee learns with pleasure that \"it has always been the wish of the Department that officials and employees should give their active influence in furthering the educational policy, and the attention of agents generally will be again directed to this very important phase of their general administrative duties.\" From such action of the Department the Committee looks forward to good results.\n\nThe Committee is pleased to know that the Department concurs with it in the view expressed in its memorandum that\nthe policy of funding the treaty money for children should be discontinued and that the question of withholding treaty money from parents will be reconsidered.\n\n8. The Committee notes that in answer to the clause of its memorandum which asks that as the Indians are the wards of the Government it should bear all the expenses of the contemplated training, which would include a larger per capita grant, and that in order to obtain qualified teachers the same should be appointed by the Churches on terms to be mutually agreed upon, the Department calls attention to the fact that \"the increased per capita grant suggested in Clause 8 of the Committee's memorandum which is above referred to is as follows:\n\n\"The salary for a day school teacher to be $500.00. The Church to appoint teachers who have Provincial Certificates. We agree to manage residential schools in Ontario at a per capita grant of $100.00 and $150.00 per pupil in all such schools west of the Great Lakes. This grant not to include the cost of material for the plant nor anything that may be regarded as a fixture in the building, such as any plumbing or heating apparatus, &c. Any deficit in the cost of management to be met by the Church managing the school. The Department to make the buildings of residential schools thoroughly sanitary and with sufficient ventilation, supplying medical men and nurses wherever necessary. As the suggested changes may involve larger financial outlay, attention is called to the fact that at present there are more residential schools than are necessary to supply the needs of the territory occupied, and that it might be a wise policy to reduce the number or to transfer some of them to more needy localities.\"\n\nAs to this statement of the Committee the Department remarks:\nThis clause deals with the financial side of the question. As stated in my preliminary remarks, if the present educational system could be shown to have justified the expenditure upon it, it might not be difficult to ask for increased appropriations; but as the consensus of opinion seems to be that such is not the case I would find it difficult at present to justify the increase which would be necessary if the augmented scale of per capita allowances and teachers' salaries was to be adopted for the present enrollment; and if any change was to be made it would involve an increase as before shown of about $186,142 and a capital expenditure of about $350,000.\n\nAt the outset it might be remarked that the question is complicated by the fact that the Roman Catholic Church while equally interested with the Protestant denominations in the evangelization and education of the Indians has not asked for any generally increased grants and do not seek more favorable terms. You will recognize the impossibility of dealing with the question at all and overlooking the rights of a Church so largely interested in the work to treatment equally favorable.\n\nOn this the Committee desires to make but two remarks. If the policy of judiciously reducing the number of residential schools be introduced the saving thus caused will enable the Department to carry out the improvements and modifications suggested with but little if any increase in the cost to the Department of the schools generally.\n\nThat in dealing with the question of any complications arising because of the Roman Catholic Church to which the Department calls attention, it will no doubt be present to the mind of the Superintendent that at his request, well nigh a year was spent in endeavouring to procure the presence of representatives of the Roman Catholics at our conferences, but all the efforts failed, and a refusal to co-operate in working out a scheme was finally the answer received. It is\ntherefore submitted that the position of the three Churches now approaching the Department should not be in any manner prejudiced because of the refusal of this Church to co-operate but that whatever is considered in the best interests of the Indians should be carried out. Wherever it is thought wise to close or change the class of school this should be done, and wherever the school is not found to answer the best interests of the Indian the grants of the Department should cease no matter what religious body might be controlling the school.\n\n9. The Committee has received with pleasure the statement of the work that has been done by the Department throughout the Dominion in the way of medical attendance, hospitals, nurses, sanitary arrangements and the like, and that it is the intention of the Department to extend this work until the demands of the country are answered. The Department may count upon the assistance of the Churches represented by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee emphasizes the weight it attaches to the following statement:\n\n\"The Department 'issues to its agents positive instructions in all matters of sanitation on the reserves, and places them in possession of the simple and obvious methods of preventing the spread of tuberculosis; and they are made clearly to understand that a principal part of their duty is to enforce these regulations, and to keep constantly before the Indians the desirability of practising such preventive measures.'\"\n10. In the general remarks made in the communication of the Department the Committee is well pleased to find the following:\n\n\"It might be laid down as a general rule that the teachers of Indian schools who are well qualified for the special work should be paid a salary of from $500.00 to $600.00 and the principle of annual increases should be resorted to in order to give an incentive for diligence and application; and that the interest of teachers and pupils should be stimulated in every possible way in order to increase the average attendance.\"\n\nThe Committee heartily approves the wisdom and necessity of this determination but suggests from the experience of its members that, looking at the increased cost of living and the arduous nature of the work demanded of the teachers, it will be necessary to increase the maximum figures so that $650.00 shall be generally the ultimate figure and in case of married men $750.00. It is feared that unless this incentive be given it will be difficult to command a good class of teachers and therefore the problem of the day school will fail to be satisfactorily solved.\n\n11. The Department proceeds to deal specifically with certain of the residential schools, and considers it advisable that they should be closed. This is a matter with which the Department, having a large and general knowledge of the locations of the schools, the needs of the various reserves, the advisability of the class of school whether residential or day, can better deal than can the Committee.\nIn some cases one day school will not take the place of a boarding school because of the large extent of some of the reserves and of the impossibility of the attendance of the pupil daily at a school far removed. In such cases it may be necessary either to increase the number of the day schools in that locality or to erect or to continue where erected a boarding school to answer the requirements of the extensive reserve.\n\nIf the system of compulsory education be enforced it will be necessary to increase considerably the school accommodation in order to provide for the larger attendance, as now only about fifty per cent of the children of school age attend the present schools.\n\nIt will be necessary for the Department to take, as no doubt it will, a wide view of the whole situation, and with the full information that can be obtained by its agents and officials in all quarters, to determine what in the general interest of the whole work is best to be done.\n\nIt must not be forgotten that the Department supplies such a very large portion of the funds necessary to carry on this work \u2014 in not a few cases covering the whole of the expenditure \u2014 that it should ultimately control in dealing with the question of location and class of school. It is responsible for the proper carrying on of the work of educating the Indian.\nAt the same time the Committee humbly submits that it will be in the interest of the Department in dealing with this phase of the case before any present existing school is closed and before any new school is opened, that a statement of the intention of the Department and the reasons for such action should be presented to this Committee in order that the proposal of the Government may be presented to the Church to be affected by the change in order that if it pleases reasons may be assigned either against or for a modification of the proposed action of the Government. This it is conceived would go far to prevent friction between the Department and the Churches.\n\nAt the same time it should be mentioned that the Committee does not desire to shirk any responsibility that may reasonably be cast upon it and that it will be at all times prepared to consider any proposal that may be made by the Department to obtain whatever information it is within its power to procure and to confer with the officers of the Department in their efforts to solve for the best the important questions which are now being dealt with between the Department and the Committee.\n\nThe Committee notices the conclusion of the Department that British Columbia requires special attention; in which it entirely concurs. The conditions of settlement on the Coast are in a state of transition. There is but little\nof the vast amount of coast line suitable for agricultural purposes or perhaps even habitable. It may be that in the near future, looking at the demands of railways and commercial undertakings, the rights of the Indians may be largely purchased out by those promoting these works, which would necessitate the removal of the Indians and would render schools erected to answer the merely present demand useless for the purpose of their education.\n\nThe Committee very earnestly presses upon the Department the very great desire on the part of all the Churches it represents, embracing probably one-half of the Indians in the Dominion, to have the proposed improvements carried out at as early a date as possible. Even although all that is contemplated may not be accomplished within a year or two, yet still the making of a beginning will be grateful to our constituents and be an earnest of the fuller work which is being undertaken.\n\nThe Committee begs to present its grateful thanks to the Superintendent and the Deputy-Superintendent for the courtesy extended by them to its members and for the careful investigation of all the matters presented to them for their consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date: 27 March 1905]\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nA reply has been received to the letter of 21st March addressed to the members of the Joint Committee on Indian educational matters, and I beg to set forth the action which it seems to me necessary to take in consequence of the Committee's reply.\n\nAs a preliminary I may say that an Advisory Board has been formed consisting of two members from each of the three protestant Churches concerned, and the Hon. S. H. Blake has been appointed Chairman and the Rev. R. P. MacKey Secretary. I take it for granted that in forming the Board the members have the authority of their respective denominations, and that the Department may communicate from time to time with the new Advisory Board on matters of importance involving the general question of Indian education. It may be said that the opinions of the Committee coincide with those of the Department on all general matters and that the detail alone requires to be worked out.\n\nAction under these headings might be taken at once:\u2014\n\nConsideration of the regulations for compulsory attendance at Day Schools throughout the Dominion, and a revision of the existing regulations in this regard.\n\nPreparation of a circular to all Indian Agents instructing\nthem to give their active influence in furthering the educational policy of the Department.\n\nThe adoption of the principle that the annuity money shall not be arbitrarily withheld from the parents of Indian children and that only where they request that a child's annuity be funded for its benefit shall this be done.\n\nThe Committee desires before action is finally taken to close any residential schools that the matter be laid before the Committee in order that the proposal of the Government may be presented to the Church affected.\n\nThis is at present really the heart of the matter and as the initiative must come from the Department it seems to the undersigned that it would be advisable to take up the question of closing such Schools as we are in a position to say should be closed, and then proceed to consider the desirability of closing all the Boarding Schools mentioned in our letter of the 21st March. At present the following schools could be closed without any detriment to the work.\n\nMORLEY: There is no doubt that the pupils of this School could be accommodated at Red Deer. They are both Methodist institutions.\n\nREGINA: There should only be one school for the district covered by Regina, Elkhorn and Brandon, and that school should in my opinion be located at Brandon. The present institution should be considered in the light of a model Indian institution, and we should expect the best methods and results from its management. Situated near\nthe city and being constantly visited by the people, it would serve as an object lesson of what the Department was doing for the Indians in these Industrial Schools. It should draw its pupils from the agricultural reserves, and not from the northern fishing districts. It should furnish a non-denominational education and any pupils that belong to the Anglican or Presbyterian persuasion should be taken to their respective Churches each Sunday by an officer of the School, and Ministers of the denominations should at all times have access to them.\n\nIf this School is built up and encouraged there will be no necessity for a School at Regina or at Elkhorn. If the Department allows the Boarding Schools at Birtle, Round Lake, Crowfoot, and File Hills to remain until we can decide where it is best to place a few model Day Schools, it should go far to remove the dislike of the section of the Presbyterian Church to the closing of the Regina School. While we would not consider these Boarding Schools as permanent, we might well allow them to remain until we see our way clear to their abolishment.\n\nAs the Elkhorn School is conducted by the Department there should be no insurmountable difficulty in closing it. I would suggest that the pupils be transferred to Brandon; that the staff, with the exception of any that might need to be transferred to Brandon on account of the increased pupilage, be given three months' notice with pay from the 1st of May; that the Principal and the Matron, Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Wilson, be retained in the service of the Department at their present salary, with a free house at Elkhorn and two rations, to be employed in an inspectorial capacity in connection with the remaining Schools. I think\nsome consideration is due Mr. and Mrs. Wilson after their long connection with Indian work.\n\nI have for some time been considering the necessity of the appointment of another Inspector in the North West Territories to devote his time exclusively to the Inspection of Residential Schools. The work of the Agency Inspectors is too heavy to permit them to spend much of their time at Schools, and I think both sides of the work have suffered in consequence. I would not propose to appoint Mr. Wilson as Inspector at once until he had proved his capacity; and I think Mrs. Wilson's services could be well utilized by the Department in superintending whatever system of nurses or field matrons we may adopt in connection with the new type of Day School. It is thought that retaining Mr. and Mrs. Wilson in the service would lessen somewhat the difficulty of closing the Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nEMMANUEL COLLEGE: The present position of Emmanuel College is this. The Principal has been informed that the School must be closed unless the Church pays the deficit but if the deficit is paid the Department will continue the School. It is hardly probable that the Church authorities will pay the deficit, and it may be foreshadowed that the School will be closed at an early date. If so, I would propose to establish one or two of the improved Day Schools in the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies at favorable points, one I think should be located in Mistawasis Reserve.\n\nIf this action is carried out, I would suggest paying the remaining\nBoarding and Industrial Schools at the rate of $130.00 per capita for the Protestant Schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories, and increasing the grant of the Ontario Schools to $100.00 per capita. The Mohawk Institute would not at present be included in this arrangement which is conducted by the New England Company. I think the grant to this School should be somewhat increased, but not to the extent of $100.00. This might form the subject of correspondence with the Principal of the School. This would involve taking a vote of, say, $50,000.00 for Indian Schools generally.\n\nI would suggest that the Roman Catholic Bishops who are interested in the Indian work should be requested to appoint two representatives to confer with the Department with reference to Indian educational matters in the Western Provinces. When they agree upon representatives the scheme for the increase in the per capita grant, and the reduction in the number of Schools, etc., could be brought before them.\n\nWith reference to Clause 10 of the Memorandum from the Joint Committee I would say that evidently the purpose of the Department in proposing an increase to $500.00 for Day Schools has been somewhat misunderstood. This rate would not apply to the improved type of Day School but to the ordinary school as at present conducted. We are looking forward to the provision of a salary for a teacher and his wife at an improved Day School, which would be equal to at least $750.00 per annum, as two rations and free quarters would be included in the emolument.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 24th., 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the Memorandum of the Conference held by your Board from the 24th to the 27th of March, 1908. It is gratifying to find that such an unanimity of opinion exists in the important matters dealt with in the previous correspondence. Concurrence in all the main features of the question seem to be so general that it is only required to work out the details involved with care and proper consideration for the many interests concerned. It was never designed to be the policy of the Department to immediately abolish the residential schools without substituting some efficient means for caring for the pupils who had previously been accommodated therein. It would seem to be well therefore to place before your Committee very fully what the Department has hoped would be an improved Day School, which might in very many localities be a useful factor in Indian education and remove to a large extent the ground for criticism which exists even as regards the best residential schools.\n\nI therefore submit herewith plans of an improved building which it is proposed to erect on one or two reserves where the Indians are favourably situated for such an experiment. As you will see, the School is designed to accommodate a teacher and his wife and a nurse. The nurse's sleeping apartment is connected with an infirmary where a few sick children might be cared for and a dispensary where a supply of drugs could be kept on hand. The quarters for the teacher and his family are, it is thought, sufficiently commodious; comprising Dining Room, living room and bed-rooms, with proper kitchen accommodation.\n\nThe school building is separated from the residence of the staff and will form a commodious class-room for tuition at certain hours of the day.\n\nYou will observe the buildings are designed to provide for the\nserving of a sum mid-day meal for the pupils in attendance, and to be\nthe headquarters of civilising influences on the reserve. Accommodation\nis afforded for a few sick children, and it would be the duty of the\nnurse by house-to-house visitation to inoculate sanitary principles,\ndispense simple medicines, instruct the Indian women in the simplest\nmethods of nursing, and to care for a few cases which might require\nhospital treatment. This feature of the plan might be further extended\nwhere the Department has already established a hospital on the Reserve,\nand the physician in charge of the Indians would be expected to co-operate\nwith the nurse.\n\nThe duties of the teacher and his wife would be of course\nlimited to educational work; but it is thought to make the woman's\ninfluence a large factor in the scheme. She will be expected in the\ncharacter of field matron to take an interest in the women of the\nreserve and to endeavor by precept and example to instruct them in the\nsimplest domestic arts - the making of good bread, the preparation of\nordinary articles of diet, the cleanliness of houses &c. &c. It is ex-\npected that she would have the assistance of the larger girls in pre-\nparing the mid-day meal which is to be a feature of the scheme and\nwhich it is hoped will largely influence a more regular and interested\nattendance. The duties of the teacher would be instruction in the\nsimpler branches of scholastic training, and a small garden should be\nestablished in which the pupils could assist in raising vegetables for\nuse at the mid-day meal.\n\nThe rate of pay, which might be stated tentatively, would be\nas follows:\n\n| School teacher and wife, in cash | $ 800.00 |\n|---------------------------------|----------|\n| Two rations                     | 120.00   |\n| Free House                      | 300.00   |\n| Nurse, in cash                  | 400.00   |\n| One ration                      | 60.00    |\n| Free quarters                   | 100.00   |\nAs such a type of Day School would be more or less experimental it should only be established under the most favorable conditions and at one or two reserves specially selected for the purpose. Generally speaking such a school could be located on reserves where the Indians are settled. It could hardly be applicable to districts where the Indians are nomadic. It should be most important that the personnel of the staff should be the best obtainable for the special work, and great care should be exercised in the selection of persons to take up this important duty. In fact, the success of the new type of school would largely depend upon the character of those who would be the pioneers in the effort. The forecast might safely be made that such an institution would be a real centre of civilization on the reserve from which good influences might radiate in every direction.\n\nHaving laid before you what in the opinion of the Department would be a useful type of new school, combining some features of both the Day and residential schools, I might now pass to the question of closing certain residential schools. It is needless to say that action in this direction should not be taken without very serious consideration. As before stated, the Department has closed the St. Paul's Industrial School, the Calgary Industrial School, and the Matilaiitla Industrial School, and, it is thought, without prejudicing in any way the interests of pupils who had been accommodated therein. Taking up only those institutions which it would seem possible to close without detriment to the interests involved, the group of Industrial Schools, namely, Regina, Eldon and Brandon which were designed to meet the needs of the Indians of Manitoba and southern Saskatchewan, might be considered. It might be emphasized that one well equipped residential school could effectively provide for all perfectly healthy Indian children, who might benefit by the agricultural instruction therein accorded. As the Regina School has for many years been in an unsatisfactory state and is now in serious financial difficulties, it is thought that it and the\nElkorn School should be merged in the Brandon School and that we should have at that point a model institution. While this school is administered by the Methodist Church it is thought that pupils of the three denominations could be accommodated there, and that religious instruction and church attendance would be readily and satisfactorily arranged.\n\nEmmanuel College is now in great financial embarrassment and it is thought that it should be closed, and the Battleford Industrial School allowed to accommodate the healthiest and most promising of its pupils. Probably as good a point as any at which to start one of the improved Day Schools would be in the Carlton Agency, probably on Mistassini Reserve where already the Department has had some encouragement in the conduct of a day School.\n\nThe Holcomb Orphanage at Morley being by its geographical position an accessory to the Red Deer Industrial School, and under the same denomination, might be closed and the pupils from the Stony Reserve drafted to Red Deer. It is open to discussion whether the Stony Reserve would not be a good place to start an improved day school, as the Department already has a hospital on that reserve.\n\nThe School at Old Siksika Camp on the Blackfoot Reserve should be closed at once as the building is unsanitary and has been condemned by the Medical Officer.\n\nFor the present it is thought that the measure of closing the schools should not be pushed any further than these instances and that a reasonable time might be allowed to intervene before either the improved Day School is extended to other reserves or further residential schools closed in the West.\n\nWhen these matters are amicably arranged and carried out with your Committee, the Department would feel disposed to adopt the increased scale of per capita grant at the remaining residential schools in Ontario and the West. The new arrangement would be carried out under a contract showing explicitly and in detail the various items of\nexpenditure for which the Department and the Churches would be responsible. It is understood that the Province of British Columbia must receive special consideration before any increases are made or schools abolished.\n\nThe Department intends at an early date to approach those interested in the education of Roman Catholic children along the same lines, but it is submitted that as the best interests of all Protestant children are not being lost sight of but furthered by the present scheme it should not be wrapped up with the acceptance by the Roman Catholic Church of the same conditions. In other words this scheme for the Protestant schools should stand upon its merits.\n\nIn due course a circular of instructions will be prepared for all employees of this Department pointing out their duties and responsibilities as regards Indian education; a copy of which will be sent for your information, and as before stated, the regulations for compulsory attendance will be revised where necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nCopy of this letter mailed to Rev. R. P. McKay - Hon. S. W. Blake Toronto.\nIndian Education in Canada\n\nSunderland that the Clark & Co.

The terms of which were as follows:\n\n\"That a hearty support is hereby given to the principle embodied in the scheme outlined in a letter (dated the 14th January 1908) from Mr. Frank Oliver to the Hon. H.

Although I attended the meeting on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Society, certainly did not do so in the character of a representative, and it would be improper for the Standing Committee to allow itself to be committed to any definite opinion on a subject of such importance as this, it had not permitted after full consideration.\n\nI say, therefore, must be taken as merely the expression of my own opinion, but I trust you will not understand by this that the Society will necessarily decline to express its opinion.\n\nI believe that the Assistant Secretary who attended from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel felt himself also in precisely a similar position as regards his brief.\n\nRegretting the additional trouble this may cause you, and was compelled to go further than your instructions.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, addressed to the Hon. the Minister of the Interior, I have to say that your letter has been placed with the papers on this question, and that your attitude with reference to the Resolution regarding Indian education, passed at a Conference held on the 15th April last, has been noted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

In some of the schools arrangements which cannot be delayed must be made in respect of principals and teachers. There are other matters also in connection with\nthe schools which require immediate action. The attention of\nthe Churches represented has been called to the fact that im-\nprovements have been suggested and are about to be carried out\nby the Department.

Action will be taken as soon as possible, and from time to time, to carry out the arrangements agreed upon so far as this Department is concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHon. S. H. Blake, K.C.,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver.\n\nNow that the Advisory Board of the Protestant denominations has accepted the suggestions of the Department with reference to Indian education it becomes necessary to make an additional appropriation for the financial needs of the scheme. We have come to an agreement only with the Protestant denominations, and if we are to alone provide for increased per capita grants to Protestant Schools, we will require in the Supplementary Estimates an additional vote of $35,765.00, (say $36,000.00).\n\nIf we are this year to provide sufficient to enable us to pay an increased grant to all Roman Catholic schools as well, without reduction, we will require $108,361.00, (say $108,000.00).\n\nIn one of the early memoranda on the subject certain Roman Catholic schools were scheduled to be closed, but Roman Catholics not having been dealt with and not having approached the Department in the same way as the Protestant bodies, asking for a general re-consideration and expressing their inability to carry on the work unless some increased financial assistance were given, no agreement has been arrived at as to closing the said schools. However, supposing that they are to\nbe closed, the Department to provide for the remaining Roman Catholic schools and for the Protestant schools on the basis of the new arrangement, we would require to provide $80,111.00, (say $80,000.00).\n\nI would submit these alternative estimates for your immediate consideration, as it will be necessary to decide within the next few days, in order to add the amount to the Supplementary Estimates of the Department, now before the Finance Minister.\n\nThe Protestant schools which are to be closed according to agreement are: Regina, Elkhorn, Morley, Emmanuel College and Old Suns.\n\nThe question of closing the following Roman Catholic schools might be brought before the proper authorities:\u2014 Cowessess, Keesekoose, Muscowequan, Onion Lake, Thunderchild's, Blood, Peigan, Ermineskin, and Crowfoot. These schools are all situated in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. A new type of day school will be established experimentally at certain points to be decided upon, and the Boarding Schools at Ermineskins and Bluequills and the large Industrial Schools at Duck Lake and Bumbow would remain; together with all the Boarding Schools in the outlying districts where the Indians make their living by hunting.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1908.\n\nMemo\u2014\n\nMinister says it will be impossible to do anything this year and that the matter will have to go on as they are for the time being.\nany arrangement we may make must be such\nfor P.T.C.\n\nwhile I agree that the\nCommission must attempt\nto reduce this in schools.\n\nBusting Smith's position\nin view of the conditions\nI was put in earlier\namounts an attempt for\nreversal and appeal to\nParliament.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, July 20th, 1905\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn discussing the nature of the reply to the tenth re-school question\u2014\nit was thought it might be among the following lines:\n\n1. That any arrangement made\nmust be the same for both Protestants\nand Catholics\u2014\n\n2. That while the Protestant churches agreed\nto the proposition, that, up to the present,\nthe Catholic's house not accepted\nthe proposition as to the reduction\nin the number of schools.\n\n3.

As the school work is divided pretty equally between the Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic church any new arrangement to be made must be the same for both the interested parties. After a certain necessary interval the Protestant churches agreed to the propositions which were advanced by the Department but up to the present the Catholics have not accepted any proposition looking toward the reduction of the number of schools under their jurisdiction. Moreover there is not absolute unanimity amongst the Protestants themselves as there is considerable opposition from some influential quarters, notably from the Bishop of Calgary.\n\nIn view of these facts and considerations it was felt to be useless to present an estimate to Parliament for an increased appropriation, and that such a step should not be taken pending the acceptance by the Roman Catholic Church of the main features of the proposition and more complete harmony amongst the various local interests of the Protestant churches.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal, Industrial School,\nBRANDON, Man.\n\nSimilar letter addressed to Hon. S. H. Blake - Toronto.\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.\nHon Frank Oliver,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nMy Dear Mr Oliver:-\n\nYours of July 18 to hand and the contents carefully noted. In replying it appears necessary to quote a little from former communications of the Department to the Advisory Board of Indian Education, and if you can reconcile what appears to be strange contradictions it may suggest some plan of future action.\n\nThe Advisory Board discussed very fully the three points covered by your letter, viz:- 1st The Financial side of the proposition advanced by the Department; 2nd The attitude of the Roman Catholic Church; 3rd The necessity of unity on the part of the three churches in our acceptance or rejection of the Government proposition.\n\nFirst As to the Financial side of the proposition. You say it is clear that greater financial assistance was an essential feature of the proposed re-arrangement. This is exactly what the Advisory Board understood. The statements, facts and figures presented in the documents of January 24th and March 21st are clear on this phase of the question. In these documents we have the following:- January 24th \"This prominent phase of the subject has therefore received immediate consideration.\"\n\"It is thought that a re-arrangement of these schools and the adoption of a new type of school would further the interests of Indian Education and at the same time render it unnecessary to apply to Parliament for an increase in the gross appropriation.\" March 21st. \"The increased grant could be made without asking Parliament for additional appropriations.\"\n\nFrom such statements and the facts and figures so carefully compiled in these documents the committee concluded that in the closing of these schools proposed, a saving of about $50000 would be made and from this $50000 the increased grants could be given, and the request from Parliament would remain about the same. It now appears that there are some new facts and new considerations to be taken into account. You say,\u2014\n\n\"In view of these facts and considerations it was felt to be useless to present an estimate to Parliament for an increased appropriation.\" Since these statements appear to contradict each other answers to a few questions may throw light on the subject.\n\nDid the Advisory Board arrive at a wrong conclusion when they assumed that a saving of about $50000 would be made by the closing of the schools mentioned, and that this would be sufficient to meet the advanced grant of the remaining schools? If not sufficient what additional amount would be required from Parliament?\n\nSecond Re the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church On March 27th the Advisory Board said,\u2014\"It is therefore submitted that the position of the three Churches now approaching the Department should not be in any manner prejudiced because of the\nrefusal of this Church to co-operate but whatever is considered in the best interests of these schools should be carried out.\"\n\nThe reply of your Department to this dated April 24th was,\u2014\n\n\"The Department intended at an early date to approach those interested in the Education of Roman Catholic children along the same lines but it is submitted that as the best interests of all Protestant children are not being lost sight of but furthered by the present scheme it should not be wrapped up with the acceptance of the Roman Catholic Church of the same conditions. In other words this scheme seems\u2014for the Protestant schools should stand on its own merits.\n\nAs the school work is pretty evenly divided between the Protestant Churches and the Roman Catholic Church any new arrangement to be made must be the same for both interested parties. After a certain necessary interval the Protestant Churches agreed to the propositions which were advanced by the Department but up to the present the Catholics have not accepted any proposition looking toward the reduction of the number of schools under their jurisdiction.\n\nIs this proposition of April 24th to the Advisory Board to stand on its own merits or have we to wait for the Roman Catholic Church to accept of a similar reduction of their schools?\n\nThird The question of unity on the part of the three Churches\n\nThe document of March 21st says,\u2014\n\n\"The Department has at all times been willing to give full consideration to the representations of the Churches but it has been found confusing to deal with a large number of persons in authority who are interested in the Indian Work.\" In the document of April 24th \"It is gratifying to find that such an unanimity of opinion exists in the important matter dealt with in the previous correspondence.\" When these matters are amicably arranged and carried out with your committee the Department would feel disposed to adopt the increased scale of per capita at the remaining residential schools in Ontario and the West.\n\nRealizing the great need of unity the proposition of April 24th was considered by the Board of Management of the Missionary Society of the Church of England.\nin Canada, by the Foreign Missionary Committee of the Presbyterian Church, and the Executive of the Missionary Board of the Methodist Church and the Advisory Board was able to inform the Superintendent General that all these bodies were prepared to co-operate with the Department in carrying out this proposition.\n\nNow you inform us that there is not absolute unanimity amongst the Protestants themselves as there is considerable opposition from some influential quarters, notably from the Bishop of Calgary.\n\nFrom this twofold position it is very plain that the Department must choose between doing business on the old plan, which may be with every Bishop of a Diocese, Moderator of a Synod, Chairman of a District, President of a Conference or any preacher, merchant or politician who may be interested directly or indirectly with the Indian Work, or on the other new plan with the Advisory Board which is clothed with absolute power to speak on behalf of the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches.\n\nThe Advisory Board is well aware of the fact that opposition will be forthcoming from those engaged in the work who will not see the question beyond their own little sphere, and from merchants and others who have the trade of these schools to be closed, also from some small politicians who will be afraid of losing a few votes. At the same time we never expect to have a more unanimous and influential b\nbacking to any proposal that may be presented by the Department than we have to the proposition of April 24th and the Board have assured the Superintendent General that in every way, in their power they will most gladly co-operate with him and with the Department in endeavoring to make effectual the plan which the Superintendent has outlined. There are matters in connection with the schools which require immediate action, arrangements which cannot be delayed must be made in respect of teachers and principals, all of which require a knowledge of the policy the Department intends to pursue. We are writing not under the authority of the Advisory Board, but on behalf of the Methodist Church which body we have the honor to represent on that Board and we assure you that we are willing to take our full share of the difficulties and responsibilities involved in putting this new policy into operation.\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\nHONORABLE\n\nof a Conference held at the Residence of\nthe Honorable S. H. Blake, Toronto, on\nthe Fourth day of September, 1908.\n\nThe members duly appointed by the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches to represent them in conference with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs on the subject of Indian education beg to state that they have perused and carefully considered the communications which have taken place between the Superintendent and the Chairman of the Committee dated the 17th and 25th of June, the 16th of July, and the 4th, 13th and 19th of August, 1908.\n\n(1) While the Committee learns with the deepest regret that no provision has been made to enable the Superintendent to carry out the plan set out in the letters of the 14th and 26th of last January and of the Deputy Superintendent of the 27th of March and the 24th of April, it cannot but express its pleasure at the last paragraph of the communication of the Superintendent of the 18th August in which this statement is\n\"I hope in the interval between now and the coming session to be able to reach a conclusion that will be at any rate measurably satisfactory, but in order to do this it appears to me that I will have to take a more personal part than has been possible during the past year.\"\n\n(2) The Committee is convinced that nothing will tend more largely to the success of the plan proposed, than that the Superintendent of Indian Affairs shall personally take the matter up and bring to bear his large knowledge and experience on the subject. There must be some person whose conclusion, after conference, must be final on the question of the closing, opening, location and character of the schools, and the spheres of action of the various religious bodies engaged in the work.\n\nWithout the careful superintendence of one skilled in these matters, and who is bound to act impartially as between the various interests that from time to time arise, there will be hopeless confusion and such friction as will interfere most materially with the due carrying out of the formulated plan. The questions which have been raised between the Department and the representatives of the Churches in various portions of the Northwest and British Columbia show how absolutely correct is this statement.\n(3) On the receipt of the communications referred to from the Superintendent and the Deputy the Committee informed the Churches interested of the conclusion of the Department. It was generally accepted, and, when better understood, by those who did not in the first instance agree to the scheme, the objections raised by them seemed to have been removed, and arrangements were made based on the proposals going into operation at once. It is impossible to exaggerate the disappointment caused by the action of the Superintendent at present contemplated. Promises had been made based on the earlier statements, which must be broken as, apart from the aid of the Government, it is simply impossible to fulfill them.\n\n(4) It is very earnestly hoped that even yet the Superintendent may see his way out of the money saved by a concentration of the work and closing some of the schools, as suggested in his proposals, and the cutting down of expenses in the Department, to make a reasonable beginning in the way of the improved schools and some increase in the per capita grants although not up to the full standard suggested.\n\n(5) The Committee has read with regret the following statement in the letter of the Superintendent of July 18th:-\n\"After a certain necessary interval the Protestant Church agreed to the propositions which were advanced by the Department but up to the present the Catholics have not accepted any proposition looking towards the reduction of the number of schools under their jurisdiction.\"\n\nAnd also the following in reference to the presentation of an estimate to Parliament for an increased appropriation:\n\n\"Such a step should not be taken pending the acceptance by the Roman Catholic Church of the main features of the propositions\".\n\nIt will not be forgotten by the Superintendent that over two years ago at his suggestion more than twelve months was spent in endeavouring to procure representatives of the Roman Catholics at our conferences, but all the efforts failed, and a refusal to co-operate in working out a scheme was finally the answer received. It was then submitted by this Committee to the Superintendent \"that the position of the three Churches now approaching the Department should not be in any manner prejudiced because of the refusal of this Church to co-operate, but that whatever is considered in the best interest of the Indians should be carried out\". Wherever it is thought wise to close or change the class of school this should be done, and wherever the school is not found to answer the best interest of the Indians the grants of the Department should\ncease, no matter what religious body might be controlling the school. This statement was presented in writing last March, and the Committee was gratified to find by a communication from the Department of the 24th of last April that\u2014\n\n\"The Department intends at an early date to approach those interested in the education of Roman Catholic children along the same lines; but it is submitted that as the best interests of all Protestant children are not being lost sight of but furthered by the present scheme, it should not be wrapped up with the acceptance by the Roman Catholic Church of the same conditions. In other words, this scheme for the Protestant schools should stand upon its merits.\"\n\nThe Committee gladly accepted this conclusion and have since acted upon it.\n\n(6) It still seems to the Committee to be a mere act of justice, that if those representing one-half of the Indian population accept an offer which the Superintendent makes, and which he considers to be in the best interests of his wards, whereby under a system of concentration inefficient and useless schools are cut off and thereby better schools, better equipment, and a larger per capita grant are given, it is monstrous that this should be interfered with because there are some interested in the work who will not consent to these terms.\nThe price to be paid for the increased grant and better schools is the diminution of schools which the Superintendent finds are not doing their duty. There is no interference with those who do not accept these terms, but they continue to do in the future as they have done in the past. What right have those who reject the terms of the Superintendent and desire to continue in the old path and who are not interfered with, to complain of the Superintendent because he has procured the assent of one-half of those interested in the work to his plan for a great improvement in the welfare of those for whom he is responsible? The Committee cannot but dissent very strongly from this apparently retrograde step, and regrets the unfortunate position in which the Department now suggests that it shall be placed.\n\n(7) In the communication of this Committee to the Department of date March last there is this statement:\n\n\"The Committee learns with pleasure that 'it has always been the wish of the Department that officials and employees should give their active influence in furthering the educational policy, and the attention of agents generally will be again directed to this very important phase of their general administrative duties' from such action of the Department, and the Committee looks forward to good results.\"\n\nAnd in answer to the Committee's Memorandum of March\nlast, in the communication of 24th April, there was the following undertaking:\n\n\"In due course a circular of instructions will be prepared for all employees of this Department and pointing out their duties and responsibilities as regards Indian education; a copy of which will be sent for your information, and as before stated, the regulations for compulsory education will be revised where necessary\".\n\nThe Committee is unable to find that any such circular has been issued.\n\nSome complaints that have been very recently made show the necessity for such instructions and for such superintendence as will compel their observance.\n\n(8) The Committee feels that the following matter is of such very great importance that it cannot help referring to it and emphasizing it:\n\nIn the portion of territory more immediately dealt with in the negotiations with the Department \u2014 that is, Manitoba, the Northwest, and British Columbia \u2014 the total number of Roman Catholic schools is, according to the last report of the Department, 52; Church of England 76; Methodist 32; Presbyterian 16. Therefore you are dealing with 52 Roman\nCatholic schools and 128 Protestant. While the majority should not and does not desire that ought that is unfair should be done to the minority, yet the majority cannot but feel that it has its rights, and that it is eminently unfair that the plan which you propose in the interest of your wards, and which the bodies, representing 128 of the schools, desire to have carried out, is to be thwarted because 52 schools which are not being interfered with choose to say No.\n\nThe Committee still trusts that before the close of this year the Superintendent will see his way so to order matters in his Department that the members of the Churches interested will see a fair commencement made along the lines suggested by him, and approved heartily by the Advisory Committee.\n\nDated Toronto 4th September 1908.\n\n[Signature]\nW.J.

The moment I heard of it, it appealed to me as something that might be of immense profit to Missionaries, Teachers, officials of the Indian Department, the Churches and the Government, and through them to the Indians themselves. I fully hope that this may be but the first of many such gatherings, and I feel sure that to bring together representatives of the Churches and the Government for a straightforward discussion and interchange of opinions on the subject, for which we are all working - the betterment and the elevation of the Indian in our midst - can only be fraught with blessing. I have always maintained, and see no reason to change my opinion, that the christianization and civilization of the Indian should go hand in hand. It is difficult, it is almost impossible, for the minister of the Gospel to do anything with a lazy man in any part of the world. The most successful work has been always amongst peoples and communities that are industrious. We have illustrations of this in Holy Scripture. Thus Gideon was threshing wheat when called to lead his people to victory; Eliash was following the plough when called to take up the mantle of Elijah;\nDavid was keeping sheep when called to be king over Israel, and Matthew was sitting at the receipt of customs when called to be an Apostle and Evangelist. The success of Mission work has been greater amongst the working populations in England and heathen nations than amongst the Indians, whether rich or poor. It is therefore of importance to our success in Missionary work amongst the Indians that the people should be taught to work. In days past all the Natives had to work and, at certain seasons of the year, work hard for their livelihood whether in the chase, or as trappers and fishermen. They have become creatures of circumstances, and those with whom it has been my lot to be cast, have perforce been obliged to give up the chase for lack of the buffalo. The latter had gone for good when I first arrived in the country a quarter of a century ago, and a more pitiable condition could hardly be conceived than was that of the Indians in Southern Alberta at that time. The buffalo had disappeared, and they were just settling down to 'reserve' life. They did nothing except dance and attend the ration house. They were poor in the extreme, except for the few remaining skin garments, and most of the people were wearing cotton stuffs in exchange for skin shirts and dresses, and Hudson Bay blankets in place of the buffalo robe. Whilst a few skin tents remained the majority of the people were already reduced to duck or cotton tepees. Several had erected log huts with the best cottonwood trees at their disposal, but they had mud roofs and floors, no windows, and in some cases, a skin hung over the entrance to serve as a door. No attempt had been made at agriculture, what was done was done by employees of the Government who ploughed, sowed, harvested for the chiefs in whose names the fields were held, and also cut hay.\nThe Tobacco Dance and Sun Dance with their accompanying smaller rites occupied the tribe from April to the end of July when they all went berry picking. Tea and other dances occupied them through the winter season. Their knowledge of the Almighty and His love to them i. Christ Jesus was almost nil. Still they were religious to a degree even if their religion consisted solely in the desire to propitiate the many spirits of evil which they seemed to think constantly surrounded them.\n\nTheir code of morality was peculiar. It was not wrong to steal but it was terribly so to be found out. Unfaithfulness in the women was punished by the excision of the nose, and there were some women thus disfigured in the camp. But what can be said for the elevating influences of the white race when every white man in the district had his women, and some two or three!\n\nAfter recalling some of the past as I have done, I can well quote the words of Mr. Smart, then Deputy Supt. General for Indian Affairs, in 1901.\n\n\"Although there is much to be deplored by those who are earnestly striving for the elevation of the race, there would not appear to be any cause for discouragement if the mind be fixed upon what has been accomplished rather than allowed to dwell exclusively upon what remains to be done.\" And from a missionary point of view one is glad to be able to quote the words of Mr. Selley in his report for 1903. Various influences conspicuously those of the Missionaries of the various denominations who labour among them, are surely, if slowly, bringing about a better condition of things.\"\nI am sure I voice the feelings of every Missionary present when I say that Mr. edley on the part of the Department appears to be modesty itself in thus writing. The wise changes which the Department has made in the past few years in the personnel of its staff agents and other officers, has done much towards bringing about a better condition of things.\n\nThere have certainly been great strides made towards civilization by the Indians in Southern Alberta. I remember in 1894 writing to the then Indian Commissioner and suggesting the necessity of letting the Sun's rays into the dark huts of the Blackfeet. At that time only one house in the reserve had a window and the Commissioner sent me up two dozen windows on my undertaking to assist the Indians in putting them in. How many of the natives have houses equal to and better than many of the white settlers and they take a pride in them. They have good floors and good roofs overhead, whilst their walls are covered with pictures and ornaments; clocks stand on shelves; cupboards hold crockery; and tables, chairs, and cooking ranges are found in nearly all. Iron bedsteads and spring mattresses are not uncommon and tend towards cleanliness, whilst I have seen leather bottomed chairs as well as washstands and bureaus amongst the furniture. It is some time since I attended an Indian feast until this last New Year's day, and then I found wonderful progress had been made, for instead of a great crowd huddled on the floor with food held between the fingers and so transmitted to the mouth, tables and chairs were provided, and the people sat down in batches of twenty. Cups, plates and spoons were provided for all and a woman stood in the background washing up the utensils ready for the next batch of people. The delicacies were carried round on a large tray, and tea was poured out in the old fashioned tea meeting style of our young days; a large toilet jug highly filled being used for the purpose.\nBut not only in their surroundings is this advance towards civilization seen. In most cases the men were dressed in tweed suits, and the women in gowns of their own make after a civilized pattern, whilst the younger women wore blouses made with their own hands if their skirts had been purchased in one of the city stores.\n\nAnd whilst one sees great progress towards civilization in the past twenty-five years, one also is struck with the great strides being made towards self-support. To me their progress in industry is very marked. As I remember, in those days, the only vehicle used on the reserves, besides the travoy, was the Red River cart, a few of which were supplied by the Indian Department just after my arrival. They served a purpose. The chiefs seemed to appropriate them and broke some of their ponies into driving. But ponies wouldn't break in, broke or tried to break the carts. Now, what could the Indians do without a wagon? I looked up the last Blue Book available, that for 1907, and I found that the four tribes, Blackfoot, Blood, Peigan, and Sarcees now have 683 wagons, besides 43 draught sleighs (the figures in number only testifying to the salubriosity of the climate), 67 democrats, and 121 buggies and road carts, most of which I believe were purchased out of their own earnings.\n\nThe Indians late in the 90's were desirous of putting up hay for sale to the few settlers then in the country. I remember how they were encouraged in their laudable desires by the Departmental issuing to them a quantity of scythes and wooden rakes. Anxious to get some hay myself, I purchased a mowing machine and leased it for the season to the Chief, White Leg, who provided me with five loads for the use of the machine, and then made \u00a3200 for himself. Up to that time the Indians had no mowing machines except what were owned by the Department and solely for the farmer's use. Now I see by the Blue Book the\nIndians of these four tribes own no less than 283 mowers and\n27 horse-drawn, and in the season 1906 put up 6582 tons of\nwild hay besides other food stuffs. The cultivation of the land\nhas not perhaps been their strong point, but who that saw the\ncrops of years ago, when most of the work was done by their\ninstructor, could blame the Indians for not taking a deep interest\nin the tillage of the soil! This perhaps accounts for the small\nnumber of ploughs, 95, owned by them. But this source of wealth,\nas it now is, will not be long let go by the Indians. Already\nI understand that a large amount of winter wheat has been harvested\nby some of the Indians in the vicinity of MacLeod.\n\nIt is possible that the attempt to make the Indians\ntillers of the soil was premature. In biblical days, the tending\nof flocks and herds was the more primitive industry of Abraham\nand his immediate successors, and it looks as if our Southern\nIndians may soon find a real means of self-support in the herds\nof cattle that are increasing year by year on their reserves.\nIn 1906-1907 they are credited with having 5817 cows and 5757\nhead of young stock or altogether 11,554 head.\n\nWhilst all this is making for progress, it strikes me\nas somewhat strange that the total income of 555 families,\nreckoning the 2779 souls as five per family, from all sources\nincluding beef eaten and sold, should be only $167.10 per family\nor $31.42 per head per annum. It means of course that there are\na great many old people and a great many children who cannot\nwork, and perhaps it is not so bad a showing as it appears at\nfirst sight. At any rate it shows great progress from 25 years\nago when their income was about nil, whilst today it aggregates\n$92,893.64, or rather did so in 1906. This year it probably\nreaches the $100,000 mark. I make no apology for dealing so\nfar with matters connected with the civilization and industrial\nprogress of the Indians. As I said at the commencement of this\npaper, I believe that civilization and christianity must go hand\nI come now to that work generally accepted as more nearly connected with its literary effort\u2014the progress of the Indians in Christianity, and of this it may be said that since 1863 it has been all progress. I can hardly describe the feelings that came over me when first I made the acquaintance of the Blackfoot speaking race. I arrived in the month of July when that great heathen festival\u2014the Sun Dance\u2014was in full swing\u2014when every Indian on the reserve almost was willing or unwilling, obliged to attend that gruesome spectacle, the torturing of the body and tearing of the flesh, on the victims doomed before the Medicine Pole to the beating of the tom-tom and weird singing of a thousand voices. The fantastic costumes of the people, the paint and feathers, the then to me foreign tongue, made my heart sink within me, and if ever I felt the hopelessness of a task set me to do it was then.\n\nBut the Christian Missionary is not thrown altogether on his own resources. \"Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\" saith the Lord; and \"When we are weak, then are we strong,\" saith the Apostle. Upheld, as I believed in prayer, by numerous friends from whom I had but a few weeks before parted in the Home Land, I endeavoured to settle down to the work as hundreds had done before me, looking to the Master for strength and help. The Agencies employed by our Church in its work amongst the Indians have been various. Naturally after building one's house, the next and most important thing is the learning of the language. In my case it had to be done from the people themselves; for there were no books except a small hand book for traders which the ethnologists at Washington told me was \"useless.\" So far as I know all literary work in the Blackfoot language has been produced by our Church. A grammar and dictionary in 1869 and the Gospel of Matthew in the same year were the first published in book form, but a small Manual of Instruction including the Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments, and Apostles Creed, with other\nmatter were earlier produced and printed at the Blackfoot Mission on a small hand press. Then portions of the other Gospels appeared in 1890. In 1906 a part of the Prayer Book and some hymns were translated and printed. The hope of reaching the older people by the Syllabic System led to a study of the Cree Syllabics and their adaptation, and we believe simplification, for the Blackfoot people. In this character we produced in 1906, Morning & Evening Prayer, Litany, a Hymn Book, and a portion of St John's Gospel. The introduction of the Syllabic System has been a success; some adult Indians who have never been to school can read and write fluently by its means.\n\nEvangelistic Work, by which I mean the effort to get hold of the heathen and teach them Christianity, which embraces the sinfulness of sin and the need of a Saviour, was at first very difficult. It was something altogether alien to the Indian's way of thinking. Listen to him as he begins his prayer. \"Pity me, I am a righteous man, I do not lie, I do not steal, I am not immoral,\" and so on. Tell him that the Creator has given us a Book and in the Book it is written, \"All men have sinned,\" and he replies, \"Yes, I know, all men are sinners, but so far as I am concerned, \"I am a righteous man, I do not lie,\" etc. Thank God, His Spirit has taught many of this self-righteous nation to see themselves in the light of God's Holy Word and to acknowledge or bend the knee that they are sinners indeed in His sight and to plead with Him for pardon and for the Grace of His Holy Spirit to lead new lives or become New Creatures in Christ Jesus.\n\nOur Evangelistic methods in the old days were to get a few people together in the house, or in the tepee by producing a little tea, and then one could talk to them as long as the tea lasted. This could be done and was done at all hours.\nof the day, but the same method would hardly serve now\nas most of them are generally busy with their work, which\nthey had not got in those days. We used sometimes to try\nEvangelistic meetings amongst them after the pattern still in\nvogue amongst white people. We did not find them a success.\nThe Indian needs, first, instruction in the rudiments of Christian-\nity. The more successful work, we find, is that done with indivi-\nduals - \"line upon line, precept upon precept,\" here a little\nand there a little,\" a quiet talk and instruction in the home\nor in the study, combined with the changed lives of some of the\nChristians, is a surer method for obtaining good results.\n\nThe first adult baptism took place in 1890. A\nfew children, whose parents had promised to send them to school\nfor instruction when old enough, were baptized before that date.\nThe number of church members on the four reserves is now about\n570, and the Blue Book quoted above gives the same number to the\nRoman Catholics. In 1906 and 07 the Baptisms numbered 68.\nOf these 26 were adults and 63 children. The number confirmed\nduring the same period was 31, making a total of 163 admitted\ninto full membership in our Church.\n\nWe have church buildings at three of the Reserves,\nand at the fourth, the Blood Reserve, a school chapel serves\nthe purpose. Our adherents are not all of them what we could\nwish, but comparing them with the average white congregation,\nI think their attendance at Divine Service and on the means of\ngrace generally is good. They are learning to give of their\nsubstance to God's work, and I have more than once noted that\nwhen an Indian has failed to have the offering ready when the\nplate was taken round, he or she invariably brings it up at\nthe close of the service instead of doing as many a white person\nwould do - carry it home again.\nMEDICAL WORK has always had a place in our Missions.\n\nIn the early days the Mission House always had a supply of simple medicines, and the missionary was often called upon to alleviate suffering. A hospital was built at the Blackfoot Reserve in 1894 by the help of the Government, and it has ever since been in use. It has been a useful agency in our work, and not a few Indians have found healing for both body and soul whilst residing there.\n\nOne of the most valuable agencies employed by us, I think, is that of the schools. This in the first instance took the form of day schools, and when the Indians were accustomed to dwell together in large camps there was no difficulty in getting a large attendance at certain seasons of the year. Such, however, when the people were induced to separate and scatter over the Reserves in small villages, the attendance dwindled, and as the people generally left their villages in the Spring and migrated with their tepees to another part of the Reserve until Fall, day schools became impracticable. We gave them up in the end, feeling that even though a few children could be got to attend regularly, the influence in their homes more than counterbalanced the best teaching they obtained in the schools. Boarding Schools were then started by the Church, first with the child's ration of beef and flour as the only assistance from Government. Then the Indian Department came to our aid and offered a per capita grant of $72.00 per annum, making at the same time certain regulations to which we were bound to adhere. As buildings were needed a small grant was made towards the cost of each by the Government, the rest being obtained by appeals from the individual missionaries to Eastern Canada and England. I feel bound to say that this work has done a great deal towards educating the younger generation in the doctrines of Christianity as well as prepar-\ning them for the changed conditions of life that have come over the people in the past few years. The number of pupils in the four schools is about 125.\n\nThe question of the school is, shall I say, a burning one at the present time. For three years past the Churches and the Government have been trying to solve the school question and it is not solved yet. The type of school most suited to the needs of the Indian, whether Industrial, Boarding, or Day; the share of financial responsibility that should be borne by the church and by the government respectively in the upkeep of the institutions; and the nature of the instruction that should be given to the pupils are all matters of great importance to the Government, the Churches, and the Indians alike. We had an Industrial School at Calgary for a few years and whilst it lived it did some good work. But it is dead, and I do not see how it could have been kept alive. It was away from the Reserves and no boy or girl can be legally taken from the Reserve except as a lawbreaker. For the next generation or so it is my firm conviction that the reserve boarding school will best serve the needs of the Indians in Alberta\u2014at any rate in the North and South. I do not know what your needs is in this central portion of the province. I am fully convinced that it would be a retrograde movement to return to day schools, even of an improved type, where boarding schools are in existence for the simple reasons that the Indians are too widely scattered for a school in any one position on a reserve to get a sufficient number of pupils, and that the irregular attendance and the baneful influence of camp life would more than counterbalance the good done in the school.\n\nThe bad influence of home life is recognized by Mr. Bealey who in his report in 1913 said: \"As a civilizing factor the\nadvantages of the removal of the pupils from the retrogressive influence of home life is shared pretty equally by the Industrial and Boarding Schools.\" I am strongly in favor of Boarding Schools of an improved type\u2014improved buildings, improved sanitary conditions, improved equipment, and improved grants.\n\nThe United States Commissioner, in his last report, extracts of which I have been permitted to see, says: \"Though the day school system is the ideal mechanism for the uplifting of the Indians, we cannot yet wholly dispense with Boarding Schools because so many tribes still continue the nomadic and semi-nomadic habits which would require the continual moving of the day schools from place to place in order to keep near a sufficient number of families for their support.\" Now it seems to me that this puts into a nutshell as it were our position in this province and I should like to see a resolution passed by this Convention favouring the well equipped and up to date Boarding School in preference to a larger number of well equipped day schools. My own view is that so much of the Industrial School should be embodied in the Reserve Boarding School as would, besides giving the pupils fair instruction in the three \"R's,\" enable them to get sufficient knowledge of the use of tools to build their own barns and dwellings, and become thoroughly acquainted with the management of stock and all that goes to make a good farmer. So far as the girls are concerned, the present type of Boarding School already provides them with a capital education in domestic affairs. There are other matters that interest us from a Missionary point of view that I should like to touch upon but I fear my paper has already overreached its proper length, so I will confine myself to two\nvery important matters, the observance of the Lord's Day, and\nthe sanctity of marriage. It seems to me that our Indians are\nnot only getting the habit of working, but of working on the\nLord's Day to a greater extent than formerly. So far as I am\npersonally aware it is from no bad example on the reserve although\nI have heard of machinery being fixed up and set in motion,\nand lumber being hauled by, and with the sanction of those in\nauthority, on the Lord's Day. The law of the country calls for\nabstinence from all labour except work of necessity on the day\nof Rest, and it would be well if the attention of the Indian\nDept. at Ottawa could be called to this tendency with a suggestion\nthat steps should be taken to secure a better observance of the\nday on all reserves.\n\nThe other matter concerning marriage was brought\nspecially before me at the last treaty payments when a young\nIndian, who had been baptized and had afterwards contracted a\nmarriage according to tribal custom with an unbaptized girl came\nto me and said: \"The agent has sent us to get married by you and\nwon't pay us our treaty money until we have been married by the\nChurch,\" - or some such words. I have on two or three occasions\nfelt obliged to conduct similar marriages where one party has been\nbaptized, but only after first getting an assurance that the\nunbaptized believes in God. It seems to me that for marriages\nof this kind and for all marriages that are contracted, as in the\npast according to tribal customs, the Indian Agent should be given\nthe powers of a Registrar for solemnizing marriages, and that the\nparties should all pledge their troth before him, and such marriages\nshould have the force of civil marriages, and the subsequent non-\nobservance of the laws of marriage should be subject to the same\npenalties as in other cases.\nAnd now in conclusion let me express the pleasure I feel at being here face to face with officials of the Government and my brethren of other Churches in conference for the welfare of the Indians. It is a good work to be engaged in and only good can come of it if we work with good motives. The convening circular bore the motto, \"Our work is one,\" and that one work must be the upbuilding of the Red Man in Civilization, in Christianity, and in Character, whilst we look forward to a fourth \"C,\" in Citizenship.\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nVen.

Somerset,\nCarievale, Saskatchewan.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the present position of the Indian School problem and to make certain suggestions which will tend to carry out as nearly as may be practicable the plan outlined in the Department's letter of the 24th. of April last, which plan was accepted by the Advisory Board. As you are aware, this plan contemplated the payment of per capita grants at the rate of $100.00 to the pupils in residential schools east of the Great Lakes and $130.00 to pupils in residential schools west of the Great Lakes, excluding the Province of British Columbia. The payment at the increased per capita rate was in effect made conditional upon the closing of the Regina and Elkhorn Schools, Emmanuel College and McDougall Orphanage, and the Old Sun's Church of England School on the Blackfoot Reserve. It was hoped both by the Department and the Churches interested that this new scheme could go into effect from the 1st. of April 1908, but lack of funds in the existing appropriations and the inability of the Department to obtain larger grants rendered this impossible. The Estimates for the fiscal year 1909-10 have been made out without any increases owing to the urgent request that our Estimates should conform as nearly as possible to those of 1907-08; but it seems obligatory that the Department should take some steps either to obtain increased grants or to make some use of money already voted in the direction of the proposed change of plan and increase in grant to the Schools. I have, therefore, to make the following suggestions, dealing with the Provinces separately,-\n\nONTARIO: As the Shingwauk Home, situated at Sault Ste. Marie, is in constant financial difficulties and as the Department has declined\nto be responsible for any further deficits, it is thought advisable to withdraw from the support of this School and to use the grant for other purposes. The institution is badly situated for agricultural operations and the pupilage is drawn not only from the Diocese of Algoma but from remote parts of Ontario. It is proposed with a portion of the money saved by this closure to improve certain Church of England Day Schools on Reserves in the Province of Ontario, to secure if possible a better class of Teacher at a higher rate of pay, and to modernize the buildings and equipment where necessary, and to increase the grant for pupils at Mt. Elgin (Maths.), Chapleau and Moose Factory (O. of E.) to $85.00 per capita. This is an increase of $25.00. The proposed rate for the Province of Ontario was to be $100.00 per capita, but the Department has not the funds at present to provide that rate.\n\nThe only other Schools that should be provided for are the Roman Catholic Schools at Wikwemikong and Albany and the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. As the latter School is supported by the New England Company, I do not think the Department should increase the grant. Sufficient funds can be found for increasing the per capita grant to the Roman Catholic Schools mentioned. This Church has not joined as yet in the new movement and it might not be thought advisable at present to increase any particular school without reference to a general understanding between that Church and the Department.\n\nManitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta &c.: If the Regina and Elkhorn Schools were closed before the end of the year the Department would have available $28,250.00 from this source with which to increase the per capita grant and to establish a certain number of Day Schools of the new type. It would be impossible, however, to increase the grant to Boarding Schools to $130.00 per capita, and after re-considering that rate I think it is probably higher than is necessary and might be reduced to $100.00 until the experience of a couple of years has proved that rate to be insufficient. There are 600 pupils estimated in Protestant Boarding Schools which at an increase to $100.00 would requi-\n$14860.00 additional to pay the grant. I would recommend that the Institutions at Regina and Elkhorn be closed and that the per capita grant be increased to $100.00 for Protestant Boarding Schools in these Provinces.\n\nDealing with the Roman Catholic Schools in the same Provinces it will be necessary to provide $26,650.00 to place the grants to pupils on the same basis. I think that in advance of any expression of willingness to consider a reduction in the number of Boarding Schools it would be premature to offer this increase, but at the same time I think the authorities of the Church should be approached more directly on this question with a view to arriving if possible at a harmonious conclusion.\n\nThe Protestant denominations have suffered great diminution of their teaching force without embarrassing the Department in any way, and I think that with reference to the savings effected or to be effected in the money voted or in any additional demands which may hereafter be made upon Parliament this fact should not be lost sight of. The following items have disappeared from the Estimates owing to Schools being closed, and the expenditure has been correspondingly reduced:\n\n- St. Paul's: $15,000.00\n- Emmanuel College: $4,304.00\n- Calgary: $4,550.00\n- Morley: $3,940.00\n- Metlakatla: $7,200.00\n\nTotal reduction: $34,294.00\n\nIf the Shingwauk Home be closed $6000.00 may be added to this; Regina $14,700.00, and Elkhorn $14,550.00, making a total diminution in our Estimates on account of the closing of Protestant Boarding Schools aggregating $88,544.00. This is a prominent and outstanding fact that will not be lost sight of by the Protestant denominations and should be kept in mind by the Department.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA. Owing to the saving which has accrued on account of closing the Metlakatla School the Department was\nenabled to take preliminary steps toward establishing Day Schools of\nthe new type at Massett on the Queen Charlotte Islands and at Aiyansh:\nand possibly at Hazelton. These three Schools are under Church of\nEngland auspices, as was the Metlakatla School. It seems only fair to\ndivert any portion of the appropriation which may be thus saved to the\npurposes of that denomination. In Boarding Schools in British Columbia\nthere are 165 Protestant pupils and 160 Roman Catholic pupils. In\nthis Province the grant is only $60.00 per capita so that $40.00 would\nhave to be provided to raise it to $100.00, and this would necessitate\ngranting $8,600.00 in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nYUKON: Affairs in the Yukon are on the same standing as\nthey were before the Supplementary appropriation which last Session\nprovided $10,000.00 for the erection of a new Boarding School building.\nI am inclined to think that whatever may be the urgency of the Church\nof England for further expenditures for Indian purposes in the Yukon,\nthe Indians themselves will not suffer seriously if the Department takes\ntime to consider slowly and carefully the needs of the Territory along\nthis line. We have had some correspondence with the Rev. Mr. O'Meara\nand later on I will bring various matters to your attention.\n\nREGATULATION: I am of the opinion that if the action\nabove outlined is taken; that is, if the Shingwauk Home, and the Regina\nand Elkhorn Schools were closed; if the Brandon School was given a\nconstituency from which pupils could be drawn who would benefit by\nagricultural training; if the per capita rate was advanced to $100.00\nfor the Mt. Elgin Institute in Ontario and to $85.00 in Manitoba and\nthe North West Territories; and if a sufficient amount was provided in\nthe Supplementary Estimates to give British Columbia the same treatment\nfrom the Ist. of July prox., the Advisory Board would probably be\nsatisfied. In this connection I may say that in a memorandum dated\nthe 4th. of Sept. 1908 the Board stated that \"It is very earnestly\nhoped that even yet the Superintendent may see his way out of the money\nsaved by a concentration of the work and closing some of the schools, an\nsuggested in his proposals, and the cutting down of expenses in the Department, to make a reasonable beginning in the way of the improved schools and some increase in the per capita grants although not up to the full standard suggested.\" I think it will also be possible from the general avail of the appropriation to begin three or four Day Schools of the new type in various localities; probably two in the Prince Albert district and one or two at points to be suggested by the Presbyterian Church, whose educational opportunities should be strengthened on account of the closing of the Regina School. If these suggestions meet with favor, I think that we may safely anticipate that the Advisory Board will be gratified that a start has been made.\n\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nSince presenting the memorandum of 27th of January to the Minister affairs have been somewhat furthered by a Meeting of the Advisory Board on February 8th at which I was present. As you will observe from the Resolution, the Board is very anxious that we should inaugurate the change set forth in our letter of the 24th April 1908 as far as possible with the funds we have on hand, and to assist us in this they have again expressed their willingness that the large Industrial Schools at Brandon, Elkhorn and Regina should be closed and that the money thus saved, together with other savings from the closing of Protestant schools, should be used in increasing the per capita grant where possible and in establishing a new type of school, or in improving the ordinary Day Schools.\n\nIf we could close these three Schools without undue haste and at such a season as would entail no suffering on pupils who have to be sent back to their homes, we would accomplish such a saving as would enable us to pay an increased grant of $100.00 per capita to the Protestant Boarding Schools west of the Great Lakes, exclusive of British Columbia. We would also be able to pay an increased salary rate to Day\nSchool teachers who are worthy of increases, and we could establish three improved Day Schools, one each for the Presbyterian, Methodist and Church of England denominations, at points to be decided upon after most careful consideration.\n\nI have under consideration this part of the question, but I would ask for Ministerial authority to proceed with the action necessary to close the Brendon, Elkhorn and Regina Schools, and to satisfy the three denominations that the money so saved will go directly to improving the remaining Schools which are conducted respectively by them.\n\nI will deal separately with the question of closing the Shingwauk Home on the File referring to this institution.\n\nChief Accountant.\nIn lieu of Brandon - $13,800.00\n\nIncrease in per capita grant $72 to $100 -\n\nNorway House = 50 pupils,\n$1,400.00\nIncrease in pupilage 50 =\n5,000.00\n\nFisher River - Berens River -\n2 improved Day Schools,\n@ $1175.00.............. 2,350.00\n\nTo develop 9 Day Schools in Lake Winnipeg District:\nLittle Grand Rapids, Poplar River, Cross Lake, Nelson House, Split Lake, Jack River,\nOxford House, God's Lake, Island Lake,\nand 4 in Saddle Lake District:\nSaddle Lake, Goodfish Lake, Whitefish Lake,\nSamson's, .................................. 5,050.00\nand at Story Reserve,.........................\n\n$13,800.00\n\nBrandon Bldgs.\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE.\n\nBuilding (estimated) $30,000.00\nLand \" $18,000.00\n$48,000.00\n\nNew Building & Furnishing, Norway House, $25,000.00\nImproved Day School Buildings,\nFisher River - Berens River = $15,000.00\n\n$40,000.00\nExplanatory Memorandum.\n\nThe Methodist Mission work is centred in three localities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. First; in the Norway House District; Second; the Saddle Lake District; Third; The Stony Reserve. The educational equipment in these districts at present consists of the Brandon Industrial School, a Boarding School at Morley, the McDougall Orphanage (which is now closed), nine Day Schools in the Lake Winnipeg District and four in the Saddle Lake District.\n\nAfter the Brandon Industrial School is closed it is proposed to provide for the educational work conducted by the Methodist Church in these districts as follows:\n\nRe-build and enlarge the Boarding School at Norway House to accommodate a pupilage of 100, at a per capita grant of $100. Close the Day Schools in that district where the average attendance is less than 15, and draft the pupils into the Boarding School. (The idea with reference to Boarding Schools in hunting and fishing districts is that the term of attendance should be short; not as at present from ten to eighteen years but from ten to fifteen years. In five years of tuition these pupils will have received any training which can be of use to them in after life, and at fifteen they should begin to strike out for themselves, and to form habits\nwhich will make them self-supporting.) Provide two Day Schools of the new type at Fisher River and Berens River.\n\nStony Reserve: It is difficult at present to determine what is the best course to pursue on this Reserve. The Boarding School was not a success, and it is doubtful whether a Day School of the improved type would be suitable to the conditions which obtain there. The Indians have requested the Department to open a Day School, and it might be well to do so as an experiment.\n\nSaddle Lake: It seems clear that the Red Deer Industrial School is not favorably located for the work to be done by the Methodist Church in the northern part of Alberta. It would be advisable to close this School and to open a Boarding School somewhere in the Saddle Lake district, and build up a Day School work with this institution as a centre.\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND.\n\nCapital Expenditure.\n\nElkhorn - Building (estimated) $40,675.00\nLand \" 3,825.00\n\nCalgary - Buildings & Land, 5,000.00 $49,500.00\n\nTHE PAS DISTRICT.\n\nTo provide for Boarding School building to accommodate 100 pupils, $25,000.00\n\" provide three (3) improved Day Schools, 16,000.00\n\" provide improvement in Boarding Schools - Southern Alberta - 5,000.00\n\n$46,000.00\n\"B\" - CHURCH OF ENGLAND.\n\nIn lieu of the following schools closed:\n\nElkhorn, $25,000.00\nEmmanuel College, 4,804.00\nCalgary, 4,550.00\nSt. Paul's, 15,000.00 = $44,354.00\n\nNote: While the saving made by the closing of the St. Paul's School is noted for information, it is not intended at present (as the funds have not been voted for some time) to include the amount in the suggested division.\n\nIncrease per capita grant from $72 to $100 at following schools:\n\nGordons, $840.00\nLac la Ronge, 1,400.00\nOnion Lake, 560.00\nSarcee, 420.00\nOld Sams, 1,120.00\nBlood, 1,400.00\nPelican, 840.00\nWhitefish Lake, 420.00\nLake Waboscow, 420.00\nHay River, 560.00 $7,980.00\n\nImprovements in Day Schools:\n\nAhtahkakoops,\nJohn Smiths,\nJames Smiths,\nBrokenhead,\nFt.

Most of these schools have a very small attendance. They are conducted in miserable buildings and by teachers who have no special qualifications. In the Province of Saskatchewan for instance there are thirteen schools. Only two have an attendance of over 10, and the others range from an average attendance of 3 to 8. In the Pas District there are eight Schools, with an average attendance of 80. It is a question, therefore, whether it is possible to build up each Day School; or whether in some districts a Boarding School should be established, with day schools to serve as sources of pupilage supply.\n\nAfter conversing with Dr. Tucker I am convinced that the Church of England authorities have not as yet found a solution of this problem, and if they were asked now to state where this saving should be spent they would find a difficulty in doing so. I think, however, that we should\nimprove the Day Schools on Ahtahkakoops, John Smith's, James Smith's and \nBlackfoot Reserves, and at Ft. Alexander. It might not be advisable at \nonce to erect the improved type of building at these points, but we should \nexperiment with good teachers in order to see if the attendance could be \nincreased and to prove the usefulness of the day schools.\n\nThe provision of a good Boarding School in the Pas District is \nsuggested. This would balance the Methodist Boarding School at Norway \nHouse, and if these Boarding Schools are anywhere of value, I think they \nshould do good work in these hunting and fishing districts, by having a \nshort term of tuition, not more than five years. It is not contemplated \nestablishing this Boarding School without thorough preliminary enquiry \nand careful consideration as between the Church authorities and \nthe Department.\n\nThe educational needs in the southern part of the Province of \nAlberta are somewhat obscure. I intend to take up the question of the \nfeasibility of inaugurating a day school of the new type on the Blackfoot \nReserve in lieu of the Old Sun's Boarding School. The Sarcee Boarding \nSchool should either be very much improved or closed altogether. The \nPeigan School and the School on the Blood Reserve are doing pretty good \nwork.\n\"A\" - PRESBYTERIAN.\n\nIn lieu of Regina Industrial School - $14,000.00.\n\nIncrease per capita grants from $72 to $100 at the following schools:\n\n- Cecilia Jeffrey: 30 pupils, $840.00\n- Birtle: 50 pupils, $1400.00\n- Crowstand: 50 pupils, $1400.00\n- Round Lake: 40 pupils, $1120.00\n- File Hills: 25 pupils, $700.00\n- Portage la Prairie: 25 pupils, $700.00\n\nTotal: $6,160.00\n\nIncrease in pupilage 10 at Cecilia Jeffrey and 15 each at File Hills and Portage la Prairie, $4,000.00\n\nImprovement in Day Schools where advisable:\n\n- Swan Lake: Salary\n- Okotoks: Salary\n- Sioux Walpaston: Salary\n\nTotal: $1,640.00\n\nImproved Type of Day Schools:\n\n- Mistawasis Reserve:\n  - Increase to teacher & wife - salary & rations, $350.00\n  - Nurse, Salary & Rations, $475.00\n  - Food for midday meal - drugs &c., $350.00\n\nTotal: $1,175.00\n\nWhite Bears - Moose Mountain:\n- Increase to present Teacher to act as field Matron, & rations, $275.00\n- Nurse - Salary & Rations, $475.00\n- Food for midday meal - drugs &c., $275.00\n\nTotal: $1,025.00\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE:\n\nBuildings, estimated, $36,160.00\nLands, $8,000.00\n\nFile Hills = Addition to Buildings & Furnishings, $4,000.00\n\nMistawasis = Improved Day School Bldg. & furniture, $10,000.00\n\nWhite Bears Reserve = Improvement in Buildings, including house for Teacher & Nurse & small Infirmary, with tents &c., $2,500.00\n\nTotal: $16,500.00\nOttawa, March 13th, 1909.\n\nGENERAL MEMORANDUM:\n\nI attach herewith a detailed plan of expenditure on Indian education in lieu of certain Industrial Schools to be closed.\n\nWith reference to the increase in per capita grant, this would only be given on the distinct understanding that no salary increases were to be made or additional obligations undertaken without the consent of the Department. It must not be understood by the Churches that each and every Boarding School on the list is to be considered permanent on account of the increase in the grant. While the Day Schools are in the experimental stage the Boarding Schools might be allowed to remain, but the whole establishment is a tentative one. The instruction in Boarding schools must be considered in the light of the special needs of the Indians who attend, and the general policy of the Department is to simplify the tuition and to make it directly applicable to the afterlife of the pupil. Investigation may lead to the conclusion that in Boarding Schools in agricultural districts the term of residence should be from 12 or 18 to 16 years and in fishing and hunting districts from 10 to 15 or 16 years. In no event should the course be longer than six years.\nOttawa, March IIth., 1909.\n\nExplanatory Memorandum.\n\n\"A\" - Presbyterian.\n\nIt is proposed to allot the grant made for Regina Industrial School, $14,000.00, as follows:\n\nIncrease the per capita grants at 6 Boarding Schools to $100.\n\nIncrease the pupilage at Cecilia Jeffrey, File Hills and Portage la Prairie Schools by 40 pupils.\n\nImprove the three Day Schools at Swan Lake, Okanese and Walpaston Sioux.

Most of these\nschools have a very small attendance. Each case should be considered\non its merits; either the school should be closed and the pupils\ndrafted into some existing Boarding School, or the School if favorably situated should be improved and developed.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that immediate good results would follow additional expenditure on the Day Schools mentioned in the list. The Department is now in communication with the Teachers, and in two instances has increased the salary to $400.00 to date from the 1st of April 1908. The teachers have been encouraged to communicate their methods to the Department and to suggest how the work can be rendered more effective, and it is proposed to place the information so gained at the disposal of all teachers in other sections whose schools have not been so successful. It is hoped that the Church authorities will assist the Department in obtaining a better class of teacher whenever it is thought advisable to make changes.\n\nThe advisability of the establishment of a good Boarding School in the Pas District was brought to the notice of the Department by Rev. Archibald Lloyd and Rev. Owen Furlong, and the Department agrees that such an institution would probably meet the educational needs of the district. The Indians are nomadic, maintaining themselves largely by hunting and fishing, and the attendance at the Day Schools established on the Reserve has for the past year been very poor. As the Pas is in a central position geographically it is thought to be a good location, but it is not contemplated establishing this Boarding School without thorough preliminary enquiry and careful consideration as between the Church authorities and the Department.\n\nThe educational needs in the southern part of Alberta are very important and some decision must be arrived at. It is doubtful whether a Day School could be successful on the Blackfoot Reserve. Particular enquiry will be made as to the location of families whose children are in attendance at the Old Man's Boarding School and who might become attendants at a Day School. It is a keen fact that the Indians during the winter are scattered along the river for thirty miles. In the spring they wander about to all quarters of the Reserve.\nand they only congregate in June and during the buying season. Upon this Reserve and upon the other Reserves in Treaty 7 it may be that the habits of the Indians would render premature and abortive any attempt to establish a Day School. For this reason in the list showing the increase in per capita grants the Boarding Schools are allowed to remain, but the Department does not intend to alter its decision with reference to Old Sun School, the unsanitary condition of which has been a subject of examination.\n\n**EXPENDITURE.**\n\nIn lieu of Brandon \u2014 $12,800.00.\n\nIncrease in per capita grant $75 to $100.\n\nNorway House \u2014 60 pupils, $1,600.00\n\nIncrease in pupilage 50 \u2014 $5,000.00\n\nFisher River & Bessie River.\n\n2 improved Day Schools,\n\n$3,175.00............. 2,350.00\n\nTo develop 9 Day Schools in Lake Winnipeg District:\n\nLittle Grand Rapids, Poplar River, Grass Lake, Nelson House, Split Lake, Jack River,\n\nOxford House, God's Lake, Island Lake,\n\nand 4 in Saddle Lake District:\n\nRedde Lake, Goodfish Lake, Whitefish Lake,\n\nSimon's..........................\n\nand at Story Reserve,...........................\n\n$2,000.00\n\n$12,800.00\n\nCapital Expenditure.\n\nNew buildings & Furnishings, Norway House, $25,000.00\n\nImproved Day School Buildings,\n\nFisher River & Bessie River, $15,000.00\n\n$40,000.00\nThe Methodist Mission work is centred in three localities in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta; First; in the Norway House District; Second; the Saddle Lake District; Third; The Stony Reserve. The educational equipment in these districts at present consists of the Brandon Industrial School School, a Boarding School at Norway House, nine Day Schools in the Lake Winnipeg District and four in the Saddle Lake district.\n\nAfter the Brandon Industrial School is closed it is proposed to provide for the educational work conducted by the Methodist Church in these districts as follows:\n\nRe-build and enlarge the Boarding School at Norway House to accommodate a pupilage of 100, at a per capita grant of $700, and provide two Day Schools of the new type at Fisher River and Berens River.\n\nIt is difficult at present to determine what is the best course to pursue on the Stony Reserve. The Boarding School was not a success, and an experiment is now being made with a Day School which since its opening has had a very good attendance. The Indians seem interested and it may possibly develop into a permanent Day School of the improved type.\n\nIt seems clear that the Red Deer Industrial School is not favorably located for the work to be done by the Methodist Church in the northern part of Alberta. It is submitted for consideration that it might be better at some not far distant date to close this School and to open a Boarding School at a point to be decided upon in the Saddle Lake District, nearer the source of pupils, and to gradually build up the Day School work with this institution as a centre.\n\nIt will be seen from the above outline that the Department wishes to take a conservative stand on the question of Boarding Schools and not to close any of the existing institutions until it\nhas been proved that day schools will as well provide for the pupils as do the residential schools; or until the Department is convinced that a school is not properly managed and should be abolished. At the same time it must not be understood that any Boarding School is to be considered permanent on account of the increase in the per capita grant or in the number of pupils in attendance. The Boarding Schools are to come under criticism and are to prove their effectiveness while the attempt is being made to develop the day schools. The increased per capita grant is only given on the distinct understanding that no salary increases are to be made or additional obligations undertaken for maintenance without the consent of the Department.\n\nThe instruction to be given in Boarding Schools and the terms of attendance must be considered in the light of the special needs of the pupils and the general policy of the Department is to simplify the tuition and to introduce a larger element of outdoor work for the boys and more practical instruction in domestic employments for the girls; in a word, to make the tuition directly applicable to the afterlife of the pupil. Investigation may lead to the conclusion that in agricultural districts pupils should enter the school at 12 or 13 years of age and remain till 16, and in fishing and hunting districts they would enter at 10 and leave at 14 or 16. In no event should the course at a Boarding School be longer than six years. The tendency has been to admit pupils who were hardly more than infants, and to keep them until they were 18 or over. It may be open to question whether girl pupils should not be kept a year or two longer, but boys who are to earn their living by farming will receive the most valuable tuition between 15 and 16 and pupils of the same sex who are to become fishermen and hunters or voyageurs should begin their life of active employment at 15 or 16.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMissionary Society\nChurch of England in Canada\n\n229 CONFEDERATION LIFE BUILDING\n\nToronto, Ont., April 26th, 180\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nI am sending you herewith a memorandum of the Advisory Board on Indian Education signed on behalf of all the members by Hon. S. H. Blake as Chairman, and by myself as Secretary, in reply to your valued communication of March 26th. It has been a cause of great satisfaction to the Board to find itself so fully in agreement with the views and proposals of the Department.\n\nI need only add that members of the Board will hold themselves in readiness to go to Ottawa to interview the Department on the subject should their presence at any time be thought to be necessary in further elucidating or in promoting the object we have in view.\n\nI am,\n\nYours most truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary M.S.C.C. & Secretary Advisory Board.\nREPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE\nof the\nADVISORY BOARD ON INDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nThe Advisory Board has received and carefully perused the communication of the Deputy Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs from Ottawa, of date March 26th, 1909, giving, amongst other information, a list of the Industrial Schools which the Department proposes to close, and showing the dealing generally with the Residential Schools and Day Schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and how the funds saved by this proposed action are to be expended.\n\n2. The Board suggests that before the Department determines finally upon the action to be taken opportunity should be given to those in the locality immediately affected by the proposed changes for consultation, so far as possible, approval or modification, according to the result of the stated conference.\n\nThe Board reiterates the conclusion arrived at after full consideration that the regulation as to compulsory attendance should be strictly enforced. The Board concurs in the conclusion that \"where Day Schools have now a very small attendance\" and the number can not be increased, arrangements should be made at as early a date as possible for the closing of these schools and for the adoption of what may be determined upon for giving education to the children of the locality.\n\nIt would be well to name a minimum attendance; if this is not reached, then on due notice, such schools should be closed.\n\nThere is a careful in-\nspection of schools, yet, in order to aid the Department in its conclusions in this matter there should be more careful and constant supervision and medical inspection of all the schools, and that the officers responsible for this branch of the work should from time to time make such reports as will give the Department a complete statement of the facts so as to enable it to act.\n\n6. The Board concurs in the shortening of the period for attendance of the children at the Residential Schools according to the schedule suggested in the communication referred to, and that it should not generally be longer than six years.\n\nWhile Residential Schools may be necessary in some localities and may serve a good purpose for the time being, the Board concurs in the policy of the Department in establishing wherever possible an improved type of School. In a recent communication the Bishop of Galesdonia, who has devoted much time to the consideration of the Indian, states:\n\n\"Viewed in the light of relative expenditure, I have no hesitation in saying that there has been far greater return from the Day School than from the so-called Industrial School which on the per capita grant system, cannot afford to keep first-class trade instructors\". Again: \"It is not the policy for the Government to relieve the parents from the duty of providing for their children\". \"In some cases only a few of the people can carry at one time. If we had a man and his wife in charge a tent that could hold a dozen children, with blankets, etc., might meet the need. I think the parents would be willing to provide food for their children during their absence\".\n\nThis equipment would be an adjunct to the Day School and is well worth\n\n4 suggests that it would be in the interest of the Indians to adopt a plan whereby the older children, in all cases where they demand it should be drafted into the White Schools.\n\nThe Board also notes with satisfaction that \"the Boarding Schools are not subject to criticism and are to prove their effectiveness while the effort is being made to develop the day schools\". And, also, \"the per capita grant is only given on the distinct understanding that...\"\nsalary increases are to be made or additional obligations undertaken for maintenance without the consent of the Department, and that no Boarding School is to be considered permanent on account of the increase of the per capita grant. The Board would, however, add that the increased per capita grant only covers part of the expenditure and cherishes the hope that by and by it may be considerably increased.\n\nThe Board in dealing with the proposal to close Regina, Elkhorn and Brandon Industrial Schools is of the opinion that there is not room for all three; there is room for one; the proposition of the Department would leave only one small residential school at Portage la Prairie and another at Birtle for the Protestant children in all that section of country East of Elkhorn.\n\nTaking up these three schools in the order in which the Department has placed them, we suggest the following:\n\nFirst Elkhorn - By closing this school the constituency East of the School can be supplied by the schools at Pilot Mille, Gordon, Round Lake and Crossland, while that to the North will be served by the new type of Day School at Mistassini, and those who need a residential school can be drafted to Battleford, and the Gordon and Round Lake agencies given as a constituency to the Battleford School.\n\nSecond Elkhorn - The pupils in this school are drafted almost entirely from territory East and North of the school. About one-half of the pupils now in attendance belong to that District of country starting with Little Saskatchewan on the South East and travelling by way of Swan Lake to Cumberland House and North of this line. This portion of the Elkhorn constituency has an Indian population of about 2400. The proposal of the Department to build a school at the Pne, or wherever it may be most suitable, to accommodate about a hundred children might conserve the interest of this entire section, which at present has not one residential school. The fact that so many have been sent to Elkhorn from this District, and the people being of nomadic habits, it is more than probable that such a residential school would serve their educational interests better than any other system that might be devised, and we strenuously\ncommend the building of a Residential School for the Pas district.\n\nThe Archbishop of Rupert's Land makes the following strong representations on behalf of the Church of England: For many years it was the only Protestant body working among the Indians of the North West; his Diocese was the scene of the labours of the first missionaries and the establishment of the first churches and Mission Schools early in the 19th century and in consequence a large number of the Indians are members of the Church of England; when St. Paul's School was burned down, three or four years ago, an assurance was given to him that if he did not press for its immediate rebuilding an equivalent would be given him there or in some other more suitable locality; the present proposals of the Department do not contemplate even the establishment of an improved Day School in his Diocese; and the closing of the Elkhorn School would blot out the last vestige of Church of England influence in the education of the Indians of Manitoba.\n\nThe Advisory Board feels that there is great force in the Archbishop's contention and would recommend to the Department the establishment of an improved Day School and a Residential School at X point to be hereafter indicated to the Department.\n\nThird Brandon - The territory East of Elkhorn might be made a constituency from which those who need a Residential School might be drafted into the Brandon School if that be retained and into such other Residential Schools as may hereafter be determined upon.\n\nThe unsanitary condition of the Residential School at Norway House has been before the Department for some time, and the Board approves the intention of the Government to build a new school at that point.\n\nThe wisdom of closing the Red Deer School and erecting a Residential School in a more suitable locality to the North commands itself to the Board worthy of the serious consideration of the Department.\nAs to all matters of detail mentioned by the Department regarding the improvement of Day Schools and Residential Schools and the establishment of the new type of Day School at Hintonburg and White Bear, together with the increased per capita grant to all the Residential Schools, this Board is in entire agreement with the proposals of the Department.\n\nThe Board heartily concurs in the last clause of the communication, \u2014\n(a) the special needs of the pupils; (b) the simplification of the tuition;\n(c) the introduction of a larger element of outdoor work for the boys and more practical instruction in domestic employment for the girls should be the aim of education so as to make it directly applicable to the after life of the pupils; and strongly urges the importance of having a parcel of land in connection with all schools, Day or Residential, so that facilities may exist everywhere to teach farming to the children.\n\nIt will be the duty of the Churches to aid in every way in their power in devising some plan whereby \u2014\n(a) Improved teachers can be fitted for work in the North West.\n(b) Nurses can also be prepared for this particular class of work.\n(c) Matrons or deaconesses can be procured to aid and help generally in uplifting the Indian women in the locality.\n(d) The evils of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases can be combated.\n(e) The Indians can be protected from the evils of intemperance and immorality, especially in his contact with the white man.\n\nWe urge upon the Department the necessity of making the proposed changes, as far as they may be finally agreed on at the earliest possible date so as to bring the appropriations within the present fiscal year, and we assure the Department of our hearty co-operation to bring the whole to a successful issue.\n\n26 April 1907\n\n[Signature]\nChairman\nJ. Norman Tucker\nSecretary\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Advisory Board has answered the communication sent to them on the 26th. of March in which certain suggestions were made as to the redistribution of funds rendered available by the closing of three Protestant Industrial Schools, namely, Regina, Elkhorn and Brandon. The answer of the Board is upon the whole very satisfactory, and tends to show that the representatives of the three Protestant denominations acting together are endeavoring to meet the wishes of the Department and to improve the system of Indian education.\n\nBRANDON,\n\nThe Board agrees with the Department upon the advisability of\nBRANDON.\n\nclosing Regina and Elkhorn Schools. The conclusion has been arrived at that while the three Schools are not necessary, there is room for one, and it is suggested, rather than definitely recommended, that the School to be kept shall be Brandon.\n\nNo doubt if this School is given an agricultural territory from which to draw pupils it might be retained with advantage to meet the needs of the Protestant Indians East of Elkhorn and as far north on Lake Winnipeg as Berens River and Fisher River. It is proposed, therefore, to allow Brandon to stand until we have the opportunity of judging whether a sufficient number of pupils can be obtained from these agricultural districts to insure the successful operation of the Institution. I would lay down the following preliminary but essential rules to govern this School: (The Board is aware of the feeling of the Department in this matter and there would be no element of novelty in the position) -\n\n1st. The school is to be a non-denominational school conducted by the Methodist Church. In it shall be accommodated pupils from the three denominations, if possible in equal numbers, that is to say that each denomination shall have the right of nominating 38 pupils.\n\n2nd. That the management of the School shall at all times give access to the clergymen of the two other denominations, and arrange that the pupils in residence shall attend public worship in their own particular Church, under the charge of a teacher.\n\n3rd\n3rd. That the per capita allowance shall be $130.00 per annum under the usual regulations governing such grants, and that the Department will not be responsible for any deficits incurred.\n\nREGINA,\n\nThe Board agrees to the closing of Regina and points out that the area from which pupils are drawn can be supplied by schools at File Hills, Gordon's, Round Lake and Crowstand, with an improved Day School at Mistawasis, and the extension to the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies of the territory contributory to the Battleford Industrial School.\n\nTo my mind this situation shows that the three Churches are working in harmony, because the Presbyterian Church while agreeing to the closing of their only Industrial School agree also that the pupils might be otherwise provided for and two Church of England Schools are mentioned, namely, Gordon's and Battleford.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the Regina School be now closed. As the Department is not responsible for its finances beyond paying the per capita grant, the Presbyterian Church will make its own arrangement with the staff. The Church might claim an interest in the equipment of the institution to the extent of any purchases made since the payment of the last deficit. As this matter will require to be carefully handled, and as in any event an auction sale\nor a distribution of equipment will have to take place, I would suggest that this important matter be placed in the hands of Inspr. Graham.\n\nELKHORN\n\nAs the cost of this School has been entirely borne by the Department the course of action is not in any way complicated. The pupils should be sent to their homes, or those who should attend Brandon might be transferred there, and the staff should be given three months' leave of absence with pay from the 1st. of June, and we should arrange to distribute or sell by public auction the furnishings and equipment of the School.\n\nI desire to draw your attention specially to the position in which Mr. A. E. Wilson, the Principal of this School, will be placed by its discontinuance. He has been many years in the employ of the Department in various educational capacities, and while I am not prepared to say that we should continue his services indefinitely, I think we should retain him until he has an opportunity of finding some other employment. It will be necessary to have some person at Elkhorn in charge of the buildings for a while; and in the interval Mr. Wilson may decide his own future. The Church of England has always considered this a denomination institution & one of the adjuncts of their missionary system- and I think they should be interested in providing for Mr. Wilson in some way.\n\nOld Sun's Boarding School. Under the new arrangement\nwith the Bishop of Calgary this School is closed and is being continued as a Day School.\n\nGENERAL\n\nBy the closing of these Schools it will be possible to increase the per capita grants at the existing Boarding Schools, as foreshadowed, from $72 to $100 per capita. This will absorb $14420.00 of the gross saving of $44,854.00. Another $1160.00 will be apportioned to the per capita increase at Brandon; making in all $16,990.00. Until the Department hears further from the Advisory Board and until there is a consensus of opinion on the location of new Boarding Schools, it is not proposed to make any additional expenditure save in the improvements to Ray School.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No 289032 of Febry. 23rd, I have the honor to submit the following:\n\nAt the outset I wish to state (what is already well known to the Department) that in the Indian work, the kind and quality of the workers is more important than the methods or systems they are required to carry out.\n\n1 Education.\n\nA. Industrial Schools:\n\n(1) While the conception of this class of school is a good one, and good work has been done; as good results might be reached in smaller schools with less equipment. At present the great barrier to the success of this class of school seems to be in the lack of a sufficient number of pupils, mentally and physically fit for the course of instruction provided, who really wish for such training, or for any higher education.\n\n(2) It does not seem advisable to teach trades to the young Indians, with the view to their earning a livelihood in that way. Outdoor work, such as farming and care of stock, is evidently the most suitable life for the majority.\n\n(3) If any wish to take a higher education or special training; the way should be open for them; but let them take this in existing schools and colleges along with white students. It is desirable that race distinctions eventually disappear; co-education might hasten that end.\n(4) The present system of congregating pupils in large schools at a distance from their reserves, is not a good one. While it is true that pupils make greater progress when taken to non-reserve schools away from parents, the most of them have to return to the reserves; and that at an age when they are still easily influenced by reserve life. Any scheme for the improvement of the race must include old as well as young.\n\nThe old people may to a certain extent constitute a hindrance to the work of a school located in their immediate vicinity; a school should be a great moral force in the uplift of the life of the reserve.\n\nAlso, as an object lesson in farming, gardening, housekeeping, care of the sick and in maintaining sanitary conditions about their homes the reserve school is a great benefit to the older Indians.\nDay Schools:\n\nThis class of school is unsatisfactory except in the most advanced Indian communities.\n\nDifficulties to contend with are:\n\n(a) Indifference of parents.\n\n(b) Nomadic habits of parents.\n\n(c) Difficult to discipline: if necessary to punish, pupils absent themselves from school for a long period; parents sympathy usually with children in such cases.\n\nB. Day Schools that have proved most successful have combined some of the Boarding school features:-i.e.-the children remaining at the school; in some cases for the noon meal; in others from Monday morning until Friday night.\n\nC. On reserves where the nomadic habit has been given up, especially where a large percentage of the parents are themselves graduates of schools, the day school could be used to good advantage. However where such communities do exist, it would be well; where possible, to erect these into ordinary school districts, along with adjacent white families; under the provincial educational system.\n3 Boarding Schools.\n\n(A) For the majority of the western reserves this seems to be for the present, the most satisfactory kind of school. There are improvements that might be made in present system of Boarding Schools.\n\n(a) Many of the schools are too large; becoming institutional rather than homelike.\n\n(b) That a school be as homelike as possible; that there be less danger in case of disease of a contagious nature appearing in the school; that pupils get better individual attention: No school should have more than twenty pupils in attendance.\n\nB. (1) One Principal could take charge of more than one school of this kind, where reserves are near each other.\n\nThere would be a great advantage if the Principal of the school were also Agent for the reserve or reserves.\n\n(2) Such a Principal-Agent would be in a position to know his pupils from infancy to manhood and womanhood:\n\nTo supervise the after-leaving-school period; and would be in a greater measure than now, responsible for the ultimate success or failure of each individual.\n(3) A weakness in the present system lies in the period immediately after leaving school. It is then that a boy (the restraint of the school suddenly thrown off) spends much time moving from place to place; visiting etc., but in fact rapidly drifting back to the nomadic habits of his ancestors.\n\n(4) Instead of giving a boy his discharge at a stated age, it should be given when he has proven himself capable of carrying out satisfactorily, the purpose for which he has been educated. The discipline and restraint of the school should not be suddenly thrown off; but continued and relaxed as the conduct of the ex-pupil might warrant.\n\n(5) A year or more before a boy is to leave the school the Principal could allot him his land and arrange that he do some work on it, from time to time, while he was still a pupil at the school. Land could be broken and prepared for seeding, a small and stable built etc., so that a boy would have a place of his own, independent of the old people; who invariably hinder the progress of an ex-pupil if he is allowed to go back and reside with them.\nD.(6) All the girl pupils should be under the guardianship of the school until they are married.\n\n(7) Domestic service among white people is a most unsatisfactory occupation for Indian girls.\n\nE.(1) The principal part of the industrial training should be to fit the pupils for farm life.\n\n(2) Something should be done to retain and develop the native trades such as bead-work, tanning of skins, and basket making.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nAt the risk of seeming disloyal to my own school; I wish to say that it is my belief that it would be better to close all Indian Industrial schools; but before this is done, provision should be made for continuing the education of the pupils now in attendance and for the reserves served by these schools. For instance, the Regina school is the only Protestant school serving the Piapot, Muscowpetung and Pasqua group of reserves also the Assiniboine reserve near Sintaluta. A small boarding school would serve the first three reserves named. A school with quarters suitable for housing and boarding the children from Monday to Friday should be provided for the other. The nearest Protestant schools to these reserves are the File Hills and Round Lake Boarding schools. These have already, all the pupils the buildings will accommodate; and for reasons stated in par. A. under Boarding schools the attendance at these schools should not be increased.\n\nBetter schools should be provided for the Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop reserves, from which many of\nGeneral Remarks (continued)\n\nthe pupils in this school are recruited.\n\nNo school should be so large that the elements of a home are in danger of being lost in institutional routine.\n\nWhere a school is located on or near a reserve, all children of school age should be compelled to attend; unless unable to do so by reason of illness or other reasonable cause.\n\nWhere there is no school on or near a reserve; it seems a real hardship to compel an Indian to send his children to a distant school. A distant school might be termed, one to which the parent could not easily drive and return home in the one day.\n\nIndian homes should have more air space per occupant; better ventilation and the sanitary conditions generally improved. A regular inspection and also on diseases etc., illustrated lectures of a popular nature, would do much good in this line.\n\nProvision should be made for the isolating of consumptives and all suffering with running, scrofulous sores. These might well be classed with such diseases as smallpox and the same precautions taken.\n\nThe establishing of small reserve hospitals is of utmost importance. These could undertake the care of the sick and also be a source of instruction to the people of the reserve in:\n\n(a) Improving the sanitary condition of the homes,\n\n(b) Informing the Indian women as to best methods of feeding and caring for infants; among whom the death rate is altogether too high,\n\n(c) Informing women as to diet and general care of the sick.\nGeneral Remarks (concluded)\n\nTemperance laws now in force might well be amended by forbidding the sale of intoxicants in any town located on or in the immediate neighborhood of an Indian reserve.\n\nIndians should be required to register their marriages, either with the Agent or some other officer, and whether married by pagan or Christian form, to more strictly observe the marriage vow.\n\nSome provision should be made for Indian divorce in exceptional cases.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that I regret the long delay to your letter of which the enclosed is a reply; but a number of reasons: including an outbreak of measles in this school, have prevented me from taking the time to give the matter the thought that such a subject demands. As it is the subject has been only barely touched. I regret that it was not found convenient for the Department, through some of its officials, to have a conference with the Indian workers. Personally I wished for such a conference, not that I hoped to have anything of value to suggest but rather for the opportunity such a gathering would afford to learn something more about the Indian problem. I trust that at some time in the near future a conference of this kind may be arranged with a view to the educational value of such a meeting, to the workers.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Interior\n\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe Indian Education.\n\nThe three Protestant denominations interested in Indian education having found themselves straitened for funds by reason of the large amounts which have to be provided owing to the rapid settlement of the new Provinces approached the Department with a view to obtaining additional appropriations for the maintenance of schools which had been in the past supported to a large extent from denominational funds. In addition to this financial interest consideration was given to the whole question of Indian education with a view to improving the educational facilities and the speedy civilisation of the Indian.\n\nUpon receipt of a joint memorandum in the autumn of 1907 from the representatives of the three Churches, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist, the Department replied on the 21st. of March 1908 and endeavored to lay down certain principles upon which the question might be considered in the future. In the latter part of the same month the Department received from the representatives of the Churches (who had in the meantime formed themselves into a Committee or Advisory Board upon the subject of Indian education) agreeing in the main with the principles laid down by the Department in this communication of the 21st. of March, whereupon, on the 24th. of April following, certain proposition were made to the Protestant denominations that certain Industrial Schools should be closed; that improvements should be made in the existing type of Day Schools and better salaries paid to the teachers; and that when these matters were amicably arranged the Department would feel disposed to adopt an improved\nscale of per capita grant to the remaining residential schools.\n\nThese suggestions were accepted by the Advisory Board but it was found impossible for the Department to obtain a supplementary vote for the additional expenditure contemplated. The Advisory Board, being anxious that the changes and improvements should not be indefinitely postponed, urged that wherever it was possible to close schools without detriment to the work that they should be closed and the funds so saved diverted to the purposes of each denomination, and the plan outlined in the communication of the 24th of April carried out as far as possible. In accordance with this wish the Department made certain suggestions involving the closing of three Industrial Schools, Brandon, Elkhorn and Regina and a redistribution of the funds to be thus saved. The Advisory Board accepted the suggestions with reference to Regina and Elkhorn, subject to the consideration of views to be expressed by persons interested in those localities, but suggested that the School at Brandon should be retained.\n\nThe Department has received certain representations from the Anglican Archbishop of Rupert's Land and from the Bishop of Keewatin, and the matter now stands in this position:\u2014the Department is prepared to close Regina and Elkhorn if it is found advisable to do so and to continue Brandon under the present Methodist management with non-denominational features.\n\nI may say that the Roman Catholics, although the matter was brought to their attention in the first place for the purpose of having their co-operation in re-adjusting the school question, have not seen their way clear to join with the Protestant denominations.\n\n(Sd) Frank Pedley\nBISHOP LEGAL ON INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nMay 13th, 1897\n\nTo the Editor of the Free Press:\n\nSir\u2014I beg, with your kind permission, to call attention to certain statements made in his official report by Mr. James McKenna, and dealing with the education of Indians, especially children in industrial schools and boarding-schools.\n\nI quote his words: \"There are people who say that the best way to think about the question is to belittle the work of the missionaries and the government in the Indian question seriously, and at first sight there seems some force in this description of the civilizing influences of their efforts. But let us consider what these influences far in advance of the present stage of development may bear witness to their great benefit to the child.\"\n\nThese are words of common sense spoken by a man of experience. It should be high time now to stop saying that the missionaries are the failure of Indian education. After years of experience in the field, I have no hesitation in saying that the missionaries are doing an education in our industrial schools and among our Indians which is far in advance of what could have been reasonably expected.\n\nImagine what the result of those splendid results could have been.\n\nIt is perfect nonsense to expect that such a thing could have been accomplished in the short space of, perhaps, six years, or even ten years, in making a child a creature absolutely immune against the influence of an Indian child, that would do away with all the bad habits of the race.\n\nIf, after leaving school, some of these children fall into the hands of the mission to which they find themselves returned, they will be treated as youths of good and respectable families, and will be educated and act in an honest and upright manner, even though they be placed in the same surroundings.\n\nMuch mischief might have been avoided had the government seen fit to send these youths, having graduated in these schools, back to their own homes under special control, so that they might receive some special guidance and encouragement, and thus avoid the chances, just the reverse of which has been the case.\n\nAs I am trying again the system of day schools in the industrial schools, or residential schools, as it is purposed to call them (for the sake of calling them), it is for anyone who is even slightly familiar with the condition of our Indian reserves, at least in the west, to see how impossible it is. This system has been tried and found wanting. The reason why it is the scattered condition of the Indians that makes it impossible is the low of more than half a dozen of children to a teacher, and the distance, on account of the distance; but even worse is the fact that many of them are in the immediate vicinity of schools, yet the number of truant officers to bring the attendance to any approximate standard is nil.\n\nNo, there is only one way to get the desired and lasting effect on the Indians, and that is to send them to residential schools, if you like, young boy or girl, after leaving the industrial school, where they could have been wished for, where education has not been wasted, not a particle of it, and where the effects will show again and be lasting.\n\nThe amount of money spent (not more than $500 per child) for the betterment of these children is not worth the expenditure. It is really unnecessary that we should spend another thousand dollars spent on Indian education, when we have vast immensities of fertile lands, once the proper methods are employed, and an inexhaustible supply of wealth promptly available for such descriptions.\n\nEMILE J. LEGAL, O.M.I.\n\nBishop's House, St. Albert, Alta.\n\nMay 13th, 1897.\nOttawa, June 7, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nA letter appeared in the Manitoba Free Press, of May 13, last, over the signature of Emile J. Legal, O.M.I., Bishop of St. Albert, on Indian education, in which His Lordship quotes statements said to have been made by you in an official report dealing with the results of education given to Indian children in industrial and boarding schools under missionary control.\n\nAs the Department has been unable to find the report from which the extract referred to was taken, I should be glad if you would give the date on which it was sent to the Department and state in what connection it was made, so that it may be traced. If it was not transmitted to the Department, be good enough to forward a full copy.\n\nA clipping containing a copy of Bishop Legal's letter above referred to is inclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.A.J. McKenna, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nInspector of Roman Catholic Schools,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from Mr. Inspector Graham's report on the Crooked Lakes Agency, Cowessess Band, August 12th, 1909.\n\nThere are a large number of school graduates on this reserve, and I regret to say the advancement made by them has not been anything like it should have been. They seem to have no desire to branch out, but keep dwelling in a small way. According to the Agent, and Mr. Sutherland, the farmer, these graduates are not doing as good work and are harder to handle than Indians who have never been at school. Some of those young men have been out of school seven or eight years, and I must say I cannot see much change in their conditions as the years go by. Much of their time is taken up in driving to and from different towns for their own amusement. Foot-ball and other sports also take up much of their time. They clothe themselves and provide some food, it is true, but this is usually done by taking a small load of wood to town from time to time.\n\nThe Indians of this band are capable of doing a great deal more than they are doing, and most of the farming is done by Indians who have never been at school. The area under cultivation by the different individuals is remarkably small\u2014the average for the 23 farmers being 22 acres. They have a magnificent reserve.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your printed circular dated the 2nd ultimo regarding the desired attitude of all officials towards pupils of Boarding and Industrial Schools who are about receiving their discharge from such schools and to say that while I am in full sympathy with the expressed desires of the Department to continue the leading of the Indian youths into higher spheres of man and woman-hood I foresee many discouragements, if not complete failures, in trying to carry your expressed wishes to a successful issue. If you will read the attached clippings taken from late newspapers you will, I think, conclude that I am not far afield in my conclusions. The attached are only a few of the evidences which have led me to the conclusion that the public are not desirous that Indians should advance, in many directions, at least. When we read of ex-missionaries encouraging the Indians to cling to the customs of their forefathers, such as the giving of war and other ancient dances, to appear in public in nude attire and with little on them except paint and feathers, we must confess that we fail to see wherein this either tends to civilize or christianise our pelican wards. If I am in error regarding the modern methods adopted to elevate and uplift the Indians\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthen the past and present missionaries who have labored amongst the Stoney's on Morley Reservation have accomplished a noble work. This is borne out by the writer of the article which will be attached hereto and headed: \"All Unite at Banff\".\n\nI also read in a Calgary newspaper that the late exhibitions were honoured by a flying visit of about 50 of the International Council of Women and that these women were fortunate in arriving at the show ground just when the squaw race was starting \"and down to the ring the delegates went and saw their less intellectual but perhaps more athletic and unconventionally dressed sisters doing the bareback act\". It is further reported that the delegates stated: \"that they thought this about the best thing they had seen since they came west.\" These delegates did not see the moving pictures or they would, doubtless, have been more highly pleased with their western trip and known more of what is being done to please and edify the public. I saw the pictures referred to and one picture which appeared to please the public most was: a teepee in the background and an entirely naked Indian youth in the foreground and another whose only attire was a very short shirt. The chief attraction now at most exhibitions appears to be a great number of Indians and the more uncivilized they appear at these exhibitions the more they please the public and more is the honour bestowed upon the missionaries who enticed the Indians from their homes and their work to take prominent parts in such entertainments. The Blackfeet Indians took a prominent part in the parades, etc., at the late Calgary exhibition and while I do not know personally of\nthe aftermath of this recent tramp to the Calgary exhibition I am persuaded, however, that when the Blackfeet returned to their homes, if they have all yet returned, that they came much poorer, financially and morally, and in short, debauched, less tractable and several degrees lower in man and woman-hood than when they went. If you ask the Agent to report as to his opinions regarding the outcome of like jaunts of the Blackfeet I feel sure the Agent will confirm all I have stated herein.\n\nIt is now high time, in my opinion, to decide on the future line of action as regards the Indian work. If you still desire to try and place the Indians upon higher planes of living some action must be taken to curb the doings of some of the so called patriarch missionaries when they set about coaxing the Indians away from home and work, otherwise, I think, the good intentions expressed in your printed circular will result in little good and a waste of a good deal of money.\n\nIf the show business is to be followed up then I suggest that farming, gardening, etc., be discontinued and sufficient energy put into it to make it far more successful than it has been in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) J. A. Markle,\nInsp.\nThey all recognize the difficulties in the way of the Day Schools. They have to get out to make a living, which means the whole family going along on their hunting trips, as it would be impossible, in most cases, to leave their families on the reserves, while they are hunting, as the women and children must be where the provision is, and that is where the hunters are. The Indians, with hardly an exception, recognize the benefits of education, and would like to leave their children of school age safe, while they are away hunting, if it could be done.\n\nIn the event of the Department deciding to establish a number of Boarding Schools, it would not follow that all the day schools could be done away with, and more especially on such Agencies as the Manitowapah, and the Pas, where the most of the reserves are a long way from where the Agent resides. In Portage La Prairie and Birtle Agencies, the Agent is fairly close, and within call of all the reserves, by phone or otherwise, but on the Manitowapah and Pas Agencies the Agent has to rely almost altogether on the school teachers to keep things straight in all small matters, and in most cases, dispense the medicines.\n\nI have been at all the Boarding Schools in my Inspectorate during this season, except the Portage La Prairie, and they are all doing a grand work, and I have only words of commendation for those I have visited, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, and would like with the Indians, to see the system extended.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThere is a great demand this year from nearly all the bands, for boarding schools, not necessarily on their particular reserves, but near enough so that they could see their children once in a while.\nCRITICISM OF NEW SCHEME\n\nR. V. Sinclair Opposes Archbishop's Views.\n\nPublic Interest in Education not Academic.\n\nIndian School Question Discussed at Length.\n\nEditor Journal\u2014Archbishop Matheson's late statement to the Synod of Rupert's Land that in his opinion the time has arrived when the churches should be relieved of the financial burdens they have voluntarily assumed in their attempt to educate Indians, and that the Dominion should assume those burdens, directs attention to the subject.\n\nHis Grace's view might, or might not, be agreed with, if it were proper to consider the question of the schools. Doubtless however, even in that case, it might be said that the subject of much difference, denominational embarking upon all sorts of unstandardized religious education, was best left to the public to take over and to pay for an educational hotch-potch, rather than to provide schools for the denominations to keep their schools and make the public pay for them.\n\nPublic interest in Indian affairs is not academic. It goes far beyond the question of the schools. Government figures as published at present summarily show anything but a gain. It seems that the public pays some $420,000 a year to educate Indians in Separate schools, while the same amount is paid for white children, and a further large sum for officials to look after the schools and $2000 superintendence down. This staff may consist of well trained educators who believe in modern methods and practice but even so it is very doubtful indeed whether any attempt to educate Indian children apart from the children it is designed to make them resemble will be wise or successful.\n\nIt is impossible to reconcile the proper intention to convert Indians into citizens at the earliest moment possible with the justification for spending many millions of public money in the hope of achieving it with the long cherished ideals of Imperial, Canadian, and American citizenship. It is the teaching of that common sense which is begotten of experience. It is the chief weapon against the tyranny of an Indian Department.\n\nLocal control and criticism have been the keynote of success in common school education, and common schools the best means of common citizenship. It may be unfortunately true that there are localities in which discriminatively \"In the best interests of the whites\" there are no common schools at which Indian children can be comfortably educated without mixing with white children. But it cannot really be best for Indian children to be educated together when it can be avoided, nor to have schools under the control of a distant centre of administration. For this is to train Indian children as units of a separate population, to incite them to a spirit of competition which directly conflict with the only sound idea of assimilation, to make them feel distinctly inferior, trying to extirpate difference and to perpetuate the very things which it is our privilege and duty to try to completely put an end to, and to do this under distant direction is worse than to have local directions. It is to set back indefinitely the day when common citizenship will be attained by Indians.\n\nIt has been said in defence of this illusory founding or continuation of denominational \"Indian schools\" that some treaty agreements make it obligatory to maintain such schools, not missions or boarding schools, but day schools. The true sense of such agreements is that they are not binding but supposing for the moment such an obligation exists, it is to be noticed that the Indian schools of today could possibly be subject to it, and that in other cases, least of all matters where the agreements have not been considered beneficent by officials, politicians or philanthropists they have been entirely overlooked or openly swept away.\n\nGrouping Indians together was said enough to such grouping seemed to be the only, or easiest way out of some difficulty. The difficulties appear when the necessity for grouping passes, as preventing the play of the forces of civilization. It is therefore certainly the height of folly and bad policy is reached in the development of a system of education for the Indian child as a person distinct from ordinary persons within the administration of which the aim is to make an ordinary person out of it. If that mistake could be rectified, it would be done by placing each system under the control of dominating influence in the management of various religious denominations whose views may be that separate education is best to keep the Indian \"child apart from the other children,\" a marked character, whilst the country whose interest is certainly and merely that this should not be done, looks at the bills.\n\nR. V. SINCLAIR.\nIndian Boarding Schools Passing\n\nAnna A. Hawley, Teacher and Nurse on James Smith Reserve Discusses Education.\n\nThe Indians are not a dying race, but a living, increasing and progressive people, in the opinion of Miss Anna A. Hawley, teacher and nurse of St. Joseph's Mission. For a little over a week she has been spending her time in the city. Miss Hawley, who has spent five years among the Indians in the district north of town, and nurse, believes that the change from boarding schools to day schools for the children, which is being made by the government, at this particular time, is a move in the right direction.\n\nThe boarding schools, like the whites' factory system, for several years of school life the children returned to the reserve to live the life of the white man or the Indian. They had no opportunity to make a living when they returned they were at sea, ignorant of the ways of the world, different from those of other people, but the parents and the children had grown fat upon the profits of the Indians' interests.\n\nWith the day school it was known there would be difficulties. One would be the difficulty of getting the Indians to attend school regularly; and the other the difficulty of raising the ideals of the Indians so that during the hours they would be subject to the influence of the school.\n\nBut in many reserves the experiment of the day school has been tried instead of sending out inexperienced teachers, fully qualified teachers are sent out; the Indians are driven to and from school during the winter months, and also during the summer months the year round.\n\nMiss Hawley tells of this experiment on James Smith's reserve, where Miss Hawley teaches. The average attendance during the past year has been one-third higher than the average attendance last year.\n\nIn the reserve there is a church building, a neat mission hall, and a schoolhouse. The present accommodation of more than fifty children, who are attending the school, is inadequate. Next year better accommodations will be necessary.\n\nOn Sunday morning Miss Hawley spoke at a large gathering. The object being, \"Life Among the Crees.\" In the address she pointed out that the government, of the Dominion, has during the past ten years spent more than one thousand per year. In the district north of town there are several hundred Indians living on the reserve. During the past decade, and this in spite of the fact that the Indians are passing through a transition state. They have not yet become completely changed in their mode of life. From a free life, living in peace with nature, with fresh air and fresh meat, they have gone to live on reserves, where they have taken up farming, where they have met new shocks, and where they must live on an artificial diet. It is impossible for the Indians to pass through such a change, and yet the Indians, as a race, as Miss Hawley has, cannot be dying out. They have now passed the turning point, and steadily increasing.\n\nThe James Smith Reserve is situated about thirty miles north of Kintail, which, lest anyone should forget, is situated some six hundred miles northwest of Winnipeg. The reserve is large, and surely there is enough of it, 32,000 acres, in which the Red man may live in peace and contentment as he wishes. The Indians live by hunting, trapping, gathering berries and picking berries. Some of the younger men are employed in the mines, when the spring is calling the white man to sow the seed, it is calling the Red man to sow the seed, and the Red man goes away he goes and there is no harvest for him.\n\nMiss Hawley is known as \"The Medicine Woman\" and while there is some rivalry between her and the Indian Medicine Man, she does not give up, and slowly gaining ground, the Indians are slowly giving up with all the superstitions and conceptions on which they have depended for years. The Indians are in time of illness and are depending more and more on the white man's doctor. However, the Indian Medicine Man does treat a patient who recovers and then refuses to pay. The name of the old faith is restored although in some cases the payment of the doctor is very relentless. In one instance he was known to take the sick man's horse as payment. One day an Indian suddenly appeared at the mission house and asked for Miss Hawley. She related his tale of woe, repeatedly dwelt on the fact that he had never paid, and pleaded with her to help him.\n\nMiss Hawley told many interesting incidents of life on an Indian Mission and so earnest was her plea for the Indians that when the Indians were present, at once signified their willingness to assist in the work.\n\nMiss Hawley intends to visit Yorkton after which she will resume her duties at the mission.\nOttawa, 24th October, 1910.\n\nI desire to present to you and other representatives of the churches interested in Indian education new proposal re increased per capita grants to boarding schools.

Scollard, Sault Ste.

A rumor that there was a difference in the rates paid reached me long ago, but I did not believe there was any foundation for it. Its truth, however, has recently been forced upon me.\n\nI have been told that because the Presbyterian Church authorities agreed to the closing of the Industrial School at Regina, the Department rewarded them by devoting the money that went to that school to the increasing of the per capita grant of their boarding schools and undertaking in addition, to erect a costly boarding school for them at File Hills.\n\nAs I represented the Department some years ago in the examination of the financial condition of the former Industrial school at Regina, I am well aware that its continuance was impossible without a considerable increase in the grant or a constant increase in the debt. I cannot therefore understand how its closing could be regarded as a reason for giving an increased grant to Presbyterian schools, while other schools are kept at the old rate.\nTake the case of the former Industrial School at St. Boniface. Its situation came to be considered as undesirable for an Indian school. The Church offered to take the building and the land (which the late Archbishop Tache has transferred for a nominal consideration to the Government for school purposes) in exchange for three school buildings to be erected at the expense of the Church at Sandy Bay, Fort Alexander and Fort Frances. These three boarding schools are the best equipped of the kind under the control of the Department. In the agreement of exchange the cost was put at a less figure than the actual outlay which was found necessary to incur in order to complete and modernly equip them. The per capita grant of the St. Boniface school was simply divided among the Boarding Schools at the rate of $72.00 per capita.\n\nNor it seems to me that if the closing of the Regina Industrial School is the reason for the increased grant, for Presbyterian Boarding Schools, the closing of St. Boniface Industrial School affords a stronger reason for an increased grant to Catholic Boarding Schools. In the former case, the buildings are left on the hands of the Government, whereas in the latter case, three fine buildings have been transferred to the Government in exchange for the St. Boniface building, while, if I am correctly informed, a costly school building is to be erected at the public expense for an Indian Boarding School to be conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church.\nMay I ask why, if I am correctly informed, there is this difference in the treatment of the schools of the two denominations? I ask the question because I am unable to give a satisfactory reply to enquiries made by conductors of Catholic Schools in respect to what they regard as a discrimination against them.\n\nI may say that I regard $78.00 per capita as quite inadequate for boarding schools. My experience teaches me that all properly conducted boarding schools should be paid $100.00 per annum per capita.\n\nSt. Michael's School at Duck Lake is paid $100.00 per capita. This school however, does a higher class of work than is done by the regular boarding schools. In fact, it might fairly be classed as an Industrial. The grant of $100.00 was allowed it on that account, and, therefore in advancing rates paid boarding schools its grant should be proportionately increased.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.R.C.I.S.\nYesterday morning a Conference took place in the office of the Honourable Frank Oliver, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, on the subject of Indian boarding schools receiving Government aid. Mr. Oliver had requested the attendance of those who have more immediate control and direction of Indian Boarding Schools throughout Canada and his invitation met with ready response.\n\nThere were present at yesterday morning's meeting:\n\nRepresenting the Anglican Church:\n- Most Rev. S. P. Matheson, Archbishop of Rupert's Land, Primate of All Canada,\n- Rt. Reverend G. Thorneley, Bishop of Algoma,\n- Rt. Reverend J. G. Anderson, Chaplain, Bishop of Moose Jaw,\n- Archdeacon Tins of Calgary, representing the Bishop of Calgary,\n- Rev. Archdeacon McKay, Prince Albert, representing the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nRepresenting the Roman Catholic Church:\n- Rt. Reverend G. Breynat, Bishop of Mackenzie River,\n- Rt. Reverend G. Charlebois, Kewatin, representing Bishop Legal of St. Albert,\n- Rt. Reverend D. J. Collard, North Bay, Bishop of Sainte Marie,\n- Reverend Father Poitras, Winnipeg,\n- Reverend Father Magan, Winnipeg,\n- Reverend Father Gueret, Procurator General, Ottawa,\n- Reverend Father Gabillon, representing Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert,\n- Reverend Gabriel Belanger, Wikwemikong.\n\nRepresenting the Methodist Church:\n- Reverend Dr. T. H. E. Shore, Superintendent Missions,\n- Reverend T. Perrier, Brandon, Man.\n\nRepresenting the Presbyterian Church:\n- Hamilton Cassels, K.C., Toronto, Ontario,\n- Reverend J. H. Turnbull, Ottawa.\n\nThe Minister laid before the delegates his views on the subject of the present position of Indian Boarding Schools, their usefulness as a factor in Indian education and the present uncertainty...\ncondition of their relations with the Government. He stated that while in his opinion the boarding schools situated on or near reserves were the more valued factor in educating the Indians, the relations of these schools with the Government had always been indeterminate. He found that while in some few cases the buildings had been erected by the Department, in the large majority of cases these had been erected by the Churches as missionary enterprises in the early days of the country's settlement and the Government had been called upon from time to time, as the needs of the case demanded, to improve these properties to render the schools more efficient.\n\nHis present desire was to make an arrangement with the Church authorities whereby the whole conduct and management of these schools would be covered by a contract between the Government and the Churches whereby the responsibilities of each to the other would be definitely fixed, and that the financial straits in which the churches found themselves owing to the general increased cost of living and the extraordinary demands made upon their finances on account of the expansion of evangelical work in the western country owing to its rapid settlement would in a measure be relieved by the Government.\n\nA most interesting discussion ensued in which the Minister's proposals were carefully considered by the Church Dignitaries present, from the various points of view, denominational and otherwise, and after full consideration and some slight amendment it was unanimously decided to adopt Mr. Oliver's suggestions as meeting all reasonable demands for the purposes of these schools for several years to come.\n\nThe schools are to be classed geographically in three divisions, Eastern, Western and Northern, and again into three classes representing the ownership and general character of the buildings in which the schools are carried on. The grants for the Eastern Division are to be from $60.00 to $100.00 per capita per annum; in the Western Division from $100.00 to $125.00 and in the Northern Division they will\nwill be one rate, viz:- $125.00. The grants are, therefore, increased from $60.00 to $75.00 to the new scale of payment.\n\nBefore qualifying for payment under the new system the school authorities are required to sign a contract with the Government. The contract is to limit the number of pupils in residence so as to prevent overcrowding, to provide for medical examination of the children to be admitted, give the Government control over the staff and other conditions which provide for general improvement. The contract also provides for improvements in existing buildings which will bring them up to a particular standard.\n\nArchbishop Matheson moved a vote of thanks to Mr. Oliver for the opportunity he had given them for such a free discussion of the whole subject of Indian education and the liberal treatment which had been accorded the different churches with such an open acknowledgment of their efforts to educate and uplift the aborigines in the country. Archbishop Matheson's remarks were concurred in by all and the meeting closed with a general expression of approval.\nMORE GOVERNMENT AID.\n\nINCREASED GRANTS TO INDIAN BOARDING-SCHOOLS.\n\nSchool Authorities Will be Required to Sign a Contract With the Government \u2014 Hon. Frank Oliver's Proposal Meets With Approval.\n\n(Special Dispatch to The Globe.)\n\nOTTAWA, Nov. 3.\u2014An important conference was held today in the office of Hon. Frank Oliver, Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs, on the subject of Indian boarding schools receiving Government aid. Mr. Oliver had called together the school authorities who have the more immediate control and direction of Indian boarding schools, and the conference, which was an invitation met with a ready response.\n\nThere were present the conference representatives of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches.\n\nThe question laid before the delegates was his views on the subject of the present position of Indian boarding schools, the future needs of Indian education, and the present unsatisfactory financial conditions of their relations with the Government. He stated that while, in his opinion, the boarding schools had been a great service, they had not been the more valued factor in education. The question was raised whether these schools with the Government had been a success or failure. He found that, while the schools had been built by the government, the buildings had been erected by the government, and the schools had been built by the Church. The schools had been built at the early days of the country's settlement, and the government had been asked to meet the first cost. The needs of the case demanded, to improve the efficiency of the Indian schools more efficient.\n\nHis proposal was to make an arrangement with the Church authorities whereby the whole conduct and management of these schools would be covered by a contract between the government and the Churches, with the responsibility of such a contract being placed upon the financial straits in which the Churches found themselves owing to the general increase costs. It was suggested that extraordinary demands made upon their finances should be met by the Church of evangelical work in the western countries, where the rapid settlement would, in a measure, be relieved by the Government.\n\nThe proposals were carefully considered by the Church representatives from all points of view, denominational and otherwise, and after full consideration and some slight modification, it was unanimously decided to adopt Mr. Oliver's proposal, and to make reasonable demands for the purposes of the schools for several years to come.\n\nThe schools are to be classified geographically in three divisions\u2014eastern, central, and northern\u2014and again into three classes, representing the ownership and general character of the institutions in which the schools are carried on. The grants for the eastern division are to be from $100 to $150; capital from $100 to $125; and the grants for the division there will be one rate\u2014namely, $115. The grants for the central division will be $460 to $72 in the new scale of payment.\n\nBefore qualifying for payment under the new system, the school authorities must enter into a contract with the Government. The contract provides for the number of pupils in residence so as to prevent overcrowding, provide for medical examination, provide for the school building (if needed), and give the Government control over the school. The contract also provides for general improvements, and the contract also provides for improvements in educational equipment which will bring them up to a par with other schools.\n\nThe conference closed with a general expression of thanks to Mr. Oliver for the opportunity he had given for a free discussion of the question of Indian education, and for the liberal treatment extended to those interested in the different churches.\nINDIAN SCHOOLS ARE RE-CLASSED\n\nIncreased Government Aid and Control.\n\nResult of Conference With Church Bodies.\n\nMedical Examination and no Overcrowding.\n\nOn Tuesday a conference took place in the office of the Honorable Frank Oliver, superintendent general of Indian affairs, on the subject of Indian boarding schools and increasing government aid. Mr. Oliver had requested the attendance of those who have more immediate control or supervision of Indian boarding schools throughout Canada and his invitation met with ready response, representatives of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Methodist and Presbyterian churches being present.\n\nAfter an interesting discussion an arrangement was made whereby the future the schools are to be classified geographically in three divisions, eastern, western and northern, and again into three classes representing the ownership and general character of the institutions which the schools are carried on. The grants for the eastern division are to be from $85 to $100 per capita, the amounts in the western division from $100 to $125, and in the northern division there will be one rate, viz., $125. The grants are, therefore, increased from $60 to $75 to $90 per capita payment.\n\nBefore qualifying for payment under the new system the school authorities must sign a contract with the government. The contract is to limit the number of pupils in residence, prevent overcrowding, to provide for medical examination of the children to be admitted, give the government control over the staff and other conditions which promise for general improvement. The contract also provides for improvements in existing buildings which will bring them up to a particular standard.\nOttawa, 17th November, 1910.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith I beg to enclose a memorandum of information relating to Indian boarding schools and draft of contract which it is proposed that the authorities responsible for the maintenance and conduct of Indian boarding schools shall become a party to in order to entitle such schools to Government aid.\n\nThe memorandum and draft contract in question are the result of a conference held in Ottawa on the 5th of November, at which were present the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, The Superintendent of Indian Education, and the following gentlemen representing the several religious bodies in Canada especially interested in Indian education:\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Government\nThe circumstances which led to the conference may be briefly outlined.\n\nWhen Indian education was taken up seriously in Western Canada in the eighties the policy of the Government was to establish Industrial schools, erected at the cost of the Government, to be conducted under the auspices of the several religious bodies interested, the Government contributing to the maintenance of the schools a fixed sum per head. In pursuance of what was then believed to be sound policy these schools were, generally speaking, located at points distant from the Indian reserves, and for this reason there was frequently considerable difficulty in securing a sufficient attendance of Indian pupils to earn the grant adequate for their upkeep.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of the Indian children who could not for one reason or another be provided for in the Industrial schools already mentioned, from time to time boarding schools were established on a number of reserves at the charge of the various religious bodies. It was a foundation principle in the case of the Industrial schools that the Government erected the building at Government\nGovernment cost, while in the case of the boarding schools the church erected the buildings at the cost of the church. In recognition of the efforts towards Indian education by the erection of these boarding schools, and to substantially assist the churches in their work, a grant per head was made by the Government towards their support.\n\nAs time went on it became more and more apparent that the boarding schools were filling a want that the Industrial schools had not filled, and for this reason instead of the number of industrial schools having been increased the number of boarding schools has been increased. With this increase in the number of boarding schools the burden for their support upon the various churches has correspondingly increased; and as the buildings which were erected in the first place by the churches have required repair or enlargement the Government has, from time to time, and in many cases, been called upon to provide these enlargements, improvements and repairs. Besides, there have been occasions when the difference between the contribution of the Government and the actual cost of the school was greater than the church interested in the school felt\nfelt itself able to provide, and the Government was called upon to meet the deficit. This was not a desirable condition from the point of view either of the church or of the Government. If there had been a prospect of these conditions being grown out of there might not have been a need of change, but all reports tended to show that so far from the probability being that this condition would be grown out of it seemed to be grown into more and more deeply year by year. Realizing the importance of the educational work being done by the boarding schools and the serious burden that the support of these schools is upon the various churches interested in them the Government concluded and the conference agreed that it would be wise to substantially increase the grant per head to boarding schools conducted under church auspices, but in doing this it was necessary that the unbusinesslike lack of arrangement whereby the Government repaired and added to mission buildings and met deficits in mission management should cease.\n\nThe draft of the contract embodies the conditions upon which the increased grant will be paid. These conditions require that the school buildings\nbuildings shall be sanitary and that the school management shall be such as will conduce to the physical, moral and mental well-being of the children. Differences in the amount of the grant are made by reason of differences in conditions which bear upon the cost and up-keep. It is assumed that in the eastern division the cost of up-keep is less than in the western division, and that in the northern division the cost is still higher, and that there is no possibility of supplying the modern construction and appliances. The difference between the minimum and maximum grants in the eastern and western divisions is to give the church the benefit by an increased grant of the capital expenditure which it makes in the erection of a first class building. It is recognized that the standard of comfort and sanitation is much higher today than it was twenty years ago, and that the condition of the Indian children with them should have the benefit of the most improved sanitary conditions. Therefore the maximum grant is given where the church erects a building at its own cost that will meet the most modern conditions. The minimum grant is given where the buildings erected by the church...\nchurch do not provide modern conditions. In case the Government erects a building it is intended that it shall conform in all respects to modern ideas, but in that case the capital charge having been borne by the Government the church can only receive the minimum grant.\n\nThe Government is willing to spend a moderate amount from year to year in establishing new and modern buildings, but it does not undertake to furnish modern buildings in all cases where they are required within a short space of time. The churches interested have the option of erecting a first class building and thereby securing a maximum grant, or of erecting or continuing a second class building and receiving the minimum grant, or as a third choice, awaiting the time when it will be possible for the Government to erect the building, in which case they will also receive the minimum grant.\n\nIn the case of buildings now in existence it is to be understood that they must conform to the minimum requirement as set out in the accompanying memorandum, and in accordance with the terms of the draft contract when completed or they cannot\nIn case a building owned by the \ngovernment will not be paid \nfor any reason, they are unable \nto make the contract and \ntherefore cannot receive any grant. \n\nFor the present, after \nsigning of the contract, grants will be paid to \nschools according to the schedule herewith until \nby thorough inspection or by improvements made it \nhas been shown that these schools are entitled to \nbe placed in a different class. If after due \nnotice any school does not conform to the \nterms of the contract and of the memorandum of \nclassification it will not be entitled to receive \nany grant. \n\nIn case it is desired to establish \nnew schools it is to be thoroughly understood by \nall concerned that unless the Department is consul-\nted in regard to the proposed establishment of any \nschool and a decision favourable to such establish-\nment has been given the church establishing such \nschool has no claim under the arrangement made. \n\nThe funds available to meet the obligations of the \nGovernment under the arrangement are provided by \nParliament from year to year, and provision cannot \nbe made for the support of any school until the \namount necessary has been voted by Parliament. \n\nAs it is contemplated under the arrangements that \nthe Government shall pay a much larger proportion \nof the total cost of Indian education in building \nschools than before it is thereby compelled to as-\nassume a proportionately larger measure of responsibility as to the conduct of those schools, especially in the matter of the accommodation which they give and the bearing which their conditions have upon the health of the pupils.\n\nIt is hoped that the arrangement arrived at amicably and unanimously will result in improved relations between the Department and the religious bodies interested in Indian education, and as well will result in benefit to the physical condition and the intellectual advancement of the Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nEstimates ..........1911-1912.\n\nINDIAN EDUCATION SUBJECT TO REVISION\n\nWESTERN DIVISION\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nClass \"C\".\nSecond Class Buildings owned by the Church.\n\n| School          | Denomination | No. of Pupils | Rate   | Per capita grant 1911-1912 |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------|--------|---------------------------|\n| Ahousaht        | Presb.       | 25            | $100 p.c. | $2,500.00                 |\n| Alberni         |              | 50            | $100 p.c. | 5,000.00                  |\n| Pt.

To be built on a stone or cement foundation with a light airy basement of full size of main building with cement floor.\nOttawa, November 23rd., 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to enclose herewith memorandum of information relating to Indian Boarding Schools with a classification of such schools on increased scale of per capita grant, and copy of a contract which must be entered into with the Government for the conduct of such schools. As you will observe by a perusal of these papers the payment of an increased per capita grant is contingent upon the condition of the buildings in which the schools are operated. I have, therefore, to request that you will, with as little delay as possible, inspect the buildings of the Boarding Schools within your district and report whether they conform to the specifications laid down. The specifications of school buildings in Class \"A\" are given with sufficient definiteness in the eight clauses in the memorandum. School buildings owned by the Government should, of course, conform to these specifications. Buildings owned by the Churches which will entitle the management to a grant of $100 should be sanitary, in a good state of repair, and conform to clauses 5, 6 and 8 of the specifications, that is\u2014\n\n5. Hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils \"ill with infectious disease or tuberculosis.\"\n\n6. Modern system of ventilation in dormitories and \"class rooms and sufficient air space in dormitories and class rooms for the number of pupils accommodated.\"\n\n8. Sufficient area of land for farms and gardens and \"practical industrial work.\"\n\nYou will readily understand what is required for Hospital accommodation. Two or three rooms in the main building or in a separate building should be available for this service, and they\nshould be so situated as to provide isolation for special cases of illness. They should have if possible a southern exposure and should be well lighted and properly ventilated.\n\nThe dormitories and class rooms should be measured to ascertain the air and floor space for pupils. You will see by the memorandum that at least 500 cubic feet for each child should be available in the dormitories and 350 cubic feet for each pupil in the class rooms.\n\nA modern system of ventilation is called for, that is, the foul air must be taken from the floor of the rooms through a heated chimney stack or in some other effective way and arrangements must be made for the entrance of fresh air.\n\nThe provision of sufficient areas for farms and gardens only applies where agricultural work can be conducted; on reserves where the Indians can support themselves by farming, both farming and gardening should be taught at the school.\n\nAfter carefully considering the needs of each building you should report what changes it will be necessary for the Churches interested, or the Department, to carry out in order to improve the buildings, make them uniform and equal to the standard specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Turnbull, Ottawa,\n\nThe circumstances which led to the conference may be briefly outlined.\n\nWhen Indian education was taken up seriously in Western Canada in the eighties the policy of the Government was to establish Industrial Schools, erected at the cost of the Government, to be conducted under the auspices of the several religious bodies interested; the Government contributing to the maintenance of the schools a fixed sum per head. In pursuance of what was then believed to be sound policy these schools were generally speaking, located at points distant from reserves and...\nand for this reason there was frequently considerable difficulty in securing a sufficient attendance of Indian pupils to earn the grant adequate for their upkeep.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of the Indian children who could not for one reason or another be provided for in the Industrial schools already mentioned, from time to time boarding schools were established on a number of reserves at the charge of the various religious bodies. It was a foundation principle in the case of the Industrial schools that the Government erected the buildings at Government cost, while in the case of the boarding schools the Church erected the buildings at the cost of the Church. In recognition of the efforts towards Indian education by the erection of these boarding schools, and to substantially assist the Churches in their work, a grant per head was made by the Government towards their support.\n\nAs time went on it became more and more apparent that the Boarding schools were filling a want that the Industrial schools had not filled, and for this reason instead of the number of Industrial schools having been increased the number of boarding schools has been increased. With this increase in the number of boarding schools the burden of their support upon the various Churches has correspondingly increased, and as the buildings which were erected in the first place by the Churches have required repair or enlargement the Government has from time to time, and in many cases, been called upon to provide these enlargements, improvements and repairs. Besides, there have been occasions when the difference between the contribution of the Government and the actual cost of maintaining the school was greater than the Church interested in the school felt itself able to provide, and the Government was called upon to meet the deficit.\n\nThis was not a desirable condition from the point of view either of the Church or of the Government. If there had been a prospect of these conditions being improved there might not have been need of change, but all reports tended to show that far from the probability that this condition would improve it was\nwas likely to become aggravated year by year. Realizing the importance of the educational work being done by the boarding schools and the serious burden that the support of these schools is upon the various Churches interested in them the Government concluded and the conference agreed that it would be wise to substantially increase the grant per head to boarding schools conducted under Church auspices, but in doing this it was necessary that the unbusinesslike lack of arrangement whereby the Government repaired and added to mission buildings and met deficiencies in mission management should cease.\n\nThe draft of the contract embodies the conditions upon which the increased grant will be paid. These conditions require that the school buildings shall be sanitary and that the school management shall be such as will conduce to the physical, moral and mental well-being of the children. Differences in the amount of the grant to different schools are caused by reason of differences in conditions which bear upon the cost and upkeep. It is assumed that in the Eastern division the cost of upkeep is less than in the Western division, and that in the Northern division, the cost is still higher, and that there is no practical possibility of supplying modern construction and appliances in the Northern Division. The difference between the minimum and maximum grants in Eastern and Western divisions is made to give the Church the benefit by an increased grant of the capital expenditure which it makes in the erection of a first class building. It is recognized that the standard of comfort and sanitation is much higher today than it was twenty years ago, and that the condition of the Indian children is such that they should have the benefit of the best sanitary improvements. Therefore the maximum grant is given where the Church erects a building at its own cost that will meet specified modern conditions. The minimum grant is given where the buildings erected by the Church do not provide modern improvements. In case the Government erects a building it is intended that it shall conform in all respects to modern ideas, but in that case the capital charge having been borne by the Government the\nthe Church can only receive the minimum grant.\n\nThe Government is willing to a moderate amount from year to year in establishing new and modern buildings, but it does not undertake to furnish modern buildings in all cases where they are required within a short space of time. The Churches interested have the option of erecting a first class building and thereby securing a maximum grant, or of erecting or continuing a second class building and receiving the minimum grant, or as a third choice, awaiting the time when it will be possible for the Government to erect the building, in which case they will also receive the minimum grant.\n\nIn the case of buildings now in existence and the property of any Church it is to be understood that they must be made to conform to the minimum requirement as set out in the accompanying memorandum, and in accordance with the terms of the draft contract at the cost of the Church or they cannot receive any grant. In case of buildings owned by the Government improvements will not be paid for unless they are made by the Government; that is unless the contract is signed and lived up to no grant will be paid.\n\nFor the present after signing the contract, grants will be paid to schools according to the schedule herewith beginning on the 1st. of April, 1911, until it has been shown that these schools are entitled by reason of improvements to be placed in a different class. If after due notice any school does not conform to the terms of the contract and of the memorandum of classification it will not be entitled to receive any grant.\n\nIn case it is desired to establish new schools it is to be thoroughly understood by all concerned that unless the Department is consulted in regard to the proposed establishment of any school and until a decision favourable to such establishment has been given, the Church establishing such a school has no claim under the arrangement made. The funds available to meet the obligations of the Government under the arrangement are\nprovided by Parliament from year to year, and provision cannot be made for the support of any school until the amount necessary has been voted by Parliament.\n\nAs it is contemplated under the arrangements that the Government shall pay a much larger proportion of the total cost of Indian education than before it is thereby compelled to assume a proportionately larger measure of responsibility as to the conduct of those schools, especially in the matter of the accommodation which they give and the bearing which their conditions have upon the health of the pupils.\n\nThe Inspectors of the Department are being instructed to immediately examine the school buildings in their districts with a view to ascertain whether the classification of the schools shown in the schedule is correct. When their report shows that the school buildings entitle the management to payment of the new grant a form of contract will be forwarded for signature. When the Inspector finds that certain improvements have to be made the management will be notified and upon the completion of the improvements and after they are approved by the Inspector, a contract will be forwarded for signature.\n\nEach Contract is to be signed by the Bishop of the Diocese in which the school is situated or when the Church has not Episcopal organization, by the officer empowered by the Church to sign the contract.\n\nIt is hoped that the arrangement arrived at amicably and unanimously will result in improved relations between the Department and the religious bodies interested in Indian education, and, as well, will result in benefit to the physical condition and the intellectual and industrial advancement of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, Dec. 9th., 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to letter of the 28th. ultimo addressed to you on the question of Indian Boarding Schools I have to inform you that Clause 3 of the draft Contract enclosed therein has been amended to read as follows:\n\n\"III.

I refer to the clauses 5, 6 and 8 of your letter.\n\nI should be pleased if you would write me a letter on Industrial Schools, showing what obligation the Department is under in connection with them outside of the equipment for educational purposes.\n\nAs you will note by the accompanying reports on the Yale and Mission City schools, I was not in a position to give the information required by the Department as to the amount of air space required for each pupil and the system of ventilation, owing to the fact that I did not receive your letter till after my return to this city.\n\nI will give all the Boarding Schools in my inspectorate the necessary inspection early in the coming month.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, December 31, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have a full report from you on the boarding schools in your Inspectorate in accordance with the circular letter sent you on the 23rd ultimo, but for the sake of convenience I would ask that you do not refer to the reports which have lately come to hand on the Yale and St. Mary's Mission schools, as the Department wishes to have all the data as called for in the letter above referred to in one communication and on one file.\n\nIn cases where repairs have to be made to industrial school buildings, the practice is for the Government to furnish material and the management to perform the necessary labour unless where skilled workmen are required, in which cases the Department bears the cost. All charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses are paid out of the per capita grant. The schools of course have to be kept up to a certain standard of instruction, dietary, comfort, etc., although no hard and fast rules in this respect have ever been laid down. In the case of industrial schools which are the property of the Church the Department is under no obligation to make repairs, etc., but nevertheless assistance is sometimes given in the way of grants towards repainting, new buildings, etc., but each application of this kind\n\nV. E. Bitchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\n2.\n\nis considered on its merits. The Department supplies necessary equipment in the class-rooms of all these schools. Trusting that this information will be satisfactory,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the re-organization of schools, I beg to bring the following matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nI notice in Clause 15 of the Contract, it is expressly stated that there is to be one month's holidays taken between the first of July and the first of October, unless some other course is expressly sanctioned by the Department. I beg to point out that at the Industrial school, the Qu'Appelle File Hills Boarding school and in fact, almost all the schools in this district, it has been the custom to let all the children go home for ten days or two weeks at Christmas time. If this practice is to be discontinued, I think Principals should be specially notified, as the parents should be informed of the Department's ruling on the matter.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it is your intention to allow the practice to be continued, I think it would be wise to have these additional holidays stipulated in the contract. I would point out that it would have a bad effect to allow one school to let the children\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nchildren go home at Christmas, and to insist on others keeping them at school. Personally I think the children should be allowed to go home at this time, and it will be a great disappointment to the parents if this permission is not granted.\n\nThere is another very important matter upon which I should like your ruling. In the past there have been cases where children have been taken into Boarding and Industrial schools, and kept there for weeks and some times for months, before being brought before the Doctor for Medical examination. The reason for this is that sometimes the children are unhealthy, and it is felt they would not pass the examination at the time, or the children are under school age. It seems to me, and I know this is the Department's desire also, that none but perfectly healthy children should be admitted to schools, but I am sorry to say this intention is not always carried out, and as a result the supposedly healthy children, already in school, are exposed to disease. There is a tendency on the part of some Principals to take children into school, no matter how unhealthy, in the hope that good food and warm clothing will effect a cure, and I am afraid these Principals to not also realize the danger to which they are exposing the children already admitted to the institution, when they allow these new comers to mingle.\nmingle and sleep with them. For as you know, Indian children are very susceptible to Tuberculosis. I think the Department should issue strict instructions to all Principals that they are not to take children into schools for a longer period than two days before having them examined by a Doctor.\n\nI think it would be a good idea if doctors were specially instructed that they must be most particular in the examination of children applying for admission to schools, and on no account to admit those with tubercular tendencies. I am perfectly aware that doctors are supposed to know all this, but sometimes certain influences are brought to bear on them, and they are perhaps more lenient than they otherwise would be, and I think if they were specially warned of the Department's desire on this point, there would be fewer unhealthy children admitted. I think also it would be an excellent idea if doctors were called upon to make a personal examination of all pupils in the schools under their charge at least once a quarter, for as I said before Indians are very susceptible to pulmonary troubles, and cannot be too closely watched, and the effect of letting two or three cases get into advanced stages would be very serious. Indian children are not like Whites and in a school of some two hundred and fifty pupils\npupils, it is necessary to be on the watch all the time. We have paid Medical Officers and I think we should expect efficient service, and I am sure if they knew what was expected of them by the Department they would gladly do it.\n\nI think that in order to get good results and in the interests of discipline, the Department should have more control of the Staff, especially Principals of schools. I do not think it right for the Principal to go away from the school for any length of time without first getting permission from the Department, and such permission should come through the Agent. Of course I do not mean that Principals should not go out recruiting when they see fit, but I refer to cases where they go away to attend to matters that have nothing whatever to do with their schools. It was formerly the practice for Principals, when leaving for a holiday to first obtain the permission of the Department, but of late this practice has been discontinued. During the last few years I think there has been far too much time spent by Principals away from their schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAspr. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in which you dealt with several matters pertaining to the proposed contract to be entered into between the Department and the Church authorities for the management of Boarding schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say in reference to the holidays to be granted at Christmas time that this is a special matter and each case will be dealt with individually.\n\nYour remarks in reference to medical examination of pupils are noted and the Department quite agrees with you that careful examination by physicians attached to the schools is necessary. If these officers answer honestly the questions asked on the application forms and adhere to the instructions given thereon none but children in good health would be admitted to any of these schools.\n\nIn reference to the holidays taken by Principals of schools I may say that it is the custom of these officers to obtain the sanction of the Department before obtaining extended leave. If there are cases where this is not done the Department would be pleased to have information to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\nTo the Secretary,\nIndian Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nSt-Albert, Alta., Feb. 18, 1911\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the new plan devised upon for the running of the Indian Boarding Schools, as stated in the official letter of the 25th of November 1910, and the accompanying Memorandum, although, in the main, I do not intend to raise any objection, yet I believe that there is some for somewhat in respect of the grant paid to the different grades of schools, as it seems to me that Class (C) is not dealt with proportionally to other classes.\n\nThis class is supposed not to have all the usual modern improvements, and no doubt, the management will have to try gradually to introduce these improvements, and of course, there shall be always some provision from the Government, to that end, but yet for such schools the grant shall be exactly the same as for Class (B). Where these improvements have been all supplied by the Department, in my opinion, if the grant to Class (B) be $100, the grant to Class (C) should be proportionately about $112.50 something between Class (A) & (B).\n\nOn the other hand these buildings being located on Indian ground, it is not to be expected, in a general sale, that the Church will consent to spend large sums of money on buildings which are not on their own ground. Could it be possible to have in full ownership, some portion of\nground in this British Reserve, the case would be different.\n\nBut I doubt very much that this could be possible.\n\nHowever, for the ensuing year at least, there is no chance of introducing any alteration in the new regulations; but I would like that the notice should be given of my remarks for the following year.\n\nIn the meantime, I express my willingness to sign the proposed Contract, so far as I am called to do so.\n\nAnd I have the honour to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I beg to take exception to the statement found in the official letter of the 1st of Nov., last referred to above, that \"the time will soon be become more and more apparent that the Boarding schools were failing a want that the Industrial schools had not filled.\" In my opinion, the establishment of Boarding Schools on the Reserve, has been a mistake from the start, and it is what has most injured the Industrial schools. For we are now compelled by force of circumstances against our own judgment to establish these schools. The work of educating and civilizing the Indians is now easily and more quickly done in the Industrial schools removed from the Reserve, and where all the work is done through in every way. Boarding schools will never turn out an educated Indian as the Separate school and even Dunlop have done.\n\n[Signature]\nINCREASED GRANT TO INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nSystem of Giving Assistance to Church Schools More Businesslike\n\nAn agreement regarding the maintenance of Indian boarding schools has been unanimously arrived at between the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa and the four churches engaged in educational work among the Indians of Canada.\n\nAccording to the estimates submitted under the new arrangement the government appropriates $25,000 towards the maintenance of the boarding schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist, Presbyterian, Anglican, and Roman Catholic churches in Canada, including the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia.\n\n\"Realising the importance of the educational work being done by the churches in connection with the missions, and the fact that the support of these schools is upon the various churches,\" reads the statement.\n\nThe government concluded, and the conference agreed, that it would be wise to substantially increase the grant per head to boarding schools conducted under church auspices, but not doing so would result in the undesirable lack of arrangement whereby the government repaired and added to dilapidated buildings and desirable schools should cease.\"\n\nThe draft of the contract embodies the conditions upon which the increased grant will be paid. These conditions are that the school buildings shall be sanitary and that the school management shall be such as will contribute to the welfare and well-being of the children. It is recognised that the standard of education is much higher today than it was twenty years ago, and that the children attending the schools should have the benefit of the best sanitary improvements. Therefore, the church undertakes to erect a building at its own cost that will meet specific requirements.\n\nThe increased grant is given where the buildings erected by the church do not meet the new requirements. It means the government erects a building it is intended that it shall be used for the purpose to which it is put; but in that case the capital charge having been borne by the government, the church will receive the minimum grant.\n\nThe purpose of deciding upon a proper ecological division of the boarding schools to receive the maximum and minimum of the new scale of pay.\n\nBy the terms of the contract the churches undertake: \"To provide at the said school premises and thereon facilities to give the pupils religious instruction at proper times; to instruct them in the duties of the farm and care of stock, or such other industries as are suitable to their local requirements; to instruct the female pupils in cooking, laundry work, needlework, sewing, knitting, etc., and any other work where such dairy work can be carried on; to teach all the pupils in reading, writing, arithmetic, and other education; to teach calisthenics, physical drill and fire drill; to teach the effects of alcohol and tobacco, the advantages of the healthy system, and how to live in a healthy manner; to instruct the pupils in the duties and privileges of British citizenship, especially the principles of the government of Canada, and to train them in such knowledge of the laws of Canada as will inspire them with respect and affection for our country and its laws.\"\n\nBy the application, the Roman Catholic church will receive $163,960, the Anglican church $148,760, the Presbyterian church $54,290, and the Methodist $23,560.\n\n(The Indian Department's appropriation for Indian schools this year will be stated above, or $25,000. This is an increase of $100,000, the greater portion of which is the result of the new arrangement.)\n\nIn the Eastern Division the grant to Class A schools was formerly $75 and $80 per pupil. Now it is $100 per capita. In Class B schools the grant was formerly $60 and $70 per capita.\n\nIn the Western Division Class A schools, which formerly drew $60 and $70 per capita under the new arrangement, Class B which also formerly drew $75 and $100 per capita, now draw $100 and $110 per capita. Now the grant is $100 per capita.\n\nIn the Northern Division the new arrangement provides a grant of $75 per capita, which was the old rate, or $100 per capita.\n\nThe grants which it is stated each church will receive are really estimates as the final allotment will secure his share according to the number of pupils in attendance and the manner in which the conditions are carried out.\u2014(See Times.)\nOttawa, May 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is about entering into a contract with the authorities of the different Churches under whose auspices Indian boarding schools are conducted.

July 8th, 1911.\n\nLETTER NO. 676-15\n\nSIR,\n\nSome weeks ago in reply to a request for your information on the subject, I was informed by the Dept. that it was making a new contract with the boarding schools and when it was completed I would be satisfied and finished with a copy.\n\nIn course of time I heard rumors of the new through the various principals of schools and in January last Mr. Inspector Bichburn had asked inspecting the schools to see what grant they could get under the new contract. I heard that the new contract came into effect on April 1st. I then wrote and asked the Dept. for a copy of the contract with each school so I would know that the Dept. required from the school, in fact, just what the bargain was. In doing that, as far as it came within my province as an Agent, I could see it carried out and also advise the Inspector as to the meaning and effect of the new rules regarding which they could somewhat at any time.\n\nI am sure the Dept. sent me a blank copy of the contract, which while we did not give any information as to the grants allowed in each school, and no information as to what grant was to be paid. At this time was getting on towards the end of the year when this information was essential. Inspector Bichburn wrote the Dept. early in June asking that a written notification of the amount of the new grant was to be sent to each principal and Agent.\n\nNow so far I have not received this and now the principals are asking me to say what basis they are to make the June report on. All I can tell them is that I have no authority to pass on reports showing any increased grant. One principal told me that his Church has told him that he is to get $100.00 per pupil. I told him to go ahead and make his return on that basis but he replied that he had no schedule showing what amounts would be paid for broken time at that higher rate. I have now\n\nThe Secretary,\nAgent of Indian Affairs, O'Leary.\nadvised the principals to hold their reports back for a week or until the information can be obtained.\n\nI trust the dept. will send me both of the grants in each school and schedule for broken tips as soon as possible and then send me a complete copy of the bargains made with each school.\n\nI have no desire to reach out for more authority (which would prove futile) but I am expected to see that the contracts are carried out and the principals often apply to me for information on the subject or me to the effect & meaning of certain clauses and it is hard to advise them correctly without full information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa July 27, 1911\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the new agreement for the future maintenance and management of Indian boarding schools, entered into between the Department and the representatives of the various churches interested, I beg to inform you that a copy of the correspondence as well as a blank form of the agreement is now being printed in pamphlet form and as soon as received from the printer, you will be furnished with a copy.\n\nThe per capita grants to boarding schools in British Columbia have been increased, from April 1st last, to $100, and the number of pupils provided for in the two schools of this class in your agency is; Alberni 50 pupils and Ahousaht 25 pupils.\n\nThe payment of all quarterly grants to both boarding and industrial schools will, from April 1st, 1911, be computed and paid on the total average attendance of the number of pupils authorized and not on the individual attendance of each pupil, as was the rule prior to this date.\n\nA.W. Heill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nAlberni, B.C.\nThere will therefore be no scale of payment required and it will not be necessary to fill in the column of the quarterly returns, of either the boarding or industrial schools, under the heading \"Amount payable for each pupil.\"\n\nThe grant for the Clayoquot industrial school was increased from April 1st last to provide for 60 pupils at $130.00 per capita.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst.

In pursuance of what was then believed to be sound policy, these schools were, generally speaking, located far distant from Indian reserves, and for this reason there was frequently considerable difficulty in securing a sufficient attendance of Indians who could earn the grant adequate for their upkeep.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of the Indian children who could not for one reason or another be provided for in the industrial schools already mentioned, from time to time boarding schools were established on a number of reserves at the charge of the various religious bodies. It was a foundation principle in the case of the industrial schools that the government erected the buildings at government cost, while in the case of the boarding schools the church erected the buildings at its own cost, and the church. In recognition of the efforts towards Indian education by the erection of these boarding schools, and to substantially assist the churches in their work, a grant per head was made by the government towards their support.\n\nAs time went on, it became more and more apparent that the boarding schools were facing a want that the industrial schools had not filled, and for this reason instead of the number of industrial schools having been increased, the number of boarding schools has been increased. With this increase in the number of boarding schools, the burden of their support upon the various churches has correspondingly increased, and the buildings which were erected in the first place by the churches have required repair or enlargement the government has from time to time, and in many cases, been called upon to provide these enlargements, improvements and repairs. Besides, there have been occasions when the difference between the contribution of the government and the actual cost of maintaining the school was greater than the church interested in the school felt itself able to provide, and the government was called upon to meet the deficit.\n\nThis was not a desirable condition from the point of view either of the church or of the government. If there had been prospect of these conditions being improved, there might not have been need of change, but all reports tended to show that, far from the probability that this condition would improve, it was likely to become aggravated year by year. Realizing the importance of the educational work being done by\nMEMORANDUM REFERRED TO IN THE LETTER OF NOVEMBER 26, 1910.\n\nFor the purpose of dealing upon a proper geographical division of the boarding schools to receive the maximum grant, and shall be divided into Eastern, Northern, and Western divisions. The Eastern division (800 and $850) will include all Ontario except Almonte, Moose Factory, and Cecilia Jeffery schools; the Western division (800 and $850) will include the following schools, which are located 300 miles or more from a railway: I.A., Albany, Moose Factory, Lac la Plage, Lac la Ronge, Whiteside Lake, Lesser Slave Lake, Fort Chipewyan, Lake Waboshow, I.C., Hay River and Fort Providence, The Western division ($800 and $850) to include Alberta and Saskatchewan schools in their entirety, and all other Canadian schools except those in the Eastern division.\n\nThe number of children to be accommodated in each school to be limited by the contract, and floor space in classrooms. In the dormitories the air space must be at least 500 cubic feet for each child. In the classrooms the limit is to be fixed by the number of children to be accommodated in each school, and ventilating systems, and floor space for seats and the air space for pupils, the latter not to exceed 500 cubic feet for each pupil, and the former 16 square feet for each pupil.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS \"A.\"\n\nThe buildings owned by the church, which would entitle the school to a per capita grant of $800 in the Eastern division and $850 in the Western division should conform to the following general specifications:\n\n1. Substantial building, either of brick, stone, cement or wood, in good state of repair.\n\n2. To be built on a stone or cement foundation, with a light airy basement of full size of main building with cement floor.\n\n3. Pure and plentiful water-supply distributed throughout the building.\n\n4. A proper system of sanitary water-closets, drainage and disposal of sewage.\n\n5. Hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils ill with infectious disease or tuberculosis.\n\nAs it is contemplated under the arrangement that the government shall pay a number of representatives a larger amount of responsibility as to the conduct of these schools, especially in the matter of the accommodation which they give it is hoped that the arrangements have been made in a manner which will result in improved relations between the department and the religious bodies interested in Indian education, and will result in an improvement in the physical condition and the intellectual and industrial attainments of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This contract is now being sent to His Lordship, Bishop Pinkham, for his signature and as soon as returned by him a copy will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. George H. Hogbin,\nSecretary\nDiocese of Calgary\nPagan Hall,\nCalgary\nIn the matter of Schools on the Indian Reserve,\n\nI beg to submit my opinion as follows:\n\n\"I think the sooner the School system on the Western Reserves is systemized on the plan of the Provincial Schools among the whites, the better it will be for the Department and for the Indians. I think that those denominational Schools on the Reserves are more of a curse to the Department and the Indians than a benefit, and that the Department should take upon itself the whole responsibility of the education of our Indians.\n\nIn order to do that it will be necessary to conform to the Provincial methods forming Day Schools wherever there are sufficient number of scholars and running them exactly on the same principle as they are run outside the borders of the Indian Reservations. I find the desire among the Indians is for the same treatment with regard to education as the whites receive. I realize before this can be done that it will be necessary to make a specific Treaty or agreement with the Indians of the various Reservations for compulsory attendance of the children at the School, and I believe that this can be done quite easily; in fact believe that in six months I can have every Reservation agree to terms of that kind. These Boarding Schools while they superficially educate our Indians do not teach them self reliance in any way. The Indian youth\nis taken there and is cared for for a term of years like children in a nursery and are practically helpless in a business way when they leave School to take up the battle of life. For that reason I believe our Schools are not doing the service that we should expect from the expenditure. Were the boys and girls taken and apprenticed to trades when they leave the School till such a time as they could get self reliance and get the knowledge of the value of money and their value as a factor in obtaining money, it would be a move in the proper direction. The expenditure with regard to those denominational Boarding Schools is very much greater than is necessary. Take for instance the Old Sun School at Blackfoot run by the English Church, an expenditure is incurred by the Government of what will be at least $50,000.00 under a guarantee from the Church that a certain number of pupils will attend. After the School has been opened several months with a staff of five or six, there are only some eight or ten pupils enrolled with an attendance when I was there of seven. This is absolutely ridiculous and more so when one realizes that other churches will ask for the same consideration as the English Church on the same Reserve. The policy should be changed and as I have already said the whole control of the School system on the Indian Reservation should be centred in the Indian Department and its Officials. I realize the desire of the various Churches to do what they think is a good work, but I think that expenditures such as I have instanced are a heinous waste of public money. The same policy in my mind applies to Hospitals. When the Government has to practically assume the cost, it should also take the responsibility and keep the Schools and hospitals entirely in its own hands. I had an interview with the Indians at Morley, Wood Mountain, Kamsack, Muscowpetung, Pasquah, Piapot's, and other Reserves, and they brought to my attention in all cases their desire to be put on the same plane as the whites outside of the Reserve.\nin the matter of education. I realize the difficulty at first that the Department will have in obtaining the proper teachers for Day Schools but I believe if a sufficient salary is paid and we show our teachers our deep interest in them and their work and we get an agreement with the Indians for compulsory attendance that we will have reached the solution of the problem of Indian Education. After the children go through a Day School Course up to the age of fourteen or sixteen if the churches desire then to give them a higher education that is a matter for the consideration of the churches.\n\nYours &c.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector.\nHonorable Robert Rogers, P.C.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nand\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nReferring to the memorial addressed to you on\nthe 24th ultimo, resulting from the consideration by the Bishops\nat Regina of the contract for the conduct and management and\nmaintenance of Indian Boarding Schools, the undersigned finds\nthat the following was omitted therefrom:\n\nClause 2 (a) provides \"That no child shall be admitt-\ned to the school who is under seven years of age.\"\n\nRegulations respecting the education of Indian\nchildren were made by Order in Council of the 10th November,\n1894, and, in amending those Regulations by Order in Council of\nthe 6th August, 1908, the age of admission of children to school\nwas left at seven years.\n\nThere is nothing to show that any Order in Council has\nsince been made changing the age; and, if none were made fixing\nthe age at seven years, then, it is submitted, the parties to the\ncontract have no power to go beyond the Regulations established\nby Order in Council and fix the age of admission at seven years.\n\nSuch a change is undesirable. The Indians have become\nused to the requirement that the education of their children\nshould begin at six years of age, and it is of the utmost import-\nance that there should be continuity in our educational policy.\nThe change will tend to make the Indians sceptical of the\nwisdom of the department; for they will reason that, if six years\nOf age was found to be too young in November, 1910, in another year or so seven years may be found to be too young, and that gradually the view of the authorities of the department as to education may come into accord with their own.\n\nThe undersigned cannot conceive that any experience gained since August, 1908, has led to the change. The undersigned are not aware that any educational authority of wide repute has recently expressed an opinion that would justify the change. The general tendency is not to advance the years of age at which schooling should begin. And what may be urged in favor of the early schooling of white children has ten-fold force in the case of Indian children, for they must \"be caught young\" to be saved from what is on the whole the degenerating influences of their home environment.\n\nThe change in the age is a serious drawback to the schools, whose managers have, in accordance with the policy in vogue up to the time of the contract, arranged for the admission of, and now have in the schools, children under seven years of age, for whom, under the contract, payment will be refused.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, respectfully ask that Clause 2 (a) be amended by substituting \"six\" for \"seven\".\n\n2. It is essential to the success of the contract system of Indian schools that the Department should pursue, at least, a policy which will not run counter to them. Recent happenings, however, give the impression that, instead of a supporting policy, the Department has entered upon and is pressing a policy which is bound, in the measure of its extension, to make against the success of the contract schools.\n\nUnder your immediate predecessor in office a very\nmarked departure was made in Canada's Indian educational policy. Up to then day schools had not been regarded as sufficient, or, indeed, wholly efficient, agencies of Indian education. It was the proved inadequacy of the day school system that led the Government, under Sir John Macdonald, to provide for the establishment and maintenance of Indian residential schools. As early as 1880 that great statesman wrote:\n\n\"The greatest obstacle to the successful education of Indian children at day schools consists in the irregularity of their attendance, caused in part by the neglect of their parents to oblige them to attend, and by the frequent absence of many families from the reserves while fishing, hunting and berry picking.\"\n\nAnd anyone with more than a perfunctory knowledge of Indian conditions, as they generally obtain today in Western Canada, is aware that the hope of the permanent advancement of the aborigines lies in the education of the children in residential schools, where the ordinary work of day schools can be supplemented by domestic, manual, agricultural, and such like training, and the lack of proper home environment supplied by an atmosphere favorable to moral culture and character building.\n\nIn his report of the 1st January, 1889, the Hon. Edgar Dewdney, then Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and a man who had long, practical experience as Indian commissioner in the west, wrote:\n\n\"The superiority of the boarding over that of the day school system as a means for the enlightenment and elevation, both morally and intellectually, of Indian youth, is, I think, unquestionable. The extension of the same to several of the...\"\nreserves should, in my opinion, be regarded with satisfaction by all who really take an interest in the advancement of the Indian race\".\n\nIn his report of the 13th January, 1891, the same gentleman wrote:\n\n\"It would be highly desirable, if it were practicable, to obtain entire possession of all Indian children after they attain to the age of seven or eight years, and keep them at schools of the industrial type until they had a thorough course of instruction, not only in the ordinary subjects taught at public schools, but in some useful and profitable trade, or in agriculture, as the aptitude of the pupil might indicate he was best fitted for. Were such a course adopted the solution of that problem, designated the Indian question, would probably be effected sooner than it is likely to be under the present system\"...........................................\n\n\"The system of absorption of Indian children by boarding and industrial training schools should be widely extended, and efforts to make the residence therein of Indian children of the proper age to be admitted the rule, and not, as it is at present, the exception, should be unremitting. Apart from other, and obviously more important, advantages of which an extended policy of the kind, if it were systematically pursued, would doubtless be the result, it would certainly be the most economical in the end, as the Indian children trained at such institutions would acquire practical knowledge which would fit them to become useful members of society\".\n\nIn his report of the 31st December, 1894, as Deputy\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs, Mr. Hayter Reed wrote:\n\n\"The extension of educational work is being chiefly carried out in the direction of industrial and semi-industrial institutions, in which the children not only get the positive advantages of instruction superior to what could be given them on the reserves, but are removed from the retarding influences of contact with them\".\n\nViewed in the light of conditions, the results produced by residential schools have been gratifying, no such results could have been produced by day schools. And it may in fairness be said that, if the unremitting efforts recommended by Mr. Dewdney had been persisted in, the results would have been still more gratifying. But it is a regrettable fact that very many officials of the department make no real effort to secure the attendance of Indian children at institutions maintained out of the public revenues for the advancement of the Indians. With the active co-operation of Indian Agents and the members of agency staffs the sphere of usefulness of residential schools could be easily extended.\n\nNot only has such co-operation in recent years been sadly lacking, but a policy has been inaugurated of establishing day schools that seem designed to make more difficult the securing of pupils for the residential schools. It is an inexplicable policy that with one hand builds up, at considerable public expense, a system, well considered, matured, and of proved efficiency, and with the other hand sets to work, also at the public cost, to elaborate and put in extensive operation a discredited scheme of Indian education, which, if successful in drawing pupils, must, in the measure of its success, be destructive...\"\nof a system created at great expense and well tried.\n\nTo a considerable extent the Indians, particularly of the west, are still nomadic. The number that has regularly settled down to farm life is still relatively small. Many who farm to some extent still move about at seasons. It is mainly the graduates of residential schools who have really settled down as tillers of the soil, and too many of these yet seek subsistence otherwise. And very many who have taken, in greater or less degree, to the cultivation of land are yet without such homes as furnish the environment essential to completing the educational work that can be done in day schools.\n\nIn the summer, tepee life is common amongst the great majority of the Indians of the West. In the winter, they are, with rare exceptions, housed in ill ventilated shacks, composed most generally of an undivided ground floor and a loft. The sleeping arrangements are of the crudest, and the ground floor is often used as a sleeping place by numerous dogs, as well as by the men, women and children. The air is foul, the place dirty. Its circumstances make against wholesome cleanliness of body, and are not favorable to mental or moral development. How can improvement be looked for in the race if the children, when out of school, are subjected to such degenerating environment?\n\nIt was just to save the children from it, and to supply, with the ordinary school training, a physically healthy and morally wholesome environment that the residential schools were established and are maintained at much expense by the Government of Canada.\n\nIt seems strange that synchronously with an extra effort to strengthen and develop the boarding schools, the Department should have taken measures to extend the day school system into the very territories which the boarding schools depend upon.\nas feeders, and at the same time enter upon a costly experiment to render the day schools more effective competitors of the boarding schools. It seems to make of the Department's educational policy a process of building up and tearing down.\n\nIn his report, dated 1st June, 1910, the Superintendent of Indian Education states:\n\n\"In many places these (day) schools are quite sufficient to meet the educational needs of the Indians\".\n\nBut a little farther on he has to acknowledge \"the severe deterrent of poverty is often present; some children have no proper clothing to wear during the winter, and the provision of any food for a luncheon at the noon hour is neglected of sheer necessity\".\n\nIn his last report he repeats the statement as to the sufficiency of these schools, and then goes on to say:\n\n\"Aid has to be given to poor children in the supply of footgear and clothing, and the plan of furnishing a warm mid-day meal has been also continued with gratifying results. In several districts the transportation of the children to and from school has assisted in maintaining a regular attendance\".\n\nBut Mr. Inspector Jackson, in his report of the 31st March, 1911, on Okanase Day School, states:\n\n\"Really no progress is seen since last year, owing to irregular attendance. The average attendance for the quarter ended March 31st, 1910, was three. The average attendance for the quarter ending June 30th will be seven, and this increase, the teacher reports is due to the warm mid-day meal .......... With the exception of one pupil, all are in the ABC class\".\n\nIn reporting on Upper Fair-ford Day school, Mr.\nJackson states:\n\n\"At this inspection there were eight present.......\n\nI can see a reason for the irregular attendance. The roads are so bad it is almost impossible for the smaller children to get through and they have not the clothing and footwear for the bad roads and severe weather...\"\n\nAs to the Roseau River Day School, which is classed \"undenominational\", he reports:\n\n\"Miss Godon appears capable of imparting knowledge if the pupils could be furnished her. She says it is impossible to get the children to attend regularly, on account of their parents' moving away on their hunting trips and taking their children with them. When they do come back on the reserve, there is always the difficulty of getting the children started back to school again, lack of clothes, &c., being the excuse......................\n\nThere is always a mid-day meal, and, when the parents go away, the children between six and twelve are kept by the teacher.\" Mr. Jackson thinks that \"this is one of the places where a little boarding school might be established\".\n\nOf the Oak River Day School Mr. Jackson writes:\n\nMr. McGraw was the last teacher here, and he tells me that the Indians would not, or could not, send their children to school, by could not, I mean lack of clothes and footwear. This is one of the points at which a small boarding school would do well\".\n\nRev. John Semmens, on his tour of inspection, found ten children at Brokenhead River Day School, and remarks:\n\n\"During portions of the year there was a lack of wood for carrying on school work, and some irregularity resulted\".\n\nOf the South St. Peter's Day School he states:\n\"Number of children enrolled 35, but the average attendance for three months was only 7.1. This was very unsatisfactory.\"\n\nBut he found only five at the North St. Peter's Day School.\n\nMr. Inspector Graham does not give specific information as to actual attendance at time of inspection and average attendance. He gives prominence to the new features that are to make day schools supply the place of boarding schools. To the Moose Mountain Day School an addition has been made, containing a kitchen and pantry. There is also a garden. But provision has had to be made for boarding some of the children, for he says: \"Some seven or eight children, whose homes are at a distance, live in a log house near the school and are looked after and fed by an Indian man and his wife\".\n\nThat is the newest improvement on residential schools for Indians as conceived by Sir John Macdonald and the practical men whose opinions have been quoted earlier in this communication. For the ordinary mortal it is difficult to conceive how children, seven or eight of them, can be better cared for in a log house by an Indian man and his wife than they would be at a regular boarding school.\n\nMr. Graham tells us that at the Assiniboine Day School \"the attendance was at one time as high as twenty-four, but during the severe weather it has fallen off considerably\", but this time he \"found twelve children in attendance\", and was \"greatly pleased to note the progress that has been made during the short time the school has been opened\".\n\nMr. Inspector Chisholm reports:\n\"On Mistawasis reserve a comfortable teacher's dwelling has been provided, with pupils' dining-room attached; and by conveying the children from the more distant parts to and from school a very fair attendance has been maintained.\"\n\nHe gives no details as to attendance, so it is impossible to ascertain exactly what is meant by \"a very fair attendance.\"\n\nHe goes on: \"The school on the wig river reserve is a suitable building and properly equipped; and at intervals very satisfactory work has been done. However,....................it has not been found possible to secure a full or uniform attendance. The value of the work has been very much impaired in consequence.\"\n\n\"The average attendance at the school at Ahatakakoo's reserve is less than one-third of the school population.\"\n\nOn the wahapton reserve the farmer, Inspector Chisholm tells us, acts also as teacher, but that he has \"little capacity for school work, and the attendance at best is poor.\" But we are assured that there has been \"latterly a slight improvement... through the assistance of the farmers wife \"in preparing the noon meal for the children (there are but eight of them all told) and in training them in sewing and knitting.\"\n\nIt is upon such \"slight improvements\" that the Superintendent of Indian Education erects the opinion paraded in his public report as to the sufficiency of day schools for Indians; and it is from such evidence that he draws his conclusion as to the \"practical beneficial result\" that have followed from the taking up of \"instruction in plain sewing, knitting, and mending.\"\n\nMr. Inspector Markle reports that the average attendance at Godfish Lake School for the year 1910 was 5.2; that \"there were no children present when\" he visited Saddle Lake Day school on\nFebruary 17th last, that the Whitefish Day school \"has not been in operation during the past years\"; that he has heard that Old Sun's Day school on the Blackfoot reserve is \"a failure\", and he adds this striking remark, which apparently has escaped the eye of the Superintendent of Education,\u2014\"it is not convenient for the children to attend any school other than a residential one\".\n\nThe reports from which the foregoing quotations have been made appear as appendices to the recently published Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education, in which Mr. Scott speaks favorably from the work of day schools.\n\nIt has in the last few years become sadly and increasingly apparent that Indian policy has not always been shaped by teachings of experience.\n\nIn March 1911, His Grace the Archbishop of Saint Boniface was compelled by a sense of duty to submit to your predecessor a protest against the then proposed erection of an undenominational day school on the File Hills reserve. Despite that protest, a building under the guise of an hospital, has been erected by the Department of Indian Affairs. It contains two small rooms, 12 x 12, which are designated hospital wards; but the Superintendent of Education in his report calls it \"a day school\". Not far away from where this day school, which may even now be about to start operation, stands, the Dominion Government recently completed and opened a large boarding school, conducted Presbyterian auspices, in the place of the Regina School which was closed some time ago. Within some twenty miles is the large St'Appelle School, rebuilt at the public expense.\nand in need of recruiting ground to ensure its effective continuance, and thereby a return in results for the public expenditure.\n\nSurely it is rather strange, for the Department to spend public money in building that elaborate day school between these two residential schools, and in specially equipping it with kitchen, dining-room, sick-rooms, teacher's and nurse's quarters so that it may more effectively interfere with the success of the two residential schools.\n\nIt cannot be denied that it is deliberately intended to interfere with the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, for a prohibition against the recruiting for pupils within the territory it is planned to serve was formally issued by the Department, and was withdrawn at the emphatic protest of the said Archbishop.\n\nAnd then as to denominational control of that and other day schools under the new policy: It has been expressly stated by the Department that the day school at File Hills was to be a secular school.\n\nIt is observed that the Superintendent of Indian Education gives, in only a comparatively few instances, the denominational auspices under which day schools are conducted. Inspectors Graham and Chisholm do not give the denominational auspices of any of the day schools mentioned in their reports. It certainly looks as if a concerted effort has been made to secularize our Indian day schools. But the law provides that Indian day schools are to be denominational. Have certain officials Department decided to evoke another strike creating school question?\n\nOn behalf of himself and his venerable colleagues who signed the memorial, first referred to, respecting Indian boarding schools,\nthe undersigned would respectfully ask your consideration of what\nis set forth herein, believing that you will readily see the neces-\nsity, in the public interest, as well as in the interest of the In-\ndian wards of the Government, of corrective action being taken in\nrespect to the Indian educational policy that has come into sway.\n\nAccept, Honorable and Dear Sir, the assurance of\nour regard and best wishes, and believe us,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSaint Boniface, Manitoba,\nNovember 15th 1912\n\n[Signature]\n+ Abelard, Arch. de Winnipeg\n\n+ Emile J.

The contract lacks statutory authority. In the Sections of the Indian Act treating particularly of schools, being Sections 9, 10 and 11, of Chapter 81, Revised Statutes, 1906, there is no mention of contract schools; nor is any authority conferred, by those or any other Sections of that Act, or by any Statute of the Parliament of Canada, upon the Governor in Council, or upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to enter into contracts for the conduct and management of Indian schools.\n\nA contract by which the party of the second part, i.e., the representative of the Church under whose auspices the school named therein is conducted, assumes large responsibilities and is obligated to incur outlays on works of a permanent nature, in addition to the continuous burden of expenditure incident to maintenance and management, should have the sanction necessary to afford the amplest security to the party aforesaid. As it is, the party of the first part, i.e., the Superintendent General, can not, and does not, bind himself to perform his essential part of the bargain, that is to meet the payments to be made in consideration of the due performance of the work contracted to be done by the party of the second part. The clause marked \"V\" stipulates that there shall be no liability to make any payment to the school under the contract \"should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment........be at any time expended during the continuance...\"\nof this contract\".\n\nUp to the adoption of the contract system a policy had been in operation which in its working was somewhat elastic. Under it the Department undertook to contribute to the maintenance of denominationally controlled residential schools for Indians through the payment of a per capita grant. But the policy was not bound in rigid bands; and contributions to the schools were made by the department in more ways than through the per capita grant. Contributions were made to help in the erection of certain school buildings, the ownership of which was recognized to be in the Church under whose auspices these institutions were to be conducted. And when considerable expenditure had been, or was to be, undertaken for additions, improvements or repairs, the department not infrequently came to the assistance of the Church by meeting in whole or in part the expenditure. The per capita grants paid under that policy can not, therefore, be taken as the full measure of the liability which the Department in practice assumed in respect of those schools.\n\nNow that policy has passed from the easy elastic state to the rigid contract form, under which aid can neither be claimed for nor given to those schools beyond the fixed per capita grant. And the party of the first part is tightly bound to the performance of onerous obligations to the State, while the State appears to be bound not at all to make the compensatory payments.\n\nIt is true that the agreement, in the beginning, sets forth that the Superintendent General represents His Majesty the King; but, as there is no Parliamentary authority for thus assuming monetary obligations, nor apparently any sanction by\nThe Governor in Council of the contract, the undersigned doubt whether the Superintendent could constitutionally bind the Crown to the terms of the contract. Yet it is obvious that there should be equally binding obligations upon both parties to the contract. And, when a public policy of import assumes contractual form, it seems but the part of wisdom to have it sanctioned by the highest authority.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit for your consideration the advisability of the Indian Act being so amended at the present session of the Dominion Parliament as to duly authorize the system of contract schools adopted by the Department of Indian Affairs. And to bring the proposal before you in concrete form, they beg leave to suggest the following amendment:\n\n\"That Section 10 of the said Act be hereby amended by adding the following Sub-Section thereto:\n\n\"The Superintendent General may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into contracts with any church or religious denomination carrying on missionary work among the Indians for the conduct and maintenance of such industrial or boarding schools, or of any industrial or boarding schools established for Indians, with the approval, consent or concurrence of the Superintendent General, by any such church or religious denomination, whether the buildings in connection therewith be or be not the property of the Crown, and may assume under such contracts the payment of per capita grants to any or all of such schools for the education, keep and proper care of children, in whole or in part of Indian blood, admitted under rules or regulations made by the Superintendent General.\"\nfrom time to time, or with his approval or consent, and in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\n\nSuch an amendment would give the desired sanction and security. It would give to the contract system that element of permanency which is essential to its success. Without adequate guarantee of stability and reasonable surety of compensatory payment for work done, there is no sufficient warrant for the party of the second part incurring capital expenditure and assuming costly and onerous obligations under the contract. That is so obvious that the undersigned can not conceive of objection being taken to such an amendment, except on factious grounds. But if objection were taken, it seems to the undersigned that this would be a ready and ample answer:\n\nThe contract system was adopted by the late administration; the late Minister entered into contracts with representatives of different churches for the conduct and maintenance of Indian schools; the contracts have gone into operation; they lack proper sanction; they were entered into without requisite authority; all that is now sought is to make them regular, and to afford reasonable security for the expenditure which has already been and is being incurred under them.\n\n2. And, now, the undersigned, apologizing for having to continue to trespass, and to such great extent, upon your very valuable and so much occupied time, venture to deal, seriatim, with the faults in the contract itself.\n\nSub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4 provides -\n\n\"That no Half-breed child shall be admitted....unless Indian children can not be obtained to complete the number...\"\nauthorized by Article I., Section 1., and Section 4. (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II., Section 1., of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\"\n\nThat, the undersigned submit, is a very drastic provision and pregnant of much evil. It is contrary to the policy which long obtained, and against which no reasonable objection has been or can be urged. And in a measure, it is obviously ultra vires.\n\nHalf-breeds may be grouped into three fairly well defined classes.\n\n1. Those who live, in varying degrees of conditions, the ordinary settled life of the country.\n\n2. Those who live, in varying degrees, the Indian mode of life.\n\n3. Those who - and they form the most unfortunate class in the community - are the illegitimate offspring of Indian women, and of whom white men are mainly the begetters.\n\nThose of the first class make no claim upon the Government of the Dominion for the education of their children; nor has any such claim, as far as the knowledge of the undersigned goes, been made on their behalf.\n\nThe third class are entitled to participate in the benefits of Indian Schools; and, in so far as the afore-quoted provision of the contract is designed to exclude them from such participation\nsuch participation, it is ultra vires of the parties to the contract, or of any authority save that of the Dominion Parliament itself.\n\nSection 12, the very first of the sections of the Indian Act dealing with \"Membership of Indian Bands\", enacts as follows:\n\n\"Any illegitimate child may, unless he has, with the consent of the band whereof the father or mother of such child is a member, shared in the distribution moneys of such band for a period exceeding two years, be, at any time, excluded from the membership thereof by the Superintendent General\".\n\nIt follows from that that the illegitimate child of an Indian woman having membership in a band is ipso facto a member of the band to which the mother belongs, and can only be removed from membership in such band by the Superintendent General, if he sees fit to exercise the power conferred upon him by the law; and that, if the child has participated for over two years in the moneys of the band, with the consent of the band (and acquiescence constitutes consent within the meaning of the provision), then there is no authority under the law for the removal of such child from membership. Such child is legally entitled to recognition as having full membership in the mother's band, unless the Superintendent General exercises his right of exclusion within the period aforesaid, which exclusion can not be by way of general order or act, but must be by specific order or act in each case; and every child not so excluded is entitled to all the benefits of band membership, including Indian educational privileges; and no such child can be contracted out of such privileges.\nWhen Indian treaties are made the illegitimate children are taken into and given all the benefits of treaty irrespective of the blood of the fathers. In years after the existing treaties were made, subsequently born illegitimate children of Indian treaty women were excluded and payment of annuity money for them or on their behalf was refused. That policy appears to have been adopted to discourage illegitimate breeding. How far it has operated in that direction those who have been for years in close contact with Indians know best.\n\nThe undersigned are not aware of the form of the order or act by which such policy was put in operation, but they know that its operation has varied in times and places. Such children have been by one Indian Agent recognized as having band membership, by another they have been excluded; one year they are admitted, another year they are debarred.\n\nBut whatever be the object of the policy of exclusion, whatever be the variations in its application, or whatever be its results, such of those children as are being excluded under it are being excluded illegally, unless each such child has been specifically excluded from band membership by the Superintendent General as aforesaid.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, respectfully ask that, if the view of the case of those children as herein stated appears to you to be correct, you would have the goodness to issue an order which will promptly bring the policy and practice of the Department with respect to them into full accord with the law.\n\nAs to the second class of Half-breeds, the undersigned at once admit that they present a difficult educational problem. But the very difficulty affords a strong reason against drawing a hard and fast line such as is drawn in the agreement.\nThis second class of Half-breeds may be divided into three groups:\n\n(1) Those who generally live apart from Indians, but follow somewhat the Indian mode of life, fishing, hunting and trapping, and to some extent engage in freighting, a business which narrows as railways extend. To this group may be added those who hang about towns, doing odd jobs when necessity compels them to work, and eking out a precarious existence, oftentimes, unfortunately, after a fashion which makes not for their own or the community's good.\n\n(2) Those who live in the vicinity of Indian reserves, mingle more or less freely with Indians, and follow the Indian mode of life.\n\n(3) Those who live on Indian reserves, with tacit or expressed consent, and live the life of Indians.\n\nWhen, and for years after, Indian residential schools were established, Half-breeds of the three groups of this second class, as well as those of the third class already dealt with herein, were admitted. In the early years of these schools, when all existing were classed as industrial, the whole expense of the cost and management was met out of the public revenues, and there was then no possibility of dividing, as is now done, pupils into grant-earning and non-grant-earning classes. And after the Departmental system of contributing by per capita grant to the support of residential schools was adopted, which during the incumbancy of the Indian Commissionership by Mr. Hayter Reed, Half-breeds of the second, as well as of the third class, continued to be admitted as grant earners, now and then, perhaps, there being a refusal in the case of a child whose parents would come within the first group of the\nSecond class, while quite close to the fringe of the first class. But, indeed, the practice of the Department was very liberal.\n\nSoon after 1896, certain officials of the administrative branch of the Department at headquarters, whose animus in the matter was evidently begotten of theory formed in the closet rather than of contact with conditions, succeeded in having a rule made excluding all Half-breed children from Indian schools. When, however, reasoned objection was taken to that rule before the then Superintendent General, the Honorable Clifford Sifton, he set it aside and directed that the children of Half-breeds living on or in the vicinity of Indian reserves, and following the Indian mode of life, should be admitted as grant-earners to Indian residential schools. The rule then made by him, when fairly followed, covered pretty fully the classes of Half-breeds whose education can only be properly provided for in such schools. Shortly after Mr. Oliver took office Mr. Sifton's safe rule, if not formally rescinded, was allowed to lapse into desuetude, and the rule which had, on good grounds, been set aside was revived, put into operation, and finally crystallized in Sub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4 of the contract.\n\nThe Half-breed children now excluded from Indian schools are in a most unfortunate position. Their \"homes\" are not homes in our sense of the word. They dwell in tepees or are hearded in shacks. Their environment militates against moral and physical development, and breaks down instead of building up character. What is so readily and so often charged against a people of mixed blood is the result, not of blood, but of environment.\n\nIt is begging the question for the Department to\nThe Honorable Robert Rogers, P.C.,\nMinister of the Interior\nand Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nThe undersigned, at a meeting held on the occasion of the induction into his see of the recently appointed bishop of Regina, have had under consideration the contract for the conduct and management and maintenance of Indian Boarding Schools entered into between your predecessor in office and the Principals of such said schools as are under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe draft of the contract was submitted by the then Superintendent General at a conference held at Ottawa on the 8th November last, between him and certain officials of the headquarters staff of the Department of Indian Affairs, on the one part, and representatives of Churches conducting Indian schools, on the other part.\n\nThe representatives of the Churches had not been previously advised of the terms or tenor of the contract; and the careful consideration which the undersigned has given it compels them to the conclusion that the said representatives had not that opportunity of deliberating it which the importance of the contract demanded.\n\nThe undersigned find that the contract, hurriedly entered into, is lacking in certain essentials and in several\nrespects faulty.\n\nThey, therefore, beg to be permitted to recite the defects they find in the contract, and to set forth in some detail the reasons of their finding:\n\n1. The contract lacks statutory authority. In the Sections of the Indian Act treating particularly of schools, being Sections 9, 10 and 11, of Chapter 81, Revised Statutes, 1906, there is no mention of contract schools; nor is any authority conferred, by those or any other Sections of that Act, or by any Statute of the Parliament of Canada, upon the Governor in Council, or upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to enter into contracts for the conduct and management of Indian schools.\n\nA contract by which the party of the second part, i.e., the representative of the Church under whose auspices the school named therein is conducted, assumes large responsibilities and is obligated to incur outlays on works of a permanent nature, in addition to the continuous burden of expenditure incident to maintenance and management, should have the sanction necessary to afford the amplest security to the party aforesaid. As it is, the party of the first part, i.e., the Superintendent General, can not, and does not, bind himself to perform his essential part of the bargain, that is to meet the payments to be made in consideration of the due performance of the work contracted to be done by the party of the second part. The clause marked \"v\" stipulates that there shall be no liability to make any payment to the school under the contract \"should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment.......be at any time expended during the continuance...\"\nof this contract\".\n\nUp to the adoption of the contract system a policy had been in operation which in its working was somewhat elastic. Under it the Department undertook to contribute to the maintenance of denominationally controlled residential schools for Indians through the payment of a per capita grant. But the policy was not bound in rigid bands; and contributions to the schools were made by the Department in more ways than through the per capita grant. Contributions were made to help in the erection of certain school buildings, the ownership of which was recognized to be in the Church under whose auspices these institutions were to be conducted. And when considerable expenditure had been, or was to be, undertaken for additions, improvements or repairs, the department not infrequently came to the assistance of the Church by meeting in whole or in part the expenditure. The per capita grants paid under that policy can not, therefore, be taken as the full measure of the liability which the Department in practice assumed in respect of those schools.\n\nNow that policy has passed from the easy elastic state to the rigid contract form, under which aid can neither be claimed for nor given to those schools beyond the fixed per capita grant. And the party of the first part is tightly bound to the performance of onerous obligations to the State, while the State appears to be bound not at all to make the compensatory payments.\n\nIt is true that the agreement, in the beginning, sets forth that the Superintendent General represents His Majesty the King; but, as there is no Parliamentary authority for thus assuming monetary obligations, nor apparently any sanction by\nthe Governor in Council of the contract, the undersigned doubt whether the Superintendent could constitutionally bind the Crown to the terms of the contract. Yet it is obvious that there should be equally binding obligations upon both parties to the contract. And, when a public policy of import assumes contractual form, it seems but the part of wisdom to have it sanctioned by the highest authority.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit for your consideration the advisability of the Indian Act being so amended at the present session of the Dominion Parliament as to duly authorize the system of contract schools adopted by the Department of Indian Affairs. And to bring the proposal before you in concrete form, they beg leave to suggest the following amendment:\n\n\"That Section 10 of the said Act be hereby amended by adding the following Sub-Section thereto:\n\n\"The Superintendent General may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into contracts with any church or religious denomination carrying on missionary work among the Indians for the conduct and maintenance of such industrial or boarding schools, or of any industrial or boarding schools established for Indians, with the approval, consent or concurrence of the Superintendent General, by any such church or religious denomination, whether the buildings in connection therewith be or be not the property of the Crown, and may assume under such contracts the payment of per capita grants to any or all of such schools for the education, keep and proper care of children, in whole or in part of Indian blood, admitted under rules or regulations made by the Superintendent general...\"\nfrom time to time, or with his approval or consent, and in accordance with the terms of the contracts\".\n\nSuch an amendment would give the desired sanction and security. It would give to the contract system that element of permanency which is essential to its success. Without adequate guarantee of stability and reasonable surety of compensatory payment for work done, there is no sufficient warrant for the party of the second part incurring capital expenditure and assuming costly and onerous obligations under the contract. That is so obvious that the undersigned can not conceive of objection being taken to such an amendment, except on factious grounds. But if objection were taken, it seems to the undersigned that this would be a ready and ample answer:\n\nThe contract system was adopted by the late administration; the late Minister entered into contracts with representatives of different churches for the conduct and maintenance of Indian schools; the contracts have gone into operation; they lack proper sanction; they were entered into without requisite authority; all that is now sought is to make them regular, and to afford reasonable security for the expenditure which has already been and is being incurred under them.\n\n2. And, now, the undersigned, apologizing for having to continue to trespass, and to such great extent, upon your very valuable and so much occupied time, venture to deal, seriatim, with the faults in the contract itself.\n\nSub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4 provides -\n\n\"That no Half-breed child shall be admitted..., unless Indian children can not be obtained to complete the number...\"\nauthorized by Article I., Section I., and Section 4. (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II., Section I., of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\"\n\nThat, the undersigned submit, is a very drastic provision and pregnant of much evil. It is contrary to the policy which long obtained, and against which no reasonable objection has been or can be urged. And in a measure, it is obviously ultra vires.\n\nHalf-breeds may be grouped into three fairly well defined classes.\n\n1. Those who live, in varying degrees of conditions, the ordinary settled life of the country.\n\n2. Those who live, in varying degrees, the Indian mode of life.\n\n3. Those who - and they form the most unfortunate class in the community - are the illegitimate offspring of Indian women, and of whom white men are mainly the begetters.\n\nThose of the first class make no claim upon the Government of the Dominion for the education of their children; nor has any such claim, as far as the knowledge of the undersigned goes, been made on their behalf.\n\nThe third class are entitled to participate in the benefits of Indian Schools; and, in so far as the afore-quoted provision of the contract is designed to exclude them from such participation\nsuch participation, it is ultra vires of the parties to the contract, or of any authority save that of the Dominion Parliament itself.\n\nSection 12, the very first of the sections of the Indian Act dealing with \"Membership of Indian Bands\", enacts as follows:\n\n\"Any illegitimate child may, unless he has, with the consent of the band whereof the father or mother of such child is a member, shared in the distribution moneys of such band for a period exceeding two years, be, at any time, excluded from the membership thereof by the Superintendent General\".\n\nIt follows from that that the illegitimate child of an Indian woman having membership in a band is ipso facto a member of the band to which the mother belongs, and can only be removed from membership in such band by the Superintendent General, if he sees fit to exercise the power conferred upon him by the law; and that, if the child has participated for over two years in the moneys of the band, with the consent of the band (and acquiescence constitutes consent within the meaning of the provision), then there is no authority under the law for the removal of such child from membership. Such child is legally entitled to recognition as having full membership in the mother's band, unless the Superintendent General exercises his right of exclusion within the period aforesaid, which exclusion can not be by way of general order or act, but must be by specific order or act in each case; and every child not so excluded is entitled to all the benefits of band membership, including Indian educational privileges; and no such child can be contracted out of such privileges.\nWhen Indian treaties are made the illegitimate children are taken into and given all the benefits of treaty irrespective of the blood of the fathers. In years after the existing treaties were made, subsequently born illegitimate children of Indian treaty women were excluded and payment of annuity money for them or on their behalf was refused. That policy appears to have been adopted to discourage illegitimate breeding. How far it has operated in that direction those who have been for years in close contact with Indians know best.\n\nThe undersigned are not aware of the form of the order or act by which such policy was put in operation, but they know that its operation has varied in times and places. Such children have been by one Indian Agent recognized as having band membership; by another they have been excluded; one year they are admitted, another year they are debarred.\n\nBut whatever be the object of the policy of exclusion, whatever be the variations in its application, or whatever be its results, such of those children as are being excluded under it are being excluded illegally, unless each such child has been specifically excluded from band membership by the Superintendent General as aforesaid.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, respectfully ask that, if the view of the case of those children as herein stated appears to you to be correct, you would have the goodness to issue an order which will promptly bring the policy and practice of the Department with respect to them into full accord with the law.\n\nAs to the second class of Half-breeds, the undersigned at once admit that they present a difficult educational problem. But the very difficulty affords a strong reason against drawing a hard and fast line such as is drawn in the agreement.\nThis second class of Half-breeds may be divided into three groups:\n\n(1) Those who generally live apart from Indians, but follow somewhat the Indian mode of life, fishing, hunting and trapping, and to some extent engage in freighting, a business which narrows as railways extend. To this group may be added those who hang about towns, doing odd jobs when necessity compels them to work, and eking out a precarious existence, oftentimes, unfortunately, after a fashion which makes not for their own or the community's good.\n\n(2) Those who live in the vicinity of Indian reserves, mingle more or less freely with Indians, and follow the Indian mode of life.\n\n(3) Those who live on Indian reserves, with tacit or expressed consent, and live the life of Indians.\n\nWhen, and for years after, Indian residential schools were established, Half-breeds of the three groups of this second class, as well as those of the third class already dealt with herein, were admitted. In the early years of these schools, when all existing were classed as industrial, the whole expense of the cost and management was met out of the public revenues, and there was then no possibility of dividing, as is now done, pupils into grant-earning and non-grant-earning classes. And after the Departmental system of contributing by per capita grant to the support of residential schools was adopted, which during the incumbancy of the Indian Commissionership by Mr. Hayter Reed, Half-breeds of the second, as well as of the third class, continued to be admitted as grant earners, now and then, perhaps, there being a refusal in the case of a child whose parents would come within the first group of the\nSecond class, while quite close to the fringe of the first class. But, indeed, the practice of the Department was very liberal.\n\nSoon after 1896, certain officials of the administrative branch of the Department at headquarters, whose animus in the matter was evidently begotten of theory formed in the closet rather than of contact with conditions, succeeded in having a rule made excluding all Half-breed children from Indian schools. When, however, reasoned objection was taken to that rule before the then Superintendent General, the Honorable Clifford Sifton, he set it aside and directed that the children of Half-breeds living on or in the vicinity of Indian reserves, and following the Indian mode of life, should be admitted as grant-earners to Indian residential schools. The rule then made by him, when fairly followed, covered pretty fully the classes of Half-breeds whose education can only be properly provided for in such schools. Shortly after Mr. Oliver took office Mr. Sifton's safe rule, if not formally rescinded, was allowed to lapse into desuetude, and the rule which had, on good grounds, been set aside was revived, put into operation, and finally crystallized in Sub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4 of the contract.\n\nThe Half-breed children now excluded from Indian schools are in a most unfortunate position. Their \"homes\" are not homes in our sense of the word. They dwell in tepees or are housed in shacks. Their environment militates against moral and physical development, and breaks down instead of building up character. What is so readily and so often charged against a people of mixed blood is the result, not of blood, but of environment.\n\nIt is begging the question for the Department to\ntake the position, as it has, that it is the duty of the Provincial Governments to provide education for Half-breeds.\n\nAs you very well know, and as anyone at all familiar with conditions knows, there are no Provincial institutions in which the required kind of education can be provided for Half-breeds of the second and third classes herein described. Even if the white rate-payers of school districts were willing to admit such children to their day schools, not as Pariahs, but on a footing of equality with their own sons and daughters, the sad condition of these Half-breed children would not, in any effective degree, be ameliorated. As educational agencies day schools presuppose a home environment that makes, at least, not against mental and moral development. And anyone that is cognizant of the conditions that obtain must know that our Indian residential schools are the only existing agencies for the proper upbringing of those unfortunate children. If they are excluded from those schools, what can they be expected to become but outcasts and menaces to society?\n\nThe Department seems to have acted upon the supposition that the Government of Canada assumed the burden of providing for the education of Indian children in residential schools solely to meet obligations imposed by treaties with Indians; and from that hypothesis to have reached the conclusion that the Dominion Government is not justified in increasing the burden by extending the benefits of the system to Half-breeds who are not recognized by it as having membership in Indian bands. But the man who laid the foundation of the system, Sir John Macdonald, had no such narrow view. Under his administration the policy was adopted and followed of admitting Half-breeds of the aforesaid second and third classes into those schools.\nAnd that policy was in accord with the basic purpose of the system; for such schools were established not merely to meet treaty obligations towards Indians, but as a means of preventing, in the public interest, a race of wild men growing up whose hands would be against all men and all men's hands against them.\n\nThe Government of Canada never took the position in the past that it had no obligations at all as to Half-breeds. It recognized them as possessing, in a degree, an aboriginal title to the land of this country, and took measures to compensate for its extinguishment. In other ways and at different times it helped these people. It gave to the children of certain of them the right of entry as regular pupils of Indian schools, and in doing so created a right in the nature of a vested right, the destruction of which is an injustice, and against the interest of the commonwealth.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit that the afore-quoted excluding clause of the contract should be expunged; and that the old and wise policy, or, at the very least, Mr. Sifton's rule, be reverted to and made permanent by incorporation in the contract.\n\n3. Clause 6 of the contract baldly provides that the \"school shall be conducted under such regulations as may from time to time be approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council\".\n\nThose regulations, which would be framed in the Department, and might, in the pressure of Governmental business, or in the ordinary course of routine matters, be approved of, could easily be so framed as to practically exclude, or unduly\nInterfere with the teaching of religion.\n\nIt is true that under Clause 9 the managers of the school are required \"to provide... teachers and officers pupils qualified to give religious instruction at the proper times.\" But that provision inferentially makes the Superintendent General the sole and final judge of the qualification of \"teachers and officers\" to impart \"religious instruction,\" and of what are \"the proper times\" at which such \"religious instruction\" should be given. It occurs to the undersigned that so theological a function as that would not be pleasurably assumed by a Minister of State in Canada. Ethical training being wisely recognized as essential in Indian education by the Government of Canada from the very beginning of its relations with Indians, Indian schools were put under the auspices of different religious denominations carrying on missionary work among them to make impossible the clash which might occur between the views of a Minister of the Crown as to the nature and scope of the ethical training that should be imparted and the tenets of the church to which the particular Indians to be so trained belonged. Indeed this provision of Clause 9 seems to the undersigned to have been intended rather for undenominational than for denominational schools, and to have been drafted by one holding the view that religious instruction can be adequately imparted irrespective of ecclesiastical dogma. From that view the undersigned must, of course, most unhesitatingly and most emphatically dissent.\n\nThe undersigned are convinced that you will readily agree that it is the part of wisdom to obviate all possibility of conflict as to religious teaching in the administration\nOf the contract system of Indian schools; and that to that end it would be advisable to have an explicit provision in the contract securing the teaching of religion in the school in accordance with the tenets of the church under whose auspices the school is conducted.\n\nThey would, therefore, suggest that the said Clause 6 be amended by adding thereto the following proviso:\n\n\"Provided that no such regulation shall prohibit, or interfere with, the teaching of religion in the said school in accordance with the tenets of the church under the auspices of which the said school is conducted.\"\n\n4. By Clause 8 of the contract it is covenanted\n\n\"Not to employ, except on probation for a period not exceeding six months, at said school any teacher or instructor until evidence satisfactory to the Superintendent General has been submitted to him that such teacher or instructor is able to converse with the pupils under his charge in English, and is able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly, and possesses such other qualifications as, in the opinion of the Superintendent General, may be necessary\".\n\nThat is a hard and fast provision, compliance with which is practically impossible; yet its violation in any respect would vitiate the contract.\n\nIt is not only required that every \"teacher\" and \"instructor\" shall be able to speak and to write the English language \"fluently and correctly\", but the party responsible for the conduct of the school under the contract must furnish the Superintendent General with \"evidence satisfactory\", and within \"six months\", of the date of the employment of every teacher and instructor, that every such \"teacher or instructor.....is\nable to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly.\n\nIt is required by Clause 9 of the contract that \"gardening, farming, and care of stock..., cooking, laundry-work, needle-work, general housewifery and dairy-work\" shall be taught.\n\nTherefore, the farmers, gardeners and stockmen, the cooks, laundresses, and seamstresses, the house-keepers and the dairy-women must be able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly; for each of them is an instructor under the contract, and the party of the second part convenants that each shall \"instruct\" the pupils of the school in his or her line of work.\n\nNow, everybody knows that there are cooks and dairy-men and house-wifery experts, laundresses and seamstresses, gardeners and farmers and stockmen, competent in their various callings, and good, practical instructors in the work thereof, who, while they speak English well enough for properly training others along their own vocational lines, cannot \"speak and write English fluently and correctly\". They are exceptions who do.\nWe understand that something has already been done by the Department to mitigate the rigor of the clause we object to. Therefore our considerations in the first edition of this memo are no more relevant, and we suppressed them. Still we believe that something more should be done to make things less stringent.\n\nFor instance, we suggest the elimination of the word instructor.\nIf it be necessary to convenant to secure the teaching of English in schools where the force of necessity compels its being learned, let the following be substituted:\n6. To duly provide for the pupils of the said school being taught to speak, read and write the English language to the same extent that pupils are so taught in the ordinary schools of the country.\n\nSuch a provision would secure, if special security in that respect be required, adequate English teaching to Indian pupils. If, in addition, they hear and become in some measure familiar with French, no danger to the commonwealth will result therefrom, nor will they be thereby the less well equipped for the battle of life.\n\n5. The conditions intended to be imposed by Clauses 12, 13 and the first part of 18 should have been more aptly, clearly and comprehensively expressed. They are as follows:\n\n\"12. To keep and maintain the school buildings and premises, to supply proper sanitation and sanitary appliances, and to keep the buildings free from flies, insects and vermin.\"\n\n\"13. To maintain the buildings at the said school and the school premises when they are the property of the (blank) in good condition and repair, the whole to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General\"\n\n\"18. To make any change or alteration in the school building or premises . . . . . .\"\n\nIn considering those provisions reference must be made to the \"Memorandum\" which appears immediately before the draft contract in the blue booklet entitled \"Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools\".\n\nThe following are excerpts therefrom:\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS 'A.'\n\nThe buildings owned by the church which would entitle the school to a per capita grant of $100 in the eastern division and $125 in the western division should conform to the following general specifications.\n\n1. Substantial building either of brick, stone, cement or wood in good state of repair.\n2. To be built on a stone or cement foundation with a light airy basement of full size of main building with cement floor.\n3. Pure and plentiful water-supply distributed throughout the building.\n4. A proper system of sanitary water-closets, drainage and disposal of sewage.\n5. Hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils ill with infectious disease or tuberculosis.\n6. Modern system of ventilation in dormitories and class-room and sufficient air space in dormitories and class-rooms for the number of pupils accommodated.\n7. Modern heating apparatus, hot water, steam or hot air.\n8. Sufficient area of land for farms and gardens and practical industrial work, where such work can be carried on.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS 'B.'\n\nThe buildings owned by the government which would entitle the management to $80 per capita in the eastern division and $100 per capita in the western division class must conform to the requirements of clauses 5, 6, and 8 of class 'A.'\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS 'C.'\n\nBuildings owned by the churches which do not in all particulars conform to the specifications in classes 'A' and 'B,' and which are nevertheless sanitary and kept in a good state of repair, and which would entitle the school to $80 per capita in the eastern division and $100 per capita in the western division. The buildings in this class must conform to the requirements of clauses 5, 6, and 8 of class 'A.'\n\nThe specific re-statement in the paragraph dealing with schools in Class C, of the requirements of Class A which have to be met by them makes it clear that the general statement in that paragraph that the schools coming within Class C are to be \"nevertheless sanitary and kept in a good state of repair\" can not fairly be interpreted to mean that these schools are to be called upon to meet in regard to sanitariness the specific and costly requirements of Class A, the schools of which class, in consideration of the more costly and extensive improvements required, are paid $25.00 per capita more than the schools in Class C. The buildings to be scheduled in Class C are described as \"buildings owned by the churches which do not in all particulars conform to the specifications...\"\nspecific requirements of that class are to be provided in their case being the things described in sections 5, 6 and 8 of the paragraph describing the requirements of Class A, namely, isolated hospital accommodation, modern system of ventilation, sufficient air space, and adequate land for farms and gardens, where farming and gardening can be carried on. As to sanitariness, all that can be insisted upon is that such school buildings shall be made and kept sanitary as similar buildings are ordinarily made and kept sanitary, without \"light airy basements\", \"water supply distributed\", \"system of sanitary water-closets, drainage and disposal of sewage; all of which requirements are specifically set forth as necessary for Class A, but are not so set forth as required for Class C. And the reason for their not being set forth as requisite for the latter classification is quite obvious; for, if these costly things had to be provided for entry into Class C and to secure the per capita grant of $100.00 payable to schools in that class, it would be the veriest improvidence not to meet the other requirements of Class A and secure the per capita grant of $125.00, especially as, in a climate marked by severe cold in winter, \"modern heating apparatus\", a requirement of Class A which as are the other things mentioned for Class C, is strangely not insisted upon, would be essential to a system of water distribution, water-flushing closets and pipe drainage throughout buildings, which are insisted upon, on the reports made on certain schools by a saidasant expert employed by the Department last summer to examine the buildings, after they had been, under special instructions from the Department, examined, not by the School Inspector, but by the regular Inspectors of Agencies, and on their reports classified for the purposes of the contract by the Department.\nThe changes and improvements ordered are, in almost every case in which the undersigned have been advised of the said expert's specifications, so vastly out of proportion to the building itself as to be quite absurd. Take, for instance, the school at Delmas\u2014it has had, since its establishment, never more than an authorized attendance of twenty. It is classed C.\n\nYet it is required that the building shall be done over and entirely remodelled. Stone foundations are to be changed, ceiling made higher, windows enlarged, and hard wood floors laid and oiled and finished in shellac. Each dormitory is to be provided with \"one water closet... automatic low tank combination operated with push button\" and \"one cast iron enamelled bath\". Galvanized iron tanks are to be put on the second floor, from which water is to be distributed throughout the building by gravitation; and the floors and walls are to be strengthened to sustain the tanks. A sewage system, with septic tanks, is to be installed.\n\nAnd all those things are in addition to the specific requirements of Class C as to isolated hospital et cetera.\n\nThe undersigned know of only one school classed C in the territory toured by the said expert that would warrant the assuming of such burdens. That school is Ermineskin's at Hobbema. And because certain of the improvements called for have been made and the others are to be gone with, its classification should be changed to A.\n\nOver and above the objections herein made to the extensive and costly improvements demanded, on an unwarranted interpretation of the official description of the requirements of Class C, the undersigned regard the requirement of isolated hospital accommodation as excessive.\nAn isolated hospital, a building standing alone and devoted to the treatment of virulently contagious diseases, necessitates special provision for heating, special culinary arrangements, special provision for laundering, and an addition to the staff of the school to which it appertains.\n\nNow a school with twenty or thirty, or even forty or so pupils, can not in reason be expected to bear the burden of building, equipping and maintaining such an hospital.\n\nWhere outside of the Indian Department is such a requirement dreamed of? How many hamlets, villages, and even towns in the west have isolated hospitals? And where there are such hospitals, the health regulations permit persons struck with certain infectious diseases being kept at their own homes if proper isolation can be effected. And for proper isolation, even in cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria, it is not necessary that the stricken ones should be put under a different roof, and those suffering from one disease separated by a doorless wall from those taken down with another, as Dr. Lafferty insisted should be done at Crowfoot's School on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThe isolated hospitals demanded are to have accommodation, it is stipulated, for \"infectious disease or tuberculosis.\" It would be an unprecedented, and a dangerous and cruel proceeding, to put tubercular cases with cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria or small-pox. Phthisis is not virulently contagious. The best medical opinion, the undersigned are given to understand, is that it can be safely treated without isolation, if simple precautions are taken; and, indeed, it is well known that very many suffering from that dread disease are, under medical direction, so treated in homes that, to say the least, have not better accommodation than is afforded by the infirmaries.\nalready provided at the schools.\n\nThe Department itself did not provide in connection with the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, which it built and owns, and in which there are in residence some two hundred and twenty-five pupils, an isolated hospital. The only hospital provided is on the top flat of the main building, and has not even a balcony, though the open air treatment is the approved one for tuberculosis, and most desirable as a means of affording a sunning to all convalescents.\n\nWhy, then, should the same department insist that church schools with an attendance of one or two score, and paid only $100.00 per capita, shall have such isolated hospitals as have been demanded?\n\nAll that should reasonably be called for is a special infirmary in the building, safeguarded to prevent contagion, and in area proportionate to the capacity of the school building, the same to be kept in readiness for the isolation of pupils who might contract infectious diseases. If such a disease spread, the school would have, as residential schools have had, to take on the circumstances of an isolated hospital.\n\nIt is important to have a clear description of what is required in the way of hospital accommodation. Schools have been submitted to vexatious requirements by physicians, whose interest therein appears to have been in large measure confined to making unnecessary demands. For sometime, indeed, it has been painfully evident that the Department's medical policy has been inspired by faddism.\n\nThe undersigned would be quite satisfied if the schools schedule in Class C were only called upon to meet requirements.\nproper to that class; for the increase from $72.00 to $100.00 per capita would warrant the necessary expenditure; and the improvements, with the increased yearly income, would enable those schools to better serve the purpose for which they are intended.\n\nThe description of the classes of schools, the undersigned respectfully submit, should have been incorporated in the contract. As they stand, it would not appear that they can be held to be part of it; and Clauses 12, 13 and 18 are so loosely framed and capable of so broad and variant interpretations that almost anything in the way of alterations and improvements can be demanded. It seems to the undersigned to be quite obviously in the interest of both parties thereto that the contract entered into for each and every school should definitely and clearly set forth what improvements are to be made and maintained in order to entitle the school to receive a per capita grant of $100.00 or $125.00, as the case may be. And to that end the undersigned would ask that the contract be amended.\n\n6. By Clause 18 of the contract the party of the second part is required -\n\n(1) \"To make any change or alteration in the school building or premises, or (2) in the management or control of the said school rendered necessary to comply with the intent and spirit of the agreement, and (3) to remove for cause from the said school any teacher, officer, employee, or pupil when required to do so by the Superintendent General\".\n\nTo be properly canvassed this clause must be taken apart and divided, as marked by the undersigned in the above quotation of it.\nIts first section should have been embodied in a clause covering the matter of Clauses 12 and 13.\n\nBut, apart from that, which is after all only a fault in drafting, the first section is objectionable in that it destroys finality in the matter of improvement, and enables the party of the first part to demand, at any time after the changes and improvements first required have been acceptably made, further alterations, which may be extensive and costly and destructive of expensive improvements made by order of the Department at the time of entering into the contract. Under this provision, managers of schools may find themselves embarrassed by Departmental approval of the recommendations of Inspectors or Agents with fads; and school managers, unfortunately, are not without experience of such faddists.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit that, in recasting the contract, it should be made clear that, when the changes and improvements called for by the requirements of the class in which the school is placed have been acceptably made and such improvements are being duly maintained, there shall be no obligation to make any further changes, alterations or improvements during the continuance of the contract.\n\n7. The second section of Clause 18 is particularly objectionable and dangerous. It empowers the party of the first part \"to make any change or alteration,...in the management or control of the school rendered necessary to comply with the intent and spirit of the agreement\", of which necessity the said party is to be the sole and final judge.\n\nThe word \"management\" means and is intended for \"managers\", the word used by the undersigned in their review of the contract to prevent confusion with the word management.\nas used in the title and generally throughout the contract. But, if there were room for doubt as to the sense in which the word \"management\" is used in the clause now under consideration, it is entirely removed by the addition of the word \"control\", which is sufficiently comprehensive to be inclusive of the meaning of \"auspices\" as that word is used when it is stated that a certain school is conducted under the auspices of a certain church. The provision is certainly very wide and far reaching.\n\nThe undersigned can find no provision in the contract for the school being conducted under the auspices of a particular church. If such a provision be not within the four corners of the contract, then it would not be contrary to its \"intent and spirit\", and, indeed, might be found necessary thereto, to change the auspices.\n\nThat may be regarded as quite unlikely to happen, and too far fetched a contingency to guard against. However that may be, this might happen:\n\nA school might come to be regarded by an Inspector or Agent as being too religiously conducted, and, on his report, the ecclesiastical \"management or control\" thereof might be changed to lay management and control.\n\nOr it might come to be considered that the \"management\" was not sufficiently Anglicized or too Frenchified, and that it was, therefore, necessary to due compliance with the \"intent and spirit of the agreement\" to change or alter the management and control.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully submit that each contract should set forth the designation of the church or religious denomination under whose auspices the school is conducted; that, in the case of each school conducted under the auspices\nof the Catholic Church, the designation of the order or community of priests or nuns the school is managed or controlled by at the time of the entering into the contract should be set forth therein; and it should be provided that no change shall be made in such management or control without the consent or concurrence of the Ordinary of the diocese or vicariate in which the school is situated.\n\n8. The third section of Clause 18 empowers the party of the first part to have removed, \"for cause\", from the school any teacher, officer, employee, or pupil.\n\nThe term \"for cause\" is dangerously indefinite. It is not difficult to allege a cause. The question always is as to its sufficiency. Under the section a teacher, officer or employee might be removed because he or she used, even in English, French idiomatic forms of expression, or spoke with too French an accent, or conversed or prayed with pupils in other than the English tongue. A teacher might be removed because he or she did not hold a certificate from one of a certain number of Normal Schools. A child might be removed and placed in a school conducted under other religious auspices.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully submit that the clause should be so amended as to set forth the causes for which removal may be made. In the cases of teachers, officers and employees the grounds for removal should be confined to incompetency, unbecoming conduct, and violation of the terms of the contract or of Departmental regulations not inconsistent therewith. Pupils should only be removed, before the full period for which they entered, for serious offences in the nature of crimes under the law, or on account of incurable disease or of\ndisease inimical to the health of the other pupils, or because of utter intractability; and it should be provided that a pupil so removed shall not be placed in a school conducted under religious auspices different from that under which the school from which the removal is made is conducted.\n\n9. In the part of the agreement which sets forth the obligations of the Superintendent General under the contract, he covenants, under Clause 2 thereof, \"to provide the pupils of... the... school with medicines, school-books, stationery, and school appliances\".\n\nIt is the practice to also furnish medical attendance; and the undersigned respectfully submit that the clause should be so amended as to include it.\n\n10. Under Clause III the party of the first part takes power to \"cancel and rescind\" the contract on his sole judgment that \"any of the covenants and stipulations\" therein have not been complied with, on giving six months notice.\n\nThe undersigned regard that as rather an extensive power to take without the right of appeal on the part of the other party to the contract, who, in virtue of it, incurs large outlay and assumes serious responsibilities; and they would, therefore, suggest that the clause be amended so as to give the party of the second part the right to appeal against an order of cancellation to the Governor in Council within six months of the date of such order, it being provided that such order shall set forth the grounds of cancellation, so that the same may be attacked if an appeal be made.\n\n11. By Clause V it is provided that there shall be no liability to make any payment to the school under the contract.\n\"should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment,......be at any time expended during the continuance of this contract\".\n\nThe Indian educational appropriation, the undersigned understand, is voted in bulk, and not for particular schools or classes of schools. Through over expenditure in one direction there might be lack of funds to meet payments due in another. Or there might be neglect to estimate for moneys payable under the contract. There is no expressed obligation under the contract to estimate for payments to the school the maintenance of which by its managers is contracted for, or to ask Parliament for the necessary money for the per capita grant stipulated.\n\nIt seems to the undersigned that those obligations should be expressed in the contract. Indeed, they venture to think that it would not be going too far to ask that it be agreed that the name of the school and the amount provided for it be set forth in the Supply Bill. That would give Parliamentary sanction to each contract, would ensure that no money voted for the school could be diverted, and would estop any demands for additional payments to the school.\n\nIf you, Honorable Sir, should find the contract sufficiently faulty to warrant its recasting, it would, the undersigned respectfully suggest, be well to have it so recast that no room for doubt might remain as to covenants and conditions, its spirit and intent. In the recasting, it should, the undersigned venture to suggest, be borne in mind that the Indian educational system has now proceeded \"from status to contract\". In the former condition there was nothing hard or fast. Variant conditions and unforeseen contingencies could at any time be taken into consideration, and an unpropitious\nfinancial situation might at any time be ameliorated by aid other than the per capita grant. Claims could be made for the meeting by the Department of certain expenditures; and such claims were often made and often met. No such aid can be looked for, no such claims are entertainable under the contract system. It is rigid. It crystallizes a policy. There is no room for give or take. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the conditions should be clearly expressed, and that no room be left for misunderstanding. It is of the very essence of a contract to aptly describe the things contracted for. And, when a public policy of import assumes contractual form, it is, as already observed, the part of wisdom to have it sanctioned by the highest authority in the State.\n\nWe beg you, Honorable Sir, to accept the assurance of our high esteem, and to believe us\n\nYour faithful servants,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAt Regina, Saskatchewan,\n24th November, 1911.\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nThe main points in connection with Roman Catholic Contract Indian Boarding Schools which are raised by the Right Rev. Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church who signed the letters addressed to the Honourable Robert Rogers on the 16th and 24th November, 1912, are as follows:\n\n1st. That the contract was hurriedly entered into.\n\n2nd. That the contract was ultra vires of the Superintendent General; an amendment to the Indian Act is proposed to overcome the alleged illegality.\n\n3rd. Detailed objections are made to certain clauses of the contract.\n\n4th. That the Department has entered upon a policy of establishing day schools which conflicts with the interests of the Boarding Schools and that an attempt is being made to secularize the schools.\n\nI will take up the points in their order.\n\n1st. That the contract was hurriedly entered into,\n\nOn the 8th November, 1910, the Honourable Mr. Oliver held a conference with Bishops, Clergymen and Laymen representing the churches interested in Indian Education to discuss the question of the future conduct and maintenance of Indian\nIndian Boarding Schools throughout the Dominion. The churches had for some time urged the necessity of better financial terms and the then Superintendent General desired to find some satisfactory basis upon which increased grants could be made. He had found that there was what he characterized as an \"unbusiness-like lack of arrangement,\" whereby the Government was called upon to spend money on buildings owned by the churches and to meet deficiencies in the management of Mission Schools. The payment of augmented Per Capita Grants was, therefore, made upon the basis of ownership in the building. The Government was no longer to be held liable for any improvements to Church property and all the school buildings whether owned by the Church or Government were to be improved and brought up to a certain standard. The draft contract was read by the Superintendent General at this conference and it was approved by the delegates. On the 26th November a copy was sent to everyone who had been present and to others who were interested. These copies were sent to the Right Rev. Bishops who signed the letters at present under discussion, with the exception of the lately appointed Bishop of Regina. The contracts themselves were not signed until March of the following year. Most of them are dated in that month and the months of April and May following. It will be seen, therefore, that a draft of this contract was in possession of the Right Rev. Bishops for at least four months, during which interval no objection was raised by them and the contract was signed without amendment. The contract has been in operation since the 1st of April, 1911, and two years of the contract will have been completed on the 31st March, proximo. During this period the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church and the Department have worked amicably.\namicably together. Every stipulation of the contract has been met by the Church and the Government, and the buildings have been improved or are in course of improvement by both parties.\n\nBefore proceeding to deal with the objections raised by the Right Rev. Bishops to the contract itself, I would state that the contracts terminate on the 31st March, 1916. That is they have still four years to run after the end of the present fiscal year. I would recommend that if the contract be found to be legal that the agreement be allowed to run its course. Experience will show where changes ought to be made. If the Superintendent General has no power to enter into such a contract it is inoperative and the whole matter can be reconsidered pending the provision of statutory authority to make a contract.\n\n2nd. That the contract was ultra vires of the Superintendent General; an amendment to the Indian Act is proposed to overcome the alleged illegality.\n\nThis is a matter which should be presented to the Department of Justice for opinion, as well as the question as to the illegitimates raised in connection with Section 12 of the Indian Act.\n\n3rd. Detailed objections are made to certain clauses of the contract.\n\nThe admission of Half-breed children. This is a question to which much attention has been paid of late. A Half-breed, being legally \"a person\" within the meaning of the Act, that is not an Indian, he is an ordinary citizen of the country and the problem of his education belongs to the Provinces not to the Dominion. It must be remembered that during the early days in the West there was a good deal of carelessness as regards\nas regards the admission of Half-breeds to Indian bands and educational institutions intended for Indians. The Government of the Northwest Territories was then under the Dominion, the Provinces had not been erected, the school lands had not been set apart for the support of schools. There is now no more reason for the Dominion Government to intervene to provide for the education of Half-breeds than there would be for intervening action in connection with any other progressive policy with reference to this special class. It will be observed that we do not absolutely exclude these children from our schools; they may be taken in if Indian children cannot be obtained, but, the cost of their maintenance should not fall upon the Dominion Treasury but upon the Provinces.\n\nHas an effort ever been made by the school authorities to get the Provincial Governments to recognize their duties and responsibilities in this matter? The Half-breeds are one class of their citizens and a certain portion of them can better be provided in resident schools than in any other class of institution. The Dominion Government has generously said, \"We will give accommodation for this class, let the Provinces provide the maintenance.\" It would be a serious matter of expense to open our doors unreservedly to Half-breeds and the appropriation being intended for Indian Education only; it would not be proper to divert any portion of it to the education of Half-breeds. The Government of Canada certainly recognized some obligations to the Half-breeds but these were cancelled by the issue of Half-breed scrip, just as the Indian obligations were cancelled by the making of Treaties to the Indians. It is purely a question of policy for the Govern-\nGovernment to decide whether they will assume the responsibility of the education of Half-breeds. Parliament can provide funds for the education of Half-breeds or any foreign element in the population. At present there is no Parliamentary authority and the late Superintendent General decided that he would not educate citizens of the Provinces. I think that this question should be taken up with the Provincial Ministers of Education, and the policy of the Department should be made clear to them, and I think it highly probable that they will be willing to contribute to the maintenance of Half-breeds in Industrial and Boarding Schools.\n\nWith regard to Half-breeds, the position of the Church is not made clear in any of these documents. They are I think chiefly concerned as to the maintenance of Industrial Schools. It is exceedingly difficult to recruit Indian children for both Industrial and Boarding Schools, but particularly difficult for the former class, because the Indians object to sending their children far away from home. Most of the Boarding Schools are on the Reserves and they have less objection to allow their children to attend this class of school. Up to the present time every Industrial School has had in residence a number of Half-breeds, for whom the Government paid nothing, but who were supported by the general revenues of the schools. So long as the Indian attendance could be kept up, the Church could derive revenue from the Department and thus support a large number of Half-breeds.\n\nWhile dealing coldly with the legal aspect, I do not think we should altogether lose sight of humane considerations and I would be inclined to go back to the Hon. Mr. Sifton's ruling and at the same time endeavour to get the Provincial\nProvincial Authorities to contribute something, any one moiety of the Per Capita Grant for this class of children as specified in Mr. Sifton's ruling and admit to Industrial Schools \"children, either those of mixed blood whether legitimate or not, who live upon an Indian Reserve and whose parents on either side live as Indians upon a Reserve, even if they are not annuitants.\" The Department is not a mere machine. Compassion should be active where it is properly due, and certainly there is no class of children the State should more compassionate than the unfortunate class above referred to.\n\nClause 6 of the Contract.\n\nThe contract provides that the school shall be conducted under such regulations as may from time to time be approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council. The school regulations now operative were approved by His Excellency in Council on the 6th August, 1908. Both the Indian Act and the regulations provide for Denominational Schools and I think it a most remote contingency that the Governor in Council would impose oppressive regulations as to religious teaching in the schools. Since the establishment of the schools, the Churches have been allowed great freedom in imparting religious training.\n\nClause 8 of the Contract.\n\nWith reference to the inability of teachers and instructors to speak English fluently. We are quite well aware that the Roman Catholic Schools employ a number of teachers and instructors whose native language is not English, and while it has been thought advisable that the English language should be taught in localities where it is the language of the people the Department has not objected to the employment of instructors or teachers whose native language is not English. It will be observed that the Right Rev. Bishops withhold in part\nin part their objection to this clause, and I think it might be allowed to stand. It is not the intention to be unreasonable in the application of this provision or any other of the contracts.\n\nClauses 12-13, first part of 18,\n\nPractically all the necessary changes and improvements have already been made at the request of the Department by the Roman Catholic Boarding Schools. It should be remembered that the new arrangement placed the Roman Catholic Authorities in a much better financial position. During the first year from the 1st April, 1911, to the 31st March, 1912, the Roman Catholic Schools received $70,186.00 more than they would have received under the old arrangement.\n\nClause 18 of the Contract.\n\nThis clause is characterized as \"particularly objectionable and dangerous\"; it is not intended to be either, and it is no wise harmful to the interests of the school. In these cases the contract is made with a Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church to conduct the school for five years. It would be contrary to the spirit of the contract to convert the school into a Protestant Institution or to alter the form of religious instruction to be given.\n\n\"Cause\", of course, means good and sufficient cause. We cannot remove a teacher or instructor for any frivolous reason.\n\n4th. That the Department has entered upon a policy of establishing day schools which conflicts with the interests of the Boarding Schools and that an attempt is being made to secularize the schools.\n\nQuotations are made from general remarks in my report for 1910-11. In generalizing I state that in many places\nplaces Indian day schools are quite sufficient to meet the educational needs of the Indians. I do not refer to schools in the Western Provinces nor to Roman Catholic Schools, I simply state what is a fact, that in many places day schools are quite sufficient to meet the educational needs of the Indians. The places referred to are principally in Eastern Canada, and even in the West and British Columbia we have admirable day schools for Indians. If it could be shown that we are establishing Roman Catholic day schools to the prejudice of the Boarding Schools there would be serious ground for objection on the part of the Ecclesiastical Authorities, but the facts are far otherwise. Within the limits of the Diocese administered by the Right Rev. Bishop, during a period of ten years, from 1902-1912, eleven Roman Catholic Day Schools have been closed and two have been opened. The two which have been established were so established by the express wish of the religious authorities; one was at Cross Lake, in the Northern part of Manitoba, established by the Roman Catholic Missionaries; the grant was applied for and first paid in 1903-1904. The school at Norway House was first applied for by the Rev. Father Rigas, and in 1908 a further application was made by Rev. Father Poitras, and a grant of a teacher's salary was paid from the 1st of October, 1910. From these facts it will be clear that the Department is making no endeavour to extend the day school system to the prejudice of Roman Catholic Boarding Schools. Neither is any attempt being made to secularize the schools or to destroy the Denominational character of these schools. A glance at pages 394 to 417 of the report for 1911, will show that the Denomination of every school of every class, Day, Boarding and Industrial is named.\n\nThe same\nThe same holds good for the report of 1912. The regulations of Indian Day Schools provide for religious instruction.\nHonorable Robert Rogers, P.C.,\nMinister of the Interior\nand Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nReferring to the memorial addressed to you on the 24th ultimo, resulting from the consideration by the Bishops at Regina of the contract for the conduct and management and maintenance of Indian Boarding Schools, the undersigned find that the following was omitted therefrom:\n\nClause 3 (a) provides \"That no child shall be admitted to the school who is under seven years of age.\"\n\nRegulations respecting the education of Indian children were made by Order in Council of the 10th November, 1894, and, in amending those Regulations by Order in Council of the 16th August, 1908, the age of admission of children to school was left at seven years.\n\nThere is nothing to show that any Order in Council has since been made changing the age; and, if none were made fixing the age at seven years, then, it is submitted, the parties to the contract have no power to go beyond the Regulations established by Order in Council and fix the age of admission at seven years.\n\nSuch a change is undesirable. The Indians have become used to the requirement that the education of their children should begin at six years of age, and it is of the utmost importance that there should be continuity in our educational policy.\n\nThe change will tend to make the Indians sceptical of the wisdom of the Department, for they will reason that, if six years...\nof age was found to be too young in November 1910, in another year or so seven years may be found to be too young, and that gradually the view of the authorities of the Department as to education may come into accord with their own.\n\nThe undersigned cannot conceive that any experience gained since August 1908, has led to the change. The undersigned are not aware that any educational authority of wide repute has recently expressed an opinion that would justify the change. The general tendency is not to advance the years of age at which schooling should begin. And what may be urged in favor of the early schooling of white children has ten-fold force in the case of Indian children, for they must \"be caught young\" to be saved from what is on the whole the degenerating influences of their home environment.\n\nThe change in the age is a serious drawback to the schools whose managers have, in accordance with the policy in vogue up to the time of the contract, arranged for the admission of, and now have in the schools, children under seven years of age, for whom, under the contract, payment will be refused.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, respectfully ask that Clause (a) be amended by substituting \"six\" for \"seven\".\n\n2 It is essential to the success of the contract system of Indian schools that the Department should pursue, at least, a policy which will not run counter to them. Recent happenings, however, give the impression that, instead of a supporting policy, the Department has entered upon and is pressing a policy which is bound, in the measure of its extension, to make against the success of the contract schools.\n\nUnder your immediate predecessor in office a very\nmarked departure was made in Canada's Indian educational policy.\n\nUp to then day schools had not been regarded as sufficient, or, indeed, wholly efficient, agencies of Indian education. It was the proved inadequacy of the day school system that led the Government under Sir John MacDonald, to provide for the establishment and maintenance of Indian residential schools. As early as 1890 that great statesman wrote:\n\n\"The greatest obstacle to the successful education of Indian children at day school consists in the irregularity of their attendance, caused in part by the neglect of their parents to oblige them to attend, and by frequent absence of many families from the reserves while fishing, hunting and berry picking.\"\n\nAnd anyone with more than a perfunctory knowledge of Indian conditions, as they generally obtain today in Western Canada, is aware that the hope of the permanent advancement of the aborigines lies in the education of the children in residential schools, where the ordinary work of day schools can be supplemented by domestic, manual, agricultural, and suchlike training, and the lack of proper home environment supplied by an atmosphere favorable to moral culture and character building.\n\nIn his report of the 1st January 1889, the Hon. Edgar Dewdney, then Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and a man who had long practical experience as Indian Commissioner in the West, wrote:\n\n\"The superiority of the boarding over that of the day school system as a means for the enlightenment and elevation, both morally and intellectually, of Indian youth, is I think, unquestionable. The extension of the same to several of the...\"\nreserves should, in my opinion, be regarded with satisfaction by all who really take an interest in the advancement of the Indian race.\n\nIn his report of the 15th January 1891, the same gentleman wrote:\n\n\"It would be highly desirable, if it were practicable, to obtain entire possession of all Indian children after they attain to the age of seven or eight years, and keep them at schools of the industrial type until they had a thorough course of instruction, not only in the ordinary subjects taught at public schools, but in some useful and profitable trade, or in agriculture, as the aptitude of the pupil might indicate he was best fitted for. Were such a course adopted the solution of that problem, designated the Indian question, would probably be effected sooner than it is likely to be under the present system\" ..........................\n\n\"The system of absorption of Indian children by boarding and industrial training schools should be widely extended, and every effort to make the residence therein of Indian children of the proper age to be admitted the rule, and not, as it is present, the exception, should be unremitting. Apart from other, and obviously more important advantages of which an extended policy of the kind, if it were systematically pursued, would doubtless be the result, it would certainly be the most economical in the end, as the Indian children trained at such institutions would acquire practical knowledge which would fit them to become useful members of society\".\n\nIn his report of the 31st December 1894, as Deputy\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs, Mr. Hayter Reed wrote:\n\n\"The extension of educational work is being chiefly carried out in the direction of industrial and semi-industrial institutions, in which the children not only get the positive advantages of instruction superior to what could be given them on the reserves, but are removed from the regarding influences of contact with them.\"\n\nViewed in the light of conditions, the results produced by residential schools have been gratifying. No such results could have been produced by day schools. And it may in fairness be said that, if the unremitting efforts recommended by Mr. Dewdney had been persisted in, the result would have been still more gratifying. But it is a regrettable fact that very many officials of the Department make no real effort to secure the attendance of Indian children at institution maintained out of the public revenues for the advancement of the Indians. With the active co-operation of Indian Agents and the members of agency staffs the sphere of usefulness of residential schools could be easily extended.\n\nNot only has such co-operation in recent years been sadly lacking, but a policy has been inaugurated of establishing day schools that seem designed to make more difficult the securing of pupils for the residential schools. It is an inexplicable policy that with one hand builds up, at considerable public expense, a system, well considered, matured, and of proved efficiency, and with the other hand gets to work, also at the public cost, to elaborate and put in extensive operation a discredited scheme of Indian education, which, if successful in drawing pupils, must, in the measure of its success, be destructive.\nOf a system created at great expense and well tried.\n\nTo a considerable extent the Indians, particularly of the West, are still nomadic. The number that has regularly settled down to farm life is still relatively small. Many who farm to some extent still move about at seasons. It is mainly the graduates of residential schools who have settled down as tillers of the soil, and too many\u2014of them yet such subsistence farmers, and very many who have taken, in greater or less degree, to the cultivation of land are yet without such homes as furnish the environment essential to completing the educational work that can be done in day schools.\n\nIn the summer, tepee life is common amongst the great majority of the Indians of the West. In the winter, they are, with rare exceptions, housed in still ventilated shacks, composed most generally of an undivided ground floor and a loft. The sleeping arrangements are the crudest, and the ground floor is often used as a sleeping place by numerous dogs, as well as by the men, women and children. The air is foul, the place is dirty. Its circumstances make against wholesome cleanliness of body, and are not favorable to mental or moral development. How can improvement be looked for in the race if children, when out of school, are subject to such degenerating environments?\n\nIt was just to save the children from it, and to supply, with the ordinary school training, a physically healthy and morally wholesome environment that the residential schools were established and are maintained at much expense by the Government of Canada.\n\nIt seems strange that synchronously with an extra effort to strengthen and develop the boarding schools, the Department should have taken measures to extend the day school system into the very territories which the boarding schools depend upon\u2014-\nas feeders, and at the same time enter upon a costly experiment\nto render the day schools more effective competitors of the\nboarding schools. It seems to make the Department's educational\npolicy a process of building up and tearing down.\n\nIn his report, dated 1st June 1910, the Superintendent\nof Indian Education states:\n\n\"In many places these (day) schools are quite sufficient\nto meet the educational needs of the Indians\".\n\nBut a little farther on he has to acknowledge \"the\nsevere deterrent of poverty is often present; some children have\nno proper clothing to wear during winter, and the provision of any\nfood for a luncheon at the noon hour is neglected of sheer necessity\".\n\nIn his last report he repeats the statement as to the suf-\nficiency of these schools, and then goes on to say:\n\n\"Aid has to be given to poor children in the supply of footwear and\nclothing, and the plan of furnishing a warm mid-day meal has been\nalso continued with the gratifying results. In several districts the\ntransportation of the children to and from school has assisted in\nmaintaining a regular attendance\".\n\nBut Mr. Inspector Jackson, in his report of the 31st\nMarch 1911, on Okanase Day School, states:\n\n\"Really no progress is seen since last year, owing to irreg-\nular attendance. The average attendance for the quarter ended March\n31st 1910, was three. The average attendance for the quarter ending June\n30th will be seven, and this increase, the teacher reports is due to\nthe warm mid-day meal.........................With the exception of\none pupil, all are in ABC class\".\n\nIn reporting on Upper Fairfield Day School, Mr.\nJackson states:\n\n\"At this inspection there were eight present........\n\nI can see a reason for the irregular attendance. The roads are so bad, it is almost impossible for the smaller children to get through and they have not clothing and footwear for the bad roads and severe weather....\"\n\nAs to the Roseau River Day School, which is classed \"undenominational\", he reports:\n\n\"Miss Gordon appears capable of imparting knowledge if the pupils could be furnished her. She says, it is impossible to get the children to attend regularly, on account of their parents moving away on their hunting trips and taking their children with them. Then they do come back on the reserve, there is always the difficulty of getting the children started back to school again, lack of clothes, &c., being the excuse..........................\n\nThere is always a mid-day meal, and when the parents go away, the children between six and twelve are kept by the teacher\". Mr. Jackson thinks that \"this is one of the places where a little boarding school might be established.\"\n\nOf the Oak River Day School Mr. Jackson writes:\n\n\"Mr. McGraw was the last teacher here, and he tells me that the Indians would not, or could not, send their children to school, by could not, I mean lack of clothes and footwear. This is one of the points at which a small boarding school would do well.\"\n\nRev. John Semmens, on his tour of inspection, found ten children at Brokenhead River Day School, and remarks:\n\n\"During portions of the years there was a lack of wood for carrying on school work, and some irregularity resulted\".\n\nOn the South St. Peter's Day School he states:\nNumber of children enrolled 35, but the average attendance for the three months was only 7.1. This was very unsatisfactory.\n\nBut he found only five at the North St. Peter's Day School.\n\nMr. Inspector Graham does not give specific information as to actual attendance at time of inspection and average attendance. He gives prominence to the new features that are to make day schools supply the place of boarding schools. To the Goose Mountain Day School an addition has been made containing a kitchen and pantry. There is also a garden. But the provision has had to be made for boarding some of the children, for he says: \"Some seven or eight children, whose homes are at a distance, live in a log house near the school and are looked after and fed by an Indian man and his wife.\"\n\nThat is the newest improvement on residential schools for Indians as conceived by Sir John Macdonald and the practical men whose opinions have been quoted earlier in this communication. For the ordinary mortal it is difficult to conceive how children, seven or eight of them, can be better cared for in a log house by an Indian man and his wife than they would be at a regular boarding school.\n\nMr. Graham tells us that at the Assiniboine Day School \"the attendance was at one time as high as twenty four, but during the severe weather it has fallen off considerably\", but this time he found twelve children in attendance\" and was greatly pleased to note the progress that has been made during the short time the school has been opened\".\n\nMr. Inspector Chisholm reports:\n\"On Mistawasis reserve a comfortable teacher's dwelling has been provided, with pupils' dining-room attached; and by conveying the children from the more distant parts to and from school a very fair attendance has been maintained.\"\n\nHe gives no details as to attendance, so it is impossible to ascertain exactly what is meant by \"a very fair attendance\".\n\nHe goes on: \"The school on the Big River reserve is a suitable building and properly equipped; and at the interval very satisfactory work has been done. However, ..............it has not been found possible to secure a full or uniform attendance. The value of the work has been very much impaired in consequence.\"\n\n\"The average attendance at the school at Allatakakop's reserve is less than one-third of the school population\".\n\nOn the Wahapaton reserve the farmer, Inspector Chisholm tells us, acts also as teacher, but that he has \"little capacity for school work, and the attendance at best is poor\". But we are assured that there has been \"latterly a slight improvement... through the assistance of the farmer's wife\" in preparing the noon meal for the children (there are but eight of them all told) and in training them in sewing and knitting.\n\nIt is upon such \"slight improvements\" that the Superintendent of Indian Education erects the opinion paraded in his public report as to the sufficiency of day schools for Indians; and it is from such evidence that he draws his conclusion as to the \"practical beneficial result\" that has followed from the taking up of \"instruction in plain sewing, knitting and mending.\"\n\nMr Inspector Markle reports that the average attendance at Godfish Lake School for the year 1910 was 8.3; that \"there were no children present when he visited Saddle Lake Day School on...\"\nFebruary 17th last: that the \"Whitefish Day School\" has not been in operation during the past years; that he has heard that old Mr.'s Day School on the Blackfoot reserve is a \"failure\", and he adds this striking remark, which apparently has escaped the eye of the Superintendent of Education,\u2014\"It is not convenient for the children to attend any school other than a residential one.\"\n\nThe reports from which the foregoing quotations have been made appear as appendices to the recently published Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education, in which Mr. Scott speaks favorably upon the work of day school.\n\nIt has in the last few years become sadly and increasingly apparent that Indian policy has not always been shaped by teachings of experience.\n\nIn March 1911, His Grace the Archbishop of Saint Boniface was compelled by a sense of duty to submit to your predecessor a protest against the then proposed erection of an undenominational day school on the File Hills reserve. Despite that protest, a building under the guise of an hospital, has been erected by the Department of Indian Affairs. It contains two small rooms, 12 x 12, which are designated hospital wards, but the Superintendent of Education in his report calls it \"a day school\". Not far away from where this school, which may even now be about to start operation, stands, the Dominion Government recently completed and opened a large boarding school, conducted under Presbyterian auspices, in the place of the Regina School which was closed some time ago. Within some twenty miles is the large Qu'Appelle school, rebuilt at the public expense.\nAnd in need of a recruiting ground to ensure its effective continuance, and thereby a return in results for the public expenditure.\n\nSurely it is rather strange for the Department to spend public money in building that elaborate day school between these two residential schools, and in specially equipping it with kitchen, dining-room, sick-rooms, teacher's and nurse's quarters so that it may more effectively interfere with the success of the two residential schools.\n\nIt cannot be denied that it is deliberately intended to interfere with the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, for a prohibition against the recruiting for the pupils within the territory it is planned to serve was formally issued by the Department, and withdrawn at the emphatic protest of the said Archbishop.\n\nAnd then as to denominational control of that and other day schools under the new policy: It has been expressly stated by the Department that the day school at Pine Hills was to be a secular school.\n\nIt is observed that the Superintendent of Indian Education gives, in only a comparatively few instances, the denominational auspices under which day schools are conducted. Inspectors Graham and Chisholm do not give the denominational auspices of any of the day schools mentioned in their reports. It certainly looks as if a concerted effort has been made to secularize our Indian day schools. But the law provides that Indian day schools are to be denominational. Have certain officials Department decided to evoke another strife creating school question.\n\nOn behalf of himself and his venerable colleagues who signed the memorial, first referred to, respecting Indian boarding schools\nthe undersigned would respectfully ask your consideration of what is set forth herein, believing that you will readily see the necessity, in the public interest, as well as in the interest of the Indian wards of the Government, of corrective action being taken in respect to the Indian educational party that has come into sway.\n\nAccept, Honorable and Dear Sir, the assurance of our regards and best wishes, and believe us,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSaint Boniface, Manitoba,\nNovember 18th 1912.\n\n(Signed)\n\nAdelard, O.M.I.,\nArch.de St.Boniface\nEmile J., O.M.I.,\nEv\u00eaque de St.Albert\nAlbert Hamel, O.M.I.,\nEv\u00eaque de Prince-Albert.\nOlivier Pl\u00e9bard,\nEv\u00eaque de R\u00e9gina.\nEmile Crouard, O.M.I., Ev\u00eaque d'Ibora,\nVic.Apost.d'Atabasca.\nThe Honorable,\n\nRobert Rogers, P.C.,\n\nMinister of the Interior\n\nand\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nThe undersigned, at a meeting held on the occasion of the induction into his see of the recently appointed bishop of Regina, have had under consideration the contract for the conduct and management and maintenance of Indian Boarding Schools entered into between your predecessors in office and the Principals of such said schools as are under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe draft of the contract was submitted by the then Superintendent General at a conference held at Ottawa on the 8th November, last, between him and certain officials of the headquarters staff of the Department of Indian Affairs, on the one part, and representatives of Churches Conducting Indian schools, on the other part.\n\nThe representatives of the Churches had not been previously advised of the terms or tenor of the contract; and the careful consideration which the undersigned have given it compels them to the conclusion that the said representatives had not that opportunity of deliberating it which the importance of the contract demanded.\n\nThe undersigned find that the contract, hurriedly entered into, is lacking in certain essentials and in several\nrespects faulty.\n\nThey, therefore, beg to be permitted to recite the defects they find in the contract, and to set forth in some detail the reasons of their finding:\n\n1. The contract lacks statutory authority. In the sections of the Indian Act treating particularly of schools, being Sections 9, 10 and 11, of Chapter 81, Revised Statutes, 1906, there is no mention of contract schools; nor is any authority conferred, by those or any other sections of that Act, or by any statute of the Parliament of Canada, upon the Governor in Council, or upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to enter into contracts for the conduct and management of Indian schools.\n\nA contract by which the party of the second part, i.e., the representative of the Church under whose auspices the school named therein is conducted, assumes large responsibilities and is obligated to incur outlays on works of a permanent nature, in addition to the continuous burden of expenditure incident to maintenance and management, should have the sanction necessary to afford the amplest security to the party aforesaid. As it is, the party of the part, i.e., the Superintendent General, can not, and does not, bind himself to perform his essential part of the bargain, that is to meet the payments to be made in consideration of the due performance of the work contracted to be done by the party of the second part. The clause marked \"V\" stipulates that there shall be no liability to make any payment to the school under the contract \"should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment .......be at any time expended during the continuance...\"\nUp to the adoption of the contract system a policy had been in operation which in its working was somewhat elastic. Under it the Department undertook to contribute to the maintenance of denominationally controlled residential schools for Indians through the payment of a per capita grant. But the policy was not bound in rigid bands; and contributions to the schools were made by the Department in more ways than through the per capita grant. Contributions were made to help in the erection of certain school buildings, the ownership of which was recognized to be in the Church under whose auspices these institutions were to be conducted. And when considerable expenditure had been, or was to be, undertaken for additions, improvements or repairs, the Department not infrequently came to the assistance of the Church by meeting in whole or in part the expenditure. The per capita grants paid under that policy cannot, therefore, be taken as the full measure of the liability which the Department in practice assumed in respect of those schools.\n\nNow that policy has passed from the easy elastic state to the rigid contract form, under which aid can neither be obtained for nor given to those schools beyond the fixed per capita grant. And the party of the first part is tightly bound to the performance of onerous obligations to the State, while the State appears to be bound not at all to make the compensatory payments.\n\nIt is true that the agreement, in the beginning, sets forth that the Superintendent General represents His Majesty the King; but, as there is no Parliamentary authority for thus assuming monetary obligations, nor apparently any sanction by\nthe Governor in Council of the contract, the undersigned doubt whether the Superintendent could constitutionally bind the Crown to the terms of the contract. Yet it is obvious that there should be equally binding obligations upon both parties to the contract. And when a public policy of import assumes contractual form, it seems but the part of wisdom to have it sanctioned by the highest authority.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit for your consideration the advisability of the Indian Act being so amended at the present session of the Dominion Parliament as to duly authorize the system of contract schools adopted by the Department of Indian Affairs. And to bring the proposal before you in concrete form, they beg leave to suggest the following amendment:\u2014\n\n\"That Section 10 of the said Act be hereby amended by adding the following Sub-Section thereto:\u2014\n\n\"The Superintendent General may, with the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into contracts with any church or religious denomination carrying on missionary work among the Indians for the conduct and maintenance of such industrial or boarding schools, or of any industrial or boarding schools established for Indians, with the approval, consent or concurrence of the Superintendent General, by any such church or religious denomination, whether the buildings in connection therewith be or be not the property of the Crown, and may assume under such contracts the payment of per capita grants to any or all of such schools for the education, keep and proper care of children, in whole or in part of Indian blood, admitted under rules or regulations made by the Superintendent General.\"\nfrom time to time, or with his approval or consent, and in accordance with the terms of the contracts.\"\n\nSuch an amendment would give the desired sanction and security. It would give to the contract system that element of permanency which is essential to its success. Without adequate guarantee of stability and reasonable surety of compensatory payment for work done, there is no sufficient warrant for the party of the second part incurring capital expenditure and assuming costly and onerous obligations under the contract. That is so obvious that the undersigned can not conceive of objection being taken to such an amendment, except on factious grounds. But if objection were taken, it seems to the undersigned that this would be a ready and ample answer:\n\nThe contract system was adopted by the late administration; the late minister entered into contracts with representatives of different churches for the conduct and maintenance of Indian schools; the contracts have gone into operation; they lack proper sanction; they were entered into without requisite authority; all that is now sought is to make them regular, and to afford reasonable security for the expenditure which has already been and is being incurred under them.\n\n2. And, now, the undersigned, apologizing for having to continue to trespass, and to such great extent, upon your very valuable and so much occupied time, venture to deal, serially, with the fault in the contract itself.\n\nSub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4 provides\u2014\n\n\"That no Half-breed child shall be admitted...unless Indian children can not be obtained to complete the number...\"\nauthorized by Article I., Section I., and Section 4. (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II., Section I., of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever.\n\nThat, the undersigned submit, is a very drastic provision and pregnant of such evil. It is contrary to the policy which long obtained, and against which no reasonable objection has been or can be urged. And in a measure, it is obviously ultra vires.\n\nHalf-breeds may be grouped into three fairly well defined classes.\n\n1. Those who live, in varying degrees of conditions, the ordinary settled life of the country.\n\n2. Those who live, in varying degrees, the Indian mode of life.\n\n3. Those who - and they form the most unfortunate class in the community - are the illegitimate offspring of Indian women, and of whom white men are the begetters.\n\nThose of the first class make no claim upon the Government of the Dominion for the education of their children; nor has any such claim, as far as the knowledge of the undersigned goes, been made in their behalf.\n\nThe third class are entitled to participate in the benefits of the Indian schools; and in so far as the afore quoted provision of the contract is designed to exclude them from such participation\nit is ultra vires of the parties to the contract, or of any authority save that of the Dominion Parliament itself.\n\nSection 12, the very first of the Sections of the Indian Act dealing with \"Membership of Indian Bands,\" enacts as follows:\n\n\"Any illegitimate child may, unless he has, with the consent of the band whereof the father or mother of such child is a member, shared in the distribution moneys of such band for a period exceeding two years, be, at any time, excluded from the membership thereof by the Superintendent General.\"\n\nIt follows from that, that the illegitimate child of an Indian woman having membership in a band is ipso facto a member of the band to which the mother belongs, and can only be removed from membership in such band by the Superintendent General, if he sees fit to exercise the power conferred upon him by the law; and that, if the child has participated for over two years in the moneys of the band, with the consent of the band (and acquiescence constitutes consent within the meaning of the provision), then there is no authority under the law for the removal of such child from membership. Such child is legally entitled to recognition as having full membership in the mother's band, unless the Superintendent General exercises his right of exclusion within the period aforesaid, which exclusion can not be by way of general order or act, but must be by specific order or act in each case; and every such child not so excluded is entitled to all the benefits of band membership, including Indian educational privileges; and no such child can be contracted out of such privileges.\nWhen Indian treaties are made the illegitimate children are taken into and given all the benefits of treaty irrespective of the blood of the fathers. In years after the existing treaties were made, subsequently born illegitimate children of Indian treaty women were excluded and payment of annuity money for them or on their behalf was refused. That policy appears to have been adopted to discourage illegitimate breeding. How far it has operated in that direction those who have been for years in close contact with Indians know best. The undersigned are not aware of the form or the order or act by which such policy was put in operation, but they know that its operation has varied in times and places. Such children have been by one Indian Agent recognized as having band membership, by another they have been excluded; one year they are admitted, another year they are debarred.\n\nBut whatever be the object of the policy of exclusion, whatever be the variations in its application, or whatever be its results, such of those children as are being excluded under it are being excluded illegally, unless each such child has been specifically excluded from band membership by the Superintendent General as aforesaid.\n\nThe undersigned would, therefore, respectfully ask that, if the view of the case of those children as herein stated appears to you to be correct, you would have the goodness to issue an order which will promptly bring the policy and practice of the Department with respect to them into full accord with the law.\n\nAs to the second class of Half-breeds, the undersigned at once admit that they present a difficult educational problem. But the very difficulty affords a strong reason against drawing a hard and fast line such as is drawn in the agreement.\nThis second class of half-breeds may be divided into three groups:\n\n(1) Those who generally live apart from Indians, but follow somewhat the Indian mode of life, fishing, hunting and trapping, and to some extent engage in freighting, a business which narrows as railways extend. To this group may be added those who hang about towns, doing odd jobs when necessity compels them to work, and eking out a precarious existence, oftentimes, unfortunately, after a fashion which makes not for their own or the community's good.\n\n(2) Those who live in the vicinity of Indian Reserves, mingle more or less freely with Indians, and follow the Indian mode of life.\n\n(3) Those who live on Indian Reserves, with tacit or expressed consent, and live the life of Indians.\n\nWhen, and for years after, Indian residential schools were established, half-breeds of the three groups of this second class, as well as those of the third class already dealt with herein, were admitted. In the early years of these schools, when all existing were classed as industrial, the whole expense of the cost and management was met out of the public revenue, and there was then no possibility of dividing, as is now done, pupils into grant-earning and non-grant-earning classes. And after the Departmental system of contributing by per capita grant to the support of residential schools was adopted, which was during the incumbency of the Indian Commissionership by Mr. Hayter Reed, half-breeds of the second, as well as of the third class, continued to be admitted as grant earners.\nnow and then, perhaps, there being a refusal in the case of a child whose parents would come within the first group of the second class, while quite close to the fringe of the first class. But, indeed, the practice of the Department was very liberal.\n\nSoon after 1896, certain officials of the administrative branch of the Department at headquarters, whose animus in the matter was evidently begotten of theory formed in the closet rather than of contact with conditions, succeeded in having a rule made excluding all half-breed children from Indian schools. When, however, reasoned objection was taken to that rule before the then Superintendent General, the Honorable Clifford Sifton, he set it aside and directed that the children of Half-breeds living on or in the vicinity of Indian Reserves, and following the Indian mode of life, should be admitted as grant-earners to Indian residential schools. The rule then made by him, when fairly followed, covered pretty fully the classes of Half-breeds whose education can only be properly provided for in such schools. Shortly after Mr. Oliver took office, Mr. Sifton's sane rule, if not formally rescinded, was allowed to lapse into desuetude, and the rule which had, on good grounds, been set aside, was revived, put into operation, and finally crystallized in Sub-Clause \"b\" of Clause 4. of the contract.\n\nThe Half-breed children now excluded from Indian schools are in a most unfortunate position. Their \"homes\" are not homes in our sense of the word. They dwell in tepees or huts in shacks. Their environment militates against moral and physical development, and breaks down instead of building up character. What is so readily and so often charged against a people of mixed blood is the result, not of blood, but of environment.\n\nIt is begging the question for the Department to take\nthe position, as it has, that it is duty of the Provincial Governments to provide education for half-breeds. As you very well know, and as anyone at all familiar with conditions knows, there are no Provincial institutions in which the required kind of education can be provided for half-breeds of the second and third classes herein described. Even if the white rate-payers of school districts were willing to admit such children to their day schools, not as Pariahs, but on a footing of equality with their own sons and daughters, the sad condition of these half-breed children would not, in any effective degree, be ameliorated. As educational agencies day schools presuppose a home environment that makes, at least, not against mental and moral development. And anyone that is cognizant of the conditions that obtain must know that our Indian residential schools are the only existing agencies for the proper up-bringing of those unfortunate children. If they are excluded from these schools, what can they be expected to become but outcasts and menaces to society?\n\nThe Department seems to have acted upon the supposition that the Government of Canada assumed the burden of providing for the education of Indian children in residential schools solely to meet obligations imposed by treaties with Indians; and from that hypothesis to have reached the conclusion that the Dominion Government is not justified in increasing the burden by extending the benefits of the system to half-breeds who are not recognized by it as having membership in Indian bands. But the man who laid the foundation of the system, Sir John MacDonald, had no such narrow view.\nUnder his administration the policy was adopted and followed of admitting Half-breeds of the aforesaid second and third classes into those schools. And that policy was in accord with the basic purpose of the system; for such schools were established not merely to meet treaty obligations towards Indians, but as a means of preventing, in the public interest, a race of wild men growing up whose hands would be against all men and all men's hands against them.\n\nThe Government of Canada never took the position in the past that it had no obligations at all as to Half-breeds. It recognized them as possessing, in a degree, an aboriginal title to the land of this country, and took measures to compensate for its extinguishment. In other ways and at different times it helped these people. It gave to the children of certain of them the right of entry as regular pupils of Indian schools, and in doing so created a right in the nature of a vested right, and destruction of which is an injustice, and against the interest of the commonwealth.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit that the afore-quoted excluding clause of the contract should be expunged; and that the old and wise policy, or, at the very least, Mr. Sifton's rule, be reverted to and made permanent by incorporation in the contract.\n\n3. Clause 6 of the contract badly provides that the \"school shall be conducted under such regulations as may from time to time be approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\"\nThose regulations, which would be framed in the Department, and might, in the pressure of Governmental business, or in the ordinary course of routine matters, to be approved of, could easily be so framed as to practically exclude, or unduly interfere with, the teaching of religion.\n\nIt is true that under clause 9 the managers of the school are required \"to provide... teachers and officers qualified to give the pupils religious instruction at the proper times.\" But that provision inferentially makes the Superintendent General the sole and final judge of the qualification of \"teachers and officers\" to impart \"religious instruction,\" and of what are \"the proper times\" at which such \"religious instruction\" should be given. It occurs to the undersigned that no theological a function as that would not be pleasantly assumed by a Minister of State in Canada. Ethical training being wisely recognized as essential in Indian education by the Government of Canada from the very beginning of its relations with Indians, Indian schools were put under the auspices of different religious denominations carrying on missionary work among them to make it impossible the clash which might occur between the views of a minister of the Crown as to the nature and scope of the ethical training that should be imparted and the tenets of the church to which the particular Indians to be so trained belonged. Indeed this provision of Clause 9 seems to the undersigned to have been intended rather for undenominational than for denominational schools, and to have been drafted by one holding the view that religious instruction can be adequately imparted irrespective of ecclesiastical dogma. From that view the undersigned must, of course, most unhesitatingly and most emphatically dissent.\nThe undersigned are convinced that you will readily agree that it is the part of wisdom to obviate all possibility of conflict as to religious teaching in the administration of the contract system of Indian schools; and that to that end it would be advisable to have an explicit provision in the contract securing the teaching of religion in the school in accordance with the tenets of the church under whose auspices the school is conducted.\n\nThey would, therefore, suggest that the said Clause 6 be amended by adding thereto the following proviso:\n\n\"Provided that no such regulation shall prohibit, or interfere with the teaching of religion in the said school in accordance with the tenets of the church under the auspices of which the said school is conducted;\n\n4. By Clause 8 of the contract it is covenanted\n\n\"Not to employ, except on probation for a period not exceeding six months, at said school any teacher or instructor until evidence satisfactory to the Superintendent General has been submitted to him that such teacher or instructor is able to converse with the pupils under his charge in English, and is able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly, and possesses such other qualifications as, in the opinion of the Superintendent General, may be necessary.\"\n\nThat is a hard and fast provision, compliance with which is practically impossible; yet its violation in any respect would vitiate the contract.\n\nIt is not only required that every \"teacher\" and \"instructor\" shall be able to speak and to write the English language \"fluently and correctly\", but the party responsible for the conduct of the school under the contract must furnish the\nwith evidence satisfactory\", and within \"six months\" of the date of the employment of every teacher and instructor, that every \"such teacher or instructor.... is able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly.\"........\n\nIt is required by Clause 9 of the contract that \"gardening, farming, and care of stock..., cooking, laundry-work, needle-work, general housewifery and dairy-work\" shall be taught.\n\nTherefore, the farmers, gardeners, and stockmen, the cooks, laundresses, and seamstresses, the house-keepers and the dairy-women must be able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly;\" for each of them is an instructor under the contract, and the party of the second part covenants that each shall \"instruct the pupils of the school\" in his or her line of work.\n\nNow, everybody knows that there are cooks and dairy-women and house-wifery experts, laundresses, and seamstresses, gardeners and farmers and stockmen, competent in their various callings, and good, practical instructors in the work thereof, who, while they speak English well enough for properly training others along their own vocational lines, cannot \"speak and write English fluently and correctly.\" They are exceptions who do.\nWe understand that something has already been done by the Department to mitigate the rigor of the clause we object to. Therefore our considerations in the first edition of this memo are no more relevant, and we suppressed them. Still we believe that something more should be done to make things less stringent. For instance, we suggest the elimination of the word instructor.\nIf it be necessary to convenant to secure the teaching of English in schools where the force of necessity compels its being learned, let the following be substituted:\n\"8. To duly provide for the pupils of the said school being taught to speak, read and write the English language to the same extent that pupils are so taught in the ordinary schools of the country.\"\n\nSuch a provision would secure, if special security in that respect be required, adequate teaching to Indian pupils. If in addition, they hear and become in some measure familiar with French, no danger to the commonwealth will result therefrom, nor will they be thereby the less well equipped for the battle of life.\n\n5. The conditions intended to be imposed by Clauses 12, 13 and the first part of 18 should have been more aptly, clearly and comprehensively expressed. They are as follows:\n\n\"12. To keep and maintain the school buildings and premises, to supply proper sanitation and sanitary appliances, and to keep the buildings free from flies, insects and vermin\"\n\n\"13. To maintain the buildings at the said school and the school premises when they are the property of the (blank) in good condition and repair, the whole to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General.\"\n\n\"18. To make any change or alteration in the school building or premises.......\"\n\nIn considering those provisions reference must be made to the \"Memorandum\" which appears immediately before the draft the contract in the blue booklet entitled \"Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools.\"\n\nThe following are excerpts therefrom:\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS CLASS 'A'.\n\nThe buildings owned by the church which would entitle the school to a per capita grant of $100.00 in the eastern division and $125.00 in the western division should conform to the following general specifications:\n\n1. Substantial building either of brick, stone, cement or wood in good state of repair.\n\n2. To be built on a stone or cement foundation with a light airy basement of full size of main building with cement floor.\n\n3. Pure and plentiful water supply distributed throughout the building.\n\n4. A proper system of sanitary water-closets, drainage, and disposal of sewage.\n\n5. Hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils ill with infectious disease or tuberculosis.\n\n6. Modern system of ventilation in dormitories and class-rooms and sufficient air space in dormitories and class-rooms for the number of pupils accommodated.\n\n7. Modern heating apparatus, hot water, steam or hot air.\n\n8. Sufficient area of land for farms and gardens and practical industrial work, where such work can be carried on.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS CLASS 'B'.\n\nThe buildings owned by the government which would entitle the management to $90.00 per capita in the eastern division and $100.00 in the western division class must conform to the requirements of clauses 5, 6, and 8, of class 'A'.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS CLASS 'C'.\n\nBuildings owned by the churches which do not in all particulars conform to the specifications in class 'A' and 'B' and which are nevertheless sanitary and kept in a good state of repair, and which would entitle the school to $80.00 per capita in the eastern division and $100.00 per capita in the western division. The buildings in this class must conform to the requirements of clauses 5, 6, and 8, of class 'A'.\nThe specific re-statement in the paragraph dealing with schools in Class C of the requirements of Class A which have to be met by them makes it clear that the general statement in that paragraph that the schools coming within Class C are to be \"nevertheless sanitary and kept in a good state of repair\" can not fairly be interpreted to mean that those schools are to be called upon to meet in regard to sanitariness the specific and costly requirements of Class A, the schools of which class, in consideration of the more costly and extensive improvement required, are paid $25.00 per capita more than the schools Class C. The buildings to be scheduled in Class C are described as \"buildings owned by the churches which do not in all particulars conform to the specifications in Class A,\" what of the specific requirements of that class are to be provided in their case being the things described in section b, c and d of the paragraph describing the requirements of Class A, namely, isolated hospital accommodation, modern system of ventilation, sufficient air space, and adequate land for farms and gardens, where farming and gardening can be carried on. As to sanitariness, all that can be insisted upon is that such school buildings shall be made and kept sanitary as similar buildings are ordinarily made and kept sanitary, without \"light airy basement,\" \"water supply distributed,\" \"system of sanitary water-closets, drainage and disposal of sewage,\" all of which requirements specifically set forth as necessary for Class A, but are not so set forth as required for Class C. And the reason for their not being set forth as requisite for the latter classification is quite obvious; for, if these costly things had to be provided for entry into Class C, and to secure the per capita grant of $100.00 payable to schools in that class, it would be the veriest improvidence not to meet the other\nrequirements of Class A and secure the per capita grant of $125.00 especially as, in a climate marked by severe cold in winter, \"modern heating apparatus\", a requirement of Class A which is strangely not insisted upon, as are the other things mentioned for Class C, would be essential to a system of water distribution, water-flushing closets and pipe drainage throughout buildings, which are insisted upon, on the reports made on certain schools by a sanitary expert employed by the Department last summer to examine the buildings, after they had been, under special instructions from the Department, examined, not by the School Inspector, but by the regular Inspectors of Agencies, and on their reports classified for the purposes of the contract by the Department.\n\nThe changes and improvements ordered are, in almost every case in which the undersigned have been advised of the said experts' specifications, so vastly out of proportion to the building itself as to be quite absurd. Take, for instance, the school at Selma. It has had, since its establishment, never more than an authorized attendance of twenty. It is classes C. Yet it is required that the building shall be done over and entirely remodelled. Stone foundations are to be changed, ceiling made higher, windows enlarged, and hard wood floors laid and oiled and finished in shellac. Each dormitory is to be provided with \"one water closet...automatic low tank combination operated with push button\" and \"one cast iron enamelled bath.\" Galvanized iron tanks are to be put on the second floor, from which water is to be distributed throughout the building by gravitation; and the floors and walls are to be strengthened to sustain the tanks. A sewage system, with septic tanks, is to be installed.\nAnd all those things are in addition to the specific requirements of Class C., as to isolated hospital et cetera.\n\nThe undersigned know of only one school classed C., in the territory toured by the said expert that would warrant the assuming of such burdens. That school is Ermineskin's at Hobbema. And because certain of the improvements called for have been made and the others are to be gone on with, its classification should be changed to A.\n\nOver and above the objections herein made to the extensive and costly improvements demanded, on an unwarranted interpretation of the official description of the requirements of Class C., the undersigned regard the requirement of isolated hospital accommodation as excessive.\n\nAn isolated hospital, a building standing alone and devoted to the treatment of virulently contagious diseases, necessitates special provision for heating, special culinary arrangements, special provision for laundering, and an addition to the staff of the school to which it appertains.\n\nNow a school with twenty or thirty, or even forty or so pupils, can not in reason be expected to bear the burden of building, equipping and maintaining such an hospital.\n\nWhere outside of the Indian Department is such a requirement dreamed of? How many hamlets, villages, and even towns of the west have isolated hospitals? And where there are such hospitals, the health regulations permit persons struck with certain infectious diseases being kept at their own homes if proper isolation can be effected. And for proper isolation, even in cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria, it is not necessary that the stricken ones\nshould be put under a different roof, and those suffering from\none disease separated by a doorless wall from those taken down with\nanother, as Dr. Lafferty insisted should be done at Crowfoot's\nSchool on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThe isolated hospitals demanded are to have accommodation\nit is stipulated, for \"infectious disease or tuberculosis.\" It\nwould be an unprecedented, and a dangerous and cruel proceeding,\nto put tubercular cases with cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria or\nsmall-pox. Phthisis is not virulently contagious. The best\nmedical opinion, the undersigned are given to understand, is that\nit can be safely treated without isolation, if simple precautions\nare taken; and, indeed, it is well known that very many suffering\nfrom that dread disease are, under medical direction, so treated\nin homes that, to say the least, have not better accommodation\nthan is afforded by the infirmaries already provided at the schools.\n\nThe Department itself did not provide in connection\nwith the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, which it built and owns, and\nin which there are in residence some two hundred and twenty-five\npupils, any isolated hospital. The only hospital provided is on the\ntop flat of the main building and has not even a balcony, though the\nopen air treatment is the approved one for tuberculosis, and most\ndesirable as a means of affording a sunning to all convalescents.\n\nWhy, then, should the same Department insist that\nchurch schools with an attendance of one or two score, and paid only\n$100.00 per capita, shall have such isolated hospitals as have\nbeen demanded?\nAll that should reasonably be called for is a special infirmary in the building, safeguarded to prevent contagion, and in area proportionate to the capacity of the school building, the same to be kept in readiness for the isolation of pupils who might contract infectious diseases. If such a disease spread, the school would have, as residential schools have had, to take on the circumstances of an isolated hospital.\n\nIt is important to have a clear description of what is required in the way of hospital accommodation. Schools have been submitted to vexatious requirements by physicians, whose interest therein appears to have been in large measure confined to making unnecessary demands. For sometime, indeed, it has been painfully evident that the Department's medical policy has been inspired by faddism.\n\nThe undersigned would be quite satisfied if the schools scheduled in Class C were only called upon to meet requirements proper to that class; for the increase from $72.00 to $100.00 per capita would warrant the necessary expenditure; and the improvements, with the increased yearly income, would enable those schools to better serve the purpose for which they are intended.\n\nThe description of the classes of schools, the undersigned respectfully submit, should have been incorporated in the contract. As they stand, it would not appear that they can be held to be part of it; and clauses 12, 13 and 16 are so loosely framed and capable of so broad and variant interpretations that almost anything in the way of alterations and improvements can be demanded. It seems to the undersigned to\nbe quite obviously in the interest of both parties there to that\nthe contract entered into for each and every school should\ndefinitely and clearly set forth what improvements are to be\nmade and maintained in order to entitle the school to receive\na per capita grant of $100.00 or $125.00, as the case may be.\nAnd to that end the undersigned would ask that the contract\nbe amended.\n\n6. By clause 18 of the contract the party of the\nsecond part is required\u2014\n\n(1) \"To make any change or alteration in the school\nbuilding or premises, or (2) in the management or control of\nthe said school rendered necessary to comply with the intent\nand spirit of the agreement, and (3) to remove for the cause from\nthe said school any teacher, officer, employee, or pupil when\nrequired to do so by the Superintendent General.\"\n\nTo be properly canvassed this clause must be taken\napart and divided, as marked by the undersigned in the above\nquotation of it.\n\nIts first section should have been embodied in a\nclause covering the matter of clauses 18 and 19.\n\nBut, apart from that, which is after all only a fault\nin drafting, the first section is objectionable in that it de-\nstroys finality in the matter of improvement, and enables the\nparty of the first part to demand, at any time after the changes\nand improvements first required have been acceptably made, further\nalterations, which may be extensive and costly and destructive\nof expensive improvements made by order of the Department at\nthe time of entering into the contract. Under this provision,\nmanagers of schools may find themselves embarrassed by\nDepartmental approval of the recommendations of Inspectors or\nAgents with fads; and school managers, unfortunately, are not with-\nout experience of such faddists.\nThe undersigned, therefore, respectfully submit that, in recasting the contract, it should be made clear that, when the changes and improvements called for by the requirements of the class in which the school is placed have been acceptably made and such improvements are being duly maintained, there shall be no obligation to make any further changes, alterations or improvements during the continuance of the contract.\n\n7. The second section of Clause 18 is particularly objectionable and dangerous. It empowers the party of the first part \"to make any change or alteration....in the management or control of the school rendered necessary to comply with the intent and spirit of the agreement\", of which necessity the said party is to be the sole and final judge.\n\nThe word \"management\" means and is intended for \"managers\" the word used by the undersigned in their review of the contract to prevent confusion with the word management as used in the title and generally throughout the contract. But, if there were room for doubt as to the sense in which the word \"management\" is used in the clause now under consideration, it is entirely removed by the addition of the word \"control\" which is sufficiently comprehensive to be inclusive of the meaning of \"auspices\" as that word is used when it is stated that a certain school is conducted under the auspices of a certain church. The provision is certainly very wide and far reaching.\nThe undersigned can find no provision in the contract for the school being conducted under the auspices of a particular church. If such a provision be not within the four corners of the contract, then it would not be contrary to its \"intent and spirit\", and, indeed, might be found necessary thereto, to change the auspices.\n\nThat may be regarded as quite unlikely to happen, and too far fetched a contingency to guard against. However that may be, this might happen:\n\nA school might come to be regarded by an Inspector or Agent as being too religiously conducted, and, on his report, the ecclesiastical \"management or control\" thereof might be changed to lay management and control.\n\nOr it might come to be considered that the \"management\" was not sufficiently Anglicized or too Frenchified, and that it was, therefore, necessary to due compliance with the \"intent and spirit of the agreement\" to change or alter the management and control.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully submit that each contract should set forth the designation of the church or religious denominations under whose auspices the school is conducted; that, in the case of each school conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Church, the designation of the order or community of priests or nuns the school is managed or controlled by at the time of the entering into the contract should be set forth therein; and it should be provided that no change shall be made in such management or control without the consent or concurrence of the Ordinary of the diocese or vicariate in which the school is situated.\n8. The third section of clause 18 empowers the party of the first part to have removed, \"for cause\", from the school any teacher, officer, employee, or pupil.\n\nThe term \"for cause\" is dangerously indefinite. It is not difficult to allege a cause. The question always is as to its sufficiency. Under the section a teacher, officer or employee might be removed because he or she used, even in English, French idiomatic forms of expression, or spoke with too French an accent, or conversed or prayed with pupils in other than the English tongue. A teacher might be removed because he or she did not hold a certificate from one of a certain number of Normal Schools. A child might be removed and placed in a school conducted under other religious auspices.\n\nThe undersigned respectfully submit that the clause should be so amended as to set forth the causes for which removal may be made. In the cases of teachers, officers and employees the grounds for removal should be confined to incompetency, unbecoming conduct, and violation of the terms of the contract or of Departmental regulations not inconsistent therewith. Pupils should only be removed, before the full period for which they entered, for serious offenses in the nature of crimes under the law, or on account of incurable disease or of disease inimical to the health of the other pupils, or because of utter intractability; and it should be provided that a pupil so removed shall not be placed in a school conducted under religious auspices different from that under which the school from which the removal is made is conducted.\n9. In the part of the agreement which sets forth the obligations of the Superintendent General under the contract, he covenants, under Clause 2 thereof, \"to provide the pupils of... the school with medicines, school-books, stationary, and school appliances.\"\n\nIt is the practice to also furnish medical attendance; and the undersigned respectfully submit that the clause should be so amended as to include it.\n\n10. Under Clause III the party of the first part takes power to \"cancel and rescind\" the contract on his sole judgment that \"any of the covenants and stipulations\" therein have not been complied with, on giving six months notice.\n\nThe undersigned regard that as rather an extensive power to take without the right of appeal on the part of the other party to the contract, who, in virtue of it, incurs large outlay and assumes serious responsibilities; and they would, therefore, suggest that the clause be amended so as to give the party of the second part the right to appeal against an order of cancellation to the Governor in Council within six months of the date of such order, it being provided that such order shall set forth the grounds of cancellation, so that the same may be attacked if an appeal be made.\n\n11. By Clause V it is provided that there shall be no liability to make any payment to the school under the contract \"should the amount voted by Parliament and applicable towards payment... be at any time expended during the continuance of this contract.\"\nThe Indian educational appropriation, the undersigned understand, is voted in bulk, and not for particular schools or classes of schools. Through over expenditure in one direction there might be lack of funds to meet payments due in another. Or there might be neglect to estimate for monies payable under the contract. There is no expressed obligation under the contract to estimate for payments to the school the maintenance of which by its managers is contracted for, or to ask Parliament for the necessary money for the per capita grant stipulated.\n\nIt seems to the undersigned that those obligations should be expressed in the contract. Indeed, they venture to think that it would not be going too far to ask that it be agreed that the name of the school and the amount provided for it, be set forth in the Supply Bill. That would give Parliamentary sanction to each contract, would ensure that no money voted for the school could be diverted, and would stop any demands for additional payments to the school.\n\nIf you, Honorable Sir, should find the contract sufficiently faulty to warrant its recasting, it would, the undersigned respectfully suggest, be well to have it so recast that no room for doubt might remain as to its movements and conditions, its spirit and intent. In the recasting, it should, the undersigned venture to suggest, be borne in mind that the Indian educational system has now proceeded \"from status to contract\". In the former condition there was nothing hard or fast. Variant conditions and unforeseen contingencies could be at any time taken into consideration, and\nan unpropitious financial situation might at any time be ameliorated by aid other than the per capita grant. Claims could be made for the meeting by the Department or certain expenditures; and such claims were often met. No such aid can be looked for, no such claims are entertainable under the contract system. It is right.\n\nIt crystallizes a policy. There is no room for give or take. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the conditions should be clearly expressed and that no room be left for misunderstanding. It is of the very essence of a contract to aptly describe the things contracted for. And, when a public policy of import assumes contract form, it is as already observed the part of wisdom to have it sanctioned by the highest authority of the State.\n\nWe beg you, Honorable Sir, to accept the assurance of our high esteem, and to be us,\n\nYour faithful servants,\n\n(Signed) Adelard\n\nO.

In pursuance of what was then believed to be sound policy, these schools were, generally speaking, located at points distant from Indian reserves, and for this reason there was frequently considerable difficulty in securing a sufficient attendance of Indian pupils to earn the grant adequate for their upkeep.\n\nTo meet the educational needs of the Indian children who could not for one reason or another be provided for in the industrial schools already mentioned, from time to time boarding schools were established on a number of reserves at the charge of the various religious bodies. It was a fundamental principle in the case of the industrial schools that the government erected the buildings at government cost, while in the case of the boarding schools the church erected the buildings at the cost of the church. In recognition of the efforts towards Indian education by the erection of these boarding schools, and to substantially assist the churches in their work, a grant per head was made by the government towards their support.\n\nAs time went on, it became more and more apparent that the boarding schools were filling a want that the industrial schools had not filled, and for this reason instead of the number of industrial schools having been increased, the number of boarding schools has been increased. With this increase in the number of boarding schools, the burden of their support upon the various churches has correspondingly increased, and as the buildings which were erected in the first place by the churches have required repair or enlargement the government has from time to time, and in many cases, been called upon to provide these enlargements, improvements, and repairs. Besides, there have been occasions when the difference between the contribution of the government and the actual cost of maintaining the school was greater than the church interested in the school felt itself able to provide, and the government was called upon to meet the deficiency.\n\nThis was not a desirable condition from the point of view either of the church or of the government. If there had been a prospect of these conditions being improved, there might not have been need of change, but all reports tended to show that, far from the probability that this condition would improve, it was likely to become aggravated year by year. Realizing the importance of the educational work being done by\nMEMORANDUM REFERRED TO IN THE LETTER OF NOVEMBER 26, 1910.\n\nFor the purpose of deciding upon a proper geographical division of the boarding schools to serve each of the railway sections of Ontario, it is proposed to divide the province into Eastern, Western and Northern divisions. The Eastern division (850) will include all the following schools, which are located within 300 miles from a railway station:\n\n- Almonte, Moose Factory, Rat Portage and Cecilia Jeffery.\n- Lac la Biche, Whitefish Lake, Slave Lake, Spruce Lake, Fort Frances, Rat Portage and Cecilia Jeffery.\n- Lake Nipigon and Fort Providence.\n- The Western division (800) will include all the other boarding schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, including the three Ontario boarding schools mentioned above, i.e., Fort Frances, Rat Portage and Cecilia Jeffery.\n\nThe number of children to be accommodated in each school is to be fixed by the contract. The limit is to be fixed by the government, but it should not exceed 500 cubic feet per child. In the case of new schools, the limit is to be fixed by the government, but it should not exceed 500 cubic feet per child. In the case of existing schools, the limit is to be fixed by the government, but it should not exceed 500 cubic feet per child.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS \"A.\"\n\nThe buildings owned by the church which would entitle the school to a per capita grant of $100 in the Eastern division and $125 in the Western division should conform to the following general specifications:\n\n1. Substantial building, either of brick, stone, cement or wood, in good state of repair.\n2. To be built on a stone or cement foundation, with a light airy basement of full size of main building with cement floor.\n3. Pure and plentiful water-supply distributed throughout the building.\n4. A proper system of sanitary water-closets, drainage and disposal of sewage.\n5. Hospital accommodation for pupils ill with infectious disease or tuberculosis.\n\nIndian Affairs. (No. 10, Volume 6039, File 160-7, Part 1)\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\n\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n6. Modern system of ventilation in dormitories and classrooms, and sufficient air space in dormitories and classrooms for the number of pupils accommodated.\n\n7. Modern heating apparatus, hot water, steam or hot air.\n\n8. Sufficient area of land for farms and gardens for practical industrial work, where such work can be carried on.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS \"B.\"\n\nThe buildings owned by the government which would entitle the management to $80 per capita in the Eastern division and $100 per capita in the Western division would be the same as described in Class \"A.\"\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS, CLASS \"C.\"\n\nBuildings owned by the churches which do not in all particulars conform to the specifications in Classes \"A\" and \"B,\" and which are nevertheless sanitary and kept in good state of repair, and which would entitle the school to $80 per capita in the Eastern division and $100 per capita in the Western division. The buildings in this class must conform to the requirements of clauses V., VI., and VII. of Class \"A.\"\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS (IN EFFECT FROM APRIL 1, 1911, FOR A TERM OF FIVE YEARS).\n\nThis Agreement made this day of\n\nby and between His Majesty The King,\n\none thousand nine hundred and\n\nrepresented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and the\n\nparties heretofore called the Superintendent General I., and\n\nof the second part (hereinafter called the\n\nWitnesses that the said parties have concurred and agreed, and by these presents do covenant and agree to and with each other as follows:\n\nI.

Dr. Roche -\n\nBy memorial dated at Regina, Saskatchewan 24th. of November, 1911, addressed to the Hon. Robert Rogers and signed by His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface and several other dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church, and by a supplementary document dated 15th. November, 1912, similarly addressed and signed, copies of which documents are enclosed herewith, representations are made at length concerning the conduct of Indian schools and certain reasons set forth why important modifications should be made in the policy and contract governing the administration of Indian schools. Particular reference is made to the contract for the conduct and management and maintenance of Indian boarding schools, although the industrial and day schools come in for some measure of consideration.\n\nThe principal points of the documents above\nreferred to are:-\n\n(1) The representatives of the churches had not been previously advised of the tenor of the contract and the consideration which the undersigned have given compels them to the conclusion that the said representatives had not that opportunity of deliberating it which the importance of the contract demanded.\n\nIn answer to this it is to be borne in mind that for some years there had been considerable discussion through interviews and correspondence between the churches and the Department with a view of reaching an arrangement whose terms will be reasonably definite and satisfactory to both the Government and the churches. The result was that on the 8th November 1910 the Hon. Mr. Oliver, then Superintendent General held a conference with the bishops, clergymen and laymen representative of the churches engaged in Indian educational work. At that conference were present representing the Anglican Church:\n\nMost Reverend S. P. Matheson, Archbishop of Rupert's Land, and Primate of all Canada.\n\nRt. Reverend G. Thorneloe, Bishop of Algoma.\n\nRt. Reverend J. G. Anderson, Chapleau, Bishop of Moosonee.\nVen. Archdeacon Tims, of Calgary, representing the Bishop of Calgary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon McKay, Prince Albert, representing the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nRepresenting the Roman Catholic Church:\n\nRt. Reverend G. Breynat, Bishop of McKenzie River.\n\nRt. Reverend G. Charlebois, Keewatin, representing Bishop Legal of St. Albert.\n\nRt. Reverend D. J. Schollard, North Bay, Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nReverend Father Poitras, Winnipeg.\n\nReverend Father Magnan, Winnipeg.\n\nReverend Father Gauvreau, Procurator General, Ottawa.\n\nReverend Father Gabillon, representing Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert.\n\nReverend Charles Belanger, Wikwemikong.\n\nRepresenting the Methodist Church:\n\nReverend Dr. T. H. E. Shore, Superintendent Missions.\n\nReverend T. Ferrier, Brandon, Man.\n\nRepresenting the Presbyterian Church:\n\nHamilton Cassels, K.C., Toronto, Ontario.\n\nReverend J. H. Turnbull, Ottawa.\nThe matter of Indian education was pretty generally discussed at this conference and the draft contract was read there and approved by the delegates. On the 25th November of that year a copy of the contract was sent to everyone who had been present and to others who were interested. So far as I have been able to discover, the contract met with general approval, and I know of no objection being raised to its terms between the 25th November and March of the following year, the time the contracts were being executed by the churches and the Department, so that the question of not having ample time for considering and protesting against its terms, if such were deemed necessary, would appear to be settled by the facts as stated.\n\n(2) The contract, it is alleged, lacks statutory authority and Sections 9, 10, and 11 of the Indian Act are quoted in support of this allegation. These Sections are as follows:\n\n\"9. The Governor in Council may make regulations, either general or affecting the Indians of any province or of any named band, to secure the compulsory attendance of children at school.\n\n\"II. Such regulations, in addition to any...\"\nother provisions deemed expedient, may provide for the arrest and conveyance to school, and detention there, of truant children and of children who are prevented by their parents or guardians from attending; and such regulations may provide for the punishment, upon summary conviction, by fine or imprisonment, or both, of parents and guardians, or persons having the charge of children, who fail, refuse, or neglect to cause such children to attend school.\n\n10. The Governor in Council may establish an industrial school or a boarding school for Indians, or may declare any existing Indian school to be such industrial school or boarding school for the purposes of this and the next following section.\n\n11. The Governor in Council may make regulations, which shall have the force of law, for the committal by justices or Indian agents of children of Indian blood under the age of sixteen years, to such industrial school or boarding school, there to be kept cared for and educated for a period not extending beyond the time at which such children shall reach the age of eighteen years.\n\nII. Such regulations may provide, in such manner as to the Governor in Council seems best, for\nthe application of the annuities and interest moneys\nof children committed to such industrial school or\nboarding school, to the maintenance of such schools\nrespectively, or to the maintenance of the children\nthemselves.\"\n\nIt has not been made clear by the documents\nnow under consideration why these sections are quoted\nin support of a demand for statutory authority for the\nSuperintendent General to enter into this contract.\nSections 5 and 6 of the Indian Act are as follows:\n\n5. There shall be a department of the Civil\nService of Canada which shall be called the Department\nof Indian Affairs, over which the Superintendent\nGeneral shall preside.\n\n6. The Department of Indian Affairs shall\nhave the management, charge and direction of Indian\naffairs.\n\nIt is quite clear that the Superintendent\nGeneral as the head of the Department is authorized\nto administer the affairs of that Department and to\ndeal with the expenditure incurred in connection\ntherewith, in accordance with the statute or the\nappropriation of Parliament, and if he considers it to\nbe in the interest of Indian education that a contract\nshould be entered into with reference to the school buildings and to the expenditure of money therefor as provided by Parliament, there is no question as to his right to do so unless there is some statute preventing it, and more especially is this the case when both the Department and the churches agreed upon the terms of the contract. If, however, there is any doubt as to the Superintendent General's power to enter into this contract, I take it that the question is one not for the schools to raise, but for Parliament. Parliament, however, has practically ratified the action of the Superintendent General by voting last session and the session before, the moneys necessary to carry out the contract's terms.\n\nThe contract is for 5 years, and has been in operation since the 1st April, 1911. During the two years that it has been in operation, the churches and the Department have worked in harmony, and the terms of the contract have been observed both by the churches and the Government. If, at the expiration of the 5 years, there are any material objections to the contract, these may be submitted for consideration.\n(2) The admission of half-breeds to Indian schools:\u2014\n\nIt is contended that the stipulation \"That no Half-breed child shall be admitted... unless Indian children can not be obtained to complete the number authorized by Article I., Section 1., and Section 4 (a) of this agreement, in which event the Superintendent General may in his discretion permit the admission of any Half-breed child; but the Superintendent General will not pay any grant for any such Half-breed pupil provided under Article II., Section 1., of this agreement, nor any part of the cost of its maintenance or education whatever,\" is a very drastic provision and pregnant of much evil, that it is contrary to the policy which long obtained, and against which no reasonable objection has been or can be urged, and in a measure that it is obviously ultra vires.\n\nIt is stated that the half-breeds may be divided into three classes:\u2014\n\n1. Those who live, in varying degrees of conditions, the ordinary settled life of the country.\n\n2. Those who live, in varying degrees, the Indian mode of life.\n\n3. Those who - and they form the most unfor-\nfortunate class in the community - are the illegitimate offspring of Indian women, and of whom white men are mainly the begetters.\n\nThe question of opening the doors for the admission of half-breeds to Indian schools is a very serious one, and if favourably considered, would be of far reaching consequences. Of course, half-breeds who are recognized members of the band are not excluded from participation in the benefits or privileges of the Indian schools, and consequently the discussion on that point is unnecessary, but it is to the half-breeds who are not members of the band that the privileges of Indian education are to be extended. Half-breeds are not Indians in the eyes of the law; they come under provincial jurisdiction and are entitled to the benefits, privileges, etc., arising from the provincial educational system.\n\nIt is quite possible in the early days the lines were not drawn so strictly, as they have been in late years, but this can be accounted for by the fact that organization was not so complete in what are now the western provinces; the administration of affairs generally was largely Dominion and the line was not so strictly drawn between Indians and Half-breeds: but the conditions have changed and it would be out of the question, I take it,\nto permit the funds placed at the disposal of the Indian Department to be expended in the education of children who do not come within the class of children over whom the Indian Department exercises control.\n\nThis question came before the Department less than a year ago by reason of the admission of about 66 Half-breeds to the industrial school at Qu'Appelle, and in connection therewith I made an extended report to the Hon. Mr. Rogers, dated 2nd May, 1912, copy of which is herewith enclosed, also copy of letter dated June 1st., 1912 to the Reverend Father Hugonard advising him that the Department would expect these Half-breed children to be out of the school by the 30th June, 1913. It will be seen that in Mr. Sifton's ruling, which is referred to in the memorial and dealt with in my report, he goes no further than to extend the privileges of the Indian schools to the children of mixed blood who live upon a reserve and whose parents on either side live upon a reserve. In the contract under which the schools are managed at present, Half-breeds may be admitted to the schools when Indian children cannot be obtained, but even then they are not eligible to draw the per capita grant.\n\nWith reference to the objections to the\nGovernment retaining power to make such regulations from time to time as may be considered advisable, it is, I think, quite clear that the Government should control, and if at any time the regulations were considered oppressive or unworkable, there is no reason to suppose that they would not be modified. The heads of the Departments, the deputy heads, and the chief officers are not, so far as I know, faddists in the administration of Departmental matters, as might be inferred from some sections of the memorial, and there is no reason to believe that fair and equitable consideration will not be given upon the merits of any proposition presented to the Department.\n\n(4) Reference is also made to clause 8 dealing with the use of the English language in these schools, and an endeavour is made to show that the requirements of this clause as to knowledge of English are too comprehensive to be workable. I presume, that it will not be difficult to see that the meaning of this clause is that English shall be the language of the institution where language is fundamental to the teach-\ning or instruction given, and it would apply more particularly to the academic side of the work. It is quite true there may be instructors in gardening, farming, care of stock, cooking, laundry work, needlework, general housewifery, and dairying, but I do not suppose that it is very material whether the garden is dug and planted, the fires lighted, the food cooked, the clothes washed and dried, garments made and mended, and the dairying done in English or any other language. I take it that the meaning of clauses 8 and 9 is that the principal language of the institution shall be English, and reading these two clauses together, I do not see that very much objection can be raised to them.\n\n(5) Objection is raised to building clauses 12, 13 and 18; a perusal of these clauses will show that there is nothing unreasonable in their stipulations. The objection that is raised would appear to be chiefly leveled at prospective trouble on the one hand, and of the placing of too much power in the hands of the Superintendent General, on the other. As to the first, I presume that if trouble arises, it can be dealt with on its merits, and as to the second it is certainly right and proper that the Superintendent General should be clothed with the necessary power to see that the\nterms of the contract are observed and in doing so accept the full responsibility of a representative of the Government.\n\n(6) A somewhat diffuse argument is made as to the word \"cause\" for which removal may take place. In the understanding of the Department the cause must be some reason, some justification, a circumstance, or a set of circumstances, which determine the Superintendent General's mind in the direction of removal, and this reason, justification, or circumstance will determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of the cause. I think there is no doubt that the section is sufficient so far as that is concerned.\n\n(7) The memorial of the 15th November, 1912 deals more particularly with the age of admission, and advances reasons why the residential school is preferable to the day school. There are today in Canada 251 day schools, 55 boarding schools, and 19 industrial schools, and while one may be able to pick out cases here and there throughout the whole of the educational system where the day schools have not succeeded, it is quite possible also that instances of failure may be found in cases of residential schools. As a matter of fact, we\nhave closed not only day schools but residential schools time and again owing to failure to obtain either teachers, pupils or money sufficient to warrant these schools being carried on. A great deal can be said in favour of the residential school, and such has been pretty thoroughly recognized by the Department, but at the same time there can be no doubt the day school has been and is a very important factor in the educational life of the Indian, and more especially it may be said, in the older sections of the country where the Indian has given up his nomadic life, and adjusted himself to the settled life of the community.\n\nThe adjustment of these matters, however, is a matter of slow progress and can only be brought about by due observance of changing habits and conditions. So far as the school age is concerned, the regulations referred to in the memorial, deal more particularly with the age at which Indian children may be committed to school; the contract deals with the age when they can be admitted, and it was well understood and agreed to at the time of the conference.\n\nI submit then that in the interest of the Department and the churches, the contract should be allowed to run its course; so far it has worked with\ncomparative smoothness, and there is no reason to anticipate that the conduct of the schools and the relation of the school authorities with the Department will not be as satisfactory as they have been since the contract was entered into. Accompanying this are the two memorials, upon which this report is based, the printed correspondence and agreement with reference to the boarding schools, copy of my report to the Hon. Mr. Rogers dated May 2nd., 1912, and letter to Reverend Father Hugonard, with reference to the admission of Half-breeds to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, also copy of the school regulations.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle, Nov. 4, 1913.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI shall be very grateful to you if you would kindly advise me upon the following matters in connection with Indian boarding school work:\n\n(1) In Clause No. 15 of Agreement, dated April 1, 1911, the following statement occurs: \"During the vacation, the pupils may, in the discretion of the , be permitted to visit their homes.\" Question - in whose discretion?\n\n(2) May the Indian Agent give an order for a pupil to leave an industrial or a boarding school when requested to do so by the parent or parents of the pupil, for a longer or shorter time, to work, or visit, at home, irrespective of the need of such pupil at the school, or the opinion of the Principal as to the expediency of allowing such pupil to be absent from the school?\n\n(3) May an Indian Agent transfer a pupil from a boarding school to an industrial school without the consent or approval of the Principal of such boarding school?\n(4) Has a Principal of a boarding school any right of supervision or control over the actions or conduct of his pupils when they are visiting their homes during the summer vacation, and may he not recall them if he deem it necessary, having in view their moral safety?\n\n(5) Is the contention (as alleged) of some Indian parents well founded, that during the summer vacation their children are theirs to do what they like with, and, that they have a right to have their children at home whenever they or the children are ill?\n\n(6) Is a Principal of a boarding school not responsible for the wellbeing of his pupils, as their guardian, from the time of their admittance to such boarding school until their discharge from it, by authority of the Department, including the summer vacation?\n\nWe have, in the Rev. H. W. Atwater, Principal of Gordon's school, Punnichy, a man of years of experience in educational work and of Indian work, and man of discretion, who may be counted upon to work with the Indian Agent and other Government officials to the best interests of the Department and the moral and spiritual welfare of the Indians under his charge.\n\nYour Department has received reports of his excellent work which is tending to a general uplifting of the moral tone of things, something which was sorely\nnecessary at the time he took over the school some eighteen months ago. He has sought our advice on the matters herein with a view to using kind and yet firm influence with some Indian parents. I shall be grateful, Sir, if you would kindly give me such advice on these matters as you deem necessary.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nEdwin H. Knowles,\nSecretary of Synod.\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI append herewith a letter from Rev. E.H. Knowles re matters connected with Indian Schools \u2014 I will be obliged if you give me answers to his queries for future as well as present use.\n\nIf you formulate a new policy as we spoke of last winter then sure our educational troubles will be minimized. Will you be good enough to send me back Knowles' letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGlen Campbell\nNovember 26th, 1913.\n\nDear Mr. Campbell,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant with an enclosure from Rev. Mr. Knowles in connection with Indian boarding school work, and I shall deal with the various matters seriatim.\n\n(1) Pupils are granted vacation according to the contract at the discretion of \"the management\".\n\n(2) The Indian Agent has not the power to grant pupils any leave over and above the usual annual leave without the consent of the Department, and when applications of this kind are made reasons must be given; neither should such applications be made to the Department without the knowledge of the principal.\n\n(3) The Department reserves the right to grant the transfer of pupils from boarding to industrial schools, and each case of this kind is dealt with on its merits.\n\n(4) The principal of a boarding school remains\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nthe guardian of a pupil while on vacation, and he may recall a pupil should he deem it necessary for good and sufficient cause.\n\n(5) The answer to No. 4 disposes of Section 5, with the exception of the last clause. It would not be possible to allow children to go home every time a parent was ill, although in cases of serious illness special action might be taken. In the case of ordinary illness of children it would be wise to allow them to be moved from the school, where provision is made for their treatment and where they are better looked after than they could be at home. Under extraordinary circumstances, however, discharge might be granted with the authority of the Department.\n\n(6) The principal of a school is responsible to the Department for the well-being of the pupils.\n\nI return herewith as requested Rev. Mr. Knowles' letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 1, 1913.\n\nDear Mr. Campbell,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 26th ultimo, with regard to Indian boarding school work, I wish to correct a typographical error which escaped notice when the letter was written: in section 5, line 6, the sentence should read \"it would not be wise,\" instead of \"it would be wise.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOffice of the Deputy Superintendent General\nOttawa\n\nJanuary 12th 1914.\n\nHon. Dr. Poche -\n\nIn forwarding the memorandum to Council to you dated the 12th January, accepting the lowest tender for the construction of the Roman Catholic Boarding school building at Cross Lake, I beg to point out that this school is to provide for the children of the Roman Catholic Indians in the diocese of Neewatin, and that the activities of the church so far as they are aided by the Government, are to be limited to this school. A few residential pupils were accommodated at Norway House but these pupils are to be transferred to the Cross Lake schools when it is completed.\n\nAs the Department is constantly being pressed for the erection of buildings for residential schools, principally in remote districts, where the Indians have not at present such educational advantages, I think it well to endeavour to fix a policy for the department with reference to future grants for educational purposes. So far as these demands are concerned, the educational field may be divided into two classes:\n\n(1) Schools which are already established in more or less settled districts. The requisitions made upon us for building expenditure for this class of schools are for repair and enlargements, and in some cases complete rebuilding. It should be remembered that most of these schools were erected by the church authorities or by the department without any attention to sanitary arrangements. In many cases they have fallen to disrepair and are not suitable for\nthe work which is carried on within their walls.\n\n(2) Schools which are intended to supplement the missionaries' efforts to evangelize the Indians. The majority of these applications must necessarily come from remote districts where the Indians earn their livelihood by hunting and fishing.\n\nIt seems clear to me that our first duty is to meet the needs which arise in class 1, and to consider it our first object to thoroughly equip the old institutions.\n\nWhen the question of Indian Education was being considered by your predecessor in office in the autumn of 1910, and when the per capita grants were increased and the schools standardized, we stated on the authority of the Hon. Mr. Oliver that the government was willing to spend a moderate amount from year to year in establishing new and modern buildings, but would not undertake to furnish modern buildings in all cases where they are required within a short space of time.\n\nOur main Estimates for the current year provide for $342,000.00 for buildings for residential schools and $10,925.00 for buildings for day schools. It seems to me that that annual expenditure is a fair expenditure for some years to come. At that rate of expenditure we should be able in two years to meet all the requirements of the older institutions.\n\nI trust this outline of policy will meet with your approval.\n\nD.G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nschools in older districts to be built or renewed\nin near future in three classes - most urgent\nmentioned in first class, &c.\n\n---\n\n### Class 1\n\n| Name                          | Denomination       | Estimate   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Pound Lake Boarding School    | Presbyterian       | $50,000.00 |\n| Vegian Boarding School        | Roman Catholic     | $25,000.00 |\n|                               | Church of England  | $25,000.00 |\n| Fraser Lake Boarding School   | Roman Catholic     | $60,000.00 |\n| Red Deer Industrial School    | Methodist          | $40,000.00 |\n\n### Class 2\n\n| Name                          | Denomination       | Estimate   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Crowstand Boarding School     | Presbyterian       | $25,000.00 |\n| Blue Quills Boarding School   | Roman Catholic     | $25,000.00 |\n\n### Class 3\n\n| Name                          | Denomination       | Estimate   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Blood Boarding School         | Church of England  | $25,000.00 |\n|                               | Roman Catholic     | $25,000.00 |\n| Kamloops Industrial School    |                    | $60,000.00 |\n| St. Mary's Mission, B.C.      |                    | $25,000.00 |\n\nTotal Estimate: $300,000.00\nIn reference to the education of Indian children I respectfully beg to offer the Department my opinion for whatever it may be valued at. And whether considered of any value or otherwise it is not given with any malice or condemnation towards any person, denomination or institution, but is given with a desire for a common sense uplifting of the Indian which is a part of the policy of the Department I have the honour of trying to serve.\n\nI have been an interested observer of Indians and Indian affairs including education, for the past 25 years, and have become gradually convinced that under the present unfinished system of industrial schools a cruelty instead of a benefit is being imposed upon the Indian.\n\nI have seen young men and women, well educated and well behaved, good mechanics and good housekeepers returned, at a very susceptible age, to their reserves, in locations at the best upon the outskirts of civilization, where it is an impossibility for them to profit by the education they have received while in the industrial school; and their last state is generally worse than the first.\n\nUnless the work of the industrial schools can be carried on upon industrial farms or in factories it would be better to leave the children in the reserves, for when taken away for a few years they are unfitted to get a living as an ordinary Indian and have not sufficient stability of character to compete with the white people.\n\nI should think an industrial farm or trade for the employment of graduates from industrial schools would in a short time become self-supporting and a source of revenue, instead of an expense.\nUntil some continuation of the work commenced in the industrial schools is obtained for the Indian children, that they may keep advancing, it would be better for all concerned that the children are left in the reserves and the day schools receive greater attention.\n\nThe present system of the day schools in Indian reserves is also sadly inefficient. At present they are not under the management of the Department or the Churches. I think that either one or the other have the sole management of the day schools, and it would appear just and proper that the Department have the management.\n\nIn most reserves there are Indians of different faiths whom it would be impossible to please by the establishment of schools under the management of their Churches. All Indians, being wards of the Government receive, in most matters, the same consideration and treatment irrespective of their religious belief; and this impartial justice should be most prominent in education.\n\nI firmly believe that the day schools in the reserves are the best and only proper method of education for Indian children.\n\nI am afraid that many earnest but mistaken people forget that the nature of an Indian cannot be altered in one generation, and one should not blame too severely the Indian, who cannot have any appreciation of education, when he neglects to send his children to a school, without which he has been able to live.\n\nA comfortable school, a sensible teacher who will not condemn any whose religious belief is different, administered by a Department just and therefore impartial, is all that can be given, the balance time will accomplish.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River agency\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nNovember 4th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in which you outline your views generally with regard to the matter of Indian education. Your remarks with regard to ex-pupils of industrial schools are noted. At present at our industrial schools very little stress is laid upon instruction in the different trades, but boys who graduate have been given, in nearly all cases, systematic instruction in agriculture and the girls in various branches of Domestic Science. It is also the policy of the Department, as you are aware, to assist deserving ex-pupils by way of enabling them to commence farming for themselves, where conditions are such as to warrant expenditure for this purpose, and on a good many of our reserves in the western provinces considerable success is being met with by ex-pupils.\n\nT H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nWith regard to the day schools, these may be considered to be under the management of the Department for all practical purposes, and the results being obtained on some of the Reserves in the better class of day schools are quite encouraging. The churches in most cases are allowed the privilege of nominating teachers and it is found that the co-operation of the missionaries and other authorities of the church is beneficial. It must be admitted that in some of the out-lying districts it is very difficult to obtain the services of satisfactory teachers owing to the isolation of the Reserves, but a distinct improvement in the personnel of our teachers is to be noted.\n\nThe Department quite agrees with you that an efficiently conducted day school is a very good means of meeting the educational needs of the Indian children under ordinary conditions. You know, however, that on some of the Reserves the locations are so scattered and means of communication so poor that it is almost impossible to obtain an attendance without which success cannot be hoped for. There are also orphan and neglected children who must be looked after and it is these latter that should be given first place when recruiting for the residential schools. While it is recognized that there are disadvantages in\nin taking children from the Reserves to educate them; on\nthe other hand there are some distinct advantages and the\nhearty and sympathetic co-operation of all officials and\nothers connected with Indian work is necessary to see that\nex-pupils are enabled to profit from their courses in these\nschools when they return to the Reserves.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to do anything\npossible to co-operate with you in the improvement of the\nday schools within your Agency, and will be glad at all times\nto give consideration and support to any practical sugges-\ntions that you may wish to make with this object in view\nand also to co-operate with you in dealing in a practical\nway with ex-pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\u2014 I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 9th re schools; and to say that I am pleased to receive this circular as it fellows along lines that I have endeavored to put into operation here the last six months with some measure of success; and further it opens an opportunity of allowing me to give expression in more extensive form to my idea of the faults and failings of our schools and the resultant deficiencies of the training practised, ideas which heretofore I might not be acceptable to the Department.\n\nAfter careful observation in the schools and in the homes of ex-pupils on the reserve, I am convinced that much of the energy of our schools is misdirected; and a proper education under the conditions is not being given these Indians; that is an education and training conducive to their best advancement.\n\nThe prime object of our schools at present seems to be, the making of as many adherents as possible to the religious body under whose auspices the school is conducted; the greater the number of adherents the greater the success claimed for the school by the staff. While not in any way wishing to belittle the efforts expended in making Christians of these Indians or belittling the advantage of a religious education, I beg to suggest that the policy pursued at present is a short sighted one; even the missionaries acknowledge that after 25 years of religious instruction there is not one single Indian on the Blood Reserve who has any real conception of the Christian faith and the morality it teaches.\nThe schools and missions as at present conducted have a tendency to make petty grafters and public beggars of many of the Indians, by issuing them large quantities of free clothing, the giving of meals on Sundays and on festive occasions, the giving of begging letters to Indians; the giving to school children about to be discharged an extravagant idea of the amount of assistance the Department owes the Indians and is willing to give; giving extra privileges in the way of absenting their children from schools to Indians who profess to be the best friends and adherents to the respective churches; The above methods while probably intended in a good cause make indolent many able bodied Indians, make them agitate makes parents fell free to barter his child to the school that will give him the most.\n\nChildren in the schools are required to spend too much time in purely religious instruction; more time than their present state of mental or moral development warrants. Children are not being taught along lines of natural development and not with an idea single to their future well being and usefulness on the reserve,\n\nThe elementary principles of education are neglected and too much time spent on lines made for show purposes. Many are not able to speak English intelligibly; few if any have any power of deduction; the teaching of girls in homemaking; care of children; sewing; growing and cooking of vegetables; care of fowl; and the teaching of the boys mixing the elementary principles of soil culture; carpentry; harness mending; use of machinery and care of stock; all the above is sadly neglected. These Indians would adapt themselves readily to the above lines of instruction. While I am cognizant of the limitations in carrying out the above program yet I am convinced far more could and should be done.\nI have never seen any children that a teacher's characteristics affects so strongly. It is an easy matter to pick out the children that have graduated from the respective schools. It is an easy matter to separate every pupil of outstanding teachers. Five of these teachers I have in mind, they have left an eradicable impression on the boys or girls. These teachers taught the children by example, how to use their head and their hands, taught them character. They have been of more benefit than all other teachers combined.\n\nThe schools have not been all to blame; they have had great difficulty in recruiting, have not received enough assistance from the agency staff, in this direction. There has been an apathy on the part of parents to send the children to school and often children were not placed in school until after they were too old to learn English.\n\nSome of the faults have been corrected, the schools are filled beyond the required numbers, 75 children of school age in school could be placed in school inside of three months if the accommodation were available. Disinclination on part of the parents seems to be disappearing, and a healthy tendency for better attendance. With the filling of the schools some of the undesirable features are passing out. I am hoping for more practical and thorough instruction by more efficient teachers.\n\nGiven increased accommodation, more practical methods of instruction, more efficient instructors; compulsory attendance; the problems we have to deal with on the reserve will be simplified and many solved just as surely as the public schools have solved the problems in civilized communities.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy\nand Sec'y\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nMarch 9th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Dilworth -\n\nYour letter of the 25th ultimo replying to the circular sent you on November 9th, last, regarding the recruiting of children for the residential schools has been brought to my attention, and I have read it with a great deal of interest.\n\nThe agreement between the Department and the church authorities for the maintenance and management of these schools was made after the most careful consideration, and if faithfully adhered to good results must follow. From your remarks on the second page of your letter I gather that the provisions of Section 9, or the first part of the contract in which is set forth the obligation of the Church authorities as to the instruction to be given pupils, are not carried out. Even in schools such as you have in your Agency\n\nW. J. Dilworth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMacLeod, Alta.\nAgency there should be no difficulty in giving the children instruction of the nature referred to, and it is the wish of the Department that you should see that more is accomplished along this line in future.\n\nI quite agree with you as to the effects of the personality of a teacher on Indian children; this is also true of White pupils in any of our schools, but during the past few years it has almost been impossible for our schools either Indian or White to obtain the services of teachers of outstanding ability. When the church authorities obtain one, every effort should be made to retain him.\n\nI am glad to learn that some of the difficulties on the Blood Reserve are being successfully coped with, and I am sure with the hearty co-operation of all interested even better results will be obtained in the future.\n\nI am sorry that there are so many children without an opportunity of attending school on the reserve at the present time, but we can only make progress slowly in the way of providing increased accommodation, owing to the expenditure\nexpenditure involved. It has occurred to me that in order to help to meet the exigencies of the case at both of these schools some of the pupils might be discharged at a somewhat earlier age than provided for in the regulations, if in the judgment of yourself and the principals such action seemed advisable, each case being considered on its merits.\n\nThe enrolment at the St. Joseph's Industrial School from the Blood Reserve is at present very small, being according to your annual report, eleven. Any orphans and some of the destitute children might be placed there under the regulations, and, if anything could be done by yourself to popularize the institution, other Indians might be prevailed upon to send their children there. It might be that the promise of a yearly holiday would be an inducement. I should be glad to have your views with reference to these two suggestions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 9th ultimo\n\nI have the honor to reply that, your suggestions meet with agreeable. Some difficulty has been experienced with the Dunbow school and the Indians are not anxious or agreeable to send their children there. From what I can gather at a distance it would appear that the staff is weak in maintaining discipline which has caused boys to run away from school on any trivial excuse. I also do not think that Indians have been dealt with fairly by the school authorities there, the parent is entirely ignored in too many instances, the school authorities feel that they should always have their way even though reserve conditions are not known. When Rev Father Nassens was principal of this school I should judge by results here that good work was done, the expupils that have came unto the reserve the last two or three years have not been benefited as regards progressive education. So far they have not shown to advantage. My task has been so far to see that our home schools were filled to the fullest extent, and trying to get the Indians to view education in a more favorable light. There are a number of children who might be sent to Dunbow, St Joseph's Industrial a list of which I enclose.\n\nI should like to have the Department's authority to summarily place these children if the occasion arises where the authority is required.\n\nThe suggestion re allowing pupils to be discharged at an earlier age is good as regards boys\nSir,\n\nbut as regards girl pupils from the conditions here I think that it were better to retain them until 18 years or until a suitable marriage is arranged for them. The last two years of a girls school life is valuable in learning housekeeping and other domestic duties.\n\nOur greatest difficulty is in getting children to go to school at an early age parents are jealous of the influences that have a tendency to wean them away from a full knowledge of the Blackfoot language and too often child children are not placed in school until too old to learn to talk English fluently. The efforts of the past year have been along the lines of getting the children in younger.\n\nI will confer with the principals of the schools and arrange to carry your suggestions into effect as soon as possible.\n\nI would be glad if I were sent a copy of the curriculum of study relative to the schools. I have not a copy of this syllabus. The I will be busy with outdoor work the present summer I hope to give more time to the school proposition than heretofore. Something should be done in making our schools give a more practical education to the children. I am making every effort possible to wean these Indians away from a beef and bannock diet a great amount of this work should be done in the schools. Changing diet to vegetables and cereal foods will have a very beneficial effect on the health and progress of the Indians make them more independent of the ration house and better home makers. The schools have done a considerable work in this direction but a great deal more should be accomplished.\nI would like to very much increase the efficiency of our schools. I expect to meet with difficulties for it seems to be a set axiom with some of our principals that agents have no authority over school matters. However I will treat the matter as tactfully as I can in the endeavor to make progress. I have the best Indians with me they feel that they will get a square deal. If they get the square deal progress will be much more substantial.\n\nI Have the Honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nTo Duncan C Scott Esqr.\nDept't Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe agreement entered into between the Department of Indian Affairs and the different religious denominations in regard to the maintenance and management of Indian boarding schools will soon terminate, as it was only to remain in effect from the first of April, 1911, for a term of five years.

Dr. Roche -\n\nIn November 1910, a meeting of the representatives of the churches interested in Indian Education was held in the office of the then Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The object of this convention was the establishment of a definite financial policy in regard to the Indian boarding schools conducted by the different religious denominations engaged in Indian educational work. The result of the conference was embodied in an agreement which was signed by the management of Indian boarding schools and which went into effect on the 1st of April 1911, for a term of five years.\n\nAlthough the time limit of the agreement expired fifteen months ago, the schools are still paid at the same per capita grant which formed the basis of the agreement. It is conceded that this grant was not at any time in itself sufficient to meet the cost\nof maintenance and it was supplemented from denominational sources to a considerable extent. The different societies affiliated with the churches and interested in home mission work have found their funds in recent years greatly diminished, and there has been a consequent reduction in the grants for Indian school purposes; in some cases they have been wholly withdrawn.\n\nOwing to the increased cost of food, clothing and wages the Churches maintain that the grant at present paid does not meet the due proportion of the cost assumed by the Department and there is no doubt that this contention is correct. The financial statements received from the schools show that, with one or two exceptions, the expenditure has exceeded the receipts from all sources. This fact, coupled with the difficulty of collecting funds as above referred to, has lead the Church authorities to ask for a readjustment of arrangements governing boarding and industrial schools.\n\nRecognizing the justice of their claim, it is suggested that an all round increase of ten dollars be added to the per capita grant to the boarding and industrial schools for the current fiscal year only,\nto assist the Churches in meeting the financial difficulties they have to contend with.\n\nThe suggested increase of ten dollars to the present per capita grant can be met out of this year's school appropriation, as savings can be effected in many of the items of expenditure, such as installation of new buildings (no new buildings to be erected this year), house-furnishings, implements, provisions, transportation of pupils, field-matrons, etc. The amount required to meet the increase will be about $38,000.00, based on last year's average attendance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 11, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department, after careful consideration of the increased cost of maintaining the residential Indian schools conducted by the different religious denominations occasioned by the war, has decided to increase the per capita grant at present allowed to these schools by the sum of ten dollars, such increase to date from the 1st of April, last, and to be for the current fiscal year only.\n\nTo meet the increase out of the depleted funds at the disposal of the Department the strictest economy will have to be exercised in the expenditure of the school vote and it is expected that the principals in charge of the residential schools in your agency will co-operate with the Department in keeping down expenditure.

McNALLY, D.D., BISHOP OF CALGARY, dated February 27, 1919.\n\nOriginal on 117,657-1A.\n\nOne of our chief difficulties at these large schools is to prevent the pupils from being exploited as mere wage earners, and to ensure that they should be taught English by persons who have a thorough command of the language. In connection with another large institution I was constrained to write the other day to this effect:\n\n\"The Department is of the opinion that the extensive farming operations carried on there entail too much work on the pupils, which causes dissatisfaction among the parents, who complain that the children are over-worked and their studies neglected.\n\n\"The same rule should apply to the stock raising carried on at the school.\n\n\"The Department is not in favour of more cattle being kept than are absolutely required for school purposes. In the past this industry has taken up much of the pupils' time at the expense of their education.\n\n\"The Department must insist upon the employment of teachers who are thoroughly qualified to give instruction in English, so that the pupils may have an opportunity of obtaining a thorough English education and learn to speak the language fluently.\"\n\nI am sure you will agree with me that these demands are by no means exacting.\nTo provide an increase of $10.00 per capita in the Grant to Residential Indian Schools .............. $35,000.00\n\nTo enable the management of the residential schools to meet the increased cost of food, clothing and other expenses of maintenance it is necessary to augment the per capita grant allowed to the various schools of this class. Urgent requests have been made by the various religious denominations, under whose auspices these schools are conducted, for an increased grant as it is found impossible for them to carry on the work without incurring further deficits under the existing grant allowed.\n\nThere is no question as to the raise in the cost of food, clothing and wages during the past two years, and as no increase in the grant to the residential schools has been made during that period the management finds it difficult to carry on the work and maintain the present standard of efficiency without further assistance being granted. It is, therefore, necessary that the Government come to their support and augment the grant to enable them to meet the increased cost in the expenditure required to carry on the work.\n\nThe main estimates provide for a total enrolment of 3,561 pupils in the residential schools and to increase the grant by $10.00 per capita for that number, will require the above amount.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nSCHOOL AND ACCOUNT BRANCHES.\n\nThe Supplementary Estimates for the Fiscal Year 1919-20 provide for an increase to Boarding and Industrial Schools throughout Canada of $10.00 per capita on the number of pupils allowed at each of these schools. The per capita grant should be paid at this increased rate from April 1, 1919.\n\nIt is to be understood that this increase is given owing to the present high cost of living and is subject to revision.\n\nD.

Sir James Lougheed -\n\nReferring to communication from the Secretary of the Kenora Board of Trade asking for an increase in the per capita grant to the Kenora and Cecelia Jeffrey boarding schools in that district, I beg to say that it would not be possible for the Department to make an exception in favour of these two schools, as all institutions of this kind should be treated alike. It is true that these two schools are somewhat handicapped owing to the fact that they have very little arable land in connection with the institutions, but many of our schools are equally disadvantageously situated.\n\nOn two occasions recently, in 1917 and 1919, increases of $10.00 were made in the grants to boarding and industrial schools. Previously the Cecelia Jeffrey and Kenora schools received $125.00 which was, by these increases, augmented to $145.00.\n\nI would suggest that these papers be placed on record in the Department in order that they may be brought to Mr. Scott's attention upon his return.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nCecelia Jeffrey I.B.S.,\nJuly 21/1920,\n\nTo Rev. C. Brouillet, O.M.I.\nKenora, Ont.,\n\nDear Father:\n\nI am sorry I could not meet you this week as several of our children have measles and I could not get away. However I am anxious that something should be done to ease the present situation in regard to the maintenance of our schools. The grant per capita is not sufficient to meet our needs in buying food for the children. Considering also that we have very little land under cultivation to raise even roots and vegetables, we are not in a position to help out the extreme high cost of living very much. Almost all our schools in the west are not so situated as most of their maintenance comes from produce of the land and also stock. It is absurd to imagine that an Indian child can be properly fed on 40 cents per day, leaving clothing out of the question.\n\nNow I wish you could interview the Board of Trade in Kenora also stating your own case and if you so desire you may read my letter to the Board. I am sure their influence could help us to secure an increased grant from the Indian Department and save the situation.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\nJohn T. Ross,\n\nCOPY.\nKENORA INDIAN SCHOOL\nKENORA ONTARIO, AUG.12th,1920.\n\nTO Board of Trade,\nKenora, Ont.,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI beg to ask that you would help us to obtain from the Department of Indian Affairs, a more suitable grant for the maintaining of our schools. I believe you are in receipt of a like request from the Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey School, as we both are in a like position, that is -- both our schools would have to be closed unless we get a raise in the per capita grant in proportion with the raise of the cost of living. We apply to you, because you are aware of the work we are doing, and we feel sure, that your influence would help us to have our request granted.\n\nThe churches, I am sure will have to take the matter up with the Department in behalf of all the schools, but what the other schools could be satisfied with, would not enable us to live on account of the distance we have to travel to recruit the expenses in bringing our children, and in boarding the parents who come to visit their children, but especially, because we have not as the other schools have, farm lands to get a part of our support from. Now I feel sure that with the help of your powerful influence the Department will readily grant our request, it will, I believe, be sufficient to call the attention of the Honorable Gentlemen to the facts and they will understand our position.\n\nNow a little while before the war the Department agreed to give us a grant of $125.00 per capita (34\u00a2) per day, since then we have been raised to $145.00 (40\u00a2) per day or a raise of 16% now when this is compared with the increase of the cost of living it is easily understood, that this raise is not sufficient, in fact, I believe, it is hardly more than enough to pay the different taxes.\n\nNow as figures speak better than words, I will give you the amount received by this school from the Department, and the resources belonging to the school and what the church had to do to maintain us:\n\nIn the year 1918 - 19 the Gov. Grant together with the natural resources of the school, amounted to $8325.57. To enable us to meet our obligations the Oblate Fathers had to subscribe $5200.00. In 1919-20 the expenses were $15148.77. The Gov. Grant combined with the earnings of the school amounted to $8455.75. The Oblate Fathers Corporation allowed me $7000.00, but notified me that I had not to count on an ever increasing allowance and even that, this year I would have to do with half that amount as they have serious obligations to meet they cannot do more. Now, you Gentlemen, know how I try to spare, and a few know how I work myself in every line of manual labor, and you understand that further curtailment of expenses would have to be at the expense of the children's comfort, what I am sure is not the intention of the Honorable Gentlemen of the Department.\n\nBegging for this communication your favorable attention I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant\n\nC. Brouillet\nPrincipal.\n\nP. S. After conferring with the Principal of Cecelia Jeffrey School, we came to the conclusion that we could not very well maintain our Schools unless we are granted $250.00 per capita.\n\nC.B.\nKENORA BOARD OF TRADE\n\nTHE GREAT WATER POWER OF THE GREAT WEST\n\nKENORA, CANADA.\nAugust 19th, 1920.\n\nThe Honorable Sir James Lougheed,\nMinister of the Interior,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa,\n\nSIR:\n\nEnclosed you will find a letter, to the Kenora Board of Trade, from the Rev. Father Brouillet, Principal of the Kenora Indian Industrial School, asking us to lend our support to having the Government Grant increased. While this letter is from the principal of the Roman Catholic School the Presbyterian School on Shoal Lake is in just as sad a plight, as witness a letter from John T. Ross, Principal of the Cecelia Jeffray Indian School, and both are well worthy of special consideration.\n\nThese schools have made their presence felt among the Indians in no small manner. The writer well remembers the Indians of this District eking out a miserable existence by peddling fish or berries in summer and living heaven alone knows how in the winter. Then comparatively few of them could speak the English language or were able to write. Today these conditions have changed, partly no doubt by the constant contact with white people but we believe largely by the growing up of the children who were educated in these schools. Today the Indian who cannot speak English is very hard to find and the penmanship of many of them is excellent. Instead of eking out a miserable hand to mouth existence the younger men work in the lumber camps and on the drives. The manager of our largest Lumber Company states that without the assistance of the Indians it would have been impossible to carry on during the war.\n\nThe Indian girls at these schools are taught not only to read and write etc., but are given lessons in cooking and housekeeping. The sharp contrast between the civilized method of living and the makeshift of the Indian cannot help but have its influence with the younger ones.\n\nThe education afforded by these schools was chiefly responsible for many young Indians going overseas and rendering excellent service in France.\nSpeaking more directly of the schools. The Kenora Indian Industrial School is located just outside of the Town of Kenora. It is a large brick building equipped with electric light, water and sewage. The Presbyterian School is located about forty-five miles from Kenora on Shoal Lake. At both these schools the Indian children are given every attention by those in charge. Two years ago the then principal of the Presbyterian School gave his life during the influenza epidemic. Father Brouillet's devotion to his work is almost a by-word in Kenora.\n\nWhen interviewing us at the Board Meeting, Father Brouillet stated that the total payroll of his school during the past year was $550.00 which sum in its entirety went to the five nuns working there with him, both he and the man of all weak getting only their board and room. We feel that such devotion is worthy of your consideration.\n\nWe would also draw your attention to the fact that neither school has any farm to draw upon and that their position is unique in this respect.\n\nThe members of the Board are entirely in sympathy with the work done by these schools. No person who has spent many years in Kenora can help but appreciate it. After hearing Father Brouillet, the Board unanimously passed the following resolution:\n\n\"That the Secretary write strongly to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa pointing out the peculiar conditions under which the two Indian Schools in this District are operating and the necessity of further financial assistance and that this Board do unqualifiedly endorse the application of these two schools for an increase in the Government Grant to 75\u00a2 per day per capita.\"\n\nTrusting that you will be able to oblige us in this matter, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSECRETARY,\n\nENCLS.\nJEC/VG.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. MCLEAN,\nACTING DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nAs you suggest, I am returning communication from the Secretary of the Kenora Board of Trade, with enclosure requesting an increased government grant to the Kenora and Cecelia Jeffrey boarding schools, in order that these papers may be placed on record in the Department. I have advised Mr. Currie this was being done, and that upon Mr. Scott's return, the matter would be given consideration, and his letter more definitely replied to.\nAug. 24th, 1920,\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nG. W. W. D. Waugh, Man.\n\nBoard of Trade,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nI herewith make application for increase in grant per capita for Cecilia Indian boarding school. As the cost of living has increased 200% we find that the Church is no longer able to support the work as it should be supported without an increase of grant.\n\nWe are not so well situated as other boarding schools on the prairie, because they can fall back for considerable help in the maintenance of their schools, from what their farm land produces.\n\nThe Mission property here comprising about 400 ac. is not agricultural land the greater part of it is rocky and the only land we have under cultivation is about 3 ac. simply sufficient for garden purposes.\n\nThis coming winter I shall be obliged to buy all my feed for stock, which consists of two horses, three cows, one bull, a few pigs.\n\nIn fact almost everything to support man and beast at the Mission must be bought and brought in from the outside.\n\nThe average attendance of pupils here for last quarter was 64 pupils. The condition of maintenance here is becoming unbearable and along with Rev. Father Brouillet, Prin. of Kenora Indian boarding school, I make application for a grant of $250.00 per capita.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn T. Ross,\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Mitchell -\n\nWith reference to the attached communication from Mr. Currie regarding an increased grant to the Henora and Cecelia Jeffrey boarding schools, I would refer to my memorandum of the 24th ultimo and your reply thereto of the 25th. I have kept a copy of Mr. Ross' letter for our official file.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nKenora Board of Trade\n\nThe Great Water Power of the Great West\n\nKenora, Canada. Oct. 12th, 1920.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nUnder date of August 19th, 1920, the Kenora Board of Trade addressed a letter to the Honorable Sir James Lougheed, Minister of the Interior, in reference to the Government increasing its grant to the Kenora Indian Industrial School and the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Boarding School, Shoal Lake.\n\nThe receipt of this letter was acknowledged by Mr. J. G. Mitchell, private secretary to Sir James Lougheed, under date of August 25th, the last paragraph of which reads:\u2014\"Your letter and enclosure are being submitted to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for consideration, and the matter will be given consideration without delay.\"\n\nSince this time our Board has not received any further communications regarding the matter, and as the winter season is approaching it is imperative that some action be taken in order that these schools may \"carry on\".\n\nYou will note from the correspondence forwarded to the Honorable Sir James Lougheed how deserving and necessary the increased\ngrant asked for is to each of these schools, and my Board has instructed me to request that you give this important matter your very earliest attention which I now respectfully request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOctober 27th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy attention has been drawn to letters from the Kenora Board of Trade under date of August 19th, and October 12th, urging the necessity for an increase in the Government grant for the maintenance of the Kenora and Cecilia Jeffrey Indian boarding schools. As you are no doubt aware, these grants are paid from Parliamentary appropriation, and it will, therefore, be necessary for Parliament to place a larger fund at our disposal before your wishes can be met. Our fiscal year ends March 31st, and the estimates for the new year will shortly be prepared. Any increase in the per capita grant must be uniform and applied to all schools, and as there are about 4,800 children at present in residence you will see that even a small increase will make a serious aggregate amount.\n\nI intend to present the case for a general increase to the Honourable the Superintendent General with the hope that some relief may be extended. Since the great advance in prices we have increased the per capita grant by $20.00 a year.\n\nI am very pleased to know by your letter of the 19th, that you are able to speak with favour of the work carried on in the schools, and I assure you that any proposals to increase their usefulness or to give reasonable financial assistance will receive my hearty support.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy-Superintendent General.\n\nA.

Representing the Church of England,\n   The Right Rev. David Williams, Bishop\n   of Huron, Chairman Executive\n   Committee of the Missionary Society.\n   The Rev. Canon Joseph General Secretary\n   of the Missionary Society.\nare unanimously agreed upon the following conclusions, which, etc.\n\nJoint-Committee's report, permission submitted as definite and urgent request to the authorities concerned, by the Dominion Government.\n\nConclusion I.\n\nThat the present scale of per capita grants, inclusive of the special war bonus of $20, allowed for pupils in Indian residential schools, be made the permanent scale, and that to meet, in part, the heavy increase in the costs of supplies, equipment and maintenance, a bonus of $20 per pupil be added, etc., etc., all rounds.\nConclusion II\n\nThat province financial obligations in the maintenance of Indian Residential Schools, frequently arise, in large part, from the fact that although the Church is compelled to organise and maintain the schools on the basis of an attendance of the maximum number of pupils for which the schools have accommodation, a lesser number of pupils are actually in attendance; the government put into force the Compulsory clause of the revised Indian Act, and secure an attendance of the maximum number of pupils at each and all Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAll of which, on behalf of the Joint Secretariat, is very respectfully submitted.\n\nOttawa\nJanuary 7th 1921.\n\nS. [Signature]\nSecretary & Joint Superintendent\nprovide a further amount for Indian Education...$100,000.00.\n\nThe above item represents a bonus at the rate of $30.00 per capita for the 5,000 pupils provided for in the Residential Indian Schools. This amount will increase the total estimate for Indian Education from $1,227,805.00 to $1,327,805.00.\n\nA joint deputation representing the various religious denominations waited upon the Superintendent General a few days ago, and urged that this amount be granted as a bonus for the current year only. They are satisfied with the present per capita rate, which was increased by $10.00 in 1916 and by a further $10.00 in 1919. They state that while they have been able to maintain the schools on the government grants plus increased revenue from their own resources, they have been unable to make good any repairs, carry out any improvements in their buildings or to meet any incidental deficits from their current resources. Financial statements submitted to the Department show that during recent years the churches have contributed approximately 25% of the cost of maintenance of these schools. It will thus be seen that the partnership existing between the Government and the Churches relieves the former of a large expenditure which would have to be met if a State system of Indian Education prevailed; and at the same time the State would lose the moral and civilising influence of the Churches in its ultimate design of advancing the Indians towards full citizenship. The Churches confidently assert that if this bonus be granted for one year, they will be enabled during the following year to conduct the schools without any call upon the Government for maintenance beyond the authorised per capita grant.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the financial assistance given to our schools from Parliamentary Appropriations and like grants made to similar institutions in the United States from Appropriations by Congress.\n\nIn the United States the responsibility for Indian Education was some time ago assumed by the State. Previous to 1918 the per capita grant allowed by the United States Government for residential schools was $107.00. In 1918 this was increased to $200.00 for schools with a pupilage of one hundred or over, and $225.00 for schools with a pupilage below one hundred. During the fiscal year 1919-20 the average grant to Residential schools in Canada was approximately $137.00. During the year 1919-20 the average appropriation made by the United States Government for the education of Indian children in residential and day schools was $211.75 per capita, while in Canada for the same year the per capita appropriation was $141.37.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nJanuary 18, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inclose herewith an item for the main Estimates of this Department for the year 1921-22, which the Honourable Sir James Loughheed is anxious to have included and considered with our other items.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.C.

The reports for later years are not yet in print and it is impossible to get the facts you desire from the Department's Annual Reports. If you wish for certain information for the fiscal years 1920-21 and 1921-22, I will be pleased to prepare the figures from the papers that we have on file, upon receipt of certain definite queries. You yourself will be in a position to ask definite questions after having prepared the table of information from the Auditor General's reports that I am forwarding, under separate cover.\n\nI am afraid that the information you are seeking will entail considerable time and effort in the compilation thereof, but the facts are contained in the Auditor General's reports for 1910-11, beginning with page H-65. On that and the following pages, detailed information concerning the expenditure for each residential school under the Department of Indian Affairs is given. The denomination of these schools, if unknown to you, can be determined by reference to the current annual report of this Department.\n\nWhen you have completed the figures of which you are in search, I will be grateful to have the 10 copies of the Auditor General's report returned to me. These are becoming more and more difficult to get and are extremely valuable to the Schools Branch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMarch 7, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI have read the attached letter from the Rev. J. B. Beys, Provincial of the Oblate Order, requesting that the Department assume the ownership, upon payment, of the Indian Boarding schools at Cowessess, Pine Creek, Muscowequans and Kenora.\n\nIt would certainly be in the interest of our work if all these buildings were owned by the government, as well as other boarding school buildings owned by the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches who are interested in Indian education. The union of the Church and State in this matter of Indian education is well recognized, and in 1911, when we made a new arrangement with the schools, the then Superintendent General, the Hon. Frank Oliver, laid down as a principle that we should own our own school buildings, although he did not pledge the government to acquire the existing boarding school buildings owned by the Churches. One can readily realize that individual capital expenditure and the upkeep of these buildings are a serious drain on Church funds.\n\nAs a matter of general policy, I am in favour of the acquirement of all these buildings. As you are aware our Estimates do not contemplate any building operations for the approaching fiscal year, but it might be well, and I would propose with your concurrence to do so, to submit supplementary estimates for the value of these buildings, (which seems to me would be fair) and to include the necessary buildings for the other Churches which are now on requisition, in order that the denominations may be treated fairly and equitably, and that the whole matter may receive the careful consideration of the government.\n\n(Sgd.) Duncan C. Scott.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI have reason to know that the grants requested by the respective churches for buildings in connection with Indian Work have not been included in the estimates presented to the Parliament at Ottawa, and in conference with Canon Gould, the Missionary Secretary of the Anglican Church, we have decided to have a delegation go down to Ottawa at the earliest opportunity to make an appeal to the Premier, the Finance Minister, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and yourself, - providing an interview will be granted us. The probability is that representatives of the Presbyterian Church will accompany the delegation that may be appointed by the Anglican and Methodist Churches.\n\nWould it be possible for you to arrange the desired interview, say, on Thursday of next week, April 6th, - and failing to arrange it for that day, could we secure an interview with the above named persons any day the following week? We will be greatly obliged to you if you can secure an appointment for us as proposed.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC & Manning\n\nDuncan C.

Dr. Manning suggests Thursday, April 6th, as a convenient date for this joint delegation from the three Protestant Churches referred to.\n\nWill you kindly indicate whether such an interview can be arranged, and if so, the date of the same, so that I may advise the representatives of the Churches.\n\n(Sd) J.D.

A request has also come from the Roman Catholic authorities in British Columbia. Cariboo, Squamish and St. Mary's schools have been offered to the Department, at a valuation not specified. We have also been approached concerning the purchase of Beauval in Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nOutbuildings, Alterations and Minor Repairs.\n\nAt certain residential schools, barns and extensive alterations are extremely necessary. The amount needed is $169,000. The chief claims are Mohawk, Mt.

There is no item in the Main Estimates for new residential school buildings. It is proposed to submit the requests to Parliament in the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23.\n\nSupplementary Estimates 1922-23\n\nThe most urgent needs are as follows:\nNew residential school buildings:\nRoman Catholic Duck Lake\nChurch of England Central Saskatchewan\nMethodist Coqualeetza and Edmonton\nPresbyterian Cecilia Jeffrey.\n\nThe total required for these buildings is $775,000.\nOutbuildings, alterations and minor repairs:\n\nAt certain residential schools, barns and extensive alterations are extremely necessary. The chief claims are Mohawk, Mt. Elgin, Chapleau, Cross Lake, Qu'Appelle, File Hills, Muscowequans, Coqualeetza, St. Mary's, Alberni and Fraser Lake. The amount needed for this purpose is $165,000.\n\nIncreased pupilage:\n\nIt has been found necessary to authorize increased pupilage at a few schools. The amount needed to care for this extra expense is $7,000.\n\nDay Schools:\n\n12 day schools are urgently required. The total cost will be $52,000.\n\nSupp. Est. 1922-23 Total: $999,000.\n\nIn addition to the urgent needs enumerated above, in connection with the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23, the Department will need funds to pay the bonus to day school teachers, if the special bonus vote is discontinued. The amount would be $37,000.\n\nThe policy of the Department is to take over residential schools from the churches and maintain the buildings and equipment whenever funds can be voted for this purpose. At the present time, the Roman Catholic Church authorities are asking us to purchase four schools under the auspices of the Manitoba Provincial of the Oblate Order. A request has also come from the Roman Catholic authorities in British Columbia. Cariboo, Squamish and St. Mary's have been offered to the Department at a valuation not specified. In connection with the first mentioned four schools - Kenora, Pine Creek, Cowessess and Muscowequans, the valuation is $248,500.\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI have received a further communication from Dr. C. H. Manning, of Toronto, stating that a joint delegation, on behalf of the Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches, will be in Ottawa Thursday next, the 13th, for the purpose of an interview with the Premier, the Finance Minister and yourself. Canon Gould, Dr. Edmison, and others will represent the Anglican and Presbyterian Churches; and Dr. Chown and Dr. Manning, the Methodist Church.\n\nThese gentlemen wish to make representations in connection with Indian Education and will be most grateful if you can arrange an interview at any hour after 9 A.M. on Thursday, next.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE INTERVIEW\nBETWEEN THE CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nAPRIL 13, 1922.\n\nDr. Chown, General Superintendent of the Methodist Church, who introduced the delegation, mentioned the State's obligation arising out of the treaties with the Indian people of Canada.\n\nCanon Gould, of the Church of England in Canada, spoke at some length of the urgent need for funds for the erection of residential schools.\n\nFather Guy, of the Roman Catholic Church, enlarged upon the remarks of the previous speaker and made the suggestion that Indian trust funds be applied in a more extensive way to the problem of Indian education.\n\nDr. Edmison, of the Presbyterian Church, explained the financial condition of his organization, and asked the Government to recommence taking over the responsibilities in connection with buildings and equipment. He requested a new school for Cecilia Jeffrey, on a site to be chosen, and suggested that the Government take over the Presbyterian residential school property in the near future.\n\nDr. Manning, of the Methodist Church, commented on the unity among the various societies doing Indian work, and asked that there be included in the Supplementary Estimates for 1922-23 the several requests already made to the Department. He referred to the immediate needs of the Methodist Church at Edmonton, Coqualeetza and Muncey.\n\nThe Hon. Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in reply, stated that there was great need at the present time of economy in connection with State expenditures. He mentioned that, if his efforts to obtain funds for new residential school buildings were abortive this year, the Department would at least keep the old buildings in repair during the interim before such time as funds could be provided. He stated that the possibility and advisability of taking Indian trust funds on loan for the purpose of erecting residential schools had been, and would continue to be, a matter of serious consideration. Mr. Stewart realized the unique position of the unfinished plant at Edmonton, and stated that this particular school and its needs would receive due attention.\nDr. Edmonson thanked the Minister for his interest in the work and promised that no undue pressure, in connection with new buildings, would be brought to bear at this time. He was personally gratified that the Minister had admitted the principle that the State should assume the responsibility for buildings in connection with residential schools, and was pleased that the Government was prepared, even this year, to do the repairing that would be found necessary from time to time.\n\nCanon Gould inquired if the Government would make any distinction between church-owned and state-owned property in connection with the temporary programme of upkeep.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Stewart, in reply to Canon Gould's question, stated that the Department would endeavour to keep the church-owned buildings in state of good repair, until such time as new buildings could be provided.\n\nDr. Chown thanked the Minister for the hearing and for his evident interest in the education of the Indian people.\nOttawa, April 21, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your favour of the 17th instant, setting forth your understanding of the principles discussed at the meeting last week, when I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with the representatives of the Church Missionary Societies that are doing educational work among our Indian wards.\n\nYou may rest assured that it is my purpose to urge upon the Government the desirability of providing, as soon as possible, the residential school buildings that are needed to successfully carry out the work. As an interim arrangement, the Department of Indian Affairs will endeavour to have voted the funds necessary to enable the Church authorities concerned to carry out the urgent repairs on the residential school buildings owned by them.\n\nI have to thank you for your expression of appreciation, and I wish to assure the Church representatives of my continued interest in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nRe: Ownership Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThere are 75 Indian residential schools under the auspices of this Department. This figure includes 2 institutions (Edmonton and Elkhorn) at which there are, at present, no Indian children. 43 of these residential schools are owned by the Churches and 32 by the State.\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\nThere are 40 residential schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. 27 of these institutions are owned by the Church authorities. The Oblate Order owns 22 of these Roman Catholic church-owned boarding schools.\n\n- Albany Mission, Ont. (6)\n- Kenora, Ont. (1)\n- Pine Creek, Man. (1)\n- Coopers, Sask. (1)\n- Macdonald, Sask. (1)\n- Thunderchild, Sask. (8)\n- Beaverl, Sask. (2)\n- Duck Lake, Sask. (5)\n- Onion Lake, Sask. (5)\n- Pelican, Alta. (5)\n- Ermineskin, Alta. (5)\n- Blue Quills, Alta. (5)\n- Fort Chipewyan, Alta. (4)\n- St. Bernards, Alta. (4)\n- St. Bruno, Alta. (4)\n- Sturgeon Lake, Alta. (4)\n- Vermilion Lake, Alta. (4)\n- Wabiskas Lake, Alta. (4)\n- Fort Resolution, N.W.T. (4)\n- Providence Mission, N.W.T. (4)\n- St. Mary's Mission, B.C. (3)\n- Cariboo, B.C. (3)\n\nThe schools marked (1) are modern, up to date buildings, in good condition and are adequate for the purpose of Indian education. The Provincial of the Oblate Order in Winnipeg (Father Boys) has urgently requested that these 4 properties be purchased. In the supplementary Estimates for 1922-23 there is an item of $48,000 to provide for the purchase of the Kenora Boarding School, after an adjusting - of the valuation -\nof the valuation. If this amount is voted, the principle involved, i.e., the gradual acquisition of all residential school buildings owned by the churches, will be acknowledged; and from time to time, as Parliament provides funds, the other institutions marked (1) and the schools in British Columbia marked (3) could be purchased. These 2 institutions in British Columbia and a third one, the Squamish Boarding School, owned by the Sisters of the Holy Infant (R.C.), have been offered to the Government at a valuation (not stated) by the Church authorities in the Western provinces. Beauval Boarding School, Sask., marked (2), has been named by the Oblates as the last school the purchase of which is desired.\n\nI wish to refer to the possibility of future requests on the part of the Roman Catholic Church that the State purchase the other church-owned residential schools. Those marked (4) are north of the main lines of communication and could be considered largely missionary activities for some years. The institutions marked (5) are either in poor condition or are not modern and would likely be turned over to the State from time to time, at practically no cost. As you are aware, it has hitherto been the policy of the Department to substitute modern, up-to-date buildings in place of the original residential schools erected with church funds which, owing to lapse of time and the development of the work, become dilapidated and inadequate. At the time of the transfer, the monetary consideration is generally nil.\n\n5 Roman Catholic church-owned institutions have not been listed above. This Department would never purchase the Fort William Orphanage, Ont., or the St. Albert Boarding School, Alta., as these are primarily convents for the education of white children. The Squamish Boarding School, B.C., should not be considered, as the property is entirely inadequate for Indian residential school purposes. The Christie Industrial School, B.C., is modern, and the possibility of taking it over, at a valuation, must be considered. The last named institution is owned by the Basilian Order. The Spanish Industrial School, Ont., a large, modern institution belonging to the Jesuit Order, is worth about $150,000, and I believe, may be offered to the State.\n\nChurch of England.\n\nThere are 21 residential schools under the auspices of the Church of England. 10 of these are not owned by the State. When the time comes to take over these institutions, the monetary consideration will be nil, because of the poor condition of the buildings or their situation.\n\nMethodist.\n\n7 residential schools are under the Methodist Church. 2 of these are church-owned, and would likely be offered to the Department, gratis, when we are able to re-build.\n\nPresbyterian.\n\n7 Indian residential schools are under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. 4 of these are church-owned. 3 are modern and well designed for the purposes of Indian education, and we will be asked to purchase these in the future. One is dilapidated, and we would pay nothing to the Church when we decided to re-build.\nRECAPITULATION.\n\nRoman Catholic.\n\nOblate Order\n\n1. Lenora $48,000.\n2. Pine Creek $83,000.\n3.

In his stead, we find the Indian of today once again a virile, strong type that is being assimilated rapidly into the composite Canadian race. Association with the White Man has won a partial immunity from the diseases that played such havoc with the health and population of the Indian at the time of his initial contact. The Indian population has been slightly increasing for some time; and in many parts of Canada, we have a flourishing group of natives - fast adopting our methods of earning a livelihood and clamoring for an education.\n\nThe Dominion Government realizes the importance of providing proper educational facilities for its wards; and increasing appropriations for Indian Education are being made from year to year. The Department of Indian Affairs is responsible for or is associated in the maintenance of about 750 teachers to the Indian youth. Most of the workers are missionary teachers; the churches and State are working side by side in the effort to prepare future Indian men and women for broader citizenship.\n\nSome 12,900 Indian children are enrolled today in the 330 day and residential schools. These schools are not under the control of the Departments of Education in the different provinces, but are financed and managed jointly by the Department of Indian affairs and the various churches engaged in the work. In each province the Indian schools are inspected regularly by qualified school inspectors and the work done by Indian pupils already compares favourably with white schools in the same localities.\n\nIn the day schools, in addition to the regular curricula, prescribed by the Departments of Education, emphasis is placed on hand work, gardening, hygiene and group games. The residential schools give still further training in the manual arts that will assist the pupil in later life. The boys are trained in farming, gardening and the care of stock; the girls are systematically taught all household duties. Parliament annually provides appropriations - amounting last year to $1,568,420.45 - from which the expenditures for the maintenance of the various institutions are made. The churches are interested not only in the conduct of schools but provide further funds to finance the schools. These grants are supplemented from Indian bands' trust funds when they are available.\n\nFurther training or assistance is offered to the promising graduates of the day and residential schools. About 90 young Indian men and women are attending high schools and colleges in Canada. Financial assistance and careful supervision for these special pupils are arranged for by the Department of Indian Affairs. Other energetic\ngraduates are given grants for stock, implements, household equipment or building material. This training and assistance has been a great stimulant to progress and has resulted in early independence.\n\nAn important factor in the general scheme is field work. In addition to nearly 40 field matrons and graduate nurses who are working on the reserves, day school teachers, Indian agents, missionaries and farm instructors take an active interest in the affairs of the Indian in his own habitat. Housewives and mothers are being trained and clean living is promoted.\n\nIndian education has many discouraging features: yet, in spite of reactionary elements, the forces of Church and State combine to create sure progress in Christian civilization.\nSept. 22, 1922.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE\n\nArchdeacon MacKay is of the opinion that the 80 to 100 pupil residential school situated close to the reserve is the best type. He claims that this is a manageable size and the Indian people are not asked to send the children to any great distance.\n\nR.J.F.\nDr. Duncan C.

Supt-General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you be kind enough to inform me whether any changes in the present system of Indian education are being contemplated; whether the government proposes to curtail any of the privileges now exercised by the various religious denominations and to assume a larger degree of responsibility in this work?\n\nI remember having heard Honorable Charles Stewart remark at the meeting in Vancouver last summer, at which you were present, that the subject of Indian education was being thoroughly gone into at Ottawa at that moment; and a short time ago I heard that the government was taking over all the school buildings and equipments and reserving to itself the privilege of appointing teachers. So, in a word, I should appreciate a short outline of any changes that may be underway.\n\nI am deeply interested in this subject, and as I have devoted a brief paragraph to it in an article which I am writing, I should like to have full grasp of the situation, that I may give the Department full credit for any improvements that are likely to be instituted.\n\nAgain, I should like to ask whether there is any likelihood of a complete withdrawal of Indian education from the hands of the church.\n\nThanking you for any information you may be able to give me in respect of the foregoing, I beg to remain,\n\nc/o John R. Bunn, Esq.,\nChamber of Commerce,\nWinnipeg \u2014 Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nBuffalo Child Long Lance)\nOttawa, January 5th, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the plans of this Department for the development of the education of the Indian peoples of Canada.\n\nThere has been no radical change in the policy of the Department with reference to Indian education. As you will understand our activities are strictly limited by the appropriation which Parliament places at our disposal each Session. While the constant wish of the Department is to expand and in every way improve the system, the need for general economy which the Government finds so pressing at this time, has to be considered. It is our wish to rapidly conform to the programmes of studies laid down by the various Provincial Departments of Education, and when possible to improve the method of instruction and the personnel of the teaching staffs. We are already utilizing the services of the public school inspectors in seven provinces, in an effort to bring the Indian schools, from an academic standpoint, up to the standard of the public schools.\n\nThe Department intends to continue to cooperate with the various denominations in the educational work.\n\nB.

Indians in the west who are sufficiently advanced to understand what your late innovation means are appreciative of the efforts being made by the department to raise their educational system to a higher standard.

They wish to submit resolutions dealing with the following subjects:\n\n1. Education.\n2. Preservation of the Race.\n3. Thrift.\n4. Defective and Delinquent Children.\n5. The Outside Service.\n6. Disturbances among the Six Nation Indians.\n7. The British Columbia Land Question.\n\nI Education:\nWhereas in the matter of Indian education results do not seem to be commensurate with expenditure incurred this Council respectfully suggests:\nA more earnest effort on the part of Indian Agents and truant officers in securing regular attendance at local Reserve Schools.\n\nII Preservation of the Race:\nThere has been brought to the attention of your Committee this year as in former years, the problem of the continuance of the custom of allowing trial marriages to take place on the Indian reserves. When a trial marriage occurs, no special rite is observed except the complimentary exchange of gifts, and nothing is done which is calculated to give the couple a realization of the responsibility of their position. A spirit of irresponsibility is in fact encouraged by a certain public opinion which supports the action of couples, who, after living\ntogether some months as man and wife, grow tired of one another and separate, to enter perhaps very soon afterward into new marriage relations. This custom is the cause of much looseness and profligacy among Indians on reserves. There are few reserves in Canada which are free from the menace to the Indian race which such looseness constitutes. Your Committee therefore submit the following resolution:\n\nWhereas we conceive the objective of Government and Church work among Indians to be their inclusion in Christian citizenship, and Whereas the home is the fundamental unit of national life, and Whereas looseness in domestic relationships on the Indian Reserves is causing much concern among many of the missionaries of the various churches engaged in Indian work, and Whereas much of this looseness has its roots in the trial marriages practised by the natives, and Whereas immorality produces disease, physical decay and race degeneracy, and Whereas the Indian Agents have already rendered excellent service in this matter in their own Agencies,\n\nBe it hereby resolved that we respectfully suggest to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs that a letter be sent out to all Indian Agents, setting forth the facts and asking them to use their influence to persuade the people under their care to forsake their old practices in this regard and to adhere more closely to Canadian laws and Christian teaching concerning marriage, for the purpose of preserving and improving the race.\n\nIII Thrift:\n\nAttention of the Committee has been called for many years to the effect upon treaty Indians of the annual dole. Frequent instances have been reported of interruption to profitable pursuits by Indians, who lose days and much outlay in order to go to the meeting place where the annuity dole is to be given. In some cases, the loss of time and income exceeds the amount of annuity. Moreover inducements are often found at the meeting place to squander unprofitably their Treaty Bounty.\n\nYour Committee consider that it would be well, as an incentive to industry, thrift and enterprise that recommendation be made to the Department of Indian Affairs that reasonable meetings through Indian Agents on Reserves, or through the League of Indians, which has the confidence of our native Indians, to influence Indian public opinion favourably to provision being made whereby Indians may give instruction to have the amount of their annuity become an annual deposit in the Indians' Savings Account to the credit of the individual Indian. The funds of the Savings Account should be available on easy terms, on recommendation of the Indian Agent of the Band or Reserve, to Indians engaged in farming or other profitable industry.\n\nIV Defective and Delinquent Children:\n\nYour Committee also submit the following resolution:\n\nWhereas we greatly deplore the present necessity for placing defective and delinquent Indian children in the same schools with normal Indian children,\n\nThe Social Service Council of Canada recommends that the Indian Department undertake at the earliest possible moment the establishing of institutions for delinquent and defective children, such institutions to take the form of industrial farms, and to be at least two in number, one for Eastern and one for Western Canada.\n\nV The Outside Service:\n\nSince the abuses arising out of the practice of partisan political patronage were nowhere more\nobvious than when Indians were the victims of the inefficiency of appointees, your Committee submits this resolution:\n\nThe Social Service Council of Canada notes with gratification the marked improvement in the Outside Service of the Department of Indian Affairs since the abolition of the patronage system, and would deprecate greatly any tendency toward a return to this system.\n\nVI The Six Nation Indians:\u2014\n\nYour Committee has considered the disturbances fomented recently among the Six Nation Indians by agitators and others whose activities have brought about a grave situation, and have placed in jeopardy the best interests of the Indians concerned. The disturbance, where it flourishes most, is leading back to paganism and unbridled immorality, and even in the localities where it has not found fertile soil it has brought considerable inconvenience to the Indians who are loyal to their government and to their country as a whole.\n\nThe following resolution, it is therefore felt, should receive hearty adoption by the Council:\u2014\n\nThe Social Service Council of Canada expresses its deep concern at the discussion raised by a certain section of the Six Nation Indians and their claim that they are not subject to the laws of Canada in general, whether Provincial or Federal, but rather are an independent nation in the midst of our country. The situation developed as a result of this contention would be impossible alike in law and in morals.\n\nThe Council therefore calls upon the Churches and the other bodies federated in the Council to uphold the hands of the authorities in maintaining law and order on the Reserves concerned. Meantime the Council expresses its confidence as well as its hope that every claim of the Six Nation Indians will be decided by an impartial body and full justice done alike to the Indians and to Canada.\n\nVII The British Columbia Land Question:\u2014\n\nTo the long-standing dispute on the subject of Indian title to British Columbia lands your Committee have devoted the major portion of their time and attention during the last year. It will be recalled that for many years the British Columbia Indians have been seeking recognition of their title, never ceded to the Province, or to the Dominion as had been done long ago in consideration of certain compensations by the Indians in other parts of Canada. Until quite recently it was felt by many who were interested in the welfare of the Indians of British Columbia that the claim of these Indians should be submitted to a competent court for settlement. This was, in fact, among the recommendations adopted last year by the Social Service Council of Canada. The situation, however, has recently altered. The Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, after consultation with representatives of the British Columbia Government, has conceded the main point in dispute, by his statement of July 24th, 1922, that the Indians of British Columbia possess aboriginal title to the lands of the Province.\n\nThe following is an extract from the notable speech made on that day by the Honourable Charles H. Stewart in the presence of representatives of the Dominion Government and of various Indian tribes of British Columbia:\n\n\"Shortly after taking office I discovered that there were some difficulties in the Indian Department, but I think there is a possibility of settling the grievances in an amicable way. The thing for the Ministers to do is to meet the people who are subjects of our Country and discuss...\"\nthese questions with them. As I mentioned to Mr. Pauli, when he was in Ottawa, I wanted today to hear a discussion of these questions, as we are greatly interested in these matters.\n\nI do not want to go into detail, but to say that you are the aboriginal owners of this Province, as no treaty was ever made with the Indians of British Columbia.\n\nThe Province turned over control of certain interests to Ottawa when they entered Confederation and one of the agreements was that the Federal Government should take over the management of the Indians of British Columbia. Now this question has never been settled since British Columbia entered Confederation.\n\nI have held conferences with Premier Oliver and other Provincial Officials and they are willing to meet the Federal Government half-way in the question of reserve lands and reserve rights in those parts of the Province where the Indians are engaged in farming and fishing for their living; that is, Indians who have no new lands will have to be purchased for this purpose.\n\nI agree with Mr. Kelly that we will have to meet in a Royal Commission Conference to discuss these matters in detail. I am authorized to say that the Federal Government is prepared to give the Indians of British Columbia everything that has been given to the other tribes of Canada, who, unlike you, have treaties with the Government. There had been some talk after many years of promises and discussions resulting in nothing, that the issues should be referred to the Privy Council. When I entered this conference I stated my intention of trying to arrive at an amicable understanding without the necessity of putting the Indians to the cost of court proceedings. It was my opinion, and I am confirmed by the events of the day, that these things could be settled by a Government which would get about seriously considering them in a systematic and highly important manner.\n\nI agree with Mr. Kelly that the Indians have to adapt themselves to new conditions in order to adapt themselves to new living as previously they earned all their rights to the white men who came into the country. I would like to see not only in British Columbia, but throughout Canada, the Indian put on a footing with his white brother in every walk of life. Let me close by saying that we want to have a settlement of all difficulties in the near future.\n\nIn consideration of the changed aspect of affairs thus indicated your Committee submit the following resolution for adoption by the Council:\n\nThe Social Service Council of Canada expresses its satisfaction at the announcement of the Dominion Government, conceding to the Indians of British Columbia the aboriginal title to lands in that Province, and with its expression of its hope of an amicable settlement without the necessity of putting the Indians to the cost of court proceedings.\nCONFIDENTIAL\u2014For your information as a delegate to the Council. These findings have not been endorsed by the S.S.C.C. This report will be discussed at the annual meeting, and this advance copy is sent for your private information preceding that discussion.\n\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MOTION PICTURES\n\nThe Committee appointed by the Social Service Council of Canada to consider the subject of Motion Pictures wishes to submit the following report:\n\nIt will be recalled that at the last Annual Meeting of the Social Service Council of Canada, this Committee was asked to correspond with the Provincial Councils with a view to arriving at the best method of conducting a Commission of Review.\n\nIn view of this decision the Motion Picture Committee of this year has found the scope of its deliberations considerably diminished, and asks the Council after hearing reports from the various Provincial Councils to come to a decision as to what the work of this Committee shall be during the year 1923.\n\nMeantime, the Committee submits the following resolution:\n\n\"Whereas the responsibility for cutting episodes from films which have been prepared only at the expenditure of much time and money is a great one, and\n\nWhereas the weight of this responsibility is greater than one person should be called upon to carry, and\n\nWhereas at present in some of the provinces of Canada it is customary for films to be viewed by only one censor,\n\nBe it resolved that the Social Service Councils of the various Provinces be asked to recommend to the governments concerned that in future the Provincial Board of Censors consist of at least three members, so that at no time, in the ordinary course of events, will any censor be called upon to make decisions alone, and on his or her own responsibility.\"\nProgramme\n\nSixteenth Annual Convention\nof the\nSocial Service Council\nof Canada\n\nOTTAWA\nJanuary 29th to February 1st\n1923\n\nAll morning and afternoon sessions and the evening session of Thursday, February 1st, will be held in the Chateau Laurier Banquet Hall, first floor.\n\nEvening meetings on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will be held in the Collegiate Institute Hall, Lisgar Street.\n\n\"There is always a new horizon for forward looking folk.\"\n\nGeneral Secretary: Dr. J.

I would like to have seen you before this report is discussed and adopted, as there are one or two matters I want to talk to you about. I will not be at my office on Saturday morning, but will be here on Monday. I hope to have an opportunity of a conversation with you.\n\nWith best regards, I remain.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDr. J. G. Shearer,\nGeneral Secretary,\nThe Social Service Council of Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nI have to request that you furnish me with a list of the various Indian Industrial, and Boarding Schools, maintained or assisted by your Department, giving the amount of the annual per capita grant in each case, the maximum number of pupils for which that grant is payable, and the denomination under whose auspices each school is operated, distinguishing between government owned and church owned schools. I should like to get this information for the fiscal year 1922-23 and to be advised with regard to any changes that may be made in the future.\n\nAt the same time I should like to be informed as to what part of the expenses of the various schools is supposed to be covered by the annual grant, what expenses are considered as properly payable by the government in addition to the grant, and what expenses, if any, are supposed to be met by the religious body under whose auspices the school is operated.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Auditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJWR/MVT\n\nAnswer was prepared but not directed.\n| Province | Name                        | Denomination | Pupilage (Mar.31/23) | P.C.Grant (Incl.

Church-owned schools are grouped under denominations and also show the pupilage and grant allowed. In explanation I wish to state that the amount of per capita grant for boarding schools is determined on three bases: 1. ownership - government or church; 2. geographical situation - west, east and north; 3. type of building - well equipped and modern or otherwise. Two schools in the Yukon receive a higher grant than any others, because of the costs of food, clothing and other staple articles. Industrial schools each receive a per capita grant of $150, except in the province of Ontario, where they are classified in the same manner as boarding schools. In the industrial school class there are two exceptions to the general rule - the Mohawk Institute in Ontario, and the Lytton Industrial School, in British Columbia, which are financed solely by this Department and without assistance from any missionary society or order. I am hopeful that these two institutions will be able to finance on per capita grants of $160 and $180, respectively, during the fiscal year 1923-24. The information contained in the attached list is for the fiscal year 1922-23.\n\nFrom time to time, it is necessary to increase the pupilage at those residential schools whose applications are numerous and whose accommodation can be provided. The pupilage figures in each case are those that obtained at the close of the fiscal year 1922-23. Occasionally, when a school is accommodating its full quota of pupils, and the Department finds it necessary to admit orphan or destitute children, we allow supernumerary grant for them, until such time as vacancies occur among the regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nRelative to the second paragraph of your letter, I have to state that the per capita grant is to enable the principal to meet current expenses: food, clothing and salaries are the major items in this connection. Equipment and equipment replacements, repairs to buildings, pupils' travelling expenses, medical and veterinary services and supplies, and postage are the chief expenses at residential schools.\n\nW. Learns, Esq.,\nAssistant Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nschools that are met by parliamentary appropriation, independent of the per capita grant. When funds are available, this Department meets expenses of every kind, with the possible exception of those incurred for food and clothing. The religious organization under whose auspices a school is operated may give grants to the principal, for salaries, to meet deficits and for any other purpose it sees fit.\n\nThere are some government-owned schools where church missionary societies or orders make special grants amounting to thousands of dollars per annum, in an effort to permit the school to give the type of instruction and residential care upon which we insist, and to keep the institution in a solvent condition.\n\nEncl. Yours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| Province       | Name                  | Denomination | Pupilage (Mar.31/23) | F.O.Grant (Incl.Bonus) |\n|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Ontario       | Mt.

My complaints have referred to both the technical training and that of the classrooms, but particularly to the former. Instead of improvement taking place there has been a steady retrograde movement, and I think steps should be taken by the Department to insist on better instruction being given to our boys.\n\nA large percentage of the ex-pupils on leaving many of our Industrial and Boarding schools today know little or nothing about the care of stock and do not display as much intelligence along these lines as do many Indians who have never attended school, neither can they be entrusted with a team of horses in the majority of cases. Losses of Horses due to neglect on the part of these young men is, to say the least, startling, and I wish to point out that these losses take place in the face of the fact that only those graduates who are considered to be worthy to receive them are entrusted with these animals; that is to say only the best of the ex-pupils received them. If we gave such assistance to all who graduate our losses would be three times as great as they now are.\n\nIt is not only along these lines that the training received is of no real value because of its\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin inefficiency; in regard to farming operations also, about fifty percent of the graduates leave school with a very limited knowledge of how to carry on this important work and many of them cannot do so any better than Indians who have never been at school. Of course there are exceptions where the training they have received at school has been of great benefit, but in such cases the Indian is usually an intelligent man who would probably have done fully as well with the ordinary supervision that is given by the Agents and farming Instructors on reserves.\n\nI make these statements partly from personal observations and partly after hearing the opinions of Inspectors and Agents who have had to deal with this problem on the reserve. Particularly during the past two years I have been repeatedly told that ex-pupils are more careless of their property and less able to manage their affairs and work than those Indians who have not attended school. Most of these opinions I respect because they have been expressed by people living and working among the Indians and who know whereof they speak. In most instances where the graduates make good on their farms it is as a result of careful and helpful supervision and instructions by the Farm Instructors and Agents and not because of the training they have received at school.\n\nYou have had an opportunity of judging the training that is being carried on in the class-rooms of our schools and the class of teachers that is being employed to teach the Indian children. In very many cases the comments of the Public School Inspectors would lead one to believe that we are neglecting the children; wasting time and spending large sums of money and getting no results. Many times I have complained that our graduates on leaving school can hardly speak English, certainly many of them could not be employed as interpreters because of this lack of knowledge. I am continually receiving complaints from parents of the pupils regarding the poor education they are receiving at the schools and\nand we must admit that in many cases the reports of the Public School Inspectors would go to prove that such complaints are not without reason. I can understand why they do not wish to send their children to some schools.\n\nThe schools of late have had a free hand in regard to the matter of employment of teachers and Instructors and you can judge from the reports you have had from the Department's own officers and the Inspectors of the Provincial Governments the kind of people that have been employed. One of the Provincial Inspectors is of the opinion that the employment of teachers in our Indian Schools should be left with them. The inference is that the heads of our Institutions are not competent to make a selection for themselves, and if this be true, it indicates a sad state of affairs.\n\nI am not going to single out any particular school but I will say that we have men at the head of some of our important institutions at which they are supposed to teach practical farming, care of live stock, etc., who do not know the first thing about these essential branches of the work; men who could not begin to make a living at farming and who, nevertheless, have the responsibility of training our Indian youths in these important matters upon which most of them depend for a livelihood during the years thereafter they leave school.\n\nIn writing this letter to you I have in mind what you said at the time I referred to these matters when interviewing the Honourable, the Superintendent General just one year ago. Since then you have had reports from an independent source as to the class-room work, which bears out what I said. My remarks at that time were directed more particularly to the technical training of the boys. The subject under review was the Qu'Appelle Industrial school, the outcome of a report made by Inspector Christianson. I have not been advised what was done, if anything, so far as the technical instruction is concerned. Changes were made in the teaching staff but the new teachers were very little better than the ones they replaced and they too, have been removed, following a report from a Public school Inspector. One of the men reported\nreported on by Mr. Christianson has been re-engaged to teach at another Indian School.\n\nI hope I may be pardoned for saying that this Department is coming in for a great deal of criticism by the Public for the manner in which many of our schools are conducted, and I am satisfied there will be little improvement until such time as your officers in the field can feel that they will get support from the Department and that their recommendations will be given more consideration than has been the case in many instances in the past. You have two Inspectors who have made almost a life study of the various problems regarding the management of Indians and Indian Schools. Their reports, in my opinion, should be of the utmost value to the Department and should outweigh reports received from other sources. At present there is a feeling that these outside influence carry more weight.\n\nThe Department has spent a great deal of money and is going to spend more in building and re-building Indian schools, and all I can say is that unless there is a complete change in the methods very little will be achieved for the vast amount of money spent.\n\nThe Department's outside staff on all the reserves throughout the Three Prairie provinces has undergone an almost complete change in personnel. We have an entirely different type of men as Agents and Clerks and Instructors. We also have Travelling Nurses and resident matrons. These men and women have been chosen with care and there has been hearty co-operation between this staff and myself. Our Farming operations have increased one hundred percent during the last five years and there is no reason why our schools should not be brought up to a higher standard and do what is expected of them. The fact that Churches contribute to the maintenance of our schools is often used as a reason for dealing leniently and making allowances in regard to the staffs appointed. This has always been a handicap, but when it goes so far as to be responsible for almost a failure of our work, it is time to consider seriously the finding of some\n\nDept. should have free land to manage different Dept's in the schools.\nsome method by which the Department may have a free hand in making appointments and managing the various departments of the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have given consideration to your letter of March 23rd, which appears to deal generally with the question of Indian education and the policy of the Department therein.\n\nDating from the establishment of the schools, there has been cooperation between the various religious denominations interested in this problem and the Government. There is no intention to alter this policy, and the Department does not intend to assume greater responsibility for appointments to the staff of the various schools than it has at present. As you must be aware, the appointment of teachers and instructors at Indian residential schools has rested with the church authorities, and your remarks that of late they have had a \"free hand\" is misleading. The Department has always exercised pressure upon the missionary societies to appoint persons properly qualified for all teaching and administrative functions. We shall continue to insist on the employment of properly qualified officers and, where it is reported that competent persons are not on duty, changes will be made through the proper channel.\n\nThe difficulties surrounding Indian education are well known and the problem of ex-pupils is no new one. We have always depended, as you seem to acknowledge, on the supervision of ex-pupils by farming instructors and agents. The whole tendency in your letter is towards the abolition of the schools or taking them away from the control of the churches, and the Department does not intend to do either the one thing or the other. The intention is to combat the difficulties which are inherent in the situation, and with\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nthe loyal support of the Churches interested, to continue a system which has not been unproductive of good results. It is presumed that the Indian agents and farming instructors understand what their duty is with reference to ex-pupils; section 30 of the general instructions to agents deals with this important matter, but if you have any doubt in your mind on the question, they will be again instructed from headquarters.\n\nI observe your remarks respecting your own harmonious relationship with the staff.\n\nAs you have been informed, the Department cannot give an unqualified undertaking that it will accept the statements of its officers and carry out their recommendations without question. I may state with pleasure, however, that it has been found that the judgment of our officers in the field from coast to coast is good, that they for the most part loyally agree with the policy of the Department and therefore receive, in return, encouragement and support.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON\nDated April 11, 1923, Addressed to W. M. GRAHAM.\n\nRe: CROWFOOT R. C. & OLD SUND C. of E. Boarding Schools.\n\nOriginal on File 77-104.\n\nIn concluding my report on the schools I wish to point out the necessity of giving our Indian boys more attention at both schools in the way of outside work, that is farming and the proper care of stock. I have mentioned this matter to you personally in conversation on several occasions, also in my reports for the last two years. I have tried to point out that most of our boarding schools lack in my opinion, this essential work. As I have often stated before, it is just as important that the boys receive this kind of education as that received in the class room. The trouble I find, not only here but in other places, is that the farmer at the school is not the class of man competent to give instruction in this line to the boys under his charge. I informed the Principals at both schools that now that the Department had spent a lot of money on the schools and in that way had given the churches what they asked for, in future the Department would inspect the schools often and that the work outside of the school would be considered just as essential as the work in the class room.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Department will insist on the church authorities placing only men in charge of schools who have had actual experience along agricultural lines. Not only at these schools but in most of the schools I have visited they have certainly got to get a different class of man as farming instructor, and my argument in this matter can be borne out by the results that the Brandon Industrial school obtained with their stock this winter. There is no reason if the other schools were properly managed, why they could not do the same and it would certainly encourage the boys who are now attending school and I am quite sure they would be a different proposition to handle when finally discharged from the school.\n\n(Sgd.) M. Christianson.\nInspector.\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, acknowledging mine of the 23rd ultimo, in which I tried as best I could to bring to your attention for serious consideration the difficulties that your officers in the field are experiencing in handling many of graduates from some of our training schools.\n\nYou state that the Department has always exercised pressure upon the missionary societies to appoint persons properly qualified for all teaching and administrative functions, and that you will continue to insist on the employment of properly qualified officers. The Department is laboring under an entirely wrong impression if it is of the opinion that the pressure that has been exercised has had the desired effect in a great many cases. In these three provinces many of our schools are staffed by persons who are not qualified to teach or instruct our Indian children in the various departments over which they have charge. A great many of our teachers would not be allowed to teach in an ordinary country school. In support of this statement I need only refer you to the reports you have received from the various Inspectors of the Department of Education in these provinces. Have not these reports shown that in many cases the teaching and methods in our schools are very poor? Have not some of the reports gone so far as to say that we are depriving the Indian children of an education? It could not be otherwise with the unqualified men and women we have employed in our schools. The proportion of qualified teachers in our employ is very small.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs far as the technical training is concerned, who is better able to judge of this than your own officers who have had long experience and years of actual contact with conditions as they exist? The reports of your Inspectors do not show that the training has been beneficial to any great extent, and I can assure you the results have not been what might have been expected, in view of the expenditure in connection with this training.\n\nI take strong exception to your statement that the whole tendency of my letter was towards the abolition of the schools or taking them away from the control of the churches. I fail to see how my letter could possibly be construed as advocating or even suggesting either of these courses. I am in favor of the schools being carried on under the auspices of the churches; some of them are giving excellent results, but in those successful institutions they have properly qualified teachers and instructors.\n\nI note your remark in the last paragraph that your officers in the field for the most part loyally agree with the policy of the Department and therefore receive in return encouragement and support. By past experience I have had reason to realize the truth of that remark and also to know that on the other hand, those who venture to point out defects and suggest improvements are not encouraged for the interest thus shown, but rather the reverse.\n\nYou refer in your third paragraph to the duties of Indian Agents and farm instructors towards ex-pupils. It was not to the duties of these officials that my remarks were directed, but I merely referred to the failures among ex-pupils to point out that many of them leave school and are handed over to Agents and Instructors without having had the training they should have had during the ten years at school, and consequently not so apt to make a success at farming. The necessity for competent instructors for the expupils is very real and they have an important work to do, but that is apart altogether from the experiences the young Indians should gain at school and which, in many cases, they do not get. The aim of my letter was to bring to the Department a realization of the necessity of insisting on properly qualified teachers and instructors being appointed in all the schools, by pointing out some results of the non-exercise of this prerogative.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner\nMay 16, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 28th ultimo with further reference to the educational policy of the Department in the Western provinces.\n\nIt does not appear that this letter adds anything to the correspondence on this subject and it in no way alters the views of the Department as expressed in my letter to you of the 23rd ultimo. The Provincial inspectional system was extended to the Indian schools at the instance of the Department. The conditions are well known and everything possible is being done to meet them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 22, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nFor the past five years a bonus has supplemented the per capita grant to Indian residential schools. The special grant has been made to relieve the financial burden of the Churches, which have been spending large sums of money, in an effort to maintain and educate the Indian children as well as was done before the war on the Government grant. Delegations, representing the Churches engaged in Indian work, have intimated on several occasions in the past few years that the continuance of the increased per capita grant is, from their standpoint, absolutely necessary, if the degree of efficiency that now obtains is to prevail.\n\nThis bonus has amounted to $20 per capita for each of the past three years, and I shall be pleased, with your concurrence, to incorporate it in the general per capita grant. Such action will result in simplified bookkeeping and a clear understanding on the part of principals and church workers as to the amount of their earnings.\n\nDuncan C.

The Mohawk and Lytton Institutions in Ontario and British Columbia, respectively, are not wholly owned by the Government as the New England Company, of London, England, has considerable equity in the buildings. This Department has leased these two schools from the Company for a period of 21 years.\n\nYou will understand that it is necessary to increase the pupilage at certain residential schools from time to time. Further, when a school is accommodating its full quota of pupils and the Department orders the admission of orphan or destitute children, a temporary supernumerary grant is allowed until such time as vacancies occur among the regular grant-earning pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Moorhead's article he read at the meeting of the Committee of 100 held at Washington upon the request of the Secretary of the Interior, and was much interested in the policy and method of administration of Indian affairs in Canada which appears to differ radically from that practiced on this side of the line. I am a Dupt. and Spl. Disb. Agent which corresponds I understand to your Indian Agents and would be very glad if you would give me information as to the policy followed particularly as to schools, farming, etc. I understand the police work is left largely to the Provincial Police.\n\nWhat arrangement is made with the various Church denominations to educate the children, and how is the government money divided among those churches? What is the curriculum for the various schools? What is the policy followed in getting the adults to be self-supporting? How does an Indian gain citizenship there? How is the land and the reservations divided among the members of the bands? How long are the Indian Agents allowed to stay at one reservation as a rule or what is the average length of time he stays at one place? How is the health of the Indians taken care of? What difference is made as to the full bloods and half-breeds?\n\nI would appreciate it if you would kindly take time to answer some or all of the above queries, and also send me your last annual report and any other literature you may have available. Thanking you for your courtesy in this matter, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, March 7, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you request certain information concerning the administration of this Department. I am having forwarded to you, under separate cover, a copy of our latest Annual Report, a copy of the Indian Act and a pamphlet which refers to the management of Indian residential schools. The Indian Act contains sections which refer to the holding of land on reserves by the members of the bands, the distinctions between Indians and half-breeds, enfranchisement and to several other questions which you raise.\n\nParliament provides funds for the conducting of Indian residential schools. These are paid to the church authorities who are responsible for the management on a per capita per annum basis. Parliament also provides the major portion of the capital expense. The curriculum at an Indian school is that of the province in which the school is situated. The pamphlet which you will receive under separate cover is somewhat out of date now, but is still used as a guide.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Will you kindly give me whatever information you have on the subject referred to?\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Woodley\nMinister\n\nDept. Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 26, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the attached correspondence, I have to report that the per capita grant paid by the Government in the case of Indian residential schools varies from $120 to $240 per annum. In the Province of Alberta the rates are from $140 to $170.\n\nThe per capita grant is determined by the locality of the school, the type of buildings, the ownership of the institution and the instruction offered the pupils in residence.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 27, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to the inquiry from one of your constituents, whose letter I return herewith, I have pleasure in giving you the following information:\n\nThe Indian Residential Schools are conducted by the religious denominations interested, who receive a per capita grant for each pupil in attendance. The grant varies with the class of school and the ownership of the building. We pay a higher rate where the buildings are owned by the Church. Our grants run from $120.00 to $240.00 per annum. These grants have to be supplemented by Church funds. The staff is engaged by the Church, with the approval of the Department, and the schools are inspected by Inspectors of this Department and by the Inspectors of the Provincial Departments of Education.\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of our last Annual Report in which will be found a list of all our day, boarding and industrial schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHonourable George Headley,\nMinister of Agriculture,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nApril 25, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have examined an old file, numbered 91863, with a view to transferring any important correspondence to the 160 series. I have found, however, that the file consists of the letters and memoranda relative to the change to a per capita grant system, the determining of the amount of the per capita grant and the authority to pay such grant. For the purpose of fixing the principle of per capita grants an O.C., dated October 22, 1892, was secured.\nJanuary 10, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Paget,\n\nThe following Indian residential schools submit accounts direct to the Department from time to time:\n\nMohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont.\nMt.

T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., 41-43 The Bible House, Winnipeg, Man., and Rev. Jos. Guy, O. M. I., University of Ottawa, Ottawa, of the requirements in connection with accounts. These church representatives occasionally have independent dealings with the Department.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn the course of the last few years, I have received a number of communications relating to the difference in the per capita grants paid to the Indian Residential Schools. Classes of schools have been established in theory and the grants are paid according to the category in which the school is placed. Practically, all the Schools do the same work and I have thought of asking from the Department that only one class be established under the name of: Indian Residential Schools, with an uniform grant.\n\nOf course, I am speaking for the Schools of Western Ontario, the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia as I am not conversant with the conditions of the Schools of the other Provinces.\n\nI can say that the present request meets with the approval of our Provincials and the Principals and I hope that you find your way to settle this matter to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Henry [signature]\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I wish to assure you that the Department understands the difficulties which confront your Society in the administration of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. Rest assured that we will not press for standards of instruction and care which will not admit of attainment because of any inadequacy of physical equipment. It is our aim to provide the necessary buildings, etc., at all Indian residential schools, so that the work among the youth of our wards will make progress. As funds are available, this intention will be carried out and all we expect of your Society and the management of the individual schools is to do the best possible under the circumstances. You will understand, however, that the efficiency of personal services is not largely dependent on physical equipment at these institutions; and from time to time I will draw to your attention, when necessary, reports concerning the qualifications of members of the staff at this and other schools that are managed by your Society.\nOttawa, June 4, 1925.\n\nDear Mrs. Horne:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo and I note that you are interested in new fields for the evangelizing and education of our Indians. There are many pagan Indians in Canada, but they are either nomads in the northern parts of the provinces or are in zones where churches are already active. I am directing to you, under separate cover, our last Annual Report, and on page 28, et seq., will be found a census of our wards showing the religious denominations.\n\nIf, after a study of groups shown as aboriginal in belief, you are interested in any reserve or locality, you might write to me and I will recapitulate the history of church efforts, if any.\n\nI regret that, at the present writing, I cannot encourage any schemes for the extension of our educational programme in Ontario or the Prairie Provinces, where the great majority of pagan Indians are found. The Department is now associated in the conduct and financing of over 150 day schools and 55 residential schools in these four provinces. The physical equipment at some of these institutions is below standard, and, for a few years at least, the Appropriation for Indian Education for Ontario and the Prairie Provinces will be required entirely for replacements. I am, therefore, not hopeful that funds will be available for the establishment of new educational centres where pagan Indians are to be found. It may be necessary to open one or two new residential schools in British Columbia during the next ten years, but the Indian fields in that province have been debated and largely divided by the churches interested in the work. Only 2% per cent. of the Indian population of British Columbia is known to be of aboriginal belief.\n\nIt may be necessary to erect a residential school for the Indian children of the Maritime Provinces. There are, however, no pagan Indians in these three provinces.\n\nI will give careful consideration and any help possible, if you will make definite suggestions for activity in the immediate future; and later, when funds are available for the extension of our educational programme, you may rest assured that the Department will cooperate when suitable fields can be found.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. H. R. Horne,\n28 Walker Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 6, 1925.\n\nDear Mrs. Horne:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo and I note with gratification that the Women's Missionary Society of the Continuing Presbyterian Church is interested in new fields for the evangelizing and education of our Indians. There are many pagan Indians in Canada, but they are largely nomads of northern localities or are in zones where churches are already active. I am directing to you, under separate cover, our last Annual Report, and on page 28, et seq., will be found a census of our wards showing religious denominations. If, after a study of groups shown as aboriginal in belief, you are interested in any reserve or locality, you might write to me and I will recapitulate the history of church efforts, if any, and describe local conditions.\n\nAs you are well aware, the Department, in cooperation with various missionary societies, has built up a system of day and residential schools for the education of Indian children. It is the intention of the Government to continue this policy of cooperation, and we are cordial to new interests and new offers. At the present time, the Department is providing new buildings and better equipment at schools already established. The completion of this work is considered of first importance. We have also long standing applications for new establishments and the possibility of meeting the needs of the situation is governed by the action of Parliament in providing appropriations and thus implementing the general policy.\n\nWhen your Provisional Board has had an opportunity of discussing the question, I shall be very pleased to receive further communications from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

There is, of course, during the cold weather an officer on the job quite early in the morning for the purpose of replenishing fires and heating the building for the day's activity. If you feel that there should be a patrol of all parts of our buildings during the night, I will prepare the necessary circular.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nGENERAL SECRETARY\nREV.

Ferrier, Esq., M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nFor some time past our Society has been able to secure at a very moderate charge as a uniform for the older boys in the Schools under our control, the uniforms specially made for the Naval Cadets. As this supply is now exhausted, and no others being made, I have been requested by our Society to ascertain if your Department would consider it advisable to adopt a special uniform for the boys in all the Indian Residential Schools in the Dominion, arrange with a firm of wholesale manufacturers to keep a liberal supply of various sizes in stock, and sell the same to the various schools at a minimum of cost.\n\nOur Commission have given much thought to this matter, and are of the opinion that the arrangement suggested would prove beneficial in many ways; but they feel that they can go no further at present than to place the matter before you, and ask you to kindly give the same your careful consideration.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[T. B. R. Westgate]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M. S. C. C.\n\nTRW/JF.\nOttawa, August 10, 1925.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to a uniform for boys at all Indian residential schools. In reply I have to state that the determining of the source of supply for children's clothing is a matter which rests with the respective managements. If this Department can assist in any scheme to improve the type of clothing supplied or to effect a saving for the churches, we shall be glad to do so. However, I wish to point out that there is much to be said for and against a uniform for boys at Indian residential schools, and I doubt if we could secure the cooperation of all our institutions. There is a measure of centralized control on the part of the various churches engaged in the work, but this control of Indian residential school activity in the case of other churches is not as centralized as in the Church of England.\n\nIt is possible that the requirements of the schools administered by your Society are sufficient to interest clothing manufacturers, and you might make satisfactory arrangements without cooperation in this particular with the other churches.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nREGINA, SASK.\nAugust 7, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 10, and to thank you for the information submitted with reference to the Indian Schools located in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nFor your information I may say that special grants have been paid to the following Indian Schools:\n\nLac la Ronge\nOnion Lake R.C.\nOnion Lake C.E.\n\non account of children attending these schools who are not wards of the Federal Government.\n\nIf you desire definite information as to the amount of the grants paid, this will be furnished you upon request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 13, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, informing me that the Provincial Department of Education pays grants on account of children who are not wards of the Federal Government at the Lac la Ronge, Onion Lake R. C. and Onion Lake C. of E. Indian Residential Schools. I should be grateful if you would let me have a list showing the names of the pupils for whom you are paying grant at each of these schools. It will be satisfactory if you give me the names for the last academic year only and the amount of your grant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nI must say that the impression I have is that the officers of the Department are very often placed in most awkward positions through the Department not upholding them when they are in the right. The Department too often rely entirely on the information they get from one side, even going so far as to instruct the carrying out of repairs and alterations that are unnecessary, and when your officers in the field point this out they are brought into conflict with the church authorities, which is not at all satisfactory.\n\nAccording to the Inspector, he is of the opinion that a lot of this work that we are called upon to do, if not all of it, could be done by the school authorities. Instead of that, it would seem that they will not move a foot in this direction, but call upon the Department for everything. This is such a contrast to Portage la Prairie, where they appreciate any little assistance that the Government give them, and where it is possible for them to get the work done themselves they do so. This unsatisfactory situation has sprung up within the last three years, and while my understanding is that the schools are to do as much as they can to keep their buildings in repair, the authorities at this particular school are certainly not under that impression.\n\nIt is unpleasant for me to write a letter of this kind, but I see matters getting worse all the time and our Inspectors being placed in a position which they should not be placed in. I am prepared at any time to show the Department where its weaknesses are in the management of Indian schools.\nOttawa, September 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to principals of Indian residential schools absenting themselves from duty without permission from the Department. It is the practice of principals to acquaint the local Indian office and church authorities to inform the Department if a principal is to be away from his school for more than a few days during the academic year. There have been no complaints of late from any of our officers in Canada, except yourself, in this connection and it may, therefore, be considered that the present arrangements are satisfactory in the main.\n\nIt must be remembered that principals of Indian residential schools are employees of the various churches more than of this Department and more discretion and tact must be exercised in the prescription of rules and regulations than if they were on the staff of the Department.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to ask principals to acquaint us concerning absences during the holiday months of July and August. At this season, principals quite properly feel themselves more or less free from their more onerous duties; and as all responsible gentlemen, I feel it can safely be left with them to make satisfactory arrangements for the management of the schools during the vacation weeks.\n\nIf your office has in hand during the summer any activity which requires the presence of the principal of a school, it would be well for you to acquaint him with your plans and to ask that you be notified as to who will act as principal when he is not on duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S LETTER, No. 100-11,\ndated September 20, 1925,\n\nOriginal on 109-11-1.\n\nThe more important phase of the matter, however, has not been dealt with. The real trouble arises when principals of the residential schools are away at a time when it is important that they should be at home. Cases have occurred lately in which an Inspector of this Department has arrived at an institution of this kind expecting to transact important business, only to find that the principal is away. It is not necessary for me to point out that our inspectors are much too busy to make long, expensive trips, only to be handicapped in this way when they arrive.\n\nI do not think the Church Authorities under whose auspices these schools are operated would have the slightest objection to their appointees being required to arrange with the Department when they desire to be away. It is not my wish to approach the matter in an arbitrary or domineering spirit - I merely wish to secure their cooperation with a view to greater harmony and efficiency. The point I wish to make particularly clear is that a great deal of valuable time has been wasted and work has been delayed on account of my not knowing that this, that, or the other man was not on duty at a time when his presence was necessary. This can be avoided by the Department requiring that leave of absence be arranged for through this office and I trust this will be done.\nRegina, August 24, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIac la Ronge School\nRe: Onion Lake R.C. School\nOnion Lake C. of E. School.\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 13th and to state in reply that the grants paid by the Government to the above schools are not paid on account of individual children but as assistance to the schools to provide tuition. In the case of the schools at Onion Lake the grant payable is $100 per calendar year. Iac la Ronge school received during 1924 the sum of $1,000, which sum covered the teacher's salary of $100 per month for ten school months. A similar sum has been authorised for the calendar year 1925.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.S. Bace,\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, Sept. 18, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to grants paid by your Department to Indian residential schools at Lac la Ronge and Onion Lake.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant No. 108-1-1, with reference to principals of Indian Residential schools absenting themselves from duty without making it known to the Department. Before receiving your letter I had, on the 12th instant, written rather fully on this subject, but there are a few points that require further attention.\n\nYou state that it is the practice of principals to acquaint the local Indian Offices and of Church authorities to inform the Department if a principal is to be away from his school for more than a few days. This may be a rule, but it certainly has not been put into practice, but even if it were, it would not solve the existing problem, viz., of keeping this office informed as to absences. It is from here that our Inspectors go out and supervise works of various kinds, and it would be only reasonable and businesslike to expect the Principals to obtain leave through this office, or at least notify me when they intend to be absent, as the Department apparently does not wish to ask them to obtain leave through this office, as our own officials are required to do.\n\nYou state that \"the Department is not prepared to ask principals to acquaint us concerning absences during the holiday months of July and August\", and I am at a loss to understand your attitude in this regard. These are two of the busiest months in the year for our work and all outside activities, and I do not think it would be asking anything out of the way to have the principals advise this office if they are going to be absent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI trust the Department will look at this matter from my point of view and issue the necessary instructions to the Principals of the Residential schools, as this will be in the best interests of the work that is being carried on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 18th instant, with further reference to principals of Indian residential schools being absent from duty. I note that you are chiefly concerned with the holiday months, when building operations are being undertaken by your office. It will be quite in order and, of course, entirely satisfactory to the Department if, in May or June of each year, you write to principals of Indian residential schools where building activity is to take place, asking each to advise your office what dates he will be absent from the school and to intimate who will act in his stead.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,-\n\nReferring to your letter No. 160-1 of Sept. 23rd regarding absences of School Principals, I would say that I do not think the Department has given very fair consideration to my requests in this matter.\n\nWhere building activities are being carried on, I can, as you suggest, write to the Principals in May or June for information as to when they expect to be absent. But what about visits of Inspectors to schools where no buildings operations are being carried on, or visits made during the other months? What objection is there to asking the Principals of all these Boarding schools to notify me when they are going to be absent? It seems to me that would be a much simpler and more satisfactory method than the one you suggest. However, as it is evident that the Department does not wish to co-operate with me in this matter, I shall have to do the best I can without this assistance in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Charles Stewart.\n\nIn my remarks this morning I stated that the appropriation for Indian Education in the United States was between $4,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00; I find, however, from figures received here today, that the estimate for the next fiscal year amounts to $6,099,525.00.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n### Average Attendance at Presbyterian Indian Residential Schools\n\n| School          | Year   | Count |\n|-----------------|--------|-------|\n| Cecilia Jeffray | Apr '02|       |\n| Portage         | Apr '91|       |\n| Birtle          | Oct '88|       |\n| Round Take      | Dec '87|       |\n| File Hills      | Mar '89|       |\n| Alberni         | Sept '99|      |\n| Regina          | Nov '91|       |\n\n| Year   | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| 87-88  |       |\n| 88-89  |       |\n| 89-90  |       |\n| 90-91  |       |\n| 91-92  |       |\n| 92-93  |       |\n| 93-94  |       |\n| 94-95  |       |\n| 95-96  |       |\n| 96-97  |       |\n| 97-98  |       |\n| 98-99  |       |\n| 99-00  |       |\n| 00-01  |       |\n| 01-02  |       |\n| 02-03  |       |\n| 03-04  |       |\n| 04-05  |       |\n| 05-06  |       |\n| 06-07  |       |\n| 07-08  |       |\n| 08-09  |       |\n| 09-10  |       |\n| 10-11  |       |\n| 11-12  |       |\n| 12-13  |       |\n| 13-14  |       |\n| 14-15  |       |\n| 15-16  |       |\n| 16-17  |       |\n| 17-18  |       |\n| 18-19  |       |\n| No. of pupils for whom Grant provided | Amount of Per Capita Grants | Average per pupil |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| 1913-14                              | $454,655.00                | $114.09          |\n| 1926-27                              | $978,265.00                | $157.30          |\n\nNumber of pupils provided for increased by 56%\n\nAggregate Amount of Per Capita Grants increased by 115%\n\nAverage Amount per pupil increased by 37.86%\n\nIn addition, the management at residential schools has received more generous treatment in the matter of repairs and replacements as well as in capital expense. This is particularly true at church-owned institutions. On the other hand, a larger percentage of pupils today are in the so-called industrial school class.\n\nThe average total appropriation for Indian Education of the last four years is an increase of 104.55% over the total appropriation of 1913-14.\nFebruary 8, 1926.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn January 19th, the Honourable the Superintendent General received a delegation from the churches interested in Indian educational work. His Lordship Bishop Williams (Huron) and Canon Gould represented the Church of England; Father Guy, the Roman Catholic and Dr. Edmison and Rev. Mr. Watts, the Presbyterian Branch of the United Church. The different speakers pointed out that the increase in the per capita grants since 1913 was not commensurate with the increase in wholesale prices and wages. Canon Gould pointed out that the Church of England average per capita grant in 1913 was $122 and for this year, $162. He pointed out that his Church and, he believed, the others were encountering huge deficits.\n\nFather Guy thanked the Minister for assuming the major portion of the capital expense and seconded the requests of the others for a larger per capita grant. He also urged reclassification and that the necessary funds be placed in the Supplementary Estimates and submitted to the present session. Father Guy made a special plea that all work agreed upon by the Department and the Churches be actually carried out and that no local officer be given the power to veto these decisions.\n\nDr. Edmison drew attention to the fact that the Presbyterian Church were expending approximately $32,000 per annum for seven small schools and that a reclassification, which would mean an increase in per capita grant for the small institutions, should be considered.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Stewart promised that he would give earnest consideration to the representations of the delegation.\nOttawa, August 27, 1926.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, and, with reference to the first paragraph, I wish to explain that it is the practice of the various church authorities to seek the approval of the Department before appointing, even temporarily, principals to Indian residential schools. I should be grateful if your office would continue this procedure, so that the various Branches of our Department and our field officers will always know who is the responsible head of each institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, (5) Ont.\nSir:\n\nAdverting to Department letter 100-1-1 of the 4th of August, I beg to again bring to the attention of the Department the fact that School Principals are frequently found to be away when I visit their Institutions and a great deal of my time could be saved if I could be advised by the Principals of the Schools of the time at which they purpose taking their annual vacations.\n\nI have recently visited File Hills and found the Principal absent and now having taken up the question of the purchase of three cows for the Elkhorn School, I find that the Principal is away and unable to attend to the matter. A great deal of confusion and inconvenience could be avoided if the Department would be good enough to circularize the Principals of the Schools, instructing them to advise me of the dates when they will be absent from the Institutions in their care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, August 31, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11 of the 14th instant, with reference to annual vacations for principals of Indian residential schools. As you are aware, there has been correspondence in this connection in the past; and I believe the best arrangement is for you to write in the spring of the year to principals of Indian residential schools where building activity is to take place, asking each to advise your office what dates he will be absent and to indicate who will act in his stead.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 160-1 of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the matter of Principals leaving their schools for a period of time without notifying this office. I note that you think the Principals of schools where building activities are going on should be asked to advise this office of the dates they will be absent, and to indicate who will act in their stead.\n\nYour letter is a disappointment to me, and shows clearly that there is a tendency on the part of the Department not to give me any assistance in trying to make these schools efficient. This is in line with your argument about straw mattresses which you eventually had to abandon, not from any advice which you received from me, but from another source. My office not being advised when a Principal leaves his school for a period of time, is, in my opinion, very poor business. The matter ends here so far as I am concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 28, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nMy attention has been drawn to your letter of the 21st instant addressed to the Secretary, in further reference to the notification by Principals of Residential Schools of absence on leave from official duties.\n\nThe opening sentence in the last paragraph of your letter is characteristic, but has no foundation in fact, and is therefore negligible, but nevertheless discourteous, as is too often the case in your correspondence.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI find in checking up the 1927-28 estimates that the per capita grants allowed for our residential schools vary in amounts and in some of the estimates, no amount is stated. I would be glad if the Department would provide me with a list of the residential schools in the three prairie provinces showing the per capita grant which is being paid in each instance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 14, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-7B of the 7th instant, with reference to the amount of per capita grant allowed in the case of each of the residential schools in the Prairie Provinces. This information is not necessary for the agency estimates each year, as the Department prepares its final estimates in this connection from its own files. If you wish a list showing the amount of the grants for your own information, I shall be glad to have it prepared and directed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 160-1, dated the 14th inst., I shall be glad if you will kindly furnish me with a list showing the amount of the grants to the various residential schools in the Prairie Provinces.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| School                  | Pupilage | Per Capita |\n|-------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Blood                   | 120      | 140        |\n| Blue Quills             | 60       | 165        |\n| Crowfoot                | 75       | 140        |\n| Edmonton                | 125      | 170        |\n| Ermineskins             | 110      | 165        |\n| Holy Angels             | 40       | 165        |\n| Morley                  | 60       | 140        |\n| Old Sun's               | 80       | 140        |\n| Peigan R.C.             | 40       | 140        |\n| Peigan C.E.             | 35       | 140        |\n| Sturgeon Lake           | 60       | 165        |\n| St. Albert              | 100      | 165        |\n| St. Bernard's           | 40       | 165        |\n| St. Bruno's             | 90 (100 from Jan.1, 1927) | 165 |\n| St. Paul's              | 120      | 165        |\n| Wabasca C.E.            | 25       | 165        |\n| Wabasca R.C.            | 30       | 165        |\n| Whitefish Lake          | 40       | 165        |\n| Lesser Slave Lake       |          |            |\n| Vermilion               | 30       | 165        |\n### MANITOBA\n\n| School          | Pupilage | Per Capita |\n|-----------------|----------|------------|\n| Birtle          | 95       | $165       |\n| Brandon         | 125      | 170        |\n| Cross Lake      | 110      | 165        |\n| Elkhorn         | 120      | 170        |\n| Fort Alexander  | 90       | 140        |\n| MacKay          | 80       | 140        |\n| Norway House    | 105      | 165        |\n| Pine Creek      | 81       | 140        |\n| Portage la Prairie | 90     | 140        |\n| Sandy Bay       | 70       | 140        |\n\n---\n\n### SASKATCHEWAN\n\n| School               | Pupilage | Per Capita |\n|----------------------|----------|------------|\n| Beauval              | 65       | $165       |\n| Couessess            | 80       | 140        |\n| Duck Lake            | 150      | 170        |\n| File Hills           | 90       | 140        |\n| Gordon's             | 100      | 140        |\n| Lac la Ronge         | 100      | 165        |\n| Muscowequan          | 60       | 140        |\n| Onion Lake R.C.      | 55       | 140        |\n| Onion Lake C.E.      | 80       | 140        |\n| Qu'Appelle           | 235      | 170        |\n| Round Lake           | 75       | 140        |\n| Thunderchild         | 110      | 165        |\nOttawa, October 23, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-7B of the 18th instant, and in reply, I am enclosing a list of the Indian Residential Schools in the Prairie Provinces showing the pupilage and per capita grant as on the 30th ultimo. You will understand that it is necessary to make increases in the pupilage from time to time, when accommodation is available. I may say that the Department is favourably considering a new scale of per capita grants in the case of the smaller institutions and those that are more remote from markets. I am hopeful that such increases which will average $10 per capita can be paid in the near future.\n\nThe Department feels that the small schools are discriminated against in the old classification. It is possible that certain schools are in an unsound financial position, due to geographical peculiarities. If you know of any outstanding cases where quite favourable consideration should be shown in the event of adjustment, please let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nReferring to your memorandum hereunder, I wish to suggest that the following be substituted for the earlier instructions to agents concerning education:\n\nEDUCATION.\n\n27. Educational advantages are provided for Indian children in day and residential schools. The annual report of the Department shows the number and locality of these institutions by agencies. Agents should give careful attention to the administration of the schools and should bend every energy to increasing their efficiency. Department representatives should familiarise themselves with Sections 9 to 11 of the Indian Act, which relate to the education of Indian children.\n\n28. Agents should report monthly on the work of each day school, using the form provided for the purpose. There will be found on the cover of classroom registers detailed instructions to teachers concerning the routine of the day school. The attention of agents is also drawn to the printed matter on the quarterly return form of this type of school. Agents should give special consideration to the matter of regular attendance of pupils. Truancy and lack of interest has, in the past, seriously militated against the success of day schools on Indian reserves.\n\n29. Residential schools should be visited as often as is necessary in the conduct of Department business. Agents are asked to make a careful study of the conditions at each institution and to report from time to time concerning the activity generally. Please read the printed instructions on the quarterly return form for residential schools. Your special attention is drawn to circular of November 9, 1914, concerning recruiting pupils for the residential schools. This activity and the return of delinquents is an important feature of the duties of Indian agents. Circulars dated November 9, 1922, and February 23, 1925, have reference to applicants for admission to Indian residential schools and agents are asked to make a careful study of these writings. Circular dated May 20, 1926, concerning the annual leave is also drawn to the attention of agents.\n\n30. The Department assists deserving ex-pupils of Indian schools whenever there is assurance that such assistance will be of permanent value. Grants are given for more advanced academic or vocational training and material assistance is granted to young couples who are establishing a home. Whenever an agent believes that a tuition grant or assistance should be allowed, he should correspond with the Department, giving full details. Agents, by advice and supervision, should assist young Indians to become economically independent.\n\n31. The Department urges its field officers to make suggestions for improving any phase of the educational programme.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant No. 160-1, enclosing a list of the Indian Residential Schools in the Prairie Provinces showing the pupilage and per capita grant as on the 30th ultimo.\n\nYou ask me if I know of any outstanding cases where quite favourable consideration should be shown in the event of adjustment of the grant, and in reply I may say that I am of the opinion that all schools situated at long distances from the railway, and where the surrounding country is not adaptable for stockraising and farming, should receive a per capita grant equal to that given to schools which are giving the same training in the more fortunately situated districts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAs I am frequently asked to authorize or recommend payment of minor repairs to plant and equipment at the residential schools I shall be glad to receive a ruling from the Department as to whether it is expected that these repairs will be paid for from the grant or will be paid by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11A of the 3rd instant, with reference to accounts for repairs and equipment at Indian residential schools. In the main, the Department tries to care for permanent improvements when funds can be found for the purpose and the per capita grant paid to the management is for current expenses. The Department gives favourable consideration to accounts for all unavoidable repairs to mechanical plant, but minor repairs to buildings and the replacement of equipment should be met from per capita or other earnings. It is understood, of course, that school principals or Department representatives should secure authority before incurring expenditure which the institution management is not prepared to meet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 26, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 100-11A of the 3rd instant, with reference to minor repairs at residential schools. In the first place, as you are aware no repairs should be authorized by you without the approval of the Department. If a Principal has incurred any expenditure without authority, the accounts may be sent to headquarters with your report, when the question of payment will be given careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter No. 160-1 of the 26th ultimo, but beg to advise you that the information that I desire to seek was not given therein and that is whether minor repairs at residential schools are proper charges against the Department or whether the school authorities should bear the cost from their grants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 100-11A of the first instant, with reference to minor repairs at residential schools. In the main, the Department tries to care for permanent improvements when funds can be found for the purpose and the per capita grant paid to the management is for minor repairs, the replacement of equipment and other current expenses.

Neary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI thank you for your initial reply to my correspondence regarding the proposed site for the Mounted Police barracks on Walpole Island.\n\nSo far, I have had no further approach from any of your officials regarding this movement on the part of the Mounted Police, yet still I am receiving disquieting reports from the Island itself. Only this week my information was to the effect that the police authorities are still planning to build the barracks on Church property, south of our Rectory and slightly beyond the site for the new Medical Centre, which was arranged satisfactorily between us some months ago.\n\nLet me once again make quite clear our position in regard to this land, which has been held by the Church of England for over 136 years. My information is that some members of your Indian Department are now claiming this land as public property. I am sure that you are not a party to this claim, and nothing in the relationship between ourselves and your department through the years that are past, will either substantiate this claim on the part of your subordinates or indicate that in any way your department wishes to act in this arbitrary fashion.\n\nLet me emphasize that in the event of the Mounted Police taking the action that is now contemplated, we shall immediately seek redress through representation to the senior Members of the Government or in the Courts of the land. I cannot believe for a minute that you would tolerate this treatment of us, and I am confident that a word from you will set this matter in its proper light for those who are now disturbing us.\n\nWith grateful thanks for your many past kindnesses,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGNL'f.\n\nBishop of Huron.\nColonel Neary -\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have an hour or so together on the following topics arising from my recent tour of the west - perhaps Thursday at 9 am if convenient to you - if inconvenient could you please 'phone me.\n\nH.G.C.\n\nAlert Bay -\n\nElectric wiring - Principal reports that man to whom Mr. Todd has allowed to estimate on job is unreliable and his work not always satisfactory.\n\nFlooring - From lack of paint or varnish over the years the floors rough and splintering - need sanding.\n\nMain Stack - in need of cleaning - school not equipment for this job.\n\nOld Classroom Block - If torn down - school will need warehouse. Some lumber from this building would be useful for a greenhouse and general repairs.\n\nStoves - second hand when installed - require I.D. permission to convert to oil.\n\nMattresses - At least 24 ought to be replaced annually until all replaced - mattresses 20 years old - normal wear.\n\nBedsteads - At least 24 bedsteads ought to be replaced annually - 20 years old and show normal wear and tear.\n\nFurnaces - Could serious consideration be given to converting to oil when overhauled this coming summer - cordwood impossible to procure - slabs no good and supply uncertain - coal far too expensive - oil source in Alert Bay village.\n\nStaff room furniture - after 20 years much needs replacing.\n\nSt. Paul's, Blood Reserve\n\nWindow and door frames - shrunk away from brick and school very drafty - need caulking.\n\nInterior - Much painting been done by school staff - more paint needed - school will put it on.\n\nStaff Room Furniture - some quite old and needs replacing.\n\nBoilers - 25 years old - unable to keep school warm. I had to purchase an oil heater in Lethbridge to heat residence - temperature in dining room 40\u00b0F. Would appreciate an engineer such as Mr. Hargreaves giving the plant a look over.\n\nGarage & Pump House - this structure just a shell - I understand authorization granted to have it insulated and heated.\nElectric wiring - has been condemned by inspectors very dangerous especially in laundry and boiler room.\n\nI.D. Jobs - though work done has been appreciated evidence on every hand that jobs not completed - classroom block unpainted - walk in refrigerator - no dressing on wood, etc.\n\nRoad clearance - No equipment to doze out 7 mile section to Cardston - at time of visit I.D. bulldozer under large snow drift. Blocked road dangerous re fire and sickness.\n\nPupilage - Still deplorably low - Mr. Regan admits that Indians will not respond - not fair that our Principal has to go along with R.C.M.P. when truants visited. R.C.M.P. wont visit without Principal or I.D. official.\n\nBuilding - with increased and increasing pupilage more classroom space and playrooms needed - see Principal's proposal to Mr. Pugh.\n\nMoose Factory General survey of conditions.\n\nGordon's General Survey of conditions.\nFebruary 28, 1950.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDep., Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe: Residential School teachers' salaries\n\nYou are acquainted, I am sure, with the difficulty the Administration is experiencing in hiring competent and qualified classroom teachers. The difficulty arises primarily from our inability to meet the salaries paid teachers in community and Indian Day schools. Another difficulty is that we cannot afford a pension or superannuation scheme for our workers.\n\nRecently I had the pleasure of spending a day at the Mohawk Institute where the Indian Affairs Branch is responsible for payment of teachers' salaries. The Principal reported that the scheme was working out very well indeed and was a vast improvement over the old method whereby the teachers were paid from the per capita grant receipts.\n\nI have discussed our problem with Colonel Neary and he has suggested I take it up with your office. It would be appreciated if we could have a discussion of this whole matter and its side issues, with a view to the possibility of instituting the same practice in I.A.S.A. schools, at a relatively early date. At your convenience a telephone call would suffice to set a time and date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nMarch 6, 1950\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \n(Supt. Indian Education)  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe February \"Prices & Price Indexes, February 1950\" published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics shows that the cost of living is by no means becoming lower. A study of the following information will show, in turn, how prices in the commodities affecting the operation of Residential Schools have increased since the current per capita rate was established as of April first 1948.\n\n| Date          | Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | Home furnishings |\n|---------------|----------|------|--------------|----------|-----------------|\n| 1st April 1948 | 151.6    | 186.8| 121.3        | 172.9    | 161.9           |\n| 1st April 1949 | 159.3    | 198.5| 131.0        | 183.2    | 168.0           |\n| 1 February 1950 | 161.6    | 201.3| 135.9        | 183.0    | 166.4           |\n\nPoint increase  \n1 April '48 to 1 Feb. '50  \n10.0 14.5 14.6 10.1 4.5\n\nPercentage increase  \n1 April '48 to 1 Feb. '50  \n6.6 7.8 12.0 5.8 2.8\n\nIndications are that with the recently authorized increase in freight rates commodity prices will continue to rise.\n\nIn consideration of the above and also of the considerable sum expended annually by our Church towards maintaining these schools it would be appreciated if early consideration could be given to an increase in the per capita rates or the paying of teacher's salaries from a government source as outlined in my letter to Director Mackay of February 28th, 1950.\n\np.t.o.\nColonel Neary\n\nMarch 6, 1950.\n\nIt might be added that the administration is now faced with the problem of trying to increase salaries paid its workers in answer to ever increasing demands. However, we cannot afford to grant staff increases further from Church funds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC:KMA Superintendent\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nPlease find hereunder a self-explanatory letter from Canon Cook concerning Per Capita Grants.\n\nYou will note that he again mentions the payment of teachers' salaries in lieu of an increased Per Capita Grant payment.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nIncreased per capita rates for Indian Residential Schools\n\nYou will recall our recent discussion concerning the period covered by the last increase in per capita rates granted to Residential Schools.\n\nI am sending you herewith the two files concerned. You will note (flag one) a memorandum sent to the Deputy Minister on November 12, 1948, concerning this increase and indicating that a sum of $112,000.00 would be required. No action was taken as a result of this request. Another letter was sent to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and a reply was received from them on December 14, 1948 (flag 2).\n\nAnother memorandum was sent to the Deputy Minister on February 12, 1949 (flag 3). No decision was made and we again wrote to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics bringing the revised figure up to March 8, 1949.\n\nOn March 19, a further memorandum was sent to Dr. Keenleyside (flag 4) and finally a decision was reached to include a sum in the 1949/50 Supplementary Estimates.\n\nYou will recall that we then prepared a new statement of proposed grants and that this matter was discussed with Mr. Jackson in May.\n\nApproval was given by the Minister for the new rates and the Churches were informed in August, 1949.\n\nWhat I believe Canon Cook to be requesting is an increase covering the change in the cost-of-living index between January 1949 and February 1950.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Per Capita Grants\n\nOn 6th March, 1950, I wrote you on the above subject in relation to the data tabulated in my letter on the advance in Cost-of-Living Indexes from 1st April, 1948 (the date from which our present scale of Per Capita Grants was effective) to 1st February, 1950.\n\nToday we received the official Price Movement Bulletin, dated 4th April, 1950, of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics giving the Dominion Cost-of-Living Indexes as at 1st March, 1950. An examination of these figures show material advances since 1st February, 1950, in the Combined Index (2.1 points) and in the items that represent a great part of our normal school expenditure, viz Food (2.7 points) and Fuel & Light (.4 points). It is also noted that this bulletin states that the Combined Index of 163.7 on 1st March, 1950, \"marked a new post-war peak, exceeding the previous high point of 162.8 for August 1, 1949\".\n\nIt will be seen that from 1st April, 1948, to 1st March, 1950, cost-of-living indexes have increased as follows:\n\n(a) Combined Index from 151.6 to 163.7, a point increase of 12.1 and a percentage increase of 8.\n\n(b) Food Index From 186.8 to 204.0, a point increase of 17.2 and a percentage increase of 9.2.\n\n(c) Fuel & Light Index from 121.3 to 136.3, a point increase of 15.0 and a percentage increase of 12.4.\n\nI am certain that you will agree that the above data emphasizes the urgency of very early consideration of the proposals contained in the penultimate paragraph of my letter of 6th March, 1950.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nColonel Neary:\n\nReferring to our conversation this morning, you may like to see this before you dictate the letter of which you spoke.\n\n5 Apr 50.

This matter has recently been discussed with the Director and I have received from him the following instructions:\n\n(a) That in the Residential School Principal's Annual Report we will obtain from each school a statement of the qualifications of each teacher.\n\n(b) That the Dominion Bureau of Statistics be approached to revise the Index figure used to denote changes in the cost of operation of Indian residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nResidential Schools Operated by\nthe M.S.C.C.\n\nPlease find attached the audit report of the residential schools operated by the Indian School Administration.\n\nPlease note the following major points:\n\n(a) A deficit for the year of $39,657.03\n(b) A per capita cost of $358.47 for 1949 compared with a per capita cost of $313.45 in 1948. This represents a net increase of $45.02 per pupil\n(c) The main increases in this $45.02 per capita increase are caused by:\n   Salaries $20.93     Food $17.59\n   Fuel, light and water $4.99\n\nI would appreciate an opportunity of discussing this audit report with you at a convenient time.\n\nBernard F.

Principals' Conference\n\nIt is proposed to call together at least ten of the Administration's Residential School Principals for a conference at Old Sun School, Gleichen on the first three days of August 1950. These principals will be from schools caring for about 1200 children.\n\nOn the agenda opportunity will be made for discussions on I.S.A. and Indian Affairs Branch relations and also on matters pertaining to classroom work. It would be most beneficial to our Principals and perhaps also to Indian Affairs if Colonel Neary could be present for, let us say, a day's sessions at the Conference.\n\nCould this request please have your consideration?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nReverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the M.S.C.C.,\nBank Street Chambers,\n102 Bank Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 17th of April in which you refer to the forthcoming conference at Old Sun School, Gleichen, August 1-3 of this year.\n\nThe suggestion made that Colonel Neary attend the conference has been considered but, inasmuch as Mr. G.A.F. Clark, of the Education Division, will be in Alberta at the time, it is intended to have him attend as it will be difficult for Colonel Neary, because of other demands on his time, to do so. I trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nDMM/BM\n\nNote: Thank you.

The increases from 1st April, 1948 (the date from which our present Per Capita rates were effective) to 1st April, 1950, are as follows:\n\n| Cost of Living Indexes | Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | Home Furnishings & Services |\n|------------------------|----------|------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| 1st April, 1948        | 151.6    | 186.8| 121.3        | 172.6    | 161.9                      |\n| 1st April, 1950        | 164.0    | 204.5| 138.0        | 181.2    | 166.4                      |\n\nPoint increase\n1st April, 1948 - 1st April, 1950 12.4 17.7 16.7 8.3 4.5\n\nPercentage increase\n1st April, 1948 - 1st April, 1950 8.2 9.5 13.8 4.8 2.8\n\nIt is clear from the above that rates established as at 1st April, 1948, are now hopelessly inadequate for operation of Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 10, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nPer Capita Grants - M. S. C. C.\n\nPlease find hereunder a self-explanatory letter received from Canon Cook today.\n\nI believe that Canon Dixon and Dr. Dorey intend to visit Ottawa in the near future for an interview with our Minister.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 20, 1950.\n\nReverend Canon H. G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPer Capita Grants\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nThe contents of your letter have been discussed with the Director and we are now obtaining from every Residential School Principal a statement of the qualifications of his teachers. It is hoped that this information will assist the Minister in deciding what action can best be taken with regard to changes in per capita grants.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nPer Capita Grants\n\nI must again emphasize the gross inadequacy of per capita grants established as from 1st April, 1948, for the operation of our Residential Schools as will be clearly seen from the cost-of-living indexes at 1st June 1950 released by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in their Price Movements Circular on 4th July, 1950.\n\nCost of Living Indexes\n\n| Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | House Furnishings & Services |\n|----------|------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 1st April, 1948 | 151.6 | 186.8 | 121.3 | 172.9 | 161.9 |\n| 1st June, 1950 | 165.4 | 209.0 | 137.1 | 180.7 | 166.9 |\n\nPoint Increase\n1st April, 1948 to 1st June, 1950 | 13.8 | 22.2 | 15.8 | 7.8 | 5.0 |\n\nPercentage Increase\n1st April, 1948 to 1st June, 1950 | 9.1 | 11.9 | 13.0 | 4.5 | 3.1 |\n\nAs you know, food costs constitute by far the biggest item in operation of Residential Schools and a rise of 11.9% in such costs makes it physically impossible to come anywhere near making ends meet on the present Per Capita rates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS\nTO THE SUPERINTENDENT\n\nPLEASE QUOTE FILE No. Est.51-52\n\nI.D.\n\nBANK STREET CHAMBERS\n102 BANK STREET\nOTTAWA\n\nJuly 12, 1950.\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Special Grants\n\nOn page M-48 of the \"Public Accounts of Canada 1949\" the amounts received as special grants for equipment and repairs to Church-owned schools are recorded.\n\nFor the six Church of England owned schools the total amount is $5,142.72 making an average of $857.12 per school.\n\nFor the nineteen Roman Catholic owned schools the total is $42,659.01 making an average of $2,245.21 per school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could be told why nearly three times the amount of that granted for Church of England owned Schools was expended on Roman Catholic owned schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n| NAME OF SCHOOL

It is felt that a fairer comparison is on the per capita basis. The authorized pupilage at the 19 Church-owned Roman Catholic Schools is 2135. The expenditure for the fiscal year 1948-49 was $42,659.01. This makes an average expenditure per pupil of $19.98.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at the 6 Church-owned Church of England Schools is 325. The expenditure was $5,142.70. This makes an average expenditure per pupil of $15.82.\n\nI might also point out that during the fiscal year 1948-49 (see page M-46) there was the following expenditure at the Church of England Schools:\n\nWabasca - $111,638.36\nCarcross - $12,057.65\n\n$123,696.01\nThere was no corresponding expenditure at any of the Roman Catholic Church-owned Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nCircular #24/50\n\nAugust 29, 1950\n\nCircular to All Principals:\n\nRe: Railway Strike\n\nPupils\n\nI have been in communication with Indian Affairs Branch concerning the grant of children delayed in entering or re-entering school as a result of the railway and steamboat strike.\n\nTheir ruling is that no loss in grant will be realized because of late entrance in such cases. However, they ask that under heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\" the actual number of days be recorded and in the \"Remarks\" column we the date of re-entrance plus the information that the pupil was late due to the strike. Note ought to be made also that the full 92 days are being claimed. On the last page under \"Aggregate number of days pupils in Residence\" record the actual figure total of \"Total number of days pupil in residence\" and underneath record the aggregate of days claimed and base your average attendance of pupils on the latter figure.\n\nExample - right three columns of form #1.A.403\n\n| Total days pupil | Total days pupil classroom | Remarks |\n|------------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| John Doe         | 87                        | R.R. strike entered 6/8/50 |\n|                  |                           | 92 days claim               |\n| Jean Doe         | 77                        | R.R. strike entered 15/8/50 |\n|                  |                           | 92 days claim               |\n| Total            | 164                       |                                   |\n\nAggregate number of Day Pupils in residence during Quarter 164\nAggregate number of days claimed 184\nAverage attendance during Quarter 2\n\nStaff\n\nAs we shall be getting full grant for late re-entering pupils and also as any delays on the part of staff are due to conditions beyond their control - staff will be paid as though they arrived back at the school at the time previously planned. New staff members will be paid from the time they originally ought to have arrived at the school.\n\nPlease inform your staff of this ruling.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry F. Cook\nSuperintendent\n\nColonel heavy. I think the above is how you suggested the report be made out.\nAugust 31, 1950.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nGrants to Church-owned Schools\n\nI have your letter 160-2 (El) of 29th August, 1950, and would invite your attention to the fact that the authorized pupilage of the 6 Anglican Schools in question during the fiscal year 1948-49 was 400, as shown hereunder.\n\n| School          | Pupilage |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| Aklavik         | 100      |\n| Carcross        | 60       |\n| Whitefish       | 30       |\n| Wabasca         | 35       |\n| Moose Factory   | 100      |\n| Fort George     | 75       |\n\n$5,142.70 divided by 400 gives an average expenditure per authorized pupil of only $12.87 compared to your figure of $19.98 for the Roman Catholic Schools. In other words, the average expenditure per Anglican authorized pupil was less than 65% of the average expenditure per Roman Catholic authorized pupil.\n\nAs regards the data given in the last two paragraphs of your letter I would point out that Carcross was originally a Government-owned School but because the Government could not, or would not, see its way clear to rebuilding it following its destruction by fire during the last war, the Church of England was obliged to expend considerable Church funds in order to provide buildings and keep a school in operation at this point; in the matter of Wabasca, it was not a question of the Government expending $111,638.36 on a Church-owned School but rather the provision of a Government-owned school to replace an old church-owned building that was no longer suitable for school purposes.\n\np.t.o.\nMajor Mackay  \nAugust 31, 1950\n\nI still feel that Church of England Residential Schools are not receiving a just proportion of this special grant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry T.

Cook, B.A., D.D.,\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the M.S.C.C.,\nBank Street Chambers,\n102 Bank Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 9th, in which you refer to the matter of the per capita grants, which was one of the items discussed by the Church of England delegation with the Honourable Mr. Harris on Monday last, the 6th instant.\n\nIn making the comment on the per capita grants to which you refer, I did not have in mind any particular school or church but was thinking of the problem as a whole from a departmental standpoint. The same standard of efficiency is not always found in schools operated by the same church despite the fact that they are being run under very similar circumstances; consequently, this fact is one that the department could hardly avoid taking into account in considering the whole question of per capita grants. The Minister will, no doubt, deal with this subject at greater length in his reply to the delegation's submission, dated November 7th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nDMM/BBM\nNovember 9, 1950.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Per Capita Grants\n\nOn Monday (4/11/50) when a delegation was so graciously received by Mr. Harris the matter of per capita grants was discussed. During the exchange of opinions on the subject you made mention that one item to be considered in an adjustment of grants was inefficiency in the operation of a school. I agree that it is an important item. However, during the last few years the administration has paid special attention to this factor in the operation of its many schools and to the best of my knowledge all of our schools are now operating as efficiently as circumstances at the school will allow.\n\nI feel it only fair to point out that the government owns many of the schools we operate and, as owners of the buildings, the government is responsible for many of the \"circumstances\" under which we are expected to operate. If equipment is outworn or staff and pupil accommodation inadequate the Church or no other organization can be expected to operate efficiently under such circumstances.\n\nI would respectfully point out also that it is hardly fair to compare the operational expense of a Church of England School with that of a Roman School. The latter denomination have many non-paid workers on their staffs (some of whom draw government salaries in the name of the school) which practice is foreign to Church of England methods of operation. Such comparison therefore ought not to enter into any consideration of the re-adjustment of grants to Church of England residential schools.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let me know of any school or schools under this Administration in which you consider the operation to be inefficient. I can assure you that once given the information the matter will be examined thoroughly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nNovember 14, 1950.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Immigration & Citizenship  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nMay this serve to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your letter of November 13th 1950.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of November 8th enclosing copy of a letter received by the Minister from the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, I submit the following comments:\n\n1. Per Capita Grants\n\nVery careful consideration is being given to the representations received regarding an increase in these grants. However, a definite decision in the matter has not yet been reached.\n\n2. Purchase of Buildings\n\n(a) Moose Fort - Funds are available in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of this building, but we are still awaiting arrangements for obtaining proper title to the land on which the school is located.\n\n(b) Fort George - A valuation of this building was obtained, but funds for its purchase are not available in the current year's appropriation.\n\n(c) Wabasca - During the fiscal years 1948-49 and 1949-50, the Department expended an amount of slightly over $200,000.00 in the erection of a dormitory block. This building is now in use. At the present time we are giving consideration to purchasing one or two of the buildings still owned by the M.S.C.C., but we have not finally decided which buildings we require.\n(d) Whitefish Lake - With the concurrence of the M.S.C.C., the Whitefish Lake School ceased to operate as a residential school effective June 30th, 1950. From September 1st, 1950, we are operating a two-room day school in the former residential school classrooms and we are also using the log building next to it for the teachers' living quarters. A small rental is being allowed for the use of these buildings, and the teachers' salaries are being paid by the Department.\n\n(e) Aklavik - The situation at this point was reviewed by Departmental officials, and it was decided that it was not advisable for the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase this building. However, the Northwest Territories Branch of the Department of Resources and Development might be interested in purchasing it, and further negotiations regarding Aklavik should be directed to that Branch.\n\n3. New Residential School Accommodation:\n\n(a) Carcross - It is our intention to erect a new residential school to replace the present building. However, before proceeding with construction we are awaiting definite assurance that the area in the vicinity of Carcross will not be inundated as a result of possible commercial projects.\n\n(b) With reference to the other five areas in which the M.S.C.C. considers residential school accommodation is lacking, it is noted that they will make further representations later.\n\nDirector.\nC & E Schools Purchase\n\nWatson 769-5 (closed file)\n\n16 June 1949 - Gordonham's report on Bidges media $10,482.64\n\nWhitefish Lake\n\n769-1 (open file)\n769-5 open file\n\n15 March 50\n\nNothing\n\nM.S.C.C.\n\n\"how do matters stand?\"\n\nE to D.I.A.\n\n\"not to buy\"\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nC.E.

W. E. Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nWe were very glad of the opportunity of discussing with you yesterday some of the problems relating to the management of the Indian Residential Schools. As we pointed out to you, the Church of England has for many years been operating a number of these schools in partnership with the Government.\n\nOur purpose in seeing you yesterday was to lay before you three current problems relating to this partnership.\n\n1. Per Capita Grants.\n\nDuring the past ten years the costs of operating these schools have steadily increased - especially for such important items as food, clothing, wages and equipment. From time to time the churches concerned have both individually and collectively made representations to Government regarding this matter and asked for increase in the grants. We have always found the Government sympathetic and responsive to these requests. In 1946, 1947 and 1948 the grants were increased. In each case, however, there has been a serious time-lag between the increase in costs and the increase in the grants. As a result my Society has incurred an accumulated over-draft of over $180,000.\n\nThe last increase in the grants was made as from 1st April 1948. Since then the cost of living index has increased by 19.1 points or 12.59%. The attached memorandum, a copy of which was given to you yesterday, indicates what this means in the operating costs of the schools.\n\nWhen the increase was made in 1948 it was based on\n\na. Cost of living index\n\nb. Auditor's report of each school.\nOn this same basis, therefore, we ask\n\na. That the per capita grants to the several schools be increased commensurate to the increase of 12.5% in costs;\n\nb. That the increase be made retroactive; and\n\nc. That in future they be adjusted to rising costs, and therefore be reviewed quarterly.\n\nAs we pointed out to you, this increase would be entirely absorbed in maintaining necessary reasonable standards of food, clothing, wages and so forth.\n\nWe also pointed out that our auditor's statement shows that for the maintenance of the schools which we operated in partnership with the Government in 1949, the per capita grants were insufficient to meet the total expenditure by \u00a396,000. This deficit had to be made up from the very slender resources of the church.\n\n2. Purchase of Northern Schools.\n\nDuring the years of the depression and the war, new buildings were needed for four of the northern schools - Moose Factory, Fort George, Carcross and Aklavik. As Government was unable at the time to assume the expenditure for these, it was undertaken by the Church.\n\nIn 1947, our Board of Management decided that request should be made that these school buildings be purchased by the Government. The proceeds would be used in the first instance to liquidate the over-draft of \u00a3160,000, referred to above, incurred in the operation of the schools.\n\nThe schools were inspected and valuated by Government officials - together with the two other Church-owned schools at Wabasca and Whitefish. The total valuation, \u00a3321,237, as set out in the attached schedule, was approved by my Society.\n\nIn September 1948 we were informed by your predecessor, the Honorable J.A. MacKinnon, that provision had been made for the purchase of the four northern schools. Later, in April 1949, the Honorable Colin Gibson, wrote that the matter was receiving the attention of departmental officials, and that it was hoped that a satisfactory conclusion could be reached in the near future.\nAs no part of the purchase has yet been completed, and as the annual meeting of our Board of Management will be held on the 21st November, we asked that we might have a definite report by that date.\n\n3. The need of increased accommodation in residential schools for Anglican Indian children.\n\nAlthough our Society is now carrying a heavy over-draft, and although the per capita grants are not commensurate with the present cost of operating existing schools, we drew your attention to the need for greatly increased accommodation. We referred particularly to six areas where necessary residential school accommodation is lacking. They were:\n\na. The James Bay Area. There are many more Anglican children in this area than the present schools at Moose Factory and Fort George can accommodate.\n\nb. Northern Manitoba. Although the replacement of the McKay School at the Pas has been mooted from time to time, no school has yet been provided in this area for the many Anglican children.\n\nc. Northern Saskatchewan. There are 450 children in the two schools in Prince Albert - probably the maximum capacity, yet there are many more children in the area for whom provision is needed.\n\nd. British Columbia Coast. The school at Alert Bay is already overcrowded, yet there are other Anglican children - about 100 in the Naas country alone - for whom accommodation is needed.\n\ne. Yukon. A formal request has already been made by my Society for a new building at Teslin to provide for the children now at Carcross - and others.\n\nf. Mackenzie Delta. The accommodation in the Aklavik School is insufficient for the Anglican children of the area.\n\nMention was made in passing that the Roman Catholic Church was also feeling the need of increased accommodation for Roman Catholic children, and that Government was at present erecting three new schools for them.\n\nYou asked us to indicate the order of priority in which we would place the needs of the six areas. The need of the children in Yukon is at present the most urgent; we should welcome a favourable reply to the formal request we have already made on their behalf. As for the other five we shall have occasion to make requests on their behalf later, but are not prepared to do so immediately.\nThese then were the three matters which we wished to bring before you. It is our understanding that you will let us have your replies after you have had opportunity to enquire into them. We should greatly appreciate hearing from you in time for the meeting of our Board of Management on the 21st of this month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A.

I know, also, that you will appreciate that there are many points of view and alternate proposals which must be carefully considered before the Department is in a position to decide on a firm policy which would be fair to all. Suffice it to say that while the Department is not at the moment in a position to make a definite statement it is a problem for which a solution must be found soon and to this end we are moving.\n\nIn regard to the purchase of buildings, the following Departmental views are placed before you.\n**Moose Fort**\n\nFunds are already available in the current year's estimates for the purchase of this building, and its finalization awaits only the registration of plans in order to secure title.\n\n**Fort George**\n\nConsideration will be given for purchase at a later date, and initial steps have already been taken towards that end.\n\n**Wabasca**\n\nYou will appreciate that the Department has already, in the past two years, spent in excess of $200,000 in the erection of a dormitory block at this location. A decision has not yet been arrived at in respect to the purchase of Church-owned buildings at this point.\n\n**Whitefish**\n\nThe Department will give consideration only to the purchase of such buildings as may be necessary for the operation of a day school.\n\n**Aklavik**\n\nThis Department is not prepared to give consideration to the purchase of buildings, but it is a matter which might be referred to the Northwest Territories Administration for consideration at a later date.\n\n**Carcross**\n\nIt is the intention of the Department to proceed with the erection of a new school at Carcross, or other suitable point, as soon as the necessary funds are available.\nThe matter of a suitable site is being reviewed and is at the moment clouded in that the prospective site may be required for commercial purposes.\n\nI hope that the foregoing may assist you in your deliberations, and, in closing, I would point out that the Department is not unmindful of the historic and active role of the Church of England in Canada in the scholastic field among our Indians and, wherever possible, it is our desire to be of practical assistance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEA/FL\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, November 23, 1950\n\nCHIEF, EDUCATION DIVISION\nCarcross Residential School\n\nPayment of Grants for September, 1950, Quarter\n\nReference is to correspondence item No. 15181 being a circular addressed to Principals of Residential Schools under the direction of the Anglican Indian School Administration.\n\nThere is a minute from Canon Cook to Colonel Neary that indicates that the monetary matters referred to in the circular were a subject of previous discussion and agreement.\n\nThe Quarterly Return from Carcross School, however, is probably being audited at a reduced amount that falls considerably short of the amount which the Principal is entitled to claim and has claimed, although he may have to some extent changed the manner of making the claim.\n\nMay I suggest that this Division anticipate the receipt of any reproach. Carcross is a small-pupilage school which has fixed administrative expenses and probably operates at a deficit. I recommend that an assurance go forward that the amount to be paid for the September Quarter will more nearly approximate the amount that has been claimed.\n\nC.A.F.

Theories emanating from an Ottawa office are oftimes impossible to put into practice in the field. In this respect the problems confronting a residential school principal responsible for a hundred or more children (one of our men has 350) ought to have precedence over a day school principal with 20-40 children.\n\nI only wish it had been possible for Colonel Neary to have been present at our Conference.

W. M. Harris,\nMinister, Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nRe: Residential School Accommodation\n\nThis morning's post brought the following (an extract from his letter) from Principal Wickenden of the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie.\n\n\"Miss Mandl came to me this morning and, with expressions of regret, announced that she was setting no satisfaction out of her work and after careful thought had decided to resign. The announcement came as a decided disappointment since Miss Mandl has achieved very good control over her junior boys in a short time and has shown skill in handling them. Her chief interest seems to be the teaching and training of young children, while here, of necessity most of her time is taken up with domestic chores in the dormitory, washroom, playroom etc. I may say that, in this connection, she has had every consideration from Miss Spinney who, with the assistance of Miss Titley, has relieved her of the bulk of the boys' supervisor's duties in the care and maintenance of clothing in order that she might have opportunity to get to know her boys and be with them. Miss Mandl feels frustrated in her efforts by lack of facilities for keeping her juniors together, and it so happens that this year we have quite a number of very small children on either side who need special care. As you know we have only one playroom and this is meant to accommodate all the boys, from pre-school to Gr. 12. Furthermore there is the usual single washroom for everybody and inadequate lobby space for clothing. Some supervisors succumb to the rough and tumble and reconcile themselves to dirt and untidiness. Some fight against it and fret continually. Some, like Miss Mandl, feel that...\"\nproper standards are impossible of attainment and will not accept a compromise. In short this lady feels that we have insufficient workers to care properly for the children and inadequate quarters.\"\n\nIt is the sort of thing with which we are constantly confronted. We hire into our service trained and competent workers who soon become disgruntled and frustrated because accommodation in the schools does not allow for decent care of the children. During the past few years we have lost a great many trained and experienced-in-other-institutions workers for the reason mentioned above.\n\nOf recent years, Indian Affairs and health authorities have demanded of our schools higher standards not only academically but in the health and care of these Indian children. It is a case of expecting us to \"make bricks without straw\" - decent citizens without the means to make them such. Sometimes government officials intimate that our operation of Residential is inefficient and that our operational costs are too high. With the facilities given us we cannot begin to administer the schools any better. Our staff turnover is high and costly because we are not given the necessary equipment and accommodation to retain decent standards.\n\nI would plead most strongly that when Indian Affairs creates any new policy in regard to Residential School work we in turn be given the facilities to carry out the extra work required. Or, on the other hand, that no new policy be created that will not fit in with the facilities at our disposal.\n\nOnce again I urge that Indian Affairs Branch create some sort of consultative committee made up of representatives of the Church organizations operating these Residential Schools for government and Indian Affairs officials so that changes of policy, equipment of schools and location of schools may be decided upon by all concerned. Long before the government took an active interest in the education of Indian peoples the Church operated Residential Schools and we are, by no means, without experience. Such a committee would, I am sure, be beneficial to the Government, Church and the people we try to serve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nDecember 26, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nResidential School Accommodation\n\nPlease find attached a draft letter for the Minister's signature, addressed to Canon Cook.\n\nYou will note that I have only answered that part of the letter which deals with playrooms. I have not attempted to make any comment on Canon Cook's suggestion concerning the consultative committee. I know that Mr. Hoey had planned to establish such a committee and I feel that it would be of help to our education officials.\n\nHowever, I would like to discuss this matter with you before the inclusion of any comment in this letter for the Minister's signature.\n\nBernard F.

It is unfortunate that this is so, but these schools were erected at a time when such play space was thought to be adequate.\n\nNow we are faced with the need for adding to this play area, and at the same time we are faced with the need for providing initial classroom accommodation for over 6,000 children who have no educational facilities of any kind.\n\nYou can, therefore, understand why, at the present time, we are giving priority to the erection of schools to serve areas where no schools have previously existed.\n\nIn other words, we realize that several of our Residential Schools need additions to provide playrooms, classrooms, etc., but we must first face the need for providing schools for those Indian children who have never had any previously,\n\nYours sincerely,\nDecember 26, 1950.\n\nRev.

Before proceeding any further with this matter, it is felt that we must have definite approval from each of the Churches for such a major change in policy.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if we could have the views of your society concerning this proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

M.S.C.C. |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Akivik       | 48.52                                                 | $33.00                               |\n| Alert Bay    | 204.6                                                 | 134.85                               |\n| Cardston     | 119.54                                                | 389.20                               |\n| Carcross     | 45.847                                                | 202.57                               |\n| Gleen        | 133.5                                                 | 145.75                               |\n| Sioux Lookout| 150.8                                                 | 104.75                               |\n| Total        |                                                       | $1010.16                             |\n\nIn certain of the above cases it is evident that the Principal's figures were reduced by your Branch because pupils were delayed in returning to the schools on account of the railway and steamship strike. In this connection, you will recollect that I discussed the matter with you and, following our discussion, issued our Circular #4/50 of 29th August, 1950. A copy of this Circular was sent you at the time and another copy is enclosed for your retention.\n\nIn the other cases listed above where the railway and steamship strike did not affect return of the children, we are at a loss to discover on what grounds reduction was made by your Branch.\n\np.t.o.\nColonel Neary\n\nDecember 29, 1950\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will have the above cases reviewed and, if at all possible, arrange for the issue of supplementary cheques to the M.S.C.C. covering the differences. In cases where, on review, you feel that your figures are the correct ones, we would like to know the reasons for the cuts made in the Principals' figures so that we may advise them and thus prevent a repetition next year.\n\nAs our financial year ends on 31st December and our books for 1951 are closed in January next, early action will be much appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nCircular #24/50\n\nAugust 29, 1950\n\nCircular to All Principals:\n\nRe: Railway Strike\n\nPupils\n\nI have been in communication with Indian Affairs Branch concerning the grant of children delayed in entering or re-entering school as a result of the railway and steamboat strike.\n\nTheir ruling is that no loss in grant will be realized because of late entrance in such cases. However, they ask that under heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\" the actual number of days be recorded and in the \"Remarks\" column give the date of re-entrance plus the information that the pupil was late due to the strike. Note ought to be made also that the full 92 days are being claimed. On the last page under \"Aggregate number of days pupils in Residence\" record the actual figure total of \"Total number of days pupil in residence\" and underneath record the aggregate of days claimed and base your average attendance of pupils on the latter figure.\n\nExample - right three columns of form #1.A.403\n\n| Total days pupil | Total days pupil classroom | Remarks |\n|------------------|----------------------------|---------|\n| John Doe         | 87                         | R.R. strike entered 6/8/50 92 days claim |\n| Jean Doe         | 77                         | R.R. strike entered 15/8/50 92 days claim |\n\nAggregate number of Day Pupils in residence during Quarter 164\n\nAggregate number of days claimed 184\n\nAverage attendance during Quarter 2\n\nStaff\n\nAs we shall be getting full grant for late re-entering pupils and also as any delays on the part of staff are due to conditions beyond their control - staff will be paid as though they arrived back at the school at the time previously planned. New staff members will be paid from the time they originally ought to have arrived at the school.\n\nPlease inform your staff of this ruling.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nOctober 5, 1950.\n\nColonel B.

This increase is shown in the following table:\n\n| Cost of Living Indexes | Fuel and Light | Clothing | Home Furnishings and services |\n|------------------------|---------------|----------|------------------------------|\n| Combined               | Food          |          |                              |\n| 1st April, 1948        | 151.6         | 186.8    | 121.3                        | 172.9 | 161.9 |\n| 1st Sept., 1950        | 169.8         | 218.8    | 140.8                        | 182.3 | 171.1 |\n| Point increase, 1st April, 1948 to 1st Sept., 1950 | 18.2 | 32.0 | 19.5 | 9.4 | 9.2 |\n\nPercentage increase 1st April, 1948 to 1st Sept., 1950\n\nOur audited figures show that during the calendar year 1949 our expenditure in our schools on (a) food, (b) fuel and light, (c) clothing - apart altogether from clothing to the value of over $52,600 supplied by the Women's Auxiliary of the Church of England in Canada - and (d) household equipment expressed as percentages of total expenditure were as follows:\n\n- Food: 31.3%\n- Fuel & Light: 12.1%\n- Clothing: 4.1%\n- Household Equipment: 4.3%\n\n(P.T.O.)\nIt is clear, in view of the foregoing, that the Bureau of Statistics figures quoted above are conclusive evidence of the gross inadequacy of the present Per Capita grants if the Indian children are to receive a reasonable standard of nutrition and general care in our Schools.\n\nAn important point noted in the Bureau of Statistics release, dated 4th October, 1950, is that among individual foods to register increases during September, 1950, were staples such as beef, pork, lard, sugar, butter and eggs all of which are used extensively in feeding the children in our schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Dixon, of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, supplying further information from the point of view of the Church of England pertaining to the brief submitted by representatives of the Church of England when they visited Mr. Harris on January 23.\n\nHe mentions per capita grants, repairs to buildings, a joint advisory board, and a special Indian curriculum.\n\nMajor MacKay:\n\nFor report, as suggested.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n25th January, 1951.\n\nThe Honorable W. E. Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nWe greatly appreciated the sympathetic and understanding hearing which you gave our joint deputation last Tuesday.\n\nThe memorandum which the deputation left with you set out in brief the requests which we made jointly. By way of support and confirmation of those requests I am directed to send you the following information relating to schools administered by the Church of England.\n\n1. Per Capita Grants.\n\nThe audited statement of our Indian School Administration (Anglican) for 1949 reveals the following:\n\na. Total expenditure $581,598.34\n\nThis is made up of\n\n(1) Cash expenditure $528,935.75\n(2) Clothing supplied $52,662.59\n\nb. Revenue from Dominion Government $481,009.33\n\nThis is made up of Per Capita Grants, staff grants, and special grants.\n\nc. Excess of expenditure over revenue $100,589.01\n\nd. Average Pupilage 1,496\n\ne. Average expenditure for pupil $389\n\nf. Average revenue per pupil from Dominion Government $322\nWhile the Church of England has met the deficit of $100,589.01 for the year 1949, it has done so only at the expense of other branches of its work. We feel therefore that it is not unreasonable to ask that the grants be increased immediately and that the increase be made retroactive.\n\n2. Buildings.\n\nThe following are the needs of the Church of England under the three classifications mentioned in the memorandum:\n\na. Buildings needing to be enlarged:\n   (1) Moose Factory.\n   (2) Fort George.\n   (3) Sioux Lookout.\n   (4) Aklavik.\n   (5) Gleichen (Old Sun).\n\nb. Buildings to replace those destroyed:\n   (1) Northern Saskatchewan - Lac la Ronge.\n   (2) \" - Onion Lake.\n   (3) Northern Manitoba - McKay School at The Pas.\n\nc. Buildings required in new areas:\n   (1) Southern Yukon - To replace present school at Carcross.\n   (2) Naas River, B.C.\n   (3) York Factory - Hudson Bay\n\nWe would emphasize the fact that because of the great lack of building accommodation, literally hundreds of Anglican Indian children are at present deprived of the opportunity of education.\n3. Joint Advisory Board.\n\nOur experience leads us to point out that such a board is necessary in connexion with problems arising out of the equipment and maintenance of the schools. We have reason to believe that we have much to contribute in consultation as a result of many years of experience; and further, that such consultation is decidedly preferable before action is taken than after.\n\n4. Special Indian Curriculum.\n\nSince so many of the children in our Anglican schools are nomads of the North, we are only too well aware of the fact that the present curricula for primary grades are capable of great improvement.\n\nWe are encouraged to know that you felt that the requests in the memorandum were not unreasonable. We devoutly hope that they can be granted at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nMINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nOTTAWA, February 20, 1951.\n\nTO: The Deputy Minister\n\nFOR:\n\nPreparation of reply for signature of ........................................................\n\nDiscussion with ......................................................................................\n\nPerusal and necessary action ..................................................................\n\nReport .....................................................................................................\n\non attached letter from Rev.

As a result I have been instructed to send you the following statement which the meeting approved:\n\n\"That in view of the dissatisfaction of our Indian School Administration with the recent experiments at Alert Bay and Moose Factory, the General Secretary be asked to notify government that M.S.C.C. favours the system of government paid teachers as at present constituted, but would make the following recommendations regarding such a system:\n\n(1) That the government take over the paying of teachers only after separate classroom and teacher accommodations are provided by government outside the residential school.\n\n(2) That all Churches operating residential schools come under the same system, and that the qualifications of all teachers in all schools merit the standards of the Department of Education of the Province or territory in which the school is located.\n\n(3) That adjustments be made in the number of teaching days and holidays to allow for the children to have the two month holiday period away from the residential school. This would not apply to orphans and children from broken homes.\"\n(4) That representatives of the Churches operating such schools comprise a committee with governmental representatives to formulate general and overall policy and to give guidance and advice in specific cases.\n\n(5) That per capita grants be retained at a sufficiently high figure to allow for the hiring of extra supervisors and staff members.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nLAD K.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nCHAIRMAN \u2014 THE PRIMATE\nCHAIRMAN, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \u2014 THE Rt.

N. Phelan,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nCost of Living Index and Per Capita Grants\n\nThis morning we received the Dominion Bureau of Statistics pamphlet \"Price Movements, March 1951 (Preliminary)\" released on 4th April, 1951, and we have prepared the following table showing the increases, by points and percentages, since 1st April, 1948,\n\n| Cost of Living Indexes | Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | Home Furnishings & Services |\n|------------------------|----------|------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 1st April, 1948        | 151.6    | 186.8| 121.3        | 172.9    | 161.9                       |\n| 1st March, 1951        | 179.7    | 233.9| 146.5        | 196.3    | 188.6                       |\n\nPOINT increase from 1st April, 1948, to 1st March, 1951. 28.1 47.1 25.2 23.4 26.7\n\nPERCENTAGE increase from 1st April, 1948, to 1st March, 1951. 18.53 25.21 20.77 13.53 17.11\n\nWe have just received the draft of our Auditors report for the calendar year 1950 which shows that of our cash expenditure on Residential Schools the purchase of foodstuffs represents 34.17%; therefore, in respect of the commodities that absorb well over one third of our expenditure it will be noted that the cost has increased by over 25% since 1st April, 1948.\n\nRecently you advised us that the Per Capita rates which have been in effect since 1st April, 1948, were increased by 5% from 1st October, 1950. Compared to the percentage increases shown in the above table an increase of 5% in the per capita grant (and then only for \u00bd of your fiscal year 1950-51) clearly is most inadequate, to say the least.\n\n(P.T.Q)\nIn view of the foregoing it is urged that early action be taken to increase the per capita grants in accordance with the increased operating costs of our schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nApril 24, 1951.\n\nMajor D. Mackay,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Sanitary Inspections of Government owned Indian Residential Schools.\n\nWe have your letter of 21st April, 1951, on the above-mentioned subject and note that you state that \"all residential Schools are frequently visited by medical officers of the Department of National Health and Welfare\".\n\nIt will be appreciated if arrangements can be made to furnish this office with copies of reports, or relevant extracts from reports, of these medical officers following their visits to Anglican Indian Residential Schools should these reports indicate any sign of neglect or carelessness on the part of school staffs in maintaining proper standards of cleanliness and sanitation so that we may be able to take appropriate action.\n\nFurther, we would ask that when these medical officers or sanitary inspectors encounter conditions such as the foul odours that have been prevalent at St. Cyprian's School, Brocket, Alberta, for some time efforts be made as quickly as possible to discover the cause and to effect a remedy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 9, 1951.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nIn a number of our schools across the country we are finding that the number of pupils held in residence over the holiday two month period is increasing considerably. This is due mainly to two reasons - (a) The establishment of day schools has changed the type of child entering these residential schools. Where formerly we got youngsters from progressive Indian families interested in their children getting an education we now get more orphans and children from so-called \"broken homes\". The former are now attending day schools to an increasing degree while the latter have no place to go during the summer. (b) Many agency superintendents are asking us to keep certain pupils all summer in an effort to allow them to escape the unsatisfactory social conditions of their home village or reserve.\n\nWhile we are glad to render this service to the Indians peoples it is nevertheless imposing on our schools an abnormal financial burden. We have to retain larger summer staffs and that costs money also the ever increasing price of foods is an item that cannot be overlooked in this regard.\n\nIn that the per capita grant system was incorporated with the understanding that the children would be in residence ten months of the year it would be appreciated if Indian Affairs branch could institute a form of bonus payment, over and above the regular grant, for youngsters retained in residence during the summer months. I'm quite sure you'll see the justice of this request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1951.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.C.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nRe: Summer Pupils\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with regard to the number of children whom it is necessary to retain at residential schools during the months of July and August. This practice has been necessary at practically all Indian residential schools for many years past. I refer, of course, to those children where home conditions are unsuitable.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it has never been recognized that the per capita allowance is paid on the understanding that the children would be in residence only 10 months of each year.\n\nThe per capita allowance covers a 12 month period, but for 2 months of each year children whose home conditions are suitable may have holidays. However, as you are aware, no reduction is made in the per capita payment to the school, provided the children who go home on holidays are not absent for more than 62 days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1951.\n\nRev.

I refer, of course, to those children where home conditions are unsuitable.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it has never been recognized that the per capita allowance is paid on the understanding that the children would be in residence only 10 months of each year.\n\nThe per capita allowance covers a 12 month period, but for 2 months of each year children whose home conditions are suitable may have holidays. However, as you are aware, no reduction is made in the per capita payment to the school, provided the children who go home on holidays are not absent for more than 62 days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nLytton, B. C.\n\nMay 30th 1951.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,  \nSuperintendent of Education,  \nIndian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWill you kindly let me know what our per capita grant allowance is at the present time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nJune 6th, 1951.\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the per capita allowance at the St. George's Residential School is $283.50.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nJune 7, 1951.\n\nMr. D. M. MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. MacKay:\n\nRe: Rev. Henry Ellis,\nProtestant Chaplain at Saskatchewan Penitentiary\n\nThe above-mentioned gentlemen was appointed Protestant chaplain at Saskatchewan Penitentiary on June 24, 1947. He was made permanent on January 1, 1950.\n\nI had occasion to meet Reverend Ellis recently and he advised me that for a period of thirty years, i.e., from 1917 to 1947, he had been an employee of your department in the educational field. Reverend Ellis requested me to consider whether or not his service with you might be computed for superannuation purposes.\n\nI would be pleased to be advised as to the period of service Reverend Ellis had with you, the capacity in which he was employed and whether or not he was a contributor towards the Superannuation Act during that period. Was he a full-time or part-time employee? Reverend Ellis did not mention this previous service at the time of his appointment.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter,\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. L. Sauvant,\nSenior Assistant Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 11th, 1951.\n\nMr. G.L. Sauvant,\nSenior Assistant Commissioner of Penitentiaries,\nJustice Building, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sauvant:\n\nRe: Reverend Henry Ellis\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 7th, the Reverend Mr. Ellis was Principal of the Onion Lake C.E. Indian Residential School for many years and later was Principal of the St. Alban's C.E. Indian Residential School.\n\nBoth of the Indian Residential Schools mentioned above are government buildings, but the schools are operated under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. All staff at these schools is engaged by the Missionary Society and paid by them from the amount which the Department allows as per capita allowance for each Indian pupil in attendance.\n\nConsequently, while Mr. Ellis was Principal of the two Residential Schools mentioned, he was not considered an employee of this Department and, therefore, he did not contribute any amount to the superannuation fund.\n\nIt is my understanding that the Missionary Society has a superannuation fund for its employees, and if you desire to communicate with them, you should address your letter to Reverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D., Superintendent, The Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C., 102 Bank St., Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nMINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nOTTAWA, June 11, 1951.\n\nTO: The Deputy Minister\n\nFOR: Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nPreparation of reply for signature of...the Minister...\n\nDiscussion with...\n\nPerusal and necessary action...\n\nReport...\n\nto attached letter from Reverend Canon L.A. Dixon, General Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, The Church House, 604 Jarvis Street, Toronto, 5, Ontario, thanking the Minister for the interview he gave to him and Canon Cook on May 28th, concerning the problem of Per Capita Grants, and outlining the reasons why the 5% increase is not sufficient to meet their needs.\n\nI have acknowledged this letter today, \"in the absence of the Minister\" and have stated it will be brought to his attention upon his return.\n\nMajor MacKay:\nFor draft reply, as suggested.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary\nJune 13, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nEvaluation of Equipment at Moose Fort Indian Residential School\n\nHerewith is a copy of the inventory of the equipment at this school. The inventory previously taken was used as the basis for inspection and evaluation. Items appearing on the previous inventory have in some cases been re-valued to allow for depreciation and, in other cases, the items have been struck off the list because they are either not required or not usable. For example, the apparatus for preparing and baking bread is not now needed, because the bread is purchased from a baker. The horses, formerly offered for sale, are dead.\n\nAs the school must have transportation for freight and passengers, by water in the summer and over the ice in the winter, it is considered proper to include canoes with engines and the tractor and a wagon. These means of transportation have been included at their list price on the understanding that hereafter maintenance and replacement will be a school responsibility.\n\nThe evaluation of the items to be purchased amounts to a total of $14,589.53.\n\nAs a supplement to the inventory I have added a list of items of \"equipment purchased by the Government\". These items include classroom furniture and equipment, an extractor for the laundry and a water chlorinator, together with a miscellaneous collection of kitchen equipment purchased from the Canada Catering Company, Limited, last year for the sum of $500.25; for which expenditure the Anglican Indian School administration was reimbursed by the Department.\n\nC.A.F.C.\n\nG.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n### Inventory of Equipment at Moose Fort Residential School\n\nWith valuation revised at May 21, 1951.\n\n| Item Description                                      |

It may now be proper to suggest to Canon Dixon that the M.S.C.C. communicate with the Commissioner for the Northwest Territories. You will note that in his memorandum to the Director dated March 17, 1950, Colonel Neary doubts that the Northwest Territories Council \"ever considered this matter\". On file 160-2 under date of November 18, 1950 the Director suggests to our Deputy Minister that the M.S.C.C. should address the Minister of Resources and Development regarding this purchase.\n\n(b) WHITEFISH LAKE\n\nAgreement was reached with the M.S.C.C. that in lieu of purchase (as the Residential School was closed on June 30, 1950) the Department would pay $50.00 a month for accommodation to be used as classrooms and as living quarters for the teachers. A letter from the Director to Canon Dixon, dated August 4, 1950, confirms the present arrangement.\n(c) WABASCA\n\nA review of the correspondence and memoranda confirms the need for buildings additional to the dormitory block which the Department erected. The Department of Public Works placed a valuation of $13,737.92 on the church-owned buildings. No official estimate of the value of the church-owned land, about 60 acres, has been received. As it is not particularly good land, its valuation is not likely to exceed (less mineral rights) $25.00 an acre or about $1,500.00 in all. As some of the buildings have almost outlived their usefulness the Department might limit its offer for the land and buildings to a total of $15,000.00.\n\nC.A.F.

Per Capita Grants\n\nCareful consideration was given to your request\nfor an additional increase in the per capita grants,\nbut it was not found possible to provide at the present\ntime the funds that would be required.\n\n2. Sale of Northern Schools\n\n(a) Moose Fort\n\nThe Director of the Indian Affairs Branch advised\nme that another valuation was recently made of the\nequipment which you request us to purchase. Funds for\nthe purpose have been included in the Supplementary\nEstimates, 1951-52, and if allowed, we will be able\nto complete the transaction early in July.\n\n(b) Fort George\n\nFunds for the purchase of this building for the\namount on which there was agreement some time ago,\nnamely $42,448.00, have been included in the Supplementary Estimates, 1951-52, and as stated in regard to the Moose Fort School, we will be able to complete the transaction early in July if the amount is allowed.\n\n(c) Wabasca\n\nWhile consideration was given some time ago to the amount that might be allowed by the Department for the land and buildings owned by your Society, it is felt that additional information should be secured. Consequently, further consideration of the purchase will have to be delayed.\n\n(d) Whitefish Lake\n\nOur officials who have examined the buildings, report that they are very old, and if the attendance at the day school which has been established warrants such action, it is considered that it will be preferable to erect a new day school. In the meantime, we are allowing rent for the buildings that are being used as classrooms and living quarters for the teachers. In this connection I would refer you to Major MacKay's letter to you dated August 4th, 1950, which confirmed the present arrangement.\n\n(e) Aklavik\n\nYou refer to the Director's letter of March 23rd, 1950, and no further action has been taken since that time. I might add that we have no funds available for purchase of the building at present.\n\n(f) Carcross\n\nIn the 1951-52 appropriation an amount of $100,000.00 has been provided to erect a new residential school at Carcross. It is our intention to provide for accommodation\n\nAs indicated in the Director's letter of March 23, 1950, the Indian Affairs Branch has already reached a decision not to recommend the purchase of the Aklavik school by this Department. The Aklavik school is, as you know, situated in territory administered by the Department of Resources and Development.\nfor approximately 80 pupils. No consideration has yet been given to the purchase of the present church-owned building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs\n\nwhen letter is signed\n\n1951 JUN 29 PM 2:00\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS Ottawa, June 26, 1951.\n\nReverend Canon L.A.

Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nWe are grateful for the time which you gave to Canon Cook and myself when we called to see you on the 28th May, and for the sympathy and understanding with which you received the several questions which we laid before you.\n\n1. Per Capita Grants.\n\nWe are duly grateful for the recent 5% increase. As we explained to you, it has been very acceptable, but has not been adequate.\n\nAs an indication of the practical difficulty confronting us we pointed out that whereas our expenditure for food in 1948 had been $133,000, in 1950 it had been $182,000, an increase of 36%. The corresponding increase in the per capita grant had been approximately 6%.\n\nFor 1951 we estimate that our expenditures will exceed those of 1950 by $80,000. Toward this, the recent 5% increase in per capita grants will amount to $20,000, leaving an estimated net excess of $60,000. This presents us with one or more possible alternatives:\n\na. To reduce staff salaries - and so impair the quality of the work;\n\nb. To reduce the standards of management - food, clothing, etc. - which are already none too high.\n\nc. To incur a deficit and so add to our already heavy overdraft - which our Society refuses to consider.\n\nIn view of the above, our request to you was that the present 5% increase be further increased by 15% as from 1st January 1951.\n2. Sale of Northern Schools.\n\nOn the 7th November 1950, I wrote to you confirming our talk with you the previous day. In my letter I referred to the negotiations which were initiated in 1947 with reference to the purchase by Government of six northern residential schools which had been erected with church funds. As there pointed out, the proceeds from such sales would be used in the first place to liquidate the overdraft of $160,000 incurred by our Society during the war years.\n\nIn your reply of the 20th November 1950 you referred to the existing situation in the case of each of the six schools. To these we referred as follows:\n\na. Moose Fort. We have been informed that the cheque for this school has been issued but has not yet been released. We have written to the Director about the furniture and equipment in the school, and also about the former hospital building, now being used as a residence for the principal, but have not yet had reply.\n\nb. Fort George. In your letter you stated \"Consideration will be given for purchase at a later date, and initial steps have already been taken toward that end\". Since then we have had no further word. Could you kindly let us know what further action has been taken?\n\nc. Wabasca. The new Government building has been erected on our Church property. Government still finds it necessary to use some of our buildings. We have enquired about the purchase or renting of these buildings but have had no reply.\n\nd. Whitefish. You have written \"The Department will give consideration only to the purchase of such buildings as may be necessary for the operation of a day school\". We should be glad to know what further action has been taken.\n\ne. Aklavik. This building was erected by our Society in 1936. In 1949 the appraiser from the Department of Public Works valued it at $124,600, an estimate which our Society approved. On 23rd March 1950 the Director wrote that it had been decided to take no action with regard to purchase. We feel that this action would not be fair to our Society, and we therefore ask that the matter be given further and favourable consideration.\n\nf. Carcross. You have written \"It is the intention of the Department to proceed with the erection of a new school at Carcross, or other suitable point, as soon as the necessary funds are available\".\nAs we explained to you there are extenuating circumstances which make the situation at Carcross particularly urgent. The present temporary building, erected with Church funds during the war, is now inadequate. As a result Anglican children are being admitted to other non-Anglican schools in the area.\n\nIf provision has been made in the current estimates for a new building, we should like to know for what total pupilage there will be accommodation. We should also like to know what action the Government is taking regarding the purchase of the present Church-owned building.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this whole question has been under consideration since 1947. It has been presented successively to your predecessors Dr. Keenlyside, the Honorable J. A. MacKinnon and the Honorable Colin Gibson. In each case it has been favourably received, but as yet no part of the sale has been completed. We should appreciate it if early action could be taken and the completion expedited.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLAD K.\nJuly 9, 1951.\n\nReverend Canon L.A.

It would be\nappreciated if you would let me know as soon as possible if\nthis valuation meets with your approval. If so, we can then\nproceed with the payment of the amount mentioned above,\nto the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl.\n\nPP/EM\nJune 28, 1951\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nDirector  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nThe building and repair season is well advanced and this Administration, to date, has no accurate information on the progress of some projects we thought would be well under way by this date. It would be appreciated if we could have early intelligence of what the Indian Affairs Branch proposes to do in relation to the following:\n\na - Construction in Southern Yukon.\n\nb - Construction of the engineer's residence at Shingwauk. Materials, I understand, are in storage on the property.\n\nc - Construction of a classroom-staffroom block at old Sun School.\n\nd - Construction of classroom and staff accommodation at St. Michaels, Alert Bay.\n\ne - Construction of classroom block or structural alterations to Bishop Horden School.\n\nf - The water situation at the Gordons School.\n\ng - Construction of a principal's residence at Wabasca. Some material is in storage on the premises.\n\nIt is imperative that we have some knowledge of the above plans so that plans can be made for school-reopening in September.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry F.

Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nRe: Cost of living Index & Per Capita Grants\nAnglican Indian Residential School.\n\nI have just received a copy of Dominion Bureau of Statistics\n\"Price Movements, July, 1951,\" released yesterday and showing an\nincrease of 3.5 points in the Combined Index between 1st June, 1951,\nand 3rd July, 1951.\n\nAs the Per Capita Grants on which we received only a 5% increase\neffective 1st October, 1950, were established with effect from 1st\nApril, 1948, I would like to invite your attention to the following\ntable which shows the point and percentage increases in the Cost of\nLiving Indexes between 1st April, 1948 and 3rd July, 1951:\n\n| Cost of Living Indexes | Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | Home Furnishings & Services |\n|------------------------|----------|------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| 1st April, 1948        | 151.6    | 186.8| 121.3        | 172.9    | 161.9                      |\n| 3rd July, 1951         | 187.6    | 249.7| 147.2        | 202.9    | 197.4                      |\n\nPOINT increase from\n1st April, 1948 to\n3rd July, 1951.     36.0   62.9   25.9   30.0   35.5\n\nPERCENTAGE Increase\nfrom 1st April, 1948,\nto 3rd July, 1951.   23.74  33.67  21.35  17.35  21.92\n\nThe above figures speak for themselves, particularly when it is\npointed out that expenditure on food represents over one third of school\noperating costs, and show how inadequate is an increase of only 5%\nin Per Capita Grants.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd.: G. R. Turner\nfor Henry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nAugust 2, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nSurvey of the Interior Economy of Church of England Indian Residential Schools\n\nSince the time that you first mentioned this matter I have given it some thought and have discussed it briefly with Mr. School Inspector Mingay.\n\nIt would be helpful, I think, if the Director were to look over this memorandum so that any misapprehensions on my part at least may be avoided.\n\nIt is understood that this project will be assigned to committees comprising departmental officials and church representatives. The Department has a greater choice of representatives than the Church although, with the exception of Major Davy, our own school inspectors have so far had very limited opportunities to study the operation of Indian residential schools. The committee to study each school might accordingly comprise the Regional Supervisor, Agency Superintendent and School Inspector concerned together with a representative of the Anglican School Administration and the Education Division, the last two supplying the necessary integrating and unifying element. The Principal of each school is, presumably, the star witness at each inquiry.\n\nThe terms of reference may be stated as \"to discover whether there are any practicable changes in the interior economy of Anglican residential schools whereby such schools may be operated at a lower per-pupil cost to the Anglican Indian School Administration.\"\n\nIn arranging a schedule for the inquiries it seems necessary that the members of the committee (especially those who are not fully acquainted with the workings of any school) should visit the\nschools when the institutional routines are operating at a fair approximation of the normal potential. This consideration would retard the beginning of the survey until late in August. Probably the Fort George School will be operating at full potential by the 25th of August.\n\nThe desirable composition of committees (i.e., the same representatives from Ottawa working with each local authority so as to unify and integrate the procedures and results) will require the survey to be spread out over several weeks, and some fairly flexible schedule of visits to the schools involved will have to be planned. This schedule may be adjusted so that those schools which are habitually slow in gathering momentum may be the last visited. In Ontario, for example, the two James Bay Schools get under way first and Sioux Lookout is possibly the slowest starting. In Manitoba there are no schools to be considered. In Saskatchewan the Principal of the newly reorganized school at Prince Albert should be allowed part of September to experiment with procedures in the new organization. In Alberta, St. Paul's School is likely to be running a poor second to Old Sun's. In British Columbia, Alert Bay offers several problems that should receive the fullest attention of all concerned. There is at several schools the need to regulate the relationship of departmentally paid teachers to the operating authorities.\n\nSome preliminary steps are indicated as necessary or desirable. I think that those who are to make the inquiry should first review the audit reports on the schools to be surveyed. The Anglican School Administration should be requested to direct each Principal to prepare a statement of the manner in which his school is operated including mention of any changes he has made in procedures and the effect thereof and any changes that have been suggested and not made and the reasons for not making them. These statements by principals are to be regarded as privileged documents to be shown to the investigating committee without previous censorship by superiors in the church or department, and it must be understood that the principal or any member of his staff may speak frankly to the committee without prejudice to his or her employment and prospects. This procedure should, I think, be discussed with and understood by the Reverend Canon Cook and the church representative on the committee.\n\nAs such investigations require some criteria to give the results validity, I suggest that the officials who are to undertake\nthis project should make some attempt in the near future to acquaint themselves with procedures and costs in institutions of a comparable nature. At this time of year provincial institutions for difficult children are probably the only comparable institutions operating at full potential. We in Ottawa might economically spend a few hours at the St. Joseph's (R.C.) Training School for Boys at Alfred, Ontario - 41 miles away. If time and funds were available it would be desirable to get the reactions of the church representative to procedures at Mohawk Institute and possibly the Ontario Training School for Boys at Guelph and for Girls at Cobourg. Similarly, the inspectors concerned in other provinces might in the meantime get some acquaintance with comparable provincial institutions in Western Canada.\n\nAs soon as possible it would be well to inform all those officials who will be concerned just what the terms of reference are and to give them some guidance in orienting their thinking. They may also be able to furnish us in advance with material that will be helpful to all who are undertaking this inquiry.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer\nOttawa, September 17, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPursuant to your instructions and our telephone conversation of September 12, in connection with the article appearing in the Toronto Star on September 11, 1951, I submit the following information prepared by the Superintendent of Education:\n\nPage 1 - 1949 Census showing the Indian population of Canada by religious denominations,\n\nPage 2 - Residential school accommodation provided and proposed since April 1, 1947,\n\nPage 3 - Purchase of Indian residential schools owned by the Church of England,\n\nPages 4, 5, and 6 Applications for new schools by the Church of England as requested in letter dated November 7, 1950, from the Reverend Canon L.A.

The Justice Department is holding cheque for the amount stated, pending completion of transfer of title.\n\n(b) Fort George Residential School\n\nThis building is owned by the Church of England and the Department has agreed to purchase it for an amount of $42,448.00. Funds for this purpose were provided in the 1951-52 Supplementary Estimates but we have not yet issued the cheque. Negotiations are pending for completion of transfer of title.\nAPPLICATION FOR NEW SCHOOLS BY THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Honourable W. E. Harris, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, dated November 7, 1950, the Reverend Canon L.A. Dixon, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, mentioned the following areas where he stated their Society considered necessary residential school accommodation is lacking:\n\n(a) The James Bay Area\n\nIn the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1951-52 an amount of $100,000.00 is provided for the erection of a new building in connection with the Moose Fort Residential School. The Engineering and Construction Service has not yet completed the plans and specifications but it is intended to provide dormitory accommodation and use the present building for classroom purposes.\n\n(b) Northern Manitoba\n\nReplacing of MacKay School at The Pas\n\nThe MacKay School was destroyed by fire on March 19, 1933. Since that time a number of day schools have been erected in the area from which this school formerly recruited its pupils. The Departmental field officials have not urged the replacement of the former MacKay Residential School.\n\n(c) Northern Saskatchewan\n\nThe Reverend Canon Dixon wrote as follows:\n\n\"There are 450 children in the two schools in Prince Albert - probably the maximum capacity, yet there are many more children in the area for whom provision is needed.\"\n\nThe Residential School at Onion Lake, Sask., was destroyed by fire on December 1, 1943, and another residential school, also under Church of England auspices, at Lac la Ronge, was destroyed by fire on February 2, 1946.\n\nNeither of the above schools has been rebuilt.\nTo provide accommodation for Church of England children in Saskatchewan the Department rented from the Bishop of Saskatchewan the St. Alban's School located in the town of Prince Albert, and also took over several buildings in the former military camp located on the outskirts of Prince Albert. Considerable renovations have been made in the buildings that have been used in the military camp and at the request of the Missionary Society of the Church of England it has been decided to discontinue the use of St. Alban's School in Prince Albert and provide additional accommodation in the military camp. To carry out this work we have recently awarded the tender of $59,592.04 mentioned on page 2.\n\nThe Department also owns the Gordon's Residential School located near Punnichy, Saskatchewan. The use of this building had to be discontinued four years ago owing to the water supply giving out. The Departmental engineers have made several attempts to secure water but so far without success. A departmental engineer visited Saskatchewan several weeks ago and at the present time another attempt is being made to locate water. If this is successful there will be accommodation for approximately 100 children in the Gordon's School, which is a first-class building.\n\n(d) British Columbia Coast\n\nThe Reverend Canon Dixon wrote:\n\n\"The school at Alert Bay is already overcrowded, yet there are other Anglican children - about 100 in the Nass country alone - for whom accommodation is needed.\"\n\nArrangements are being made with Indian Commissioner Arneil to have a survey made of the district in the near future with a view to determining if another residential school should be erected.\n(e) Yukon\n\nReverend Canon Dixon wrote as follows:\n\n\"A formal request has already been made by my Society for a new building at Teslin to provide for the children now at Carcross - and others.\"\n\nAs stated on page 2, it is the Department's intention to replace the present Carcross School.\n\n(f) Mackenzie Delta\n\nCanon Dixon wrote:\n\n\"The accommodation in the Aklavik School is insufficient for the Anglican children of the area.\"\n\nThis building is owned by the Church of England and Indian Eskimo and white children are enrolled.\n\nAs a result both the Northwest Territories Administration of the Department of Resources and Development and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration are interested and it has been decided to delay consideration of providing funds for additional accommodation until further information is available.\n## NEW DAY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS ERECTED IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS\n\n| Classrooms in which Roman Catholic teachers are employed | Classrooms in which non-Catholic teachers are employed |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1947-48                                                  | 25                                                     |\n| 1948-49                                                  | 22                                                     |\n| 1949-50                                                  | 32                                                     |\n| 1950-51                                                  | 34                                                     |\n| **Total**                                                | **113**                                                |\n\nSection 120 (1) of the Indian Act provides for the employment of a teacher of the same religious denomination as the majority of the members of the Band.\n\nIn the case of the schools where non-Catholic teachers are employed it is difficult to make a distinction by denominations as there is considerable interchangeability in securing and appointing teachers.\nOttawa, October 2, 1951.\n\nEXPENDITURES FOR NEW BUILDINGS AND MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS\nAT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS OPERATED UNDER THE\nAUSPICES OF THE MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA, FROM APRIL 1, 1948 -\nMARCH 31, 1951.\n\n| Name of School | Fiscal Year | Expenditure | Total |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------|\n| GARCROSS, Yukon | 1948-49     | $12,057.00  | $12,057.00 |\n| WABASGA, Alberta | 1948-49     | $111,638.00 |       |\n|                 | 1949-50     | $90,480.00  |       |\n|                 | 1950-51     | $6,651.00   | $208,769.00 |\n| GORDON'S, Saskatchewan | 1948-49 | $43,160.00 | $43,160.00 |\n\nNote: The following information regarding this building was contained on page 5 of memorandum of September 17, 1951:\n\n\"The Department also owns the Gordon's Residential School located near Punnichy, Saskatchewan.

Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa 4, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 28th to which no reply was sent, I might point out that at the time it was received the departmental estimates had not yet been approved, and consequently, it was not possible at that time to give you the information you requested.\n\nHowever, in the interval I believe that you have been informed regarding the majority of the items mentioned in your letter of June 28th. The following is a brief review:\n\n(a) Construction in Southern Yukon -\n\nI presume this refers to the proposed new Carcross Residential School, for which an amount of $100,000.00 has been included in the current year's appropriation. Plans and specifications for this building have not yet been completed by the Engineering Division.\n\n(b) Construction of Engineer's residence at Shingwauk Residential School -\n\nAs you know, a contract has been let for the construction of this building. In letter dated\nOctober 6th, Superintendent Laurence has written us as follows:\n\n\"With reference to our telephone conversation of yesterday-date, this is to advise that I immediately went down to the Shingwauk School and found that the contractor, Mr. Newcastle, was at work on the footings and will now continue to work on this building until it is finished.\n\n\"As it has been raining here almost continuously for the last three weeks, the weather held him up from being further advanced with the basement.\"\n\n(c) Construction of Classroom - Staffroom, Old Sun's Residential School -\n\nA contract has been awarded recently for construction of this building.\n\n(d) Construction of Classroom Block and Staff Accommodation at Alert Bay -\n\nProvision was made in the current year's estimates for a classroom block at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, but it is not known if it will be possible to proceed with construction this year.\n\nNo funds were included in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new teacherage, but we understand accommodation for the teachers is available for the current academic year at least in quarters provided by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\n(e) Construction of Classroom Block, Bishop Horden School (Moose Fort) -\n\nPlans and specifications for this building are not yet completed, but it is still hoped that we will be able to award a contract for its erection before the end of the current fiscal year.\n(f) Water Situation, Gordon's School -\n\nI understand from Mr. Buck that he has kept you informed regarding the water situation at this school. Recent reports regarding the possibility of securing adequate water are very encouraging.\n\n(g) Construction of Principal's Residence at Wabasca -\n\nIt was not found possible to include funds for this purpose in the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 16, 1951.\n\nReverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, replies are going forward to all the communications mentioned in your letter, with one exception.\n\nWe have not found it possible to locate your letter of July 12, 1951, with reference to adjustment of grant at Wabasca C.E. Residential School due to high electric costs. Please let me have a copy of your letter in this regard.\n\nThe delay in replying to your letters is regretted. The shortage of staff is to a considerable extent responsible for such delay. It is my hope, however, that it will now be possible to give more prompt attention to such matters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nExtract from THE CANADIAN CHURCHMAN, Toronto, October 4, 1951.\n\nThe Most Rev. W. F. Barfoot presided at the opening meeting of the Executive Council, for the first time as Primate, on Saturday morning, September 8th, in the Memorial Hall of Christ Church Cathedral, Victoria. The Roll Call indicated that there was a large attendance.\n\nIndian School Administration\n\nThe need for more workers was also stressed by Canon H. G. Cook, who asked for thirty more staff members if the work in the Indian Schools is to be done effectively. He said, however, that most of the inactivity in connection with the Indian Schools was due to the poor administration of the Government Department. There is need for more accommodation; for example - fifty children cannot get into the school at Aklavik. Canon Cook also spoke of the activities and methods of the Roman Catholic Church in its treatment of the Indian children, especially any who are of Anglican parents.\n\nIt was recommended that a Commission be appointed to consider the whole question of Indian work and to approach the Government.\nOctober 22, 1951.\n\nMajor D.

F. Davey,\nAssistant Director of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Bob:\n\nI can quite understand that you want another expert trained by me for the Department of Indian Affairs, as I have reason to believe that your Department has progressed more since I have been supplying them than in all its history of some 200 years. However, at the present moment I can think of no one who would take the job and who has these very desirable qualities. I think you remember Arthur Plows, who was principal at Fairbridge School Farm, and who commanded the Canadian Scottish Regiment in action for a brief time. Art is a splendid chap and would make an excellent Indian School Inspector or Inspector in any Department for that matter. I am sure he has not completed his B.A., as yet, I don't know how close he is to it. As you know, Fairbridge is closing. I would like you to let me know if you are interested in Plows, as I have written him regarding an Elementary School Principalship, today. I sent your advertisement to Art.\n\nI am very glad to know that you and Margaret have secured satisfactory living quarters. It must be nice to be settled down in one place for a change. Let me know if you need a good office boy.\n\nAll the best wishes to Margaret and yourself,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nApril 26, 1952.\n\nMr. W.J. Mouat,\nInspector of Schools,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nDear Bill:\n\nThanks very much for your last letter. Unfortunately, Art Plows would be ruled out by the Civil Service Commission because of the fact that he has not his degree. I know him slightly and had some contact with him when he was Principal of the Fairbridge School Farm. I understand he did an excellent job there and certainly would be a good man for our service. It is unfortunate that he has not completed his university work.\n\nI would like very much to see him in our service, and I am sure that he would be an excellent man for the principalship of one of our residential schools, for which he has a good background. Whether or not this would interest him, of course, I do not know. The last time I saw him I asked if such a job had any attraction for him when he left Fairbridge, but he seemed to have another prospect which was more attractive. However, I would appreciate it if you could give me his address, as I would like to sound him out again on that idea. I am afraid that any proposal will reach him too late, as I realize that he will have to indicate definitely in a short time his intention with regard to the principalship which you are offering him.\n\nI hope that this finds you and Jean and the family well. There is no prospect of our getting west for a few years, but perhaps you and Jean will be able to take a summer trip east in the near future and we will have an opportunity of seeing you. Very best wishes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRFD:ST\nApril 29, 1952.\n\nReverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa 4, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nI understand that the principal of the Fairbridge Farm School, just outside of Duncan on Vancouver Island, will soon be released from his duties there due to the closing of that school. I also understand that he is an Anglican. His background, which consists of a number of years teaching in the schools in British Columbia and several years as principal of the Fairbridge Farm School, should make him a very suitable candidate for the principalship of an Indian residential school. He is not an ordained man, and for this reason you may not wish to consider him.\n\nI also know that the Reverend James E. Whittles, Rector of All Saints Church in Vancouver, is interested in Indian school work, and, I believe, would be interested in a principalship of a school if it were offered to him. Mr. Whittles is a personal friend and for that reason I would prefer you to make independent inquiry as to his suitability, if you are looking for someone for one of your residential schools, although I believe he would do a good job. Bishop Gower in Vancouver will, of course, be able to supply you with much information concerning him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. F. Davey,\nAsst. Superintendent of Education\nCOPY\n\nRight Reverend Robert Jefferson,\nB.A., D.D., D.C.L.,\nBishop of Ottawa.\n\nThe Bishop's Office,\n71 Bronson Avenue,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 13th, 1952.\n\nThe Hon. W.E. Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nIn connection with the interview arranged by your Secretary with our Primate, the Most Reverend Dr. Barfoot, for Monday, the 23rd of June, at 11 a.m., I enclose a brief prepared for your consideration on the matters which he desires to take up with you. We thought it would save a great deal of time for you by having this brief in your possession beforehand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) Robert Ottawa\n\nROBERT OTTAWA.\n\nRO/MCS.\n\nD.M.\nPlease let me have detail of each case by Wed. p.m. if possible.\n\nW.E.H.\nRevised Memorandum Re: Problem of admittance to Residential Schools of Indian children of uncertain Religious Affiliation.\n\nThe old Indian Act, in Chapter 98, Section 9, Paragraph 2, stated...\n\n\"Such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required, and no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nDuring the period of the revision of the Indian Act Bill 267 was presented for first reading in Parliament June 7, 1950. Section 118 of Bill 267 - bearing on the subject of this memorandum read....\n\n\"Every child who is required to attend school shall attend such school as the Minister may designate, but no child who is in the care or legal custody of, or whose parent or guardian is a Protestant, shall be assigned to a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices; and no child who is in the care or legal custody of, or whose parent or guardian is a Roman Catholic, shall be assigned to a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nBill 267 was not accepted and so on February 27, 1951 Bill 79 as \"an Act Respecting Indians\" was tabled in Commons. In Bill 79 the section corresponding to 118 of Bill 267 was renumbered as section 117 and changed to read....\n\n\"Every child who is required to attend school shall attend such school as the Minister may designate, but no child whose parent is a Protestant shall be assigned to a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and no child whose parent is a Roman Catholic shall be assigned to a school conducted under Protestant auspices, except by written direction of the parent.\"\n\nIt is evident from a reading of the three quotations immediately above that, in substance, they mean the same; however in 117 of Bill 79 the clause \"except by written direction of the parent\" has been added.\n\nAfter studying Bill 79 the I.S.A. Superintendent wrote Colonel Fortier (Deputy-Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) on March 2, 1951 in part as follows:\n\n.....2\n\"I have gone through the portion headed \"Schools\" and am disappointed to find such a change in the wording of section 117 which corresponds somewhat to section 118 of Bill 267. I think the interpretation of the new section is open to much more misunderstanding than the section in Bill 267. I'm quite sure it will only add confusion when put into practice in the field.\"\n\nThe Deputy Minister must have discussed the letter with the Honourable Walter Harris (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) as the Superintendent, Indian School Administration, was asked to call on Mr. Harris on 7/3/51 to discuss the section on \"Schools\".\n\nStated briefly the questions discussed are recorded below (q), with the Minister's replies summarized in the (a) sections.\n\nq - 1. Questioned the wisdom of the removal of the words \"or guardian\" from section 118 Bill 267.\n\na - 1. \"Guardian\" was removed because it was felt that a guardian might be of a different religious affiliation from the parent and if the guardian were free to determine the denomination of the school it would add to confusion generally.\n\nq - 2. Questioned who would determine the school to be attended for a child of mixed R.C. and non-R.C. parentage.\n\na - 2. Each questionable case would be decided upon by the Minister or Director after examination of all available facts and circumstances.\n\nq - 3. Questioned wisdom of \"except by written direction of the parent\" section 117, Bill 79.\n\na - 3. This phrase was added chiefly to allow Indian children to attend Indian Day Schools or Provincial Public Schools if accommodation in such was conveniently possible. The Minister gave assurance that where evidence showed that bribery or persuasion by a religious body had been used to influence the parents the written request of the parent would be ignored and the Minister decide where the child would attend school. The Minister also stated that, if evidence was found of using this phrase as a lever in proselytizing the section would be amended.\n\nq - 4. Pointed out that as Section 117 stood in Bill 79 - children might be changed from school to school on the slightest\nprovocation.\n\na - 4. On this point the Minister reiterated his stand that the Minister or Director had the final say and that neither would tolerate any evidence of proselytizing.\n\nWhen Mr. Harris reviewed Bill 79 with a representative group of Indians at an Ottawa meeting the Indians made no protest on any section dealing with \"Education\" save that they all favoured Government Day Schools over Church operated Residential Schools.\n\nEventually Bill 79 was passed through Commons and became \"The Indian Act\" (Statutes of Canada 1951) on September 4th, 1951. Section 117 of Bill 79 was incorporated into the New Indian Act unchanged in any way.\n\nFor years past the Administration has had to face the problem of Church of England children being taken into Roman Catholic Schools. Wherever possible and wherever documentary proof of religious affiliation could be produced the Administration has protested such action and, quite frequently, with success. However since the New Indian Act came into effect the tempo of Church of England pupils being admitted into Roman institutions has accelerated. It is apparent that the Roman authorities feel that all that is required to allow Church of England pupils into their schools is a written statement to that effect from either one or both of the parents. Then too the Romans seem to contend that if either parent of a child is or has been a Roman Catholic they have a claim on the youngster.\n\nThe experience of the I.S.A., over the last few months in particular, is that the Indian Affairs Branch authorities appear to favour the Roman Catholic Church wherever decisions have to be made as to which school a pupil, of disputed religious affiliation, ought to attend.\n\nThe following examples summarize some of I.S.A.'s recent experiences in this connection.....\n\nFort George: Upon receiving intelligence from Principal Shepherd that 10 children, whose respective parents are both Church of England, were enrolled as pupils at the R.C. Residential School, I.S.A. wrote Major Mackay, under date 5/3/51, pointing out that such was inconsistent with the Indian Act. In the same letter Indian Affairs Branch was asked if these particular pupils were grant earners for the R.C. School and if so, why?\nDuring an interview with Major Mackay in his office on 5/10/51 he stated that he had no knowledge of I.S.A. letter of 5/3/51 and Mr. Phelan asserted that he knew nothing of the letter. On 6/10/51 a copy of the letter was posted to Major Mackay.\n\nOn 16/10/51 Mr. Phelan informed that 8 of the 10 children mentioned in I.S.A. letter of 5/3/51 were grant earners at the R.C. School as there was no indication on their application as regards religious affiliation.\n\nLater investigation showed they were recorded as \"Christian\".\n\nBishop Marsh took up this matter with Colonel Fortier on 17/10/51 and Colonel Fortier stated to the Bishop that the matter would be corrected and the children taken from the R.C. School.\n\nOn 21/12/51 Colonel Fortier informed I.S.A. that their office had no definite proof that the children under discussion were Church of England and that Indian Affairs Branch was writing their agent on the subject. (The information as to children's religious affiliation on file by I.S.A. is copied from the parish register at Fort George.) (Note the time between dates - during which time I.A.B. apparently made no attempt to find out religious affiliation of pupils concerned.)\n\nOn 10/1/52 Canon Shepherd gave the names of 9 children of Church of England parentage, at that time, in the R.C. School at Fort George. The list did not correspond with the former list as supplied by the Canon which gave evidence that there was a rotation of Church of England pupils into the R.C. School.\n\nOn January 15/52 Bishop March and I.S.A. Superintendent again visited Colonel Fortier, Major Mackay and Mr. Phelan and discussed the problem. At this meeting Mr. Phelan informed that 5 of the children mentioned in I.S.A. letter of 5/3/51 were still in the R.C. School. He did not state how many other Church of England pupils were in the R.C. School but Canon Shepherd's letter gives the names of 4 over and above the 5 mentioned by Mr. Phelan. A copy of I.S.A. letter to Major Mackay on this phase of the matter is quoted below.\n\nFebruary 7, 1952.\n\nMajor D. Mackay,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay: Re: C. of E. Pupils in R.C. School\nFort George, P.Q.\nYou might recall that when Mr. Phelan and yourself, Bishop Marsh and I met in Mr. Fortier's office about mid January we were told, on information submitted to Mr. Phelan, that there were five C. of E. children, mentioned on the first list (no information was given on how many more), in the R.C. School at Fort George.\n\nThis does not reconcile with our latest intelligence from Principal Shepherd who submits the names and information regarding nine children currently in the R.C. School. For your information the data is appended to this letter.\n\nIn reference to the list of nine children Principal Shepherd states \"you will notice that the list has changed quite a bit from that submitted a year ago. A good few of the children have been taken out, but some others have been put in.\" Further in respect to the five children admitted by Mr. Phelan to be in the R.C. School the Principal writes \"We could not take these children into our school before next summer. We are full to the roof now and never know when to expect children back from the Moose San. Several have come back to us already. We could take them in next summer but it would mean turning away some of the children at present in our school\".\n\nThe last statement of Principal Shepherd's bespeaks a situation which I think ought to be the immediate concern of Indian Affairs Branch. Lack of accommodation at a Non-Roman school is thus making it possible for a Roman School (in an area where they have no adherents, or perhaps a relatively few imported adherents) to take in C. of E. pupils as grant earners. This is contrary to the Indian Act, as I'm sure you'll agree.\n\nPrincipal Shepherd also states that when Mr. Mingay visited the Roman School it was found that the R.C. School authorities had signed statements from the parents for all Protestant children in their school. On the 7th of March 1951 I called on the Honourable Mr. Harris in connection with my letter addressed to Colonel Fortier dated March 2, 1951 which had to do with the proper interpretation of section 117 Bill 79 (now section 117 of the Indian Act proclaimed September 4, 1951). In reference to the last clause of 117 \"except by written direction of the parent\" Mr. Harris assured that in such cases the final decision rested with the Director or the Minister and if evidence was found of using this phrase as a lever in proselytizing the section would be amended. I contend that the Roman School is using the stay of the C. of E. pupils within their school for proselytizing purposes and that Indian Affairs Branch,\nin thus allowing the practice to continue, is acting contrary to\nthe spirit of the new Indian Act.\n\nI understand that Mr. Mingay is not in the Ottawa Office\nat the time of this writing but as soon as he is available I would\nappreciate having a discussion with you and Mr. Mingay on this whole\nquestion. A copy of this letter is being forwarded Bishop Marsh who\nis vitally concerned with what is going on at Fort George.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\n\nAt the last meeting (15/1/52) with Colonel Fortier Bishop\nMarsh and the Superintendent I.S.A. agreed that, as St. Philip's\nChurch of England School had accommodation for no more children\nit would be unjust if we insisted on their dismissal from the R.C.\nSchool before the end of the term.\n\nIn relation to this whole question Colonel Fortier wrote\nBishop Marsh under date 12/2/52 as follows:\n\n\"With regard to the children of Anglican faith enrolled at the\nFort George Roman Catholic School, I will give this matter\nfurther attention when I receive Canon Cook's report.\"\n\nI.S.A. letter of February 7/52 is Canon Cook's \"report\" and\nat the time of this writing nothing further has been heard from\nColonel Fortier.\n\nOn February 29, 1952 I.S.A. officials met with Major Mackay\nand Mr. Phelan and among other matters discussed was this one on\nthe Fort George pupils. No further progress was made at this\nmeeting, however.\n\nNOTE: What has to be watched in this case is, that while I.A.B.\nthrough the Deputy-Minister has stated his willingness to\ndismiss Church of England children from R.C. Schools after\nwe've reported them in as pupils there is nothing to prevent\nadmission of a new batch each term. Mail communication with\nFort George is slow and the children could be pupils in the\nR.C. School months before I.S.A. Ottawa Office hears about it.\n\nCarcross: On August 24, 1951 properly made out applications (with\nsignatures witnessed by a Commissioner for taking oaths\nin and for the Yukon Territory) accompanied by an affidavit (also\nduly witnessed) signed by the father that he wanted his children brought up in the Church of England faith and to attend Chootla School, Carcross, were mailed to the Stikine Indian Agent covering the entrance of Albert James; Paddy James; and Jimmy James into the Chootla School as residential pupils.\n\nOn October 20, 1951 Mr. Phelan wrote Agency Superintendent Meek of Whitehorse as follows:\n\n\"It has been brought to our attention that these children (James children) are of the R.C. faith and as their admission has not been approved we are deleting their names from the Return. Should the Department approve their admission you will be advised and the Principal will be able to enter their names on future returns.\"\n\nOn 26/12/51 I.S.A. wrote I.A.B. asking its decision on the James children and also asked if a former pupil of Chootla (Elisabeth Johnson of Teslin) was now a pupil at the R.C. Lower Post School as we'd heard that she was. No reply was received from I.A.B.\n\nOn 13/2/52 I.S.A. again wrote I.A.B. Ottawa the same request for information pointing out that the proper formalities had been observed in accordance with the Indian Act for their admission to the School.\n\nOn 12/3/52 the following reply was received over Director Mackay's signature: (note again the tardiness of I.A.B. replies)\n\n\"With reference to the James children who are in the Carcross Indian Residential School, it has been ruled in this case as follows:\n\n'Applicant being Roman Catholic children should attend Roman Catholic School.'\n\nWe are instructing Superintendent Meek to return these children to their parents at the end of the present academic year and he has been requested to have the Principal of the Carcross School claim grant on the March Quarterly Return for these children from the date they entered the School.\"\n\nAt the time of writing this memorandum the James children are still in the Chootla School.\n\nI.S.A. Head Office has on file the original of the following statement in connection with the James children.\n\"Statement of George and Lucy James of Carcross in the Yukon Territory\n\nIt is our full wish and intention that upon the arrival of a Bishop of the Church of England in Canada, to renounce our allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church and to become members of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nIt is also our wish that our children be nurtured in the teachings of the Church of England in Canada. It is our wish that they attend the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThis statement is made of our own free-will and has not been brought about by any coercion of any kind.\n\nThis we do solemnly swear.\n\nDate Carcross Y.T. Feb. 26, 1952 Signed Mr. George X. James (Mr. George James)\nSigned Mrs. Lucy X. James (Mrs. Lucy James)\n\n\"...C.T. Stanger...\"\n(Rev. C.T. Stanger)\nOrdained Priest of the Church of England in Canada\"\n\nUnder circumstances similar to the admittance of the James children another pupil \"Kenneth Johnson\" was admitted to the Choctaw Residential School in September 7, 1951. On February 19, 1952 Superintendent Meek wrote Principal Stanger of Choctaw as follows:\n\n\"Just received your letter with the application forms for Kenneth Johnson. At the same time I have a letter from Mr. Phelan concerning this boy noting that he previously attended the Whitehorse Indian School.\n\nThe letter states 'We are not clear why he should be admitted to the Carcross Residential School. Furthermore, even if there was a necessity for admitting him to the Carcross School his admission could not be approved due to the fact that he is an R.C. He could be admitted to the Lower Post School provided the need for institutional care exists. It is noted that his...\"\nname is entered on the Carcross return. In view of the fact that his admission to this school has not been approved his name will be deleted from future returns and no grant will be allowed. Please advise the Principal in this regard. In the meantime, this pupil should be taken out of the Carcross School.\n\nI will admit this is somewhat confusing as identical cases of Protestant children attending the Lower Post School are on file here. My only comment is that these are instructions from the Department.\"\n\nQueerly enough a brother of Kenneth (Jerry Johnson) has been a pupil at Chocoutla for nearly 2 years and no action has been taken.\n\nUnder date April 16, 1952 Principal Stanger wrote I.S.A. Head Office regarding Kenneth Johnson as follows.....\n\n\"I received a letter from Mr. Meek (Agency Superintendent) quoting from a letter from Mr. Phelan. The quotation is.... 'we have carefully reviewed the correspondence on this case and the department's ruling is that in view of the fact that his religious denomination is Roman Catholic his admission to the Carcross Indian Residential School is denied'.\n\nMr. Meek went on to say that he has been instructed that Kenneth must not be included in the March Quarterly Return and that he is to inform the parents that if they wish Kenneth to be placed in a Residential School the Department will consider an application for the Lower Post School, but under no circumstances can he be placed in the Carcross School.\"\n\nOne wonders why, in the light of information contained, in Mr. Meek's letter to Mr. Stanger quoted above, no grant can be claimed for the Johnson boy.\n\nIn connection with this case I.S.A. Ottawa Office has on file the original of the following statement made by Mr. Dan Johnson:\n\n\"Statement of Dan Johnson of Carcross in the Yukon Territory\n\nIt is my full wish and intention that upon the arrival of a Bishop of the Church of England in Canada, to renounce my allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church and to become a member of the Church of England in Canada.\"\nIt is also my wish that my children be nurtured in the teachings of the Church of England in Canada. It is my wish that they attend the Carcross Indian Residential School.\n\nThis statement is made of my own free-will and has not been brought about by any coercion of any kind.\n\nThis I do solemnly swear.\n\nDate: Carcross, Y.T., Feb. 26, 1952\n\nSigned Dan Johnson\n(Mr. Dan Johnson)\n\nWitnessed -\n\nMatthew Watson\n(Mr. Matthew Watson)\nCommissioner of Oaths,\nCarcross, Yukon Territory.\n\nC.T. Stanger\n(Rev. C.T. Stanger)\nOrdained Priest of the Church of England in Canada.\"\n\nStill another case exists in the Yukon in connection with a Church of England lad named \"Clyde Blackjack\".\n\nThe story behind this case, (on information gleaned from various sources roughly, is as follows - Bishop Coudert (R.C. Bishop of Yukon) apparently wrote Indian Affairs that as Clyde aged 14 years of Carmacks had no family to look after him he ought to be sent to the Lower Post School. Mr. Phelan instructed Mr. Meek to admit the boy to Lower Post if the case warranted his being taken care of in an institution. As the lad lives at Carmacks with an uncle and as Mr. Meek was unable to go to Carmacks for quite a time after Mr. Phelan's letter no action was taken. However during the time of no action the J.P. from Carmacks wired Mr. Meek asking if the boy Clyde could be put into either Mr. Lee's or the Carcross Schools as he was Anglican. Mr. Meek - in light of Bishop Coudert's letter - thought it wise to check religion and was assured by the uncle of Clyde - Clyde's older brother who is a patient in Whitehorse hospital, and the Indian census that Clyde was Anglican. This was explained by Mr. Meek in a letter to Mr. Phelan - giving quotes of telegrams between Carmacks and Whitehorse on the subject. Mr. Phelan apparently instructed that the lad was to be entered at Lower Post and admission forms forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nThe I.S.A. Superintendent asked Archdeacon Clough (Chaplain at Camell Hospital, Edmonton) to see Mrs. BlackJack about this matter and he was able to procure the following statement.\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital\nEdmonton, March 17th, 1952.\n\nTo:\nRev. H.G. Cook\nIndian School Administration,\nMSCC. 102 Bank Street, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Cook:\n\nThis is to state that my son Clyde Blackjack of Carmacks B.C. is by Religion a member of the Church of England in Canada, and I want him to attend the Church of England School at Carcross.\n\nSigned: Bessie J. Blackjack\n\nWitness: C.F.A. Clough\n\nArchdeacon Chaplain\n\nArchdeacon Clough's covering letter is also of interest -\n\nChaplains Office\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital\nEdmonton\n\n17.3.52\n\nDear Canon:\n\nEnclosed I hope is what you want. Bessie is on the list as being R.C. and whilst I have spoken to her since the other three in her ward are my people, I have played the game, treating her as one of Father Rheumas people. I find also that Dolly, Sally and Stanley are her children and all are down as being R.C. This I gather is because the Father was R.C. Those here in charge of the Admissions are all R.C. and I have to be ever on the lookout. I wish the Clergy wherever they come from would drop a line as do the men in the arctic telling me of the coming of their people.\n\nI will see you Wednesday.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) C.F.A. Clough\nArchdeacon\nOn March 31, 1952 Principal Stanger wrote I.S.A. Ottawa as follows:\n\n\"I visited Roddy Blackjack, older brother and guardian of Clyde. Roddy is in the Whitehorse General Hospital. He stated that he wished Clyde to attend Carcross School. I advised him not to sign any papers that the R.C.'s might produce.\n\nI returned to visit him two weeks later. The R.C.'s had been to visit him with applications for Clyde's admission to Lower Post. He had signed them in full knowledge of what they were. Clyde is now at Lower Post.\"\n\nIn the case of Clyde Blackjack Indian Affairs Branch, apparently, has accepted a statement from a \"guardian\" which word was deliberately removed from the new Indian Act section dealing with admittance of children to a school. By section 117 the \"parent\" has to sign such papers and we hold Mrs. Blackjack's (the Mother's) statement as quoted above.\n\nNorthern Saskatchewan: When John James Dreaver and George Dreaver were admitted as pupils to the Prince Albert Indian School, Prince Albert (Lac la Ronge School in Indian Affairs correspondence) a declaration, signed by the mother stating that she wished her sons to attend Prince Albert Indian School, accompanied the application forms. The father, William Dreaver, is Church of England and the mother, Lillian Dreaver, is R.C. They live on the Water Hen Reserve.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa was asked why no grant was paid for these pupils and on March 10, 1952, the following reply was received:\n\n\"With reference to the Dreaver children attending the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, the following ruling has been made:\n\n'Applicant being Roman Catholic children should attend Roman Catholic School.'\n\nIn view of the ruling, we have instructed Superintendent Jones to arrange for the discharge of these children, at the end of the present academic year and to ask the Principal of the Lac la Ronge School to show them on the next quarterly return claiming per capita grant from the date the children entered the Lac la Ronge School.\"\nNote: - Despite the father being Church of England and the mother declaring she wishes her sons to go to a Church of England School Indian Affairs Branch rules as above.\n\nArchdeacon Paul brought the following situation to the attention of I.S.A. Superintendent.\n\nTwo Church of England Indian families live too far from a Day School for their children to be day pupils and the youngsters are now pupils in St. Anthony's R.C. Residential School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan. The children in question are:\n\nAnnie & Dora, children of Frank Heather - both parents Church of England.\nRose and Roy Dillon, children of Chief Ernest Dillon - both parents Church of England.\n\nArchdeacon Paul wrote J.A. Davis, Superintendent of Indian Affairs Branch Meadow Lake Agency, pointing out the fact that these were Church of England children and ought not to be in the R.C. School. The following is a quote from Mr. Davis' reply:\n\n\"Referring to Anglican children attending the R.C. Indian School #659 and your statement that this is contrary to the Indian Act. If you will note in section 117 it states \"Except by written permission of the parents\" and in this case it was the parents who decided to send their Protestant children to the R.C. institution.\"\n\nNote: - the above shows just how inconsistent Indian Affairs Branch is in interpreting the Indian Act.\n\nJames Bay: - In discussion with Suffragan-Bishop Clarke of Moosonee the Superintendent I.S.A. learned that on March 28, 1952 the Bishop wired Mr. Phelan questioning the admittance of Church of England pupils to the R.C. Residential School in Albany. The children in question are Frederick George and Bertie Andrew, sons of Joel Wesley, Albany.\n\nBy April 7, 1952 Bishop Clarke had received no acknowledgment of his wire.\n\nOld Sun School: - The situation as regards the movement of pupils from one school to the other on the Blackfoot Reserve has been a source of concern to I.S.A. for years past. A long and complicated exchange of correspondence between the Principal, I.S.A. and I.A.B. on the various aspects of the different...\ncases are on file in the I.A.B. Head Office Ottawa. Some parents have signed declarations asking that their children go to one school or the other and have later written letters to the effect that they want their children to go to another school. Such action on the part of the Indian parents bespeaks unethical methods of persuasion on the part of the R.C. missionary priests of whom three are active on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nThe following letters from Mr. Phelan to the Blackfoot Agency Superintendent will however show that Indian Affairs Branch definitely favours the Roman cause by using the religion of whichever parent is R.C., as support for authorizing the entrance of the respective children to the R.C. School:\n\nOttawa, February 29, 1952.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nFloyd Royal,\nRamona Royal,\nFrancis Royal,\nPhyllis Mayfield,\nBert Mayfield\nWalter Mayfield\n\nThe request for the admission of the above-mentioned children to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School has been received and carefully considered.\n\nThe following ruling has been made:\n\n\"The mother being the responsible parent is Roman Catholic. Children should attend Roman Catholic School.\"\n\nIn view of the above ruling, the Department approves the admission of the children to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School as grantearing pupils from the date they entered the School.\n\nPlease advise the Principal in this regard and advise this office when the children entered the school.\n\n(sgd)\nD.

McKay\nDirector\n\nCopies:\n\nMr. Gooderham\nRev. Cole\nFather Charron\nTo add confusion to the case Principal Cole of the Church of England Old Sun School reported to Ottawa I.S.A. Office on 4/3/52 that the following pupils had been transferred to the Crowfoot R.C. School as of 1/4/52:\n\nDavid Yellowhorse - admitted to Old Sun 1-9-46\nPercy Yellowhorse - \" \" \" \" 25-9-48\nMarie Yellowhorse - \" \" \" \" 4-9-50\nSylvia Yellowhorse - \" \" \" \" 1-2-50\nPhyllis Mayfield - \" \" \" \" 1-10-43\nBert Mayfield - \" \" \" \" 15-3-48\n\nThe following children who had not returned to Old Sun on September 1, 1951 were authorized for transfer to Crowfoot R.C. Schools:\n\nFloyd Royal - admitted to Old Sun 1-9-46\nRomans Royal - \" \" \" \" 25-9-48\nEddie Wolfchild - \" \" \" \" 1-11-47\n\nIn view of Major Mackay's assertion of February 29, 1952, that no children would be removed from any school until the conclusion of the academic year I.S.A. 'phoned the information of Mr. Cole's letter to Major Mackay on April 5, 1952 and questioned the action that had taken place on the Blackfoot. The Director knew nothing of the situation and said he'd consult Mr. Phelan. Later in the day Mr. Phelan 'phoned asking for the names of the pupils involved and said he'd check. On April 7th Mr. Phelan again 'phoned to state the following wire had been sent to Agency Superintendent Pugh:\n\nOttawa, April 5, 1952\n\nMr. W.P.R. Pugh\nIndian Superintendent\nGleichen Alberta\n\nDEPARTMENT INFORMED THAT PERCY YELLOW HORSE MARIE YELLOW HORSE DAVID YELLOW HORSE SYLVIA YELLOW HORSE PHYLLIS MAYFIELD AND BERT MAYFIELD WERE ATTENDING OLD SUN'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AT TIME YOU RECEIVED OFFICIAL LETTERS DATED FEBRUARY 29th -stop- EVIDENTLY OUR LETTER WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR BECAUSE WHILE IT WAS RULED THAT THESE CHILDREN SHOULD SUBSEQUENTLY ATTEND A SCHOOL CONDUCTED UNDER ROMAN CATHOLIC AUSPICES IT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION THAT THEY SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE SCHOOL THEY WERE ATTENDING DURING THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR -stop- THEREFORE THE SIX CHILDREN MENTIONED SHOULD REMAIN IN THE OLD SUN'S SCHOOL TO THE END OF JUNE 1952 AND CAN BE ENROLLED IN CROWFOOT SCHOOL FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 1952-53\n\n(signed) D.M. McKay\nD.M. McKay\nDirector\n\nApparently Ottawa I.A.B. Head Office is trying to lay the blame for the removal of the pupils from Old Sun to Crowfoot on the Agency Superintendent though the instructions in the communications (quoted above) of February 29 are perfectly clear.\n\nOn May 2, 1952 Mr. Phelan wrote Mr. Pugh (with copy to Old Sun School) \"With reference to the Yellowhorse children...\"\nit is presumed that these children are back in the Old Sun School.\n\nIn reference to the Yellowhorse children Principal Cole wrote I.S.A. Ottawa office under date May 11, 1952 -\n\n\"Ever since Mr. Phelan gave the \"go sign\" to the Principal of the Crowfoot School to take the children the Yellowhorses simply have not been in School (the R.C. School). They positively refuse to stay in the R.C. School.\"\n\nOn May 13 Principal Cole wired Ottawa I.S.A. Office -\n\n\"DAVID YELLOWHORSE RETURNED SCHOOL THIS DATE PERCY YELLOWHORSE COMPOUND FRACTURE CALGARY HOSPITAL\"\n\nBy all accounts it appears the Yellowhorse boys ran away from Crowfoot (R.C.) School to Calgary. Fr. Charron apparently was unsuccessful in getting them back to Crowfoot and Percy was run over by a taxi as he was sleeping in a Calgary back lane.\n\nOn May 22, 1952 I.S.A. Head Office received the following information from Principal Cole -\n\n\"Marie and Sylvia Yellowhorse returned to this School 5 p.m. 17-5-52.\n\nPhyllis & Bert Nelson Mayfield have not returned as of 11 a.m. 18-5-52\"\n\nThis information was passed on to Indian Affairs Head Office by 'phone (May 22) with the request that early action be taken to return the other children to Old Sun School. Major Mackay and Mr. Phelan were not up to date on the situation and stated communication would be made with the Agent.\n\nOn May 26, 1952 Mr. Davey 'phoned to say -\n\n\"Mr. Pugh had advised that Mrs. Mayfield was to bring Phyllis and Bert to Old Sun on May 26th.\"\n\nOn June 2, 1952 the following letter concerning the whereabouts of the Blackfoot children mentioned above was received from Principal (letter written 31-5-52) -\n\n\"Yellowhorse, David.) In residence Old Sun School,\nPercy.) with the exception of Percy who is\nMarie.) hospitalized at this Blackfoot hos-\nSylvia.) pital with broken legs.\n\nMayfield, Phyllis) Not returned to\nBert Nelson) Old Sun School.\nWalter\n\nWolfchild, Edward) At Crowfoot Indian School.\nTurning Robe, George) In residence Old Sun School.\"\nIncidentally both the letters of February 29th were typed and bear the date of the meeting (mentioned in section Fort George of the memorandum) of the Superintendent and General Turner and Major Mackay and Mr. Phelan. The copy of letter which the Superintendent saw in the Yukon, i.e., the James children, as coming from Indian Affairs Branch Ottawa Office also carried the date February 29th. The meeting in Major Mackay's office was held during the afternoon of February 29, 1952, at which time Major Mackay informed the I.S.A. delegation that a decision on all the disputed children would be made soon. The date on the letters indicate that at the time of the meeting the decision had been reached. The assumption is that Major Mackay and Mr. Phelan were loath to discuss the decision.\n\nSpecial Grants: Each year Indian Affairs Branch makes special grants to Church-owned Schools towards repairs, equipment and maintenance. These expenditures are recorded, by schools, in the annual auditor general's report \"Public Accounts of Canada\". For the past three years the following figures are given:\n\n1949 Special Grant to 6 C. of E.-owned Schools = $5,142.72\n1949 Special Grant to 19 R.C.-owned Schools = $42,659.01\n\n1950 Special Grant to 5 C. of E.-owned Schools = $3,451.06\n1950 Special Grant to 18 R.C.-owned Schools = $55,870.50\n\n1951 Special Grant to 5 C. of E.-owned Schools = $1,866.99\n1951 Special Grant to 17 R.C.-owned Schools = $39,844.76\n\nBroken down on a per pupil basis (for the schools receiving the special grant) the figures reveal (in dollars):\n\n1949 - C. of E. schools received $12.00 per pupil.\n1949 - R.C. schools received $19.00 per pupil.\nC. of E. Schools received 65% of that allotted to R.C. Schools\n\n1950 - C. of E. Schools received $10.00 per pupil.\n1950 - R.C. Schools received $27.00 per pupil.\nC. of E. Schools received 38% of that allotted to R.C. Schools.\n\n1951 - C. of E. Schools received $5.00 per pupil.\n1951 - R.C. Schools received $20.00 per pupil.\nC. of E. Schools received 25% of that allotted to R.C. Schools.\n\nIn August of 1950 I.S.A. brought the 1949 figures to the attention of Indian Affairs Branch but no satisfactory reply was received as to why the R.C. Schools were favoured in the allocation of special grant expenditures. Since then, as the figures show, the expenditure of the special grant, increasingly, has been in favour of the R.C.-owned Schools.\n\nThere is, on file in I.S.A. Head Office, record of other incidents, where the action of Indian Affairs Branch appears to\nfavour the Roman Cause. Enough material however is given above to show against the odds the I.S.A. and our Indian missionaries are working.\n\nOf vital concern to the I.S.A. is an understanding with government on the interpretation of section 117 of the New Indian Act. Is government to practice the policy of the Roman Church and claim that a child, either of whose parents is Roman or whose guardian is Roman, is, in turn, Roman Catholic despite statements signed by the parents to the contrary? Is the religion of the father or that of the mother to determine the religion of the child? Indian Affairs appears to choose in favour of whichever parent is R.C. In out-of-the-way-areas is the Roman Church allowed to take in obviously Church of England pupils and retain them until the Church of England protests? Answers, by the Minister, to these questions to all concerned are of vital importance to the Indian School Administration.\n\nThe I.S.A. recommends that the Minister be requested to review, in the light of Section 117 as interpreted by him, the specific cases outlined in the foregoing pages and to notify the M.S.C.C. of his decisions.\n\nHenry G.
