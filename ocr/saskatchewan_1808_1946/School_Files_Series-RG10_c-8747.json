He also forwarded a copy of a letter from Indian Agent Moore asking that surplus funds be expended on the purchase of 30 bags of cement to line a well on the Indian Reserve No 2 to be dug by certain Indians and lined by them, and the purchase and installation of a new pump and well cover at Tsarlip Indian Day School. The cost of cement at Saanich Reserves is $1.35 per bag and the estimated cost of pump and well cover is given by Mr. Moore as $50.00.\n\nThere is available in 71-60-119 an amount of $53.33 provided for work at Morley which will not be undertaken and enough of this can be transferred to 71-60-152 to enable either one of these items to be undertaken. If this transfer is approved, it is recommended that Mr. Webb be authorized to consult Mr. Indian Commissioner MacKay and to undertake whichever one of the two items is considered to be the more important, as the funds available are not sufficient for both. An early decision will be appreciated as the work, if undertaken, will have to be done this month.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer T.S. Mills.\n\nNote: Surveys and Engineering have been instructed to purchase the 30 bags of cement for the well on Saanich No 2 Reserve.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Brentwood Bay Stores\nAddress: Saanichion, B.C.\n\nAuthority No.: 152-14-5\nDate: Nov. 13th, 1940\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Laundry Soap for Tsartlip Indian Day School | .05 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nVoucher No.: 1064\nDate: March 15th, 1941\n\nIndian Affairs.

File No. 152-14-5 wherein you were good enough to authorise the purchase of cocoa, milk and sugar for the pupils of the Tsartlip Indian Day School to an amount not to exceed $3.00 per month as from November 15th until March 31st, to be used to augment the midday lunch of these children.\n\nI would ask the Department to be good enough to continue this service again this year because it worked out quite well during last winter, and according to the report of the Teacher, it was \"a decided factor towards keeping the children healthy and contributed to their regular attendance at school\".\n\nI feel that if it helps the health of the children at all and encourages their attendance at school it will be money well spent. The total expenditure for the season will not exceed $15.00. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant an amount of $15.00 may be expended during the current academic year for the purchase of supplies to serve a midday meal at the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The Sister in charge, (Sister Maureen Regan) has done an excellent job in the short time she has been there and the attendance\u2014even at this early date\u2014has been much higher than at any time during the past year. I feel extremely confident that the future of the school is most promising and since I came here I never found the children so clean, attentive, well managed and happy as they were the day I visited. Altogether, I believe that\u2014insofar as this school is concerned\u2014the Department made a wise move to engage the Sister, particularly one so well qualified as Sister Maureen Regan is. This particular school, pupils and teachers alike, have been a headache to me for years and I really feel now that we will make progress. In my opinion at least the teacher deserves every encouragement from the Department and so far as I personally am concerned, I intend to go out of my way to help her in every way I possibly can.\n\n(R.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6409, file 839-5, part 3)\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver,\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted and further to mine of the 3rd. instant, I beg to attach hereto, in duplicate, a list of materials required for the proposed building for use at the Tsartlip school as a storeroom and toilet.\n\nYou will please note that the total cost will amount to $83.59 inclusive of a charge of $36.00 for labor in erection, which is at the rate of $6.00 per day. This building is urgently needed and I would recommend that the authority be granted as soon as possible.\n\nThe attendance at this school has been 100% since the day it opened and the children are as happy and contented as the flowers in June, all of which goes to show that if they like the teacher they will attend. I certainly feel that every assistance and encouragement should be given to this school and the Teacher as she is doing a grand job of work there.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nI wish to advise that I have just returned from a visit to the Tsartlip Indian Day School and met the Reverend Sister Maureen Regan and her co-teacher Reverend Sister Elizabeth Ann. It appears that there will be two teachers there in fact, while officially just one. The latter sister is teaching the primary class, using the entrance hall as a class room. This hall is the only store room we have in this school and it is piled up with garden and manual training supplies and tools, paper towels, toilet paper, janitor's brushes and supplies, school supplies and other impediments such as wash basins, pails etc. etc. all of which will show you how unsuitable it is for a class room. I should mention that it is only during certain subjects that the hall is being used, the rest of the time the pupils are in the class room with the other pupils.\n\nI found that there was an attendance of 16 pupils each day since the school reopened and I have never seen the children so happy, clean and well behaved since I first visited that school and never found so large an attendance on any one day during the past year. My first impression of the Teachers is particularly good and I feel extremely confident of what the future of this school holds for the pupils and the Department regarding increased benefits. These two teachers appear particularly well qualified and seem to have the knack of handling children, although this is their first attempt at teaching Indians.\n\nSister Regan asked me about a separate toilet for the teachers and a small storeroom for the supplies at present piled in the hall of the school building, and I feel that the request should receive favourable consideration.\n\nI wish to recommend that we erect a small building approximately 9 feet long, 6 feet wide and 7 feet high with a shed roof, which would act as a combined storeroom and toilet with a partition between them and which could be put up near the small woodshed and kept locked. No windows would be required, other than a small ventilator on the toilet side, and three ply roofing could be used instead of shingles. I think a building such as this could be put up for approximately $70.00 including the labor. If this recommendation receives favourable consideration by you I can get particulars of materials and labor costs. Please understand that this expenditure could not have been foreseen as the appointment of Sister Maureen Regan was not anticipated when estimates were submitted.\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letters of the 3rd and 24th ultimo requesting authority to expend $83.59 for the provision of a building for use as a store room and outbuilding at Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that while the Department approved of the appointment of Sister Maureen Regan as teacher of the school, that she is accompanied by Sister Elizabeth Ann which appears to be, in part, the reason for the provision of this building in order that the small store room in the school can be used as an extra classroom.\n\nIn view of Mr. Moore's recommendation, I would recommend approval of the application if funds could be provided for this purpose. If the expenditure is approved, I would request advice in the matter by air mail as the uncertain state of the lumber market makes it imperative to accept quotations as early as possible if price changes are to be avoided.\n\nD.M.

While in the Cowichan\nAgency recently I called at this little school and was\ngratified to find thirty pupils present out of an enrollment\nof thirty-four. Much credit is due to the new teacher, Sister\nMaureen Regan, for the increased attendance and the keen interest\nbeing displayed by the Indian parents in the school.\n\nThe school is much too small for present and future\nrequirements and should be replaced by a new school as soon as\nfunds can be provided. Provision was made for this purpose in\nthe post-war program of new construction submitted to the\nDepartment some time ago. In the meantime, it is suggested that\nlong desks be constructed at the back of the classroom to accom-\nmodate six to eight pupils now sharing single desks with other\npupils, the available space being too small for eight complete\nsingle desks. A quotation on what is required is enclosed,\ntogether with copy of a covering letter from Mr. Indian Agent\nMoore. The cost seems high but is in line with prevailing rates\nboth for material and labour. It would be preferable, of course,\nto furnish new regulation desks but in addition to lack of space\nto accommodate them supplies are not available, at least in this\nProvince.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that construction\nof the desks required be approved.\n\nD.M.

These extra pupils have put an extra drain on all school supplies and makes a lot more work for the Teacher who finds that she needs a duplicator for getting out the work for the various classes as she has not got the time to put the work for each class on the board, nor in fact has she got the board space. I would therefore recommend that this be supplied.\n\nThe other requisition is for general supplies and it is noted that the prices were got from the Clarke & Stuart Co. catalogue as the only one available, I suppose, to the teacher. However, I think we can get the supplies in Victoria from one of the wholesale house for even less.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1944.\n\nMr. R.H.

If you will refer to the correspondence you will find that no definite authority was ever received for this expenditure by this Office, and I would be obliged to know just what the situation is, because if I am to be responsible I wish something definite.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B. C.\nAugust 25th, 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nWith further reference to the opening of the new class room of the Tsartlip school, I wish to advise that the area on which will be used as a playground for the children and which lies between the Hall and the Church will have to have a coat of gravel on it before the wet weather starts. This particular piece of grounds is quite rough owing to the fact that wheel barrow loads of earth were dumped there and left in heaps, which will mean levelling before the gravel is put on.\n\nThe gravel will cost $1.00 per yard and it will cost another $6.00 to have the ground levelled beforehand. Kindly authorise this expenditure as soon as possible.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letters of the 25th and 30th of August, with reference to the grounds surrounding the church building which is being prepared for use as a second class room at the Tsartlip School. It will be noted that Mr. Moore recommends that the grounds be leveled and graveled at an approximate cost of $21.00.\n\nIn estimating the cost of preparing this building for use as a school room this expenditure was not taken into consideration and consequently was not provided for. Please advise if funds are available for this work.\n\nFor your information I enclose herewith two photos of the building in question.\n\nFor: D. M.

It appears highly desirable that the gravelling should be completed before the start of the wet season.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIn Account With\n\nR.

C.\nApril 7th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to submit herewith an application for a Special Gasoline Category for:\n\nRev. Sister Maureen Regan, Teacher of the Tsartlip Indian Day School who drives back and forth each day to school, a distance of 30 miles. This trip is made 6 days each week. I would recommend that approval be given to this application the same as last year.\n\nDash board Licence slips are attached to both forms and which I would ask you to return as soon as possible.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 10, 1945.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, regarding special gasoline category for Sister Maureen Regan, I am sorry that nothing can be done about this matter as it is not our custom to sign these forms for teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant returning the application for special gasoline category for Rev. Sister Maureen Regan submitted by me under cover of letter of April 7th.\n\nIt would seem as if we are starting all over again this year where we left off last, and in this regard I would respectfully direct your attention to previous correspondence, listed below:\n\nMy letter to Department, March 30th, 1944, with enclosure.\nDr. McGill's letter to me, April 3rd, 1944, File:152-14-5.\nMy letter to Major MacKay, dated April 21st.\nMajor MacKay's letter to Dept., dated April 25th, File:3-11-2.\nDr. McGill's letter to me of May 10th, 1944, File: 152-14-5.\n\nIf you will please refer to the above correspondence you will note why the special category is requested and necessary. The conditions are exactly the same this year as last and I would request that the Department be good enough to give this further consideration, as I don't wish to return the application to the Rev. Sister until I am sure that I can not get assistance from the Department. In closing I would like to point out that every Rural school teacher in this Province who has to use a car to get to and from their school automatically receives a special gasoline category for this purpose, and it would appear as if Sister Maureen is in this class of employment. She has no other means of transportation and there is none available and 30 miles per day is too much to expect her to cycle. The form with dashboard license slip is returned herewith.\n\n(P.H. Moore) Indian Agent.\nApril 10, 1945.\n\nR. H Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nSister Regan's application has been submitted for signature by Mr. Jackson, the certificate having been amended for the purpose.\n\nThis application is not in the category of those that require Mr. Jackson's signature, which comprises only Department cars and trucks, and cars personally owned and operated on a mileage basis by employees. It is obvious that this office is not in possession of any record that would warrant the signing of certificate No. 2.\n\nThe Regional Oil Controller should be informed of this as he is probably under the impression that Sister Regan is one of those for whom it has been arranged that the Chief Executive Assistant would sign certificate No. 2. Any responsible local resident conversant with the facts may sign the certificate which applies to her case, and the Oil Controller will act upon such if he is informed as above.\n\nYour reference to last year's correspondence is noted. At that time the clerk who attends to these matters was in hospital and the matter was efficiently taken care of by his stenographer notwithstanding that she was not familiar with the requirements.\n\nActing Director.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nApril 12, 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nTSARTLIP INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (Senior Room), West Saanich, B.C.\n\nSHIP TO Sister Maureen (Regan), Tsartlip Indian Day School (Senior Room) & (Junior Room)\n\nPurpose for which required: Playground equipment\n\nNOTE:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.

When forwarding these, Indian Agent Moore states that the articles can be obtained locally. If all the articles are purchased from one firm, the total amount of the account will exceed $50.00. In this event, it will be necessary to have your purchase order attached to the account when forwarding it for payment.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. VANCOUVER.\n\nYour File #3-11-12 October 13th, 1944\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted, relative to gasoline for Sister Maureen Regan of the Tsartlip School, I wish to say that I conveyed the information to the Reverend Sister, as set out in your letter and have now received her reply which says in part:\n\n\"With regard to the gasoline question: On April 1, 1944 I applied for gasoline to be used for school purposes during the fiscal year from March 31, 1944 to March 31, 1945. Due to some misunderstanding I was not issued a Ration Coupon Book until the latter part of May. Which book, marked \"Special A\" containing 60 units, and marked \"This is your Final Book\". In the meantime, I was obliged to use for school driving the \"AA\" coupons allowed for ordinary driving.\n\nOur car, being a 1933 model, averages 15 miles per gallon of gasoline. When I applied April 1st, for gasoline, this is how I stood regarding mileage, etc.:\n\nFrom March 1944 - March 1945 ........ 45 school weeks\nMileage @ 25 miles per day ------------ 5,625 miles\nThe latter part of May we were issued 60 units\nMileage on 60 units .......... 2700 miles.\n\nAt present I have on hand 25 units\nMileage on 25 units------------------ 1,125 miles.\nThis year our mileage averages 26 miles per day, due to the fact that the Junior Room is located \u00bd mile from the Senior Room.\n\nI have on hand units enough to last 43 days.\nI might mention that during the latter part of July we taught \"Vacation School\" in Saanichton which necessitated our using the car for that week.\"\nKindly advise further in this regard and see if this Teacher is going to get more gasoline. If she is not, please have the Controllet so advise.\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nDUNCAN, B. G.\nApril 24, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nReferring to previous correspondence relating to the application of Sister Maureen Regan for a Special Gasoline Category, as instructed the form was sent to Ottawa and returned since the Department could not see its way clear to recommend any additional gasoline. On April 16th I again wrote Ottawa (as per copy of letter attached) giving full details and referring to correspondence on the matter with you in 1944. I am now in receipt of a reply (copy also attached) which I trust you will find self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note from my letter that I returned the application form along with the dash-board licence slips, but so far the dash-board slip has not been returned by Ottawa and I am unable to have a new form submitted until this is done.\n\nIn the meantime, the Reverend Sister is in need of gasoline and it occurred to me that you, as Senior Department Official, might sign this application for the Officer of the Oil Controller, or if not then it can be signed, as suggested by the Department, by some local resident. However, it would seem to me that an official of this Department would be in a much better position to state the facts than an outsider, since Sister Maureen Regan is employed by us.\n\nYour comments on the matter will be appreciated.\n\nR.H. MOORE,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 26th, 1945.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq., Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of the 26th instant I would advise that I have asked the Department to airmail you Sister Maureen Regan's Provincial automobile license slip and application.\n\nIn view of the Department's letter of the 19th instant addressed to you on this subject in which it is stated that any local resident conversant with the facts may sign the certificate I do not consider it was intended to place this responsibility on any official of this office. Apparently the automobile is also used for purposes other than those of this Department as in your letter of October 20th, 1944, you quote from the Reverend Sister's letter, \"during the latter part of July we taught 'Vacation School' in Saanichton which necessitated our using the car for that week.\" You will also note that she states in this letter that she is using an old 1933 model car averaging only fifteen miles per gallon and that they are travelling 26 miles a day, return mileage from Victoria to the school.\n\nIn view of the critical shortage of gasoline and rubber, it occurs to me that rather than consume these essentials in a mechanically inefficient vehicle the Rev. Sisters should explore the possibility of securing accommodation in the neighbourhood of the school.\n\nIn any event, I regret that this office is not in a position to meet your request that we endorse the application.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, May 4, 1945.\n\nMr. R. H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 26, addressed to the Indian Commissioner, in connection with the automobile license slip and application of Sister Maureen Regan, for extra gas, our files indicate that both the license slip and the application were returned to you with my letter of April 10.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 152-14-5\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 24th instant and my reply re Sister Maureen Regan's application for a Special Gasoline Category, and also his letter of October 20th, 1944.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly return the application form and Provincial automobile licence slip to him direct by airmail.\n\nFor D.

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nWith reference to the Tsartlip School which is now occupying two rooms, the monthly vouchers for rental should be issued as follows:\n\n1. One voucher for $10.00 in favour of Most Reverend J.C. Cody, Bishop of Victoria, #40 View Street, Victoria, B.C.\n\n2. One voucher for $10.00 issued in favour of Reverend X. Lauzon, Catholic Rectory, Saanichton, British Columbia.\n\nThese payments are effective from September 1st, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of July 30th, 1945, File 152-14-5, it is noted you mention that the Tsartlip School is occupying two rooms and give details of how the vouchers for rental are to be made out.\n\nIn this respect I would point out that while there are two schools at Tsartlip, one is our own building and the other is the church hall, for which latter there has been a monthly charge of $10.00 per month. Over and above these two schools, there is the Saanich Indian Day School on which we previously paid a rental of $10.00 per month, but which has now been increased to $20.00, payable to Most Reverend J. C. Cody.\n\nWould you kindly advise if the rental of the one room at Tsartlip, which is actually the Church Hall, is now $20.00 per month also, or if there has been a misunderstanding and the cheque for $10.00 covering this room should be forwarded to Rev. X. Lauzon.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSamuel B. Brown\n\nfor R.H.

It is understood that the Guardene Fire Extinguishers are the general purpose type and would be suitable for use in Day Schools and I would recommend that authority be granted for an expenditure of $77.50 for the purchase of five extinguishers if funds are available.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Moore in connection with the use of oil for starting fires in Indian Day Schools and warning him against this practice.\n\nFor D.

I have always felt that the one quart size would be just as good at a day school, especially where there are female teachers.

This matter was subsequently discussed with Mr. Moore and it was decided that it would not be economical to cut the two long desks referred to and that it would be preferable to buy eight new desks. These will be available here in February at an approximate cost of $70.00 and if funds are available I would recommend that authority be granted to place the order.\n\nD. H. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDuncan, B.C.\nJanuary 15th, 1946\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Tsartlip I.D. school, junior room, it was brought to my attention that there is a definite shortage of desks. There are 20 pupils in attendance and only accommodation for 15 comfortably, although by putting four pupils in a desk intended for three they can seat 17, which is too crowded.\n\nYou will remember that some of the desks there were made by Mitchell & Anderson and are after the old style of desks where three or four children sit together, this was done to conserve space when we had only the one school on that reserve. Since then we had two of those desks cut in half which is a definite improvement, but there are still two others which should be cut so that we can get the maximum seating capacity out of them. However, even with that we will still have to have 4 #2. desks complete, that is four fronts & four backs. The reason I am asking for size 2 for the junior room is that some of the children in the low grades are big and old enough to be in the senior room but on account of poor, and in some cases no, attendance at school when they came of school age meant no progress.\n\nThese desks should be shipped direct to the following address:\n\nThe Teacher, Tsartlip I.D. School, Jr. Room,\nC/O. The R.C. Rectory,\nWest Road, Saanichton, B.C.,\nas soon as conveniently possible.\n\nI would also ask for authority to have the two long desks cut and made into fours which will entail putting in extra legs at an approximate cost of $15.00.\n\nR.H.

It seems to me that these oil heaters are much more satisfactory for Indian schools, or in fact any one room schools than coal or wood and the cost of operation is certainly no higher.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Deep Bay Public school I noticed that they had one there and the teacher was high in her praise of its efficiency and simplicity of control.\n\nR.

MacKay  \nIndian Commissioner for B.C.  \nPost Office Box 70  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of above date and file number I would say that the price of $67.00 given in my letter of the 13th ultimo was the wholesale price on a smaller heater, which on further investigation was considered too small for the school. The size quoted on here-with has almost twice the heating capacity, but of course is the retail price from Mitchell and Anderson Hardware of Sidney, who will build the platform or stand for the drum of oil and install the stove properly for $123.38 which is less than quoted us by the McDowell Co. in Victoria on a different make of stove of the same size. So far I have not received a written quotation from McDowell, although I have asked for it twice since you were over.\n\nR. H. Moore  \nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 152-14-5\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Nelson's letter of November 17th, 1945, authorizing the purchase of a new heater for the Tsartlip Indian Day School at an approximate cost of $40.00.\n\nWe have been unsuccessful in securing delivery of a suitable heater and Mr. Indian Agent Moore, in his letters of March 15th and April 13th attached, suggests that consideration be given to the installation of a Duo Therm oil heater. It will be noted that Mr. Moore considers that an oil heater would be much more satisfactory for use in Indian Day Schools and that the cost of operation in his Agency would be no more than for coal and wood heaters. The total cost of a suitable Duo Therm oil heater, completely installed, with a 40-gallon drum of fuel oil, would be $123.38, and I would recommend that the Department authorize this expenditure.\n\nD. A. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, April 25, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department approves the purchase of an oil heater for the Tsartlip School, at a cost of $123.38. It is understood that this replaces the authority given in my letter of November 17, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReference your letter above noted I wish to advise that during a recent visit to Visteria I tried to get a suitable wood burning circulating heater for the Tsartlip School but was unable to do so and the stores and wholesalers were unable to give me an approximate date of when they might be expected.\n\nI was wondering how the stock of Gordon and Belyea is and if our chance of getting the heater from them by the end of this month is still good.

The wholesalers in Vancouver hoped to be in a position to supply heaters prior to March 31st, but deliveries have not been made as expected, and consequently the heater in question was not supplied during the last fiscal year. Mr. Indian Agent Moore has suggested consideration be given to the installation of the Duc-Therm oil heater on an approximate cost of $67.00, his letter of March 13th in this connection being enclosed. It will be noted that Mr. Moore considers an oil heater would be much more satisfactory for use in Indian Schools and that the cost of operation in his Agency would be no higher.\n\nI am inclined to agree with these views, but would appreciate the Department's view in the matter.\n\nD.

I would recommend that authority for this be granted as soon as possible.\n\nR. H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDuring my recent visits to the Tsartlip Indian Day School, Senior Room, I have been struck by the efficiency displayed by Sister Elizabeth Marie in teaching sewing and other arts to her pupils. The same thing applies to the Saanich Indian Day School which is being taught by Sister Socorro. These Sisters are most interested in trying to get the pupils to make their own clothes and have requested that this Department be good enough to supply a sewing machine for each of the two schools (Tsartlip Senior and Saanich Indian Day Schools). I would recommend that the Department procure these machines and have them shipped direct to the schools concerned the addresses of which follow:\n\nTeacher  \nSaanich Indian Day School  \nSaanich I.R. #2  \nSaanichton, B.C.\n\nTeacher  \nTsartlip Indian Day School - Senior Room  \nSaanich I.R. #1  \nBrentwood Bay, B.C.\n\nI am arranging to send some old Army and Airforce clothing which I have on hand, down to these schools so that the teachers may instruct their pupils in remodelling them for their own use. Trusting that you may give this request favourable consideration.\n\nR. H. Moore  \nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B.C.\nOctober 17th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPost Office Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThis is to advise that I have made arrangements with Joe Bartleman of the Saanich #1 Reserve to plow a garden plot at the Tsartlip Indian Day School as well as slash and grub approximately 1\u00bd acres of land adjoining the school which is to be used for a playground and basketball court. I estimate that the sum of $45.00 will be required to pay Bartleman for this work and I would ask that you be good enough to give me the necessary authority as soon as possible. As a matter of fact he has already plowed the garden as I wanted it done before the weather broke.\n\nR. H. Moore\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of October 17th in connection with a proposed expenditure of $45.00 for clearing land adjoining the Tsartlip Indian Day School building to provide a suitable playground and basketball court, and for plowing the school garden.\n\nI may say that this school building is more or less surrounded by brush, a condition which is not desirable, and I would recommend approval of the expenditure requested.\n\nD.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 152-14-5 (W.T.L)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of October 21st authorizing an expenditure of $24.82 for the construction of a basketball court at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of February 25th wherein he requests that a further expenditure of $50.00 be authorized for levelling the basketball court.\n\nMr. Moore's letter indicates that if the work is to be done it would be advisable to take advantage of the services of Mr. J.D. Kissinger who is working with a bulldozer in the vicinity, and if funds are available I would recommend that Mr. Moore be authorized to have the work done.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nYou will please remember that you authorized some months ago certain materials and labor charges in connection with the erection of a Basketball Court at the Tsartlip Senior School. The backboards, baskets, etc., have all been put in but owing to the rather rough ground, it is difficult, and in fact dangerous for the pupils to play there due to the unevenness of the ground which might cause a strain or even a break of some child's leg.\n\nHowever, I have been endeavouring for some time to get someone with a bulldozer to go in and level off the ground, and just managed to get a quotation from Mr. John D. Kissinger to clear the ground of roots and level the court as well as depositing the extra soil around the yard where needed, for the sum of $50.00. This is a particularly reasonable figure and if we had to bring in a machine, it would cost us twice as much but it so happens that this man is working near there and will not have to charge much for his moving time.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nR.

However, I feel certain that you can arrange to have the sewing machine at this school properly stored during the months of July and August.\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/NGD\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nI refer to the application of Mr. R.H. Moore for an allowance to enable pupils from the Cole Bay Indian Reserve to be transported to the Tsartlip Indian Day School.\n\nIt is recommended that this application be granted, with the reservation that this allowance will be withdrawn should the number of pupils drop below four.\n\nIt is also suggested that an attendance report by the senior teacher be attached to the Voucher.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nIn reply to your letter above noted, I attach, herewith, in duplicate, a list of Indian children belonging to the Pauquachin Band, which will give you the information requested.\n\nPersonally, I feel that payment on a per capita attendance basis is hardly fair to the operator owing to the fact that it costs exactly the same to take one child to school as it would to take twenty. There is the same mileage, same wear and tear on the truck, and the same length of time required. Furthermore, if there happens to be any sickness among the Indian children they would have to stay home, which is certainly no fault of the operator; but, at the same time, he would be penalized. If you insist on an attendance basis of pay we might as well forget the whole matter as the Indian I have in mind to run the bus would not be interested other than on a straight monthly rate.\n\nFinally, the Indian, Walter Williams, is prepared to comply with Provincial requirements insofar as Provincial Licence is concerned, also insurance and inspection of vehicle.\n\nR. H. Moore\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHME:EL\nEnc1.2.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's application of the 5th inst. for provision of transportation for the children of Seanich I.R. No. 3 (Coele Bay) to the Tsartlip Indian Day School, a distance of about six miles each way in an Indian automobile, together with a memorandum of the 14th inst. by Inspector Davey.\n\nYou will note that the cost will amount to approximately $86.00 a month for the conveyance of an estimated eight children.\n\nThe Department will no doubt recall the difficulty we experienced in this Agency for similar transportation for the Nanaimo children, it having to be finally abandoned as the cost per pupil became too high.\n\nHowever, I would recommend that this application be given a trial on the basis that should the average attendance fall off the project be reconsidered and definitely abandoned when it falls below an average of four pupils in any one month.\n\nI would also suggest that the Reverend Principal's certificate of pupils conveyed by this service be submitted with each voucher.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nencls.\nOttawa, August 29, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.

I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Oct. 2nd, 47. The charge for drilling a well would be five dollars ($5.00) per foot with a minimum cost of $150.00 or 30 feet of drilling.\n\nThe above charge per foot includes all necessary casing to reach from surface to bed-rock; when drilling in bed rock no casing is required as the rock forms its own casing. In regard to the probable depth, my guess would be 100 feet more or less - however I might be far from the mark as the wells in that vicinity vary in depth considerably.\n\nI think it would be advisable to employ a diviner; his charge would be approximately $10.00, I recommend Mr. A.J.A. Bell, 1234 Pike Street, Victoria.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned \"D. S. Godwin\"\n\n(LS)\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nReplying to your above letter, I wish to attach, herewith, in duplicate, a copy of a letter recently received from Mr. Godwin in reply to one I sent him making enquiries as to the cost of drilling a well at the Tsartlip Indian Day School, which I hope may be found self-explanatory.\n\nIf there is any money available now I would recommend that the well be drilled as soon as possible and before the ground gets sodden with rain.\n\nWe should figure on a cost of from $510.00 to $1,010.00, depending on the depth, including the Diviner's fee. It might so happen that we will be lucky and strike a satisfactory flow at less than one hundred feet, but it is hardly likely.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM:EL\nEnc.2.\nOct. 22, 1947.\n\nAirmail:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReference is made in District School Inspector Davey's recent report covering his inspection of the Tsartlip Indian Day School to the lack of an adequate water supply.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of October 15th in this connection, from which you will note that the cost of drilling a well at this school may run as high as $1,010.00. No provision was made in the estimates for this expenditure, and it is thought that the funds allotted for the construction of new schools would be required elsewhere. In any case it would appear to me that, in view of the possible extent of the expenditure involved, this is a matter which should be investigated by the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n-ms.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, October 24, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 22nd instant\nwith reference to the cost of drilling a well at\nthe Tsartlip Day School.\n\nIn view of the possible expenditure in-\nvolved, the Department cannot give favourable con-\nsideration to the matter at the present time.\n\nWe will request the Surveys and Engineering\nBranch to make an investigation and report.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, October 25, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Tsartlip Indian Day School, Cowichan Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay writes that a well is required at the above mentioned school. Preliminary estimates indicate that an expenditure of over $1,000.00 might be necessary.\n\nThe Commissioner considers this amount excessive and we would appreciate it if you could arrange to have one of your officers visit the school and let us have a report.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit | Price | Sub-Total |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------|-------|-----------|\n| Metal Waste Paper Baskets #20    | 1        |      | .72   |           |\n| Corn Brooms Viscount             | 2        |      | 1.05  |           |\n| Enamel Drinking Cups             | 2        |      | .45   |           |\n| Metal Waste Paper Basket #20     | 1        |      | .2    |           |\n| Purex Toilet Tissue              | 1        | CASE | 10.30 |           |\n| Paper Towel Westminster Interfold| 1        | CASE | 5.50  |           |\n| Bottles Lysol 14 oz              | 1        |      | 1.10  |           |\n\n**Total:** $31.79\n\n\"It is Cheaper to Buy the Best\"\n\nSister M.

C.\n\nRe: Voucher No. 85 - Jan. 26, 1948\n\nIn reply to your letter, date and file number above noted, I wish to advise that I quite appreciate the fact that the existing set-up in this school is unusual \u2014 all of which was explained in detail before the building was taken over as a school room. Major MacKay and Inspector Coleman saw the building and had at least two interviews with the then Priest in charge, before final arrangements were made.\n\nSeveral months after we commenced to use the Hall I explained the lighting situation, in letters, to Major MacKay \u2014 dated January 12th and February 2nd, 1945 \u2014 to which the Commissioner replied on February 6th, 1945, authorizing payment of the account at the rate of $20.00 for the entire Winter Season \u2014 from November to February.\n\nIn the Fall of 1945 the Priest was replaced by the present incumbent who was totally unaware of the arrangements made by his predecessor, with this Department, and it was not until a few weeks ago that he came to me to see why we had not paid the light bill for the Winters of 1945 and 46 and 1946-47. I simply told him that he had not submitted any accounts and that I assumed the Church was making a donation to the Department \u2014 and so let sleeping dogs lie. He assured me this was not so and immediately sent accounts for the two years.\n\nThe Church authorities do not wish a separate meter installed as the Rectory, Church, and Hall are all on one meter. If such an installation was to be made it would not help any as the building is used frequently for ordinary parish Church meetings and social gatherings.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the present arrangement is much less expensive than if we had a meter. Certainly no one can complain that a twenty dollar ($20.00) per annum light bill is expensive.\n\nR. H.

C.\n\nRe: Tsartlip Indian Day School - Jr. Room.\n\nThe attached copy of letter is, I trust, self explanatory. As the Department increased the rental from ten to twenty dollars ($10.00 to $20.00) per month on the Saanich I. D. School on July 30th, 1945 - File #152-15-5 - on representations from the Church authorities I assume that the same procedure will follow here.\n\nAt all events copies of the application (which is really an account) are also attached for submission to the Department as per request of Father Lauzon.\n\nR.

H. Moore,\nSuperintendent,\nCowichan Agency,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you will remember, the agreement entered upon between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Catholic Authorities in Saanich, by which the parish hall would be used as a junior class room to the West Saanich Indian Day School, was an emergency measure.\n\nAlthough the Church Authorities are prepared to leave the hall at the disposal of the Department, as long as new quarters will not be available, they feel that, owing to high cost of material and labor, the present rent of $10.00 is no more adequate.\n\nAs the rent for the East Saanich School has been raised to $20.00 a month a few years ago, and the two buildings serve the same purpose in the two localities, I would ask you to submit to the Department, the enclosed application, in triplicate, for a monthly rent of $20.00.\n\nThe cheques are to be made yet to Rev. Father Williamson's name.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) \"Father X. Lauzon\"\n\n(EL)\nAIR MAIL\n\nSeptember 14, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6409, file 839-5, part 4)\nExtract from an Agricultural Survey - Cowichan Agency, dated May 20th, 1948,\n\nI made several enquiries regarding the 7000 strawberry plants supplied to five pupils of the Tsartlip School and, due to planting the strawberries on freshly-plowed sod and very little if any supervision during the summer, the grass and weeds took over in every case excepting Jack Paul's patch who kept it in good shape. Sister Elizabeth Marie who started this project asked the J. Paul be given more strawberry plants this fall but I pointed out to her that, since he had planted 1500 plants last spring, he would be able to get sufficient new plants off his own patch to plant any additional acreage that he could handle. In future when projects such as this are contemplated, I would recommend that not more than 500 plants be given and only to those who have land that was cultivated the previous year.\n\n(Sgd) W. J.

Barrass, dated March 10, 1949.\n\nIt would appear from this report that a ground water supply can only be obtained at considerable depth. Shallow wells have in most instances dried up early in the season. Mr. Barrass suggests that the probable cost of a drilled well near the school site might be $715. for a depth of 130 feet. It appears that there is a reasonable certainty of securing water at that depth.\n\nMr. Barrass has further investigated the possibilities of providing power for operating a pump. This will be rather expensive owing to the necessity of constructing the power line for a distance of one-half mile. It appears that the yield from the aquifer is very small and that if a greater distribution was required, possibly to the Indian village, elevated tanks will be required, as pressure tank service would not likely be suitable due to the low pumping rate. It would not appear that there is any alternative to a well as a source of supply for this school.\n\nDuplicate copies of this report are being forwarded to Mr. Arneil for his information.\"\n\nThe well is estimated to cost $715.00, but the cost of delivery to the school and possibly to the reserve, has not been investigated, as this might depend to some extent on the amount of water found to be available when the well has been drilled.\n\nIf Indian Affairs will advise whether they require domestic water to be delivered to the Reserve as well as to the school, and also whether they require electric power to be delivered to the Village, we will investigate further.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nO T T A W A.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nFor your information and attention please.\n\n4/4/49.\n\nAttchs.\nVancouver, B.C.,\n10 March, 1949\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Water Supply\nTsartlip Indian Day School\nSaanich I.R. No. 1\nCowichan Agency, B.C.\n\nPursuant to your instructions of November 27, 1948, I visited the above reserve with the object of determining the possibility of drilling for water at the Tsartlip school. The information obtained and the subsequent proposals are set forth in the following memorandum.\n\nGeneral\n\n1. Saanich I.R. 1\n\nThe reserve is fourteen miles north of Victoria in the South Saanich Municipality. The majority of the twenty-two dwellings on the reserve are located between the West Saanich Road and Saanich Inlet, a distance of approximately 1600 feet. The difference in elevation between the road and the inlet is about 150 feet. In October, 1948, the population was 164 persons.\n\n2. Educational Facilities\n\nThe existing facilities consist of a small wood frame school building with a seating capacity of 15, situated east of the main road in the centre of the reserve. The limited capacity of this building is augmented by the use of a church three-quarters of a mile north of the school which is rented by the Indian Department.\n\nThe Educational Branch of the Indian Affairs Department are intending to construct an additional two room school which will have a seating capacity for 70 pupils. The site of this structure is to be determined by the location of the source of water supply. The Department prefers a site adjacent to the present building as it is the centre of the reserve and provides ample space for playground facilities.\nDomestic Water Supply\n\nAll water for domestic use on the reserve and adjacent property is derived from wells. In the vicinity of the proposed site there are three dug wells on reserve lands and five drilled wells on private property. One of the dug wells is adjacent to the present school but unfortunately it is dry throughout the year. The accompanying sketch plan illustrates the relative position, yield, and depth of the wells in respect to the school site. The average drilled well in the vicinity of the school has a depth of 95 feet and a yield of 150 gallons per hour.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThere is ample evidence that a well drilled adjacent to the site of the present school will be successful and it is therefore recommended that funds be allotted for its installation. It is estimated that the cost of drilling and casing will be $715.00. (See Appendix I).\n\nSupplement to the Above Recommendation\n\nThe distribution and use of the well proposed above naturally depends upon its yield. The main purpose of the inspection of the reserve was to determine the feasibility of drilling for water at the proposed school site, however the cost of power for a pump and the means by which the water may be delivered under pressure encumbers other factors which are enumerated in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe source of water for over 160 residents on this reserve consists of three dug wells, only one of which yields consistently. This well is the only source of domestic water for the entire Indian Village. If the yield of the proposed well is sufficient, it may be possible, due to the topography of the reserve, to supply both the school and the Indian resident dwellings by gravity flow from an elevated storage tank.\nThe factors determining the further development of the well then are as follows:\n\n1. Supplying the School with Domestic Water Service.\n\n   a. Electric Power\n\n   The British Columbia Electric Company Ltd.'s estimate of the approximate cost for extending their distribution lines from Stelly Crossing (see plan) to the Indian School is approximately $740.00. Their calculations for the above figure assumed the use of 1 KW of lighting equipment and a single phase motor not larger than 2 H.P. Against this total the British Columbia Electric Railway Company will credit the first two years revenue, which would be in the neighbourhood of $50.00, resulting in a net cost of $690.00.\n\n   If the Department provided electric service to the Indian residents, the charge for the extension from Stelly Crossing would be under another section of the Public Utilities Commission Tariff.\n\n   b. Storage and Delivery under Pressure\n\n   As the anticipated well yield is only 150 U.S. gph (2\u00bd U.S. gpm.) a pressure tank will not be suitable. To supply water under pressure, an elevated storage tank will have to be constructed, its capacity being determined by the number and type of plumbing fixtures intended for the new school.\n\n2. Supplying the School and the Indian Village with Domestic Water Service.\n\n   To supply the Indian day school and village jointly will require a larger capacity storage tank than above at approximately the same elevation. In this case two wells in parallel, each with a yield of 150 gph, will be required if complete plumbing facilities are installed in the school.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nCyril W.

It is noted from this memorandum that duplicate copies of Mr. Webb's report have been forwarded to you.\n\nPlease let us know what action you consider should be taken.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neery,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nApril 21, 1949.\n\nW. S. Arnell, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nOn the 12th of April, 1949, the Superintendent of Indian Education forwarded to you a copy of a memorandum received from the Chief Engineer, Lands and Development Services Branch, in regard to a water supply system for the Tsartlip Indian Day School, together with the report of the engineer who investigated the situation.\n\nIn this report, reference is made to the fact that the source of water for over 160 residents on the Indian Reserve is from three dug wells, only one of which yields a consistent supply. He recommends that a well be drilled adjacent to the site of the present school and that, if the yield from this well is sufficient, it would be possible to supply both the school and the Indian Reserve by gravity flow from an elevated tank or tanks.\n\nWill you please let me know whether you consider that we should ask the Lands and Development Services Branch to make further investigations to estimate the cost of supplying the Indian Reserve with water, as well as the Indian Day School and, if you recommend that this be done, provision will have to be made in the Estimates for the work entailed in supplying the Indian Reserve.\n\nYou will no doubt be replying to letter of April 12th, addressed to you by Col. Neary but, for the records of this Division, we would like to have a reply to this letter. Please indicate on your reply File No. 31152-14.\n\nW. J. F.

Mr. Campbell points out that the last paragraph of Mr. Mills' memorandum of April 1st which was passed to you left the matter with you to advise us as to what further action you wished us to take.

Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, Jan. 31, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-010-16 of the 15th instant, with reference to a resolution of the Seabird Island Band, relative to a day school on their reserve. I have noted that there are 36 children of school age and that the council house could be used as a temporary classroom.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department will be pleased to learn how many of the children of school age are living close enough to the council house to attend school regularly. Further, please advise me if any Roman Catholic residential schools carry on active recruiting on this reserve.\n\nIf it is decided to give the Seabird Island Indian Day School a trial, it would be necessary for you to get in touch with Rev. Father Welch, 59 Blackwood St., New Westminster, B.C., and enlist his cooperation in the matter of securing a teacher. You would be well advised to intimate to the Rev. Father, and also to this Department, if it is possible for a teacher to secure boarding accommodation.\n\nIf this school is given a trial, would you recommend that desks be supplied? If so, please intamate the number, the size, or the ages of the children and give shipping directions. It will also be necessary for this Department to supply classroom equipment, such as blackboard, texts, scribblers, etc. I take it for granted that the Indians will arrange for the heating and cleaning of the classroom, themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file S40-1, part 1)\nSir\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter number 165-5-1 dated January 31st, in reply to mine 1-010-16 dated the 15th ult., in reference to the resolution passed by the Seabird Island Indians requesting a school for their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the thirty-six children mentioned are all of school age ranging between six and fifteen, and all living on the Seabird Island Reserve. They could attend school regularly. The only residential Roman Catholic School is St. Mary's at Mission, which is practically filled all the time. We can never get children entered in there without considerable trouble. The priests pick and choose the children to suit themselves and go off into the northern part of this agency to recruit as it eliminates the chances of the children running away, besides the Indians have very great objection to this school. Just to show you what they think of it I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Dennis S. Peters. This is the grandfather of Alex. Peters child, whom he was trying to get into the Coqualeetza Institute, and which request the Department refused, your letter number 120298-10 dated January 12th.\n\nIf we have to apply to Father Welsh in these matters we might just as well give up the idea of trying to educate the Indian children in dayschools as they absolutely object to them and put every obstacle in the way. I reported this in my letter of January 15th, 1-04-12, when reporting upon the proposed dayschool for the Hope Band. Father Welsh put a stop to this as he said they had the residential school at Mission, and he couldn't see the necessity of a dayschool and so if I approached him about the one for Seabird Island he would say the same thing. There are now fifty-six children belonging to these two bands that want dayschools, and for whom there is no room at Mission, yet the priests are\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\u20142.\n\nobjecting to them.\n\nI may here add that I never visit a reserve in the lower part of this agency where I discuss school matters with them, that they do not raise an awful objection to the St. Mary's School at Mission.\n\nThese Indians are so keen for their own school that they have offered the use of their council house and will keep it well supplied with fuel. The teacher can board in Agassiz, and I have no doubt but that board can be obtained within a mile of the school. All the supplies that would be needed could be shipped direct to Agassiz. We would require an assortment of desks for children from six to fifteen. There does not appear to be a Roman Catholic teacher available.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter dated Dec. 19th, filed No. 1-04-12, my son Alex. D. Peters received your letter in which he forwarded to me, and he advise me to answer your letter and to further inform you the very reason he is working hard in communicating with the Coqualeetza and to Victoria and to you for the last two or three months for to put his two childrens in the Coqualeetza School.\n\nNow here's the reason why. Mrs. Alex. D. Peters are sickly with consumption, and as you know very well that it is no cure for such disease, and for the saving the childrens of getting the disease, the only hope is to part them from the mother and they be safe. These childrens are all right yet according to McCaffrey's examinations, and while there's a chance, as the Coqualeetza is willing to accept them, and before these childrens is touched with such disease, we better save them, and pass them in the said boarding school.\n\nAnd referring to Catholics vs. Methodist or any other church, the ruling of the Department is killed, so that doesn't matter in that part of it. And in my belief regarding different religions, they are all aiming to one God, and it is all up to the people themselves, if one persona is obey good behave, obey the laws of God, he is sure for a prize when he dies, the bad ones will be punished, that's my belief, and it don't matter in what church he or she belongs. But 40 years ago Indians thinks in these days once they belong to Catholic religion they are sure for Heaven, whether they are good or bad just the same, and if an Indian going and belong to Methodist or other Protestant, are sure for Hell.\n\nNow to-day is different, we want our children to be saved, and get the best education, and high schooling if we can get them, it don't matter about churches.\n\nAnd about the school in Katz, it is good thing, if there wasn't the sickness of Mrs. Alex, the childrens would stay home, but they had to be parted before they be safe. And I inform you further that Alex's, 2 children, Peter and Laura, are not included in the number of childrens who will attend school in Katz. (Hope Dayschool) So all you can do is to sign these forms and send them back to us and oblige. No doubt you will help us to bring these children to safety. Good-bye.\nand thanking you, wish to hear from you in near future,\nand if any further information you desire I am willing to\nfurnish it, again thanking you.\n\nYours Dennis S. Peters.\nKatz, Dec. 29th, 1922.\n\nH. Graham,\n\nSir\n\nI wrote the letter enclosed and before I sent it over to you, E.C. Chirouse met me at Chilliwack on Christmas and he asked me if surely we want to put Alex children in the Methodist schooling. I tell him, Yes, we do, and he kick all his worth, and I tell him the reason we want that school because nearly all, or quite a number of Indians been in that school came out with a good education and smart, but those that been in the Mission School they come out wild, may be two or three behave but not much education, and some says the grub at the Mission is very poor indeed. And I tell him if there any good school a Catholic I says, I'll be willing to put the children in, just to satisfy you, I says, and he says the Catholic is good, and I tell him what about Squamish and he says that he'll try the two schools for a room for two kids. I says all right in my part. Well when I came back home I told Alex, all what Chirouse has said, and all what I says to Chirouse, and Alex objects to all the Catholic Schools, because he was told by friends that the Squamish School is just as bad as the Mission School. So he is very strong in his mind to put his children in the Coqualeetza Boarding School. Oh, well he's the boss anyhow, and I can see that he is right of course, so you can sign the forms and send it to him.\n\nGoodbye and a Happy New Year.\n\nYours,\n\nD. S. Peters.\n\nE.C. Chirouse is the Re. Father Chirouse of the Indian Mission.\nOttawa, March 16, 1923.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the proposed day school on the Seabird Island Reserve. Further consideration is being given to this matter, and I shall have another communication for you in a few weeks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nOttawa, March 16, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your No. 1-010-16 of the 7th ultimo, and to my communication of this file number of the 27th ultimo, I have to inform you that the Rev. Father Welch, of New Westminster, B.C., in answer to a letter from the Deputy Superintendent General, has stated that he understands there are only 26 children on the Seabird Island Reserve, and that 14 of these are at present attending St. Mary's Indian Boarding School at Mission. I should be pleased to have a definite report on the number of children of school age, who are living in the immediate vicinity of the council house. Further, you will please make enquiries as to the nearest boarding house available, in the event of a teacher being appointed. The Rev. Father states that the nearest homes in Agassiz are nearly three miles distant from the proposed new school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated 26th February, telling me that it is the Department's intention to open a day-school on Seabird Island Reserve. Also that your Agent reports the presence of 36 children of school age in the immediate vicinity.\n\nAs to the number of children I am aware of only twenty-six and of these fourteen are at present attending St. Mary's and unless your Agent includes some children living four miles away, across the river, at Chemainus.\n\nYou ask me to assist in procuring a Catholic teacher. I shall be pleased to do so, but would suggest that you build near the school, a cottage for a man and his wife, as you have done in many places. Agassiz will be the nearest White Settlement to the School, and if the school mistress must reside there, it would entail a walk of nearly three miles each morning and afternoon. It appears to me that this would be a great hardship for any young lady, especially during our long rainy seasons.\n\nYour determination to open another day-school in the vicinity of St. Mary's is naturally making us most apprehensive for the welfare of the old Mission Boarding School. With day-schools around it, and the Lillooet district cut off in the near future, we fail to see how St. Mary's can be effectively carried on.\n\nI can assure you that we now have grave fears that the Mission School will some day, from lack of pupils be practically forced out of existence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file 840-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 27, 1923.\n\nEnclosure\n\nSr.,\n\nI have your No. 1-10-16 of the 7th instant, with reference to the proposed day school on the Sea Bird Island Reserve.\n\nI have noted that thirty-six children of school age are living in the immediate vicinity of the council house, which can be used for class-room purposes and that a teacher could secure board in Agassiz within a mile of the school. It is understood that the heating and cleaning would be undertaken by the members of the band.\n\nThe Department is favourably disposed to giving this school a trial and a blackboard and class-room equipment will be directed upon your requisition. Please intimate further if there are any school desks in the agency that are at present not in use and that could be placed in the council house at Sea Bird Island. If no old desks are available, please requisition for a conservative number of new desks which will be ordered from this office, if necessary.\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of an official communication to the Rev. Father Welch, with whom you should co-operate in the matter of securing a teacher. Salary from $600.00 to $800.00 will be allowed depending upon the qualifications of the teacher secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytten,\nB. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file 840-1, part 1)\nFebruary 26, 1923.\n\nDear Father Welch,\n\nI have to inform you that it is the intention of the Department to commence day school activities on the Sea Bird Island (Maria) Reserve. It is proposed to use the council house of the band for class-room purposes. Our agent reports the presence of thirty-six children of school age in the immediate neighbourhood.\n\nThe Indians in this locality are all Roman Catholic and I am requesting your co-operation with our representative, Mr. H. Graham, of Lytton, B. C., in connection with the services of a teacher.\n\nOur agent will write to you when all arrangements are made and when the teacher is needed for this cause.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nVery Rev. John Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to letter number 165-5-1 dated February 27th, in connection with starting a day school on Seabird Island Reserve.\n\nAs instructed by you I wrote to Father Welch with a view of obtaining a Roman Catholic teacher for this school, but up to the present have had no reply.\n\nI also wrote to Mr. Inspector Cairns and he tells me that there are no Roman Catholic teachers available to his knowledge.\n\nThe Indians of this band being desirous of getting this school started immediately have forwarded me a petition asking that any teacher available will be quite satisfactory to them, in order to get the school started.\n\nThe one greatest drawback of getting a teacher for a school like this, is the small salary paid. The Department, according to their letter, is only offering from $600 to $800 per year, according to qualifications. Now if we get a teacher, he or she will have to board in Agassiz, and will have to pay anywhere from $35 to $40 per month for board. Presuming that they get board for $35, which is very exceptional, this would only leave $15.00 a month to take oneself on. It is not very likely we will get much of a teacher for this, especially as it is a wet climate and the teacher would have one and a half to two miles to walk every day to and from school.\n\nI will be very much obliged if the Department will give this resolution their favorable consideration, and when replying state definitely if I am authorized to offer $500 for this, for I think I might get a B.C. certificated teacher or an English certificated teacher at this salary.\n\nIn regard to the desks for this school I took the matter up with Mr. Inspector Cairns and he advises me that he has no second hand desks in sight, except some that can be purchased from the Provincial authorities at $1.50 a piece. These would, of course, have to be crated, which would add a little more to the expenses.\n\nI will be obliged if you will advise me if the Department considers it advisable to purchase these second hand ones or to order new ones.\n\nTrusting to receive an early reply,\n\nRussell T. Perrier Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file 840-1, part 1)\nWE, the undersigned Indians of the Seabird Island Band hereby certify that we wish to have a day school started on our reserve, and are willing and satisfied to have our children placed under a teacher of any denomination who may be available, if a Roman Catholic teacher is not to be obtained, in order that the school may be started as soon as possible.\n\nSigned:\n\nI certify that the above declaration has been read over and interpreted to the above signed Indians and that the contents were understood by them and embodies their wishes, and that I witnessed their signatures to this document.\n\nSworn before me at B.C. this day of 1923.\n\nSignature.\nOttawa, June 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 2-08-20 of the 16th instant which has reference to the proposed schools on the Hope and Seabird Island Reserves. I have noted that the difficulty of securing cooperation in the matter of procuring teachers still obtains.\n\nI have to inform you that a local representative of the Roman Catholic Church will visit the Rev. Father Welch in the course of the next few weeks, and I am of the opinion that if you correspond with the last mentioned Rev. Gentleman on or about the first of August, he will give you every assistance. Please keep this in mind and act without further authority in an effort to secure Catholic teachers for these two schools, in time to open on the first of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INDIAN AGENT H. GRAHAM,\nLYTTON, B. C. (His No. 2-08-20) Dated June 16/23.\n\nOriginal on File 165-62-1.\n\nNow in regard to the proposed schools for the Hope and Seabird Island Bands, I have applied to Father Welch for a Roman Catholic teacher for each of these, but can get no satisfaction from him. He just replies that he is taking the matter up with Ottawa. I have also taken the matter up with Mr. Cairns, who advises me that there are no Roman Catholic teachers that he knows of, available. He further states that he met Father Welch at Mission school recently, who told him that if we put in a Protestant teacher at Hope he would see that there were no children attending the school. Now they will attempt the same thing at Seabird Island school. I feel sure they will not attempt to supply us with a teacher, as I do not think there are any available, which would mean that if we put in a Protestant teacher, we will have to prosecute the Indians in order to see that the children are sent. The Indians themselves tell me they want the schools very badly, and do not care of what denomination the teacher is, as they realize that religion is not being taught.\n\nThere is certainly not room at the Mission School for all these children, and yet they try to prevent us starting day schools.\n\n(sgd.) H. Graham.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the opening of the proposed day school on Seabird Island Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the Inspector and yourself are of the opinion that it would be advisable to delay the opening of this school until after the summer holidays next, by which time it is hoped to have all equipment on hand. The action taken is approved.\n\nIt is hoped that the services of a teacher will be secured in time to begin duties on or about September 1st next, and, as requested in our letter of the 2nd instant, you should submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher obtained for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nAfter discussing the matter of opening this school with Mr. Inspector Cairns, he suggests that, as all schools close for summer holidays at the end of June, it would not be wise to open this school until after the holidays, so we have decided that by the time we get the equipment, there, it will be ready to open on the 1st of September.\n\nTrusting this meets with the Department's approval,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file S40-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the procuring of the services of a teacher for the Indian day school which it is proposed to open on Seabird Island Indian Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the Rev. Father Welch has been unable to obtain the services of a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith. When you are satisfied that every effort has been made to obtain a teacher of that faith, and it has not been possible to obtain one, you may then secure the services of another teacher having the necessary qualifications. The salary allowed will be as stated in our letter to you of the 12th ultimo. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher obtained should be submitted for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter number 165-5-1 dated April 12th, authorizing me to start a day school on Seabird Island Indian Reserve, and notifying me that the Department is willing to pay a salary of $600.00 plus a bonus to select if possible a Roman Catholic teacher for this position.\n\nI may say that I have already applied to the Rev. Father Welch for assistance in obtaining the services of a Roman Catholic teacher and also to the priests at St. Mary's Mission School, but up to the present have been unable to obtain the services of this denomination.\n\nI have also placed the matter before Mr. Inspector Cairns, who advised me that there is no Roman Catholic teacher available, but we can obtain a good Protestant teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHQ/MD\nOttawa, April 14th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-010-16, of the 3rd instant, with reference to the proposed Seabird Island Indian day school. I have noted that there are 56 children of school age who could attend the classes which can be held in the council house, and that a teacher could secure board and lodging within a reasonable distance of her work.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that you are authorized to secure the services of a properly certificated teacher, and you may offer a salary of $800, plus any bonus provided by law. If possible, select a Roman Catholic for this position, as the Indians of the vicinity are of this religion. Please report on what action you take in this connection. Direct also separate communications to the Department with reference to the classroom equipment required, and as to what desks should be supplied. I have noted that no old desks are available. In this connection please refer to our instructions under date of February 27th.\n\nIt is considered that the Indian Band should arrange for the heating and cleaning of the classroom without help from the Department. They should also take an active interest in the matter of attendance of their children, but they should understand that the commencement of this activity must not interfere with the residential school pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nWrite further when agent's reply received.\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to my letter No. 1-010-16 of the 7th of February, and in reply to yours of March 16th, No. 165-5-1, in reference to correspondence you have had from the Rev. Father Welch of New Westminster, in connection with the proposed day school on Seabird Island I.R. I might state that the number of children as reported by me in the first instance was quite correct. It is quite true that some of these children are going to the Mission School, which the Indians strongly object to on the ground that they do not get sufficient education, and they were in hopes that if they could get the day school going, and it proved a success, they might gradually be able to get these out, as there are plenty of children on other reserves, who cannot get day schools, to fill up the Mission School.\n\nThere are twenty-six (26) children now on the reserve of school age, not including those attending the Mission School at present, a list of which I am enclosing.\n\nThe distance to the proposed school from the postoffice and two hotels in Agassiz, is just two miles. There are many homes as near as half a mile from the proposed school house, and many of these take in boarders, which I have no doubt a teacher could get board and lodging at, so Father Welch's contention that they are three miles from a place to board is absolutely incorrect.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

She is twenty-three years of age, and has the following qualifications:\n\nShe has had one year in high school and has also two years' training as a stenographer. She spent nearly a year with one of the big business concerns of Vancouver, as demonstrator of Electric Washing Machines. She acted as a substitute in the laundry of St. George's Industrial School at Lytton. Mr. Lett, the principal, at the expiration of the three months' trial gave her a very hearty testimonial.\n\nIn the latter position Miss Delany was brought into close touch with the Indian girls of the school. She was remarkably successful in dealing with the girls and won their confidence and affection.\n\nI have done my best to get a teacher for this school with a certificate, but have failed. Under these circumstances, and with the fact before me that the Indians of Seabird Island are very anxious to have a school opened I recommend that Miss Delany be appointed teacher at a salary of Seven hundred dollars per annum and the bonus.\n\nIn order that the school may be opened on September 4th, I would respectfully ask you to send me a telegram confirming the appointment of Miss Delany.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.H. Cairns\n\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nP.S. Miss Delany is a Roman Catholic and I am sure in that respect will be quite acceptable to Father Welch.\nOttawa, August 20th, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, in which you inform the Department that Miss Lilian Raftery will not be available for the Seabird Island Indian Day School.

My boys would be a great help to me at home milking cows - morning and evening, and much less expense for me, as I supply them all their clothes at the Mission Boarding School.

That will save me a lot of expense on her clothes if she goes to school right at home, than when she goes to the Mission boarding school as I supply her all her clothes, and then she can be replaced by another child from other reserves that have not the privilege of a school on their reserves.

I want to keep her here right at home, that she may go to this school that has recently been opened at the Seabird Island Reserve. Children are a great help to us when they are right at home, and go to school at the same time. It is for our children that we begged hard for a school on our reserve. And if we can only have our children here, then I would prefer that at the Mission Boarding School for other children that have not the privilege of a school on their reserves. Please inform the Indian Department about this matter, and let me know as soon as possible, and oblige,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) August Andrew.\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2-010-16 of the 12th instant, with reference to the opening of the Seabird Island Indian Day School. I have noted, with satisfaction, the circumstances attendant upon the commencement of teaching activity.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the Indians are enthusiastic and I hope that a good attendance will obtain throughout the first academic year. Your action, in advising certain parents to send their children back to the St. Mary's Indian Residential School immediately, is commended, and you should inform your correspondents, Jimmy Andrew, Martin Harris and August Andrew, that the Department insists that their children, who are enrolled at the residential school, shall remain there for the full tuition period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There were seventy-five Indians present, and there were eighteen children enrolled, two of whom were sixteen years of age, but very anxious to attend school.\n\nThe Indians were very enthusiastic and three of the parents, who have children at St. Mary's Mission School, got up and made speeches, and asked if they could not withdraw their children from that school, and send them to the day school. Both Mr. Cairns and myself made it very plain to them, that we had no power to allow them to do this, and advised them to send the children back immediately, as it was a matter entirely in the hands of the Department at Ottawa. That same day these particular Indians went home and wrote me letters, copies of which I am enclosing.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in the matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

On the recommendation of the Reverend Father Brown, O.M.I., I have accepted the application of Mrs. Carpenter, subject to the approval of the Indian Department, her notice to remain October 1st.\n\nMrs. Carpenter is a scholarly woman and has plenty of energy. She has no certificate as a teacher but was trained in England, where she had some experience as a pupil-teacher. I would, therefore, recommend that Mrs. Carpenter be allowed to take charge of the school on condition that she be paid $50 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. H.

Father Welch, O.M.I., nominated the services of Mrs. Carpenter to take charge from the 1st of October, next. The Department is approving of the temporary appointment of Mrs. Carpenter, her retention in the position to depend upon the success which she achieves in the work. She has no certificate as a teacher, but was trained in England, where she had some experience as a pupil-teacher. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of both salary and bonus is based on ten teaching months in the year.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give Mrs. Carpenter any assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The salary allowed will be at the rate of $700 for the ten teaching months in the year, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. I shall be pleased if you will state Mrs. Carpenter's Christian name. This information is required in the issuing of cheques for salary and bonus.

MacLennan, is anxious to obtain a transfer to another Indian Day School, as she has been here for some five years or more. I suggested that she write to the Archbishop of Vancouver, His Grace Archbishop Duke, without whose approval I understand the Department would not care to take action. The teacher of the Shalalth Day School in the same agency and Diocese being also anxious to transfer, it would be easy to arrange this matter, but I have thought it better to let the Catholic Church make its own nominations to the Department, either through the Indian Agent at Lytton, B.C. Mr. Strang, or direct to Ottawa. I have no objection to offer for I consider that this transfer would be quite suitable.\nOttawa, October 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 10328-010-16 of the 9th instant, enclosing the application of Miss Christene MacLennan, teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I regret to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to allow Miss MacLennan any increase at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There were 17 children at the time of my visit. I examined several children in their work, and the standard appears to be fair, but I told the teacher that I thought they wanted a bit more discipline, as some of the parents had complained of the bigger children. Everything was clean and tidy. The position of the blackboards, however, should be changed as they are hard to see from the desks owing to the reflection of the light.\n\nGeo. S.

The Department regrets that Miss Wadel is giving up duties, as it is noted by your reports that her work has been satisfactory.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Wadel for the next school year to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. As this school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, it will be necessary to consult them regarding the appointment of a successor to Miss Wadel, and you should take this matter up with them in due time. Particulars concerning the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for this position should be forwarded to the Department. The salary allowed will depend on the qualifications and experience which the teacher nominated possesses. Please give this matter your attention in due time in order that the services of a teacher can be obtained before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYou should see that Miss Wadel prepares the usual quarterly return at the end of the present quarter showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and forwards same to the Department through your office in order that payment of salary due her can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This lady has certainly given exceptionally good services as a school teacher for the Department. In fact she is one of the best day school teachers that I think we have. I know her work well, during the time she was on the Osoyoos Reserve in the Okanagan Agency. She was well liked there by all the Indians, and got the children on well in their work. This position was particularly honourous, in that she was cut off from any intercourse with white people, being all by herself on the Indian Reserve quite a long way from the nearest settlement. Since being at Seabird Island School she has pulled that school together remarkably and the attendance is greatly increased. She is also there, apparently, well liked by all the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nOSP/AL\n\nH.

Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his inspection of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, states that the Indian parents are taking more interest in the education of their children and have expressed a desire to have a change of teacher. As you were advised at the time of the appointment of Mrs. Carpenter, the present teacher, her retention in the position was to depend upon the success which she achieved in the work. It appears from reports received that her services have not been entirely satisfactory, and it is desired that a qualified teacher be engaged for the next school year. You should inform Mrs. Carpenter in due time that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz. June 30th, next.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, it will be necessary to consult them regarding the appointment of a successor to Mrs. Carpenter. You should take this matter up with the Church authorities in due time, and also with Mr. Inspector Cairns, and submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for the position. You will please keep this matter in mind and make all necessary arrangements, as requested above, in due time to have a suitable teacher engaged for the next school year.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Cairns that you have been instructed to notify Mrs. Carpenter that her services will not be required after the end of June, next, and to take the necessary action to obtain the services of a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, March 8th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report dated February 2nd, last, on your inspection of the Seabird Island Indian Day School. It is noted that the Indians are taking more interest in the education of their children and that they have expressed a desire to have a change of teacher. The present teacher, Mrs. Carpenter, was appointed temporarily in September, 1924, on the distinct understanding that her retention in the position would depend upon the success she achieved in the work. In view of your recommendation that she be allowed to remain for the balance of the present school year, ending June 30th next, the Department will approve of her continuing her duties until that time. We are, however, requesting Mr. Agent Graham, Lytton, to inform Mrs. Carpenter that her services will not be required after that date.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher for the next school year, beginning on or about September 1st, next, and as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, they should be consulted in obtaining a qualified teacher whose services would be satisfactory. Mr. Agent Graham will be requested to take this matter up with the Church authorities and yourself in time to obtain the services of a teacher for this school for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n205 Winch Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR CAIRNS,\ndated February 2nd, 1928, on his inspection of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 165-5-6.\n\nJust now there is a stir among the Indians regarding school affairs and they have expressed the desire to have a change of teachers. This can be brought about by giving Mrs. Carpentier sufficient notice. She would like to remain in the school until June 30th and I would, therefore, recommend that Mrs. Carpentier be allowed to finish her work for the year.\n\nDuring my visit to the Seabird Indian Day School, some five or six of the men were present at the examination. I explained to them that Mrs. Carpentier would, in all probability, resign her position to take effect June 30th, 1928. Mrs. Mary E. Carpentier has been faithful in the discharge of her duties as a teacher. She has been extremely kind to the pupils and, notwithstanding the fact that the attendance has been irregular, progress has been made. The Indians spoke kindly of Mrs. Carpentier.\n\nMrs. Carpentier asked me if she could obtain a leave of absence for one year, that is to make it possible for Mrs. Carpentier at the end of a year to make application should there be a vacancy. This, of course, will come up for review about the 30th of June, 1928.\nMiss Ruth Young, an expert Primary teacher, was present at the examination and taught a model lesson for the benefit of both teacher and pupils. It appeared to me that Mrs. Carpentier has lost her interest, to some extent, in the pupils. However, I would like to give her a further trial. At the end of a month or two, I will visit the school again and be in a position to give recommendations.\n\nIt may be necessary to consider the matter of a change of teachers unless results are evident.\n\nThe attendance and the work generally are not satisfactory. Mrs. Carpentier seems to have lost her grip and is not getting the co-operation of the parents, as she should.\nJune 7, 1937.\n\nCapt. G. H.

The School which was quite successful under Miss C. McLennan, has not been so since the appointment of Mr. F.G.M.

In reply to my query, Mr. J.W. Burns has refused a transfer to Homalco Indian Day School.\n\nI am forwarding Your Grace's nominations to the Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, through the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, and recommending the appointment of Miss Mabel Boeur to the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School, and the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Leary from Homalco (Church House) to Sliammon. This will leave the positions of teacher and field matron open at Church House, in place of Chehalis as suggested in the above quoted letter.\n\nI should be glad to have in due course suggestions with regard to the filling of the positions at Church House.\n\nMiss Catherine MacDonald and Miss Mabel Leary, whom I interviewed while in Vancouver are very good candidates for ordinary teaching positions, but I do not believe that either would be very suitable at Church House where a married couple or a teacher and relative who is a trained nurse would be more suitable.\n\nShould you later wish to consult me again with regard to any vacant positions, I may say that I shall be glad to go to Vancouver for this purpose, but I would ask you to note that from July 10th to August 1st I shall be on statutory vacation and away from Victoria.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H.

Second Class Certificate and Provincial Summer School qualifications in Indian & Rural Work, Primary Work, etc., and has some thirteen years experience in our B.C. Indian schools. Miss Boeur taught for some six years at Katzie Indian Day School, four years at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, and for the past three years at the Sliammon Indian Day School. She is a very good teacher indeed, and I am very glad to recommend her appointment to the position at Sea Bird Island.\n\nI would ask that the Indian Agents be informed in due course of the decision of the Indian Affairs Branch with regard to the proposed transfers, so that they may in turn communicate with the teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

I also said that under the circumstances I was bound to receive very unfavourable reports from Capt. Barry, and that I would be blamed for all the faults of the children, although in no way responsible. You agreed with me regarding the manners and speech and said that I would have a hard task changing them. I may say that after two years hard work I have succeeded and most of the children are now well spoken and have nice manners. As to the schoolwork I have exercise books which were in use here before my time which will prove what I say is correct.\n\nEach time Capt. Barry has inspected the school, although he did not say anything, I could tell that he was not very well impressed by the work of the higher grades, neither was I, and it is only now that I am getting the children where I want them. As to Grades 1 and 2, Capt. Barry has always told me that they were excellent, and as they are the children I started in school I think I should be judged by their work as they are the most important grades in any school, being the foundation on which all the rest of the schoolwork is built.\n\nI shall be glad if you will forward a copy of this letter to Ottawa and ask that an impartial official of the Department investigate this and prove if I am right or wrong. I think that after hearing my side of the question they cannot in common justice refuse to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Strang Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nChilliwack, B.C.,\nJuly 23-37\n\nRt.

Mr. Ball advises me that Mrs. Nicholson has withdrawn her verbal resignation and wishes to remain at Sliammon for another year.\n\nOwing to Captain Barry's absence on vacation Mr. Ball was unable to reach him by telephone, and I understand that he himself is on vacation until about August 10th.\n\nThe previous recommendation for the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Bowyer from Comox to Sliammon was made, of course, on the understanding that Mrs. Nicholson had definitely resigned. It is now learned that such a transfer is impossible until such time as Mrs. Nicholson actually resigns.\n\nI should be glad to know if the Indian Affairs Branch approves of the transfer of Miss Isabel Boeur, present teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, to be teacher of the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School at Agassiz in the Lytton Agency. You will remember that His Grace Archbishop Duke has requested Miss Boeur for the Sea Bird Island vacancy and that the Inspector of Indian Schools recommends her transfer. Should the Indian Affairs Branch approve of this transfer it will not be difficult to find a suitable Roman Catholic teacher for the position left vacant at Sliammon.\n\nUpon receipt of a telegram from the Department authorizing the above transfer I shall immediately get in touch with His Grace Archbishop Duke with a view to obtaining the nomination of a suitable candidate for the Sliammon Indian Day School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGerald M.

As the salary rate at the Seabird Island School is $90.00 a month, we can only allow this amount to Miss Boeur. I mention this specifically because the salary rate at Sliammon is $95.00 a teaching month.\n\nYou should notify both Indian Agent Ball and Indian Agent Strang regarding this transfer.\n\nIn connection with securing a teacher for the Sliammon School, I would refer you to my letter of July 30th. If, however, you do not recommend the transfer of Miss Hepworth to Sliammon, you should request His Grace Archbishop Duke to nominate a qualified teacher for the Sliammon School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

C., dated Victoria, Aug. 14/37.\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter of the 9th instant and the third paragraph of your communication 167-24-1 of July 30th last, I am forwarding herewith a letter from Archbishop W. M. Duke of Vancouver, in which he suggests the transfer of Miss Marie Hepworth from the Okanagan Indian Day School to be teacher of the Sliammon Indian Day School, and also the appointment of Miss Catherine McDonald as teacher of the Okanagan Day School.\n\nCaptain Barry informs me that Miss Catherine McDonald is a Roman Catholic, aged 49 years, trained at the Ottawa Normal School 1914-15 and holds a Second-Class Ontario Certificate. This teacher has 16 years successful experience; 10 years having been spent in Ontario rural schools and 6 years at St. Patrick's School, Vancouver. Her sister is a widow who could and would live with her, should her appointment as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School be approved. She was interviewed in Vancouver on June 19th last by our Inspector of Schools.\n\nI would recommend that approval be given for the transfer of Miss Marie Hepworth to Sliammon Indian Day School and the appointment of Miss Catherine McDonald as teacher of the Okanagan Indian Day School. On receipt of a telegram that the Indian Affairs Branch has approved of these appointments, I shall immediately inform the Indian Agents concerned.\n\n(SIGNED) D. N.

C.\nLYTTON INDIAN AGENCY - PROGRESS REPORT FOR DECEMBER 1937.\n\nThe attendance at the day schools is all that can be expected at this time of the year, particularly at Seabird Island day school where the pupils have long distances to walk to school. Miss Boeur is getting more settled, and I believe she is a capable teacher. It was raining heavily when I visited Seabird Island school; consequently the attendance was poor that day. A visit was made to the parents of these pupils, and the former were requested to assist the teacher in every possible way and to have their children attend regularly.\n\nA.

In this connection I would refer you to my letter of August 9, 1937.\n\nMiss Boeur is being paid salary of $900.00 a year and in addition is allowed $75.00 for janitor services.

Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nAs the end of the school year is approaching, I am again writing to you about my salary. I am completing my second year's teaching here, and still the salary paid here is the lowest I have ever received during my fourteen years' teaching in Indian Schools.\n\nFormerly I received one thousand fifty dollars per annum, plus janitor fee. Previous to my coming to Scalbird Island I received nine hundred fifty dollars per annum, plus janitor fee.\nI am sorry to be again troubling you about this, but I really feel that I do not deserve less than I received before coming to Sealord Island. If you recall, I accepted the transfer to this school without learning until later that my salary would be less here.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will consider this matter, as I should like either an increase in salary or in janitor fee. At present my salary is nine hundred dollars, plus seventy-five dollars a year for janitor work.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\nMabel Boeck.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward herewith, a letter from Miss Mabel Boeur, teacher at Seabird Island Indian Bay School, in which she applies for an increase in salary.\n\nMiss Boeur is a good teacher and has made nice progress in the general school work since coming to Seabird Island School, and I would respectfully recommend that the janitor's allowance for this teacher be increased to $10.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nenc.\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1939.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing letter from the teacher of the Seabird Island Indian day school requesting an increase in her salary.\n\nThe salary schedule at Indian day schools was recently reviewed and it was decided that no increases should be granted to any of the teachers of Indian day schools at the present time. Under these circumstances favourable consideration cannot be given to Miss Boeur's request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, November 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd ultimo and also Inspector Barry's report on the Seabird Island Indian Day School, sent forward therewith.\n\nI note with interest Inspector Barry's recommendation, approved by yourself,- that the salary of Miss Boeur, the teacher in charge of this school, be increased. I feel confident, however, that it would be simply a waste of time for me to recommend a salary increase in this case, in view of the comparatively small enrolment at this school and the low average attendance. I note that when Inspector Barry visited the school there were only three boys and three girls present and that the average attendance for this school year amounts to only 5.4. This condition is wholly unsatisfactory to the Department, and in view of the conditions now confronting us, not only this school but other schools where the attendance is unsatisfactory should be very carefully reviewed by the Inspector, acting under specific instructions from yourself. I feel confident that the Minister will expect you to take such action.\n\nWould it be possible, therefore, to have from you a recommendation in respect to this and other schools, expressing an opinion on,-\n\n(a) closing the school and transferring the pupils to residential schools where accommodation may be available,\n\n(b) operating such schools on an eight or nine month basis,\n\n(c) making provision for the transportation of such pupils -\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\npupils to white schools in the neighborhood, where accommodation may be available and where arrangements can be made for their education.\n\nI firmly believe that in times like these the Department simply cannot afford to keep a school open and in operation with an attendance of three, four, five or six pupils. If Miss Boeur is dissatisfied with her present salary, she should not be encouraged to remain in the Indian service and should be told to send in her resignation. I have carefully reviewed and compared, this morning, the salaries paid in our Indian day schools in British Columbia with the salaries paid in other one room day schools of the province, and I notice that the average salary paid by this Department in British Columbia is substantially higher than the salaries prevailing in other one room public schools.\n\nYour attention to this matter in the immediate future will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nP.O.Box 444\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDecember 9, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the attached file I may say that I have read Department letter 165-8-1 with some care.\n\nThe instructions with regard to Miss Boeur will be followed should she again mention the question of salary increase. If you consider that Mr. Indian agent Strong should be informed of the Department's decision in this case, you will no doubt take the necessary action.\n\nThe preliminary work on the survey of small Indian schools suggested by Mr. Hoey has been completed during the past weeks as I had a few minutes to spare from time to time.\n\nThe possible increase in attendance at some of these schools has been discussed with Church officials in a few cases, mainly to enable me to obtain some idea of the reaction to be expected should one or more schools be closed.\n\nMy report on the small schools will be prepared during my visit to Vancouver Island on other duties and forwarded to you during the next two weeks.\n\nAt the present time I do not see how any schools now in operation could possibly be closed, if we are to continue the education of the children concerned, for the residential schools are all filled to capacity at present authorized.\n\nMoving children from a small day school where there are for example 12 children on the roll to a residential school would result in an increased expenditure to the Department.\n\nSuch a small day school as I have mentioned costs some \u00a31000.00 per annum to operate while the 12 pupils at a residential school would cost in per capita fees alone some \u00a36000.00. The attendance at small Indian day schools in late spring and early Fall would not exceed some 50% and probably not at any time exceed 80% of the number on the roll of the school.\n\nIn general the closing of day schools and transferring the pupils to residential schools could not possibly be justified on the ground of expense to the Department. It is in any case impossible from a practical point of view as there are no vacancies at the residential schools, and my efforts to have the numbers entitled to draw per capita allowance at certain of the residential schools, e.g., Mary's Mission for instance, have not so far been very successful.\nThe possibility of operating some of our Indian schools on an eight month basis has been considered in the past. Schools at Massett, Skidegate, and Gwaiiha are now operating on an eight months basis.\n\nThe difficulty is that when schools are open only eight months in a year we cannot, except in unusual circumstances, obtain the services of the better qualified teachers. Such teachers are able to obtain ten month schools under the Provincial Department of Education. It may be possible to suggest that one or two of the small schools be reduced to eight month schools, and this will be discussed in my final report on this subject.\n\nThe sending of our children to Provincial schools while satisfactory in places where no Indian school is in operation and numbers are far too small for the establishment of such an Indian school is not the best arrangement for two reasons:\n\n(a) Catholic children can not obtain any religious instruction at Provincial schools.\n\n(b) The Programme of Study in Provincial schools is not the best for Indian children, that is Indian schools being adapted to the child's future.\n\nThis matter will however be further reported on in my final survey of these small schools.\n\nWith regard to the final paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter of November 2nd, I am of course well aware that the salaries paid in our Indian schools are in general higher than those paid by the Province in rural schools.\n\nThe Province has for some years been trying to find some way to increase the rural salaries. Should we reduce salaries or place many schools on an eight month basis the result will be that qualified teachers will not accept appointments in Indian schools and the standards I have for years attempted to maintain will fail to the very inadequate level noticed when I took up my work in 1941.\n\nThere is a very definite shortage of qualified teachers in British Columbia this year. We are so far unable to find teachers for Gitlakdamix (Anglican) Kincolith Division (Anglican) and Massett Division 3 also Anglican. I have consulted Anglican Church authorities, and the registrar of the B.C. Education Department, who is just as unable to find teachers as I am, but have not found suitable candidates.\n\nI would request that you consider this letter an Interim Report on the possibilities suggested in Mr. Hoey's letter of November 2nd.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nHarrison Hot Springs, B.C.\nJune 14th 1940.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my report on the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School, Roman Catholic Church, Lytton Agency, which was inspected this morning.\n\nThe children attending this school are well dressed, and clean. They appear very happy and are certainly making excellent progress.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Boeur, has made a very great success of her work here. As the future of this particular school is somewhat doubtful, it is quite possible the teacher may seek a transfer through nomination by the Catholic Church authorities. Her vacation address will be in care of Mrs A. J. Boeur, R.M., Abbotsford, B.C.\n\nOnly about 12 of the 16 pupils attend well. Some of the others are, the teacher states, not strong, and some have a distance to walk to school.\n\nThe dozen or so children who do attend fairly regularly might possibly be accommodated in the Agassiz Consolidated School, as the school bus passes quite near to their homes, Miss Boeur states. Other pupils could not however be picked up easily.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be best to operate this school from October 1st to May 31st yearly in the location in which it is now established, the Indian Council House on Sea Bird Island, till such time as the permanent location of the majority of the Indian parents has been decided on, new houses built, etc., when it may be necessary to erect a new school in a more central location.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H.E.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDecember 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hosy's letter of November 2nd, file 165-5-1, and beg to submit herewith an interim report received from Capt. Barry on the matters referred to therein.\n\nThe possibilities suggested in your letter will be further dealt with on receipt of Inspector Barry's final report.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDecember 9, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the attached file I may say that I have read Department letter 165-5-1 with some care.\n\nThe instructions with regard to Miss Boeur will be followed should she again mention the question of salary increase. If you consider that Mr. Indian Agent Strang should be informed of the Department's decision in this case, you will no doubt take the necessary action.\n\nThe preliminary work on the survey of small Indian schools suggested by Mr. Hoey has been completed during the past weeks as I had a few minutes to spare from time to time.\n\nThe possible increase in attendance at some of these schools has been discussed with Church officials in a few cases, mainly to enable me to obtain some idea of the reaction to be expected should one or more schools be closed.\n\nMy report on the small schools will be prepared during my visit to Vancouver Island on other duties and forwarded to you during the next two weeks.\n\nAt the present time I do not see how any schools now in operation could possibly be closed, if we are to continue the education of the children concerned, for the residential schools are all filled to capacity at present authorized.\n\nMoving children from a small day school where there are for example 12 children on the roll to a residential school would result in an increased expenditure to the Department.\n\nSuch a small day school as I have mentioned costs some $1000.00 per annum to operate while the 12 pupils at a residential school would cost 15 per capita fees alone some $2000.00. The attendance at small Indian day schools in late Spring and early Fall would not exceed some 50% and probably not at any time exceed 80% of the number on the roll of the school.\n\nIn general the closing of day schools and transferring the pupils to residential schools could not possibly be justified on the ground of expense to the Department. It is in any case impossible from a practical point of view as there are no vacancies at the residential schools, and my efforts to have the numbers entitled to draw per capita allowance at certain of the residential schools, St. Mary's Mission for instance, have not so far been very successful.\nThe possibility of operating some of our Indian schools on an eight month basis has been considered in the past. Schools at Massett, Skidegate, and Gwaihaha are now operating on an eight months basis.\n\nThe difficulty is that when schools are open only eight months in a year we can not, except in unusual circumstances, obtain the services of the better qualified teachers. Such teachers are able to obtain ten month schools under the Provincial Department of Education. It is not possible to suggest that one or two of the small schools be reduced to eight month schools, and this will be discussed in my final report on this subject.\n\nThe sending of our children to Provincial schools while satisfactory in places where no Indian school is in operation and numbers are far too small for the establishment of such an Indian school is not the best arrangement for two reasons:\n\n(a) Catholic children can not obtain any religious instruction at Provincial schools.\n\n(b) The course of Study in Provincial schools is not the best for Indian children, that in Indian schools being adapted to the child's future.\n\nThis matter will however be further reported on in my final survey of these small schools.\n\nWith regard to the final paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter of November 2nd, I am of course well aware that the salaries paid in our Indian schools are in general higher than those paid by the Province in rural schools.\n\nThe Province has for some years been trying to find some way to increase the rural salaries. Should we reduce salaries or place many schools on an eight month basis the result will be that qualified teachers will not accept appointments in Indian schools and the standards I have for years attempted to maintain will fall to the very inadequate level noticed when I took up my work in 1931.\n\nThere is a very definite shortage of qualified teachers in British Columbia this year. We are so far unable to find teachers for Gitlakdamix (Anglican) Kincolith Division 2 (Anglican) and Massett Division 3 also Anglican. I have consulted Anglican Church authorities, and the Registrar of the B.C. Education Department, who is just as unable to find teachers as I am, but have not found suitable candidates.\n\nI would request that you consider this letter an Interim Report on the possibilities suggested in Mr. Hoey's letter of November 2nd.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, July 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the Indian day schools in British Columbia conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, I would refer you to official letter of the 3rd instant, approving the operation of the Seabird Island School for an 8 month period, namely from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70\nVancouver, B. C.\nSea Bird Island Indian Day School.\n\nThe particulars of this school are set out in some detail in my Survey Report on Small Indian Day Schools, Page 8. This school was last visited by me on June 14th 1940. On that occasion there were only 6 pupils present, though there were 16 on the school roll.\n\nThe building used as a school is the Council House of the local Indians. It is just possible that the school should be located in a different part of Sea Bird Island to insure a better attendance. Too many children have in the past been allowed to go to the St. Mary's Indian residential school at Mission.\n\nThe present teacher is Miss M.C. Boeur, a girl of some 36 years of age who has now a First Class certificate and some fifteen years experience in Indian schools.\n\nThe progress of this school has been very good since Miss Boeur was appointed on transfer from the Bliammon Indian Day school.\n\nAverage Quarterly Attendance\n\n| Year       | September | December | March   | June    |\n|------------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|\n| 1935-36    | 4.6       | 9.8      | 10.2    | 12.2    |\n| 1936-37    | 8.8       | 14.1     | 12.3    | 12.0    |\n| 1937-38    | 4.5       | 9.6      | 6.0     | 6.9     |\n| 1938-39    | 3.9       | 8.3      | 6.7     | 8.9     |\n| 1939-40    | 5.4       | 8.2      | 6.4     | ?       |\n\nMany of the local Indians are away hop picking in September. It was suggested that this school operate on a nine month basis in my Small school Survey Report, Page 8, and that even this might be reduced to eight months.\n\nUnder present regulations the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School will reopen on October 1st 1940. I would recommend that the academic year in future be reduced to one of eight months from October 1st to May 31st.\n15/7/6440\n\nOttawa, July 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves the Seabird Island Indian Day School being open for 8 months - Viz.: October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941. The Indian Agent and the teacher should be advised accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.

M. Duke\nArchbishop of Vancouver.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter of nomination dated August 31st last received from His Excellency the Archbishop of Vancouver.\n\nArchbishop Duke recommends the transfer of Miss Mabel Boeur, at present teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, to be teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School in the same Agency. He further recommends the transfer of Miss Mary Winter, at present teacher of the Katzie Indian Day School, New Westminster Agency, to be teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, and informs me that in due course he will nominate a teacher to replace Miss Winter at the Katzie School.\n\nI have discussed the transfers suggested above with Inspector Barry who considers them quite satisfactory. I would therefore recommend that the nominations of His Excellency the Archbishop of Vancouver be accepted and that Miss Mabel Boeur be appointed teacher at the Seton Lake Indian School and Miss Mary Winter teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nI should be glad to receive, by air mail if possible, the Department's approval of the above transfers and to know the monthly salary which these teachers will be allowed in their new schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nenc.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have this morning received from Mr. Indian Agent Strang a copy of Miss Mabel Boeur's resignation, dated August 30th last, as teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, the original having been forwarded by air mail to the Department by Mr. Strang.\n\nAlthough Miss Boeur has not complied with the regulations of the Department in the giving of a month's notice of her intention to resign, I am, on the advice of Inspector Barry, recommending that her resignation be accepted, for it would appear that she is now actually in charge of a Provincial School near Vanderhoof.\n\nIn my air mail letter 15/7/7665 of the 4th instant, I recommended that on the nomination of His Excellency Archbishop Duke, Miss Mabel Boeur should be transferred to the Seton Lake Indian Day School, and that Miss Mary Winter, now teacher at the Atzic Indian Day School should be transferred to Seabird Island. Due to Miss Boeur's resignation, I must cancel my recommendations as set forth in my letter of the 4th instant.\n\nHis Excellency Archbishop Duke of Vancouver has now recommended the transfer of Miss Mary Winter from the Atzic School to be teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School. Inspector Barry informs me that such transfer is entirely satisfactory to him. I would therefore recommend that Miss Mary Winter be appointed teacher of the Seton Lake School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nSept. 5, 1940.\n\nHis Excellency Archbishop Duke has been requested to let me have the names and qualifications of suitable teachers to fill the vacancies at the Katzie and Seabird Island Schools.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to Departmental letter 165-5-1 of the 7th instant, in which the resignation of Miss Mabel Boeur, former teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency, was accepted.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter 15/7/7677 of the 5th instant, the Department was notified that His Excellency Archbishop Duke of Vancouver had been requested to nominate a suitable teacher to fill the vacancy caused by Miss Boeur's resignation at the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nArchbishop Duke has now suggested the appointment of Mrs. Lydia Eva Culton, R.R. 1 Haney, B.C., as a suitable teacher for the above named school.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that Mrs. Culton was trained at the Fredericton Normal School, New Brunswick, 1905-06. She holds a Second Class Teachers Certificate in the province of New Brunswick and has had about twenty years teaching experience in the Provinces of New Brunswick, Manitoba, etc. During this time she appears to have received very good reports from her school inspectors.\n\nCaptain Barry further informs me that Mrs. Culton has one child, a girl of some ten years of age, now in Grade 5A at the Provincial School, Haney. Mrs. Culton was deserted last May by her husband whose address is now unknown. She is thus forced to return to teaching to support herself and her child.\n\nOur Inspector of Schools, during an interview today with Mrs. Culton, came to the conclusion that she was\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\na highly qualified teacher and ought to do extremely well in an Indian Day School. He suggests that under the conditions noted above and due to the great scarcity of qualified teachers in B.C., Mrs. Culton might well be appointed, on a temporary basis.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the temporary appointment of Mrs. L.E. Culton as teacher of the Seabird Island Indian School be approved. I would request that the Department's decision in this matter be forwarded as soon as possible, by air mail, and that I be informed of the salary which would be allowed Mrs. Culton at the above named school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

This school will be in operation for an eight-month period; namely, from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment and staff questionnaire will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant the Department approves the appointment of Mrs. Lydia Eva Culton as teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nIt is understood that this school will be in operation from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941, during which period Mrs. Culton will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month. I enclose staff questionnaire which she should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nI am a teacher in an Indian School (Seabird Island). Teachers are not members of the Civil Service. The Department informed me so. For that reason no deduction should be made from my salary for the \"Fund.\" I believe that such payment is deducted every month and has been deducted for my pay here for October, November and December. My salary is $40 per month. Support my child and myself. I pay off the Fund the balance income tax which leaves $3.70 each month.\n\nWill you kindly adjust this matter?\n\nVery Truly,\n\nAgnes E. Oulton.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 22, 1941.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant I may say that present regulations require us to make a deduction of 5% from the salary of all teachers engaged after September 1, 1939. This amount is funded and interest allowed on it and when you give up duties as a teacher of an Indian day school the amount deducted, plus interest, is returned to you.\n\nThe other 2% deducted from your salary is not income tax but National Defence tax which all employees receiving salary above a certain amount are required to pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Lydia E. Oulton,\nSeabird Island Indian Day School,\nAgassiz, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to submit the Day School Return for the quarter ended December 31, 1940, for Seabird Island Indian Day School, teacher, Mrs. Lydia E. Culton.\n\nWith regard to the remarks contained therein I wish to advise the Department that they are very much exaggerated. The complaint of lack of clothing has been investigated and the Indians, with the exception of one family, told the Commissioner that they could provide the necessary clothes; the one exception has only recently returned to reside on the Seabird Island Reserve after an absence of several years and the necessary clothing is being provided, in fact it was already in care of the teacher.\n\nRegarding the statement that the attendance could at least be thirty, there is not this number of children of school age available on the Reserve and it has been explained to the teacher it is not always the policy of the Department to compel children to attend school. I also explained the fact that most of the children had long distances over bad roads to travel to school and regular attendance could not be expected during the winter months.\n\nMrs. Culton, who is 54 years of age and new to Indian work, is living in a small lean-to addition to the Council House used as the school, with her young daughter. These quarters are anything but suitable for the purpose.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nThe teacher ....\nThe teacher is inclined to listen to Indian gossip and take sides. She has not only ignored the Chief but speaks disparagingly of him whom I have always found to be a good average Chief and has always had the confidence of his people. I have endeavoured to point this out to Mrs. Culton but she is rather difficult to convince.\n\nSchool Inspector Barry is evidently satisfied with her work as a teacher and I would therefore respectfully suggest that a transfer to another of his schools out of my Agency be arranged for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nenc.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Strang.\n\nIt refers to remarks made on the December quarter return by the teacher, Mrs. Lydia E. Culston. Please bring the contents of the Agent's letter to the attention of Inspector Barry who will probably have occasion to visit this school within the next few months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nLytton, B.C., June 12, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nIn forwarding the quarterly return from the teacher of the Seabird Island Day School I would draw the attention of the Department to the number of pupils shown as absent for the full term and feel that some explanation is necessary other than given by the teacher as truancy.\n\nOn her complaint I made personal investigation into the matter. It will be noted that there are four more names on the quarterly return than shown on the previous quarterly return ending March 31st, 1941, namely, Margaret and Patricia Pettis, Thomas Harris and Bertie Louie. The first two mentioned have been discharged from the St. Mary's Residential School, Margaret being required at home to keep house for her widowed father and Patricia, a T.B. case, for health reasons. Thomas Harris is a T.B. case also and excused from school for this reason. Bertie Louie, aged 6 years, is much too young and although she attended school for two days this term, should have no place on this register.\n\nRegarding the other four pupils shown absent for the full period, Sylvester Joe is a T.B. case and is excused from attending school regularly; this boy was decidedly far from well when I called at his home. Elsie and Irene Peters are two of seven children in the family that were having an attack of measles and were excused from school during the germination period and under quarantine. Carl Leon's father had removed from the Reserve with his family following employment outside the district.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMrs. Culton ...\nMrs. Culton, the teacher of the school, is an elderly person with no previous experience with Indians, given to gossip which she has exercised among the Indians on the Reserve causing no end of trouble, and is very disrespectful when this has been pointed out to her.\n\nA full report of my investigation was submitted to the Indian Commissioner for B.C., Major D.M. MacKay and Mrs. Culton has since asked for a change of school to another Agency which I have been very pleased to recommend to our Commissioner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAB/RS.\nenc.\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Strang with reference to the Seabird Island Indian Day School. The information in this letter is somewhat different from that contained in Inspector Barry's letter of April 8 which was forwarded to me under cover of your letter of April 9. I should appreciate hearing what action you suggest should be taken with regard to the teaching services at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nLytton, B.C., May 12, 1941.\n\nYour File 15/7/1863.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter dated May 6th regarding the letter from Mrs. Lydia E. Culton, teacher of the Seabird Island Indian School, I beg to report as follows:\n\nI proceeded to Agassiz and went direct to the teacher, requesting the names of the children whom she accused of breaking and entering a house at Agassiz. She gave me the names of Thomas Harris and Benny Joe and although not directly accusing him gave me to understand that Sylvester Joe was also implicated. After listening to her for some time and incidentally so loud did she talk in telling me of drunkenness in and around the reserve, Indians lying on the road and around the church drunk, that the echo from her voice was quite distinct, I left her and proceeded to interview the children reported absent from school.\n\nThe first child I visited was Johnny Bobb who lives with his grandparents. On being questioned as to why he did not go to school as he had always been a good boy, never giving any trouble previously, he came right out and said he did not like the teacher's manner, she shouted too much. I told him he must go to school which he promised to do.\n\nI next went to see Sylvester Joe and his parents. This boy is a T.B. case and has not been feeling well enough to go to school; he is one of the children who will go to the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and it is recognized that he only attends school when feeling well enough. Mrs. Joe and her daughter-in-law were both very much put out with the manner of the teacher, not only with children, but with the people on the reserve generally. I next called on the Pettis children; Margaret, aged 15, was discharged from the Mission School as she was required at home to keep house for her father as her mother is dead. Margaret attended the day school for a short period after her brother married and his wife took over the housework but she is now keeping house for her grandfather, Johnny Bob. Charles Pettis has been kept at home because of a bad cold and also he is another T.B. case and not expected to attend school regularly. Thomas Harris is another case for the new Indian Hospital when it is open. This boy decidedly looks far from well and just wants to lie around all the time. Martin Harris, accused of keeping this boy from school, emphatically denied this and Mary Jane, mother of the boy, when faced with the fact that she signed a statement to this effect said that she told both Father Patterson and the teacher that day that Martin wanted Francis to attend school but the boy was not feeling well enough to do so but the teacher shouted her down and Mary Jane said, \"What could I do when they told me to sign my name?\". Marion Harris, aged 15, said that...\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nsaid that she liked school but could not stand the teacher shouting at her and threatens to run away if made to attend school. Marion has reached the age where her fancies are turning to boys and it would be useless now to force her to attend. I met Mollie on the Peters children, Irene and Elsie, who were first kept at home with bad colds and are now having an epidemic of measles all to themselves. As one gets well another goes down; they are under the care of Dr. McCaffrey. The Indians have all the same complaint, that the teacher shouts at them and bosses them too much.\n\nMrs. Culton does not understand nor ever will understand the temperament of the Indians; they are not used to being shouted at and bullied by officials and as you are aware, Mrs. Culton cannot be told this. To give you an instance of how they take this: On my way to the Reserve I met Fred Even, the blind Indian going to Agassiz which is about 5 miles from his place, to obtain some medicine. I told him that drugs were available from the supply at the school. He said, \"Mr. Strang, I'd rather walk to Agassiz and pay for my drugs than go near that woman at the school.\" Others also complained about her shouting at them when they called for cough medicine, etc.\n\nFollowing up the alleged breaking and entering by Thomas Harris and the Joe boys of which they denied any knowledge, I called on Constable J.H. Davey of the Provincial Police in Agassiz and he showed me the police record of the case where Charles Thomas and George Douglas had entered a house belonging to a Chinese and taken a watch and other articles later recovered by the police and returned to the owner who refused to prosecute. These two boys have no connection with the school whatsoever. This happened during the month of March and the police report is dated the 14th of that month.\n\nI then brought up the complaint made verbally by the teacher of the wholesale drunkenness on the reserve Saturday nights and Constable Davey informed me that regular patrols were made over Seabird Island, more especially on Saturday nights, and that there was no truth in the statement made by the teacher in this regard, that the Rev. Father Patterson had been talking two days previously about the canoe races to be held on May 24th at Maria Slough and the Father had remarked how well behaved the Indians on Seabird Island had been over a long period.\n\nWhile visiting at Johnny Bobb's place, Mrs. William Bobb, (nee Marion Phillip), a graduate of the St. George's School, accused the teacher of causing friction among the people and relating stories to Father Patterson about them, mostly information she has gained through gossip.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA3/R3.\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nYour report 14-2, dated May 18th, in reply to the Indian Commissioner's letter 15/7/1963, has been handed to me for consideration before any further action is taken in the matter.\n\nYour subsequent letter of May 13th, with which you forwarded a letter from Mrs. August Andrew, is also on my desk.\n\nI have discussed very briefly with Inspector Coleman and Major MacKay the contents of your letter and report and it has been arranged that I again visit Seabird Island Indian Day School at an early date.\n\nI note in other correspondence that you suggest that it would be well for Mrs. Gulton to be transferred to another school. I am inclined to agree with you that her usefulness at Seabird Island has been considerably impaired of late but you can readily understand that such transfers are not very easy to arrange. However, when I am at the school I shall advise Mrs. Gulton to request such a transfer, forwarding her letter, in triplicate, to you. Should Mrs. Gulton agree to this course, you will no doubt add your own remarks and recommendations before forwarding her request to the Indian Commissioner. He will then be in a better position to deal with the whole matter.\n\nI am returning herewith Mrs. Andrew's letter of May 12th addressed to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nHarrison Hot Springs, B.C.\nJune 4, 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am returning herewith copy of Mr Indian Agent Strang's report 14-2 dated May 12th last in the matter of Mrs. Lydia Oulton, teacher of the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School.\n\nThe above report, as well as a letter from Mrs. A. Andrew dated May 12th and addressed to Mr. Strang, were, as you will remember, handed to me for consideration before any further action was taken with regard to the teacher at Sea Bird Island.\n\nAs arranged I visited Sea Bird Island this morning and had a lengthy conference with Mrs. Oulton. This school now operating on an eight months basis, there were no children present as the school closed on May 31st.\n\nMrs. Oulton was not shown Mr. Stang's report, but the subject matter of that report was discussed with her.\n\nThe following is a brief outline of the statements made by the teacher to me. It should be read in connection with Mr. Strang's report of May 12th.\n\nMrs. Oulton was informed by me that a number of the Indian parents appeared to be very much upset by her actions, shouting at the children, etc.\n\nIn reply the teacher informed me that previous to her taking up residence at the school the building had been used at night as a meeting place for unmarried couples. She also stated that the Priest's room at the rear of the Church had also been used for the night by unmarried men and women. Mrs. Oulton's arrival at the school had of course put a stop to such action as is indicated above, and she considers that certain Indians are most anxious to get rid of her, and that these people are making statements to the Indian agent which are not in fact true. Mrs. Oulton admitted to me that she did not have a high regard for Mr. Strang, and that she thought she had not had sufficient co-operation from him.\n\nMrs. Oulton still believes that there is considerable drinking going on on this Reserve. She sees Indians going to a house near the school where she believes they obtain \"liquor\". She tells me that she has seen Mrs. Andrew's daughter (?) lying drunk on the road on a Sunday night.\nThe teacher states that Johnny Bob's niece, who was married to a \"white\" man who is still alive, is living at John Bob's place. Another \"white\" man is also living on the Reserve at the same house. This \"white\" man delivered milk from John Bob's wagon to her, Mrs Culton, at the school one day towards the end of May.\n\nThe teacher states that JOHNNY BOBB played truant on two occasions. The grandfather asked the teacher to punish Johnny but Mrs Culton refused. She understands the grandfather did himself strap the boy.\n\nMrs Culton doubts that SYLVESTER JOE has T.B. and asked me for my authority in making a statement that he did have T.B. The teacher pointed out from the register that Sylvester did not attend school a single day, while Miss Boeur was teacher, during the school year 1939-40. The same boy only missed school on two occasions between October and December 1940, while Mrs Culton was teacher. Sylvester missed school on six days during the January-March quarter 1941, and has not been to school since the beginning of April of this year.\n\nThe case of MARGARET PETTIS was discussed with the teacher and it was pointed out to her that the above girl was discharged from St. Mary's School Mission with the permission of the Department, that she was wanted at home, and that being 15 years of age we did not insist on her going to school. I explained to Mrs Culton that in B.C. children reaching their 16th birthday were not forced to attend Provincial schools and that we followed much the same course except in certain special cases.\n\nCHARLES PETTIS has, the teacher states, been playing truant with Johnny Bobb. She quotes Johnny's grandfather and Mrs D. Charles his aunt as making this statement to her.\n\nTHOMAS HARRIS runs around and plays ball on Sunday with the others. The teacher states that Thomas helps his grandfather, Martin Harris. Thomas tells the teacher that Martin Harris will not let him go to school.\n\nMARRION HARRIS has never been near the school since Mrs Culton was appointed teacher. The teacher has never even spoken to her. Marion was only at school for thirteen days during the school year 1939-40 when Miss Boeur was teacher.\n\nMrs Culton had not heard that the PETTIS children were ill with measles. She sees these children around with the other children, and were at the games etc. on the 24th of May.\n\nMrs Culton states that the case of Fred Culton is bound up with a dispute about the purchase of wood for fuel at the end of last year. The Indian Agent left it to the teacher to arrange the purchase and she did not know that Fred Ewen should be given the contract.\n\nI explained to Mrs Culton that in the case of breaking and entering in Agassiz the Joe boys and Thomas Harris had nothing whatever to do with the matter. She had listened to Indians talking about this and I am convinced mixed up names. I did not inform Mrs Culton of the information given by Mr Strang in reference to this particular case, but just told her that she was mistaken, but that I could understand that names had been mixed up in the conversation overheard.\nWhile I consider that Mr Strang's report of May 12th does not disclose all the facts in each case, I do agree with him that Mrs Oulton does not understand the temperament of Indians. I am satisfied that she shouts at the Indians, including the children, and that she is a most difficult person to reason with.\n\nMy own opinion is that the Sea Bird Island Indians are playing with Mrs Oulton and with Mr Strang, and for their own reasons trying to make further trouble between Mrs Oulton and Mr Strang. It is reasonably clear that a section of these Indians do want to get rid of the teacher, as does Mr Strang from his own official correspondence.\n\nWhen a teacher is unable to get along well with her Indian Agent and with the Indians I believe that it is time to take the teacher out of that school. It is very obvious that Mrs Oulton's usefulness to the Department in her present position has been considerably impaired of late.\n\nMrs Oulton's professional work has been reported on twice during the past academic year. Please see my reports of October 26th 1940 and of April 15th 1941, on the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School. Mrs Oulton is not in any way an outstanding teacher, but she has worked hard to improve the standing of her Grades. She did increase the attendance during the year.\n\nI have suggested to Mrs Oulton that she make official application through her Indian Agent for a transfer to another school in B.C. for the next academic year. I also suggested that she write to His Excellency Archbishop Duke to ask him to consider her when making nominations to fill vacancies.\n\nMrs Oulton did not wish to leave Sea Bird Island but tells me that she will follow my advice and ask for a transfer. I think that it may be possible to arrange this later, but the fact that she has a little girl now going into Grade 6 will have to be taken into account. Mother and child were as you know left to look after themselves by the father who does not contribute, I am informed, to their support.\n\nI trust that the solution to this troublesome matter indicated above will be satisfactory to you, and I may say that I intend to inform Rev Father Patterson, O.M.I., if I can see him at Mission tomorrow of the suggestion made to Mrs Oulton and of the reasons for her transfer. He is the Catholic Missionary of the district.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H.B.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6410, file 840-1, part 1)\nLytton, B.C., June 12, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith an application from Mrs. Lydia E. Culton for a change to a school in another Agency.\n\nIn this connection I would be very pleased if this could be arranged and that Mrs. Culton would remove from the Seabird Island Reserve as soon as possible, before she creates any more trouble than she has already done among the Indians.\n\nThe increase in the average attendance during Mrs. Culton's term of teaching is due to the return of families to the Reserve with children of school age, who have been away for several years. Out of the 24 registered pupils shown on her register ending this quarter, 4 were not shown on her last quarterly return. Two of these children were discharged from the St. Mary's Residential School, another is a T.B. case and the fourth is a child of 6 years of age who attended two days during the quarter.\n\nRegarding Mrs. Culton's statement that there are approximately 30 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years of age, it will be noted that she quotes the B.C. School Act as a basis for her statement and this in spite of the fact that she informed me that she was quite conversant with the sections of the Indian Act dealing with schools, as she and School Inspector Barry had gone thoroughly into this on the occasion of his last inspection of her school.\n\nIf, as she states in her letter, Captain Barry is of the opinion that she will not have co-operation from me as Indian Agent, necessary for the proper conduct of the school, to say the least it shows a lack of discretion on the part ....\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\non the part of the School Inspector to pass an opinion of this nature about an Indian Agent to a school teacher under him.\n\nI make this statement, that every teacher in my Agency has had the fullest co-operation possible from me and personal feeling has never diverted me from this policy. Furthermore, any time I have had occasion to complain to the Department regarding a teacher it has proved a justifiable complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAS/RS.\nenc.\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised by Capt. Barry to make application for a change to a school in another Agency for the School Year 1941-42.\n\nIn conversation with Capt. Barry on June 4th the Inspector informed me that the Department was satisfied with the progress of the school for the last School Year especially with the matter of increased attendance and school work in the various grades as shown by his inspections during the School Year 1940-41.\n\nWhile I am gratified with the results I attribute much of my success to the Indian Commissioner Mr. MacKay and his assistant Mr. Coleman, also to the very helpful instructions of Capt. Barry during his inspections.\n\nIt is the opinion of Capt. Barry however that I will not have the co-operation of yourself as Indian Agent necessary for the proper conduct of the school for the coming year. This is based on the unfortunate fact I have not been able to secure your collaboration as Indian Agent during the past School Year. This is shown particularly in the fact that there are approximately Thirty pupils on the Reserve according to British Columbia School Act that are school age 6 to 16 years of age that is according to parents statements to me and my pupils on the register shows twenty four with an average for the School Year of 11.5. While this is an increase over previous years a great deal has yet to be done in this respect and a continued improvement will depend upon the full co-operation of the Indian Agent of the application of the Indian Act to the Indian people of Seabird Indian Reserve with the teacher in charge of the school.\n\nAs I can hardly expect sufficient co-operation from you as Indian Agent in the light of my experience last School Year, I am asking you to forward this application to the Indian Department for their favorable consideration.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nLYDIA E. GULTON\nJune 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 14-2 of the 12th instant with which you forward Mrs. L. L. Oulton's request for a transfer.\n\nIf a suitable school can be found for Mrs. Oulton, her transfer to such school will be recommended to the Department.\n\nMrs. Oulton forwarded a copy of her letter of June 7th addressed to you to this office some days ago. This letter was discussed with Inspector Barry at the time and I was then informed by him that Mrs. Oulton's statement, \"It is the opinion of Captain Barry, however, that I will not have the cooperation of yourself as Indian Agent necessary for the proper conduct of the school for the coming year\" has no basis whatever in fact.\n\nInspector Barry did inform Mrs. Oulton that when a teacher is unable to work in harmony with her Indian Agent it is much better for such teacher to seek a transfer to another Agency.\n\nThe statement that Inspector Barry on June 4th informed Mrs. Oulton that the Department was satisfied \"with the progress of the school for the last school year etc.\" is also not entirely in accordance with the facts. The complete report of what was said during our Inspector's visit to the school on June 4th has been on file here for some days. A copy of this report is now being forwarded for your information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nInspector Barry has mentioned to His Excellency Archbishop Duke that it would be better if Mrs Oulton could be moved to another school for the next academic year.\n\nIt is still too early for us to know just where Mrs Oulton could be placed; but just as soon as His Excellency and Inspector Barry suggest to me a suitable transfer for this teacher, the Department will be informed and requested to approve a transfer.\n\nAs the Department will understand the whole of the above matters are still under consideration here, and it was for this reason that I did not forward the attached file of correspondence at an earlier date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Macay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApril 22, 1942.\n\nMemorandum to\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nfrom Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nRe Mrs. Lydia E. Culton.\n\nIn accordance with your request I enquired into\nthe subject of Mr. Indian Agent Strang's letter of March\n28th, 1942 forwarding the petition of Chief Harry Joseph,\nof Seabird Island Reserve, dated December 10th, 1941.\n\nI met the Chief and his Secretary, Edward J. Peters,\non the 13th instant and endeavoured to ascertain their\ncomplaints against Mrs. Culton, but could secure nothing\nof a very specific nature. They complained in a vague and\ngeneral way that Mrs. Culton interfered in Indian matters\non the Reserve that did not concern her and thus trespassed\non the Chief's sphere of activity. Also that Mrs. Harry\nDavid complained that she was too rough with her children.\nIt is clear that Mrs. Culton is disliked by them.\n\nI understood from Mr. Strang that Dr. McCaffery\nrefused to have any dealings with her and I interviewed\nhim on the subject, but his attitude was that he had no\ndefinite complaint to make but did not like the woman and\nconsequently left her alone as much as possible.\n\nThe school was visited on the 14th, there being\nseven pupils present. The school was fairly clean, but a\nlittle untidy. Mrs. Culton had removed most of the desks\nfrom their slats and they were not very orderly. I in-\nstructed the Agent to see that they were replaced on new\nslats.\n\nMrs. Culton complained that a new pump installed\nhad never functioned, the reason apparently being that the\nIndians had driven the pipe without attaching a sand point\nand the end of the pipe had plugged. The Agent promised to\nhave it remedied as soon as possible. Mrs. Culton also\ncomplained that some new roofing secured for the teacher's\nquarters had never been applied but the Agent stated that\nthey had been waiting for some warm days in which to do the\nwork as otherwise it would be impossible to make it lay flat.\nThe Commissioner for B.C.\n\nApril 22, 1942.\n\nMrs. Culton is a very loud speaking, belligerent type of woman likely to arouse resentment in those with whom she has contact, but there is no evidence of her interfering in Reserve \"politics\" at the present time. In fact the Chief stated to me that she is not nearly as bad as she used to be in this respect. While she is not a teacher I would wish to have in my Agency if I were an Indian Agent, I am unable to show sufficient cause for her removal, unless the foregoing is deemed reasonable grounds for such action. I would point out, however, that if the average attendance is not much better than it appears to be at present, I would suggest that consideration should be given to closing the school until such time as a reasonable proportion of the children are prepared to take advantage of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Coleman\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental letter 165-5-1 of the 19th instant with reference to the Sea Bird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency.\n\nSince I forwarded to the Department on April 3rd 1941 under this office number 15/7/1382 the report of Inspector Barry on the above named school, there has been a considerable amount of correspondence between Mrs Oulton, Mr Indian Agent Strang, and this office.\n\nOn May 7th Mrs Oulton complained to her Indian Agent of his lack of action with regard to certain children of the Sea Bird Island Band, a copy of this letter was also sent to me. I instructed Mr Strang to make an investigation and to let me have a detailed report on the matters brought to notice by Mrs Oulton. A copy of Mr Strang's report is now attached for information, as well as a copy of Inspector Barry's letter to Mr Strang dated May 28th.\n\nInspector Barry was then instructed to visit Sea Bird Island and to interview Mrs Oulton with regard to her complaints and the matters mentioned by Mr Strang in his report. Our Inspector had a lengthy conference with Mrs Oulton, and submitted his report dated at Harrison Hot Springs on June 4th. A copy of this report is now forwarded to the Department.\n\nMrs Oulton in a letter addressed to Mr Strang on June 7th requested a transfer. She also made certain other statements to which Mr Strang objected; in his 14-2 of June 12th, my reply 15/7/2565 dated June 14th no doubt satisfied Mr Indian Agent Strang. These letters have been copied for the information of the Department.\nLyttom, B.C., March 28th, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teacher, Seabird Island Indian Day School\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter signed by the Chief, Harry Joseph, and the Secretary, Ed. J. Peters, of the Seabird Island Band Councillors with respect to the Teacher of their Indian Day School.\n\nAlthough I have had various complaints prior to this petition, from Whites as well as Indians, regarding Mrs. Culton's adverse activities in connection with the administration of this Agency, this petition was withheld until I could visit the School and the Reserve.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the Seabird Island School during this month, I must say that the teacher, Mrs. Culton, treated my visit with the utmost disrespect in front of the children. I interviewed several of the Indians, including the Chief, and find that she has been counselling them not to write their Agent for anything, but to communicate with Ottawa or the Commissioner's office. I talked with Dr. P. S. McCaffrey, Medical Health Officer for the Indians, regarding the situation and he simply informed me that he did not feel like visiting the School, owing to the Teacher's manner.\n\nI do not question her teaching abilities but she is living in the small quarters attached to the council house, kindly loaned to the Department for school purposes by the Band, and the building is not kept as clean as it might be and not nearly as clean as it was kept by previous teachers. The Indians are deprived altogether of the use of this building which they especially require on Sundays during the winter months, as most of them come long distances to attend church and require the building to prepare and eat their lunches.\n\nThe Teacher does not recognize the Chief and has created a decided division among the members of the Band.\n\nI have endeavored in every way to co-operate with Mrs. Culton but she will not be advised and I find that she is a detriment to the welfare of the Indians and I therefore recommend that the Department dispense with her services as a Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMajor D.

Strang,\nIndian Agent\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, June 24th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a letter dated June 18th which has just been received from Indian Agent Strang.\n\nYou will recall writing to me on the 23rd of April with reference to Mrs. Culton, teacher of the Seabird Island School. My reply to your communication was dated April 29th.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to dispense with Mrs. Culton's services at the end of the current month, you may advise her accordingly. Please let me know what action you take in this matter and, at the same time, you should return the attached letter for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

It would be appreciated if you would keep in touch with the situation at Seabird Island and, if necessary, a change in the teaching services could be made for the academic year 1942-43. From the information contained in your letter, I do not see any necessity for changing the teacher at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Strang wherein he recommends that the services of Mrs. Culton, teacher of the marginally noted Indian Day School be dispensed with.\n\nI discussed the contents of Mr. Strang's letter with Captain Barry but as the Inspector was not well enough at the time to make another trip to the school, and also that the complaint involved matters apart from the classroom work, arrangements were made to have Mr. Inspector Coleman inquire into the subject while on duty in the area in connection with other Department matters. A copy of Mr. Coleman's memorandum to the Commissioner following his visit to the school with Mr. Strang is enclosed.\n\nI am not satisfied that sufficient cause has been shown to justify the removal of Mrs. Culton at this time and, therefore, do not concur in the recommendation made by Mr. Strang for her dismissal.\n\nThe reports submitted by Inspector Barry on the progress of the pupils under Mrs. Culton have, on the whole, been satisfactory and, although there have been indications from time to time of a lack of cooperation between the teacher and the Agent, I should not care to say that the teacher was entirely responsible. Perhaps I should add that I have visited this little school on various occasions since Mrs. Culton's appointment, the last visit being made on the 17th instant at which time 13 children were present. My visits were...\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwere all made without previous notification and, apart from finding the class-room untidy, I considered the conditions generally satisfactory.\n\nIn discussing the matter of attendance with the teacher I was informed that a number of the children were absent on the day of Mr. Coleman's visit to the school due to illness and, that under normal conditions there should be no difficulty in maintaining a sufficient average attendance to justify the continuation of the school. This, of course, is a matter that could be given attention and a decision made prior to the commencement of the forthcoming school year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to Mrs. Cullon, teacher of the Seabird Island School, I would advise that I propose to hold the disposition of this matter in abeyance for a short time as it is possible that the present teacher of the Katze Indian Day School or another Catholic teacher in an agency other than Lytton may resign. However, I will advise you further in the matter as soon as something definite can be done.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

Strang,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to let you know that I am keeping Donald out of school till the end of this term. I'm having him to help me weed our garden before we go strawberry picking on May 19th. I was trying to explain that to Mrs. Quilton but she would not listen. We cannot reason with her just as soon as we start talking to her, she starts yelling at us, would not give a person a chance to explain.\n\nOne thing I do not like in her, and it's not only me, all the other parents are the same, she calls down everybody in Seabird Island, and tells that to the children in school hours. We do not like her telling gossip to the children, she can tell that to the elders, but not to the children. We don't approve of that kind of a teacher for our children. I wouldn't want her to be teaching here again for another term. You wouldn't understand Mr. Strang, me and Donald are going out to do weeding and strawberry picking for one month to get enough money to buy our clothing, and come home again to look after my garden, and saly some salmon for our winter supply. You know we cannot get any clothing on $7.00 a month relief and that's why we are going to earn a little money for our clothes. I hope you will understand and will write me a letter of authority to keep Donald home to help me.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd. Mrs. A. Andrew.\nSeabird Island I.R.\nAgassiz, B.C. Dec. 16, 1942.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe held a meeting in regard to our school teacher on this Reserve. We all decided to write and ask you to discharge her.\n\nThere has been many teachers here before her, and we all find it that they done a lot better than her. She also try to interfere with our business and your affairs.\n\nTherefore we come to the conclusion that her services shouldn't be no longer be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Harry Joseph.\n\nEd. J. Peters.\nLytton, B.C. June 18, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn submitting the enclosed Quarterly School Return from Mrs. Lydia E. Culton, teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, I beg to draw the attention of the Department to the statement made by the teacher, under remarks as to progress, etc., that the absence of the Harry children was due to lack of food:\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to this school in the company of Mr. Inspector Coleman on the 14th of April last, the Harry children were absent, and I informed the teacher that I had a request from their mother for shoes in order that they attend regularly, and she informed me in her usual emphatic manner that they lacked for nothing.\n\nI regret to report that since Mrs. Culton's appointment as teacher to the Seabird Island School, she has been a source of worry, not only to the Indians of the Reserve, but also to this Office. She has deprived the Indians of the use of their Council House and lean-to kitchens, where they were always in the habit of meeting and cooking their meals on Sunday when they attended church, as the majority of them have to travel a considerable distance. She is also the cause of a great deal of trouble with her gossip among the Indians, and refuses to recognize the Chief.\n\nOn the occasion of my visits to the School, I have found her anything but courteous, and quite defiant in her manner. This, I have passed over as the children are quick to notice this attitude on the part of a teacher. I have received numerous complaints from the Indians, both oral and written, two of which, I enclose herewith. Last year, at the request of Mr. Barry, School Inspector, instead of asking for her dismissal, she was given an opportunity to apply for a transfer, which she did, and Mr. School Inspector Barry failed to find a school for her.\n\nSince then------\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMM.\nSince then, I have found her more disrespectful than ever in her manner, and, according to the Indians, even counselled them to ignore the Agent in all their dealings.\n\nInstead of being a help in the Administration of this understaffed Agency, Mrs. Oulton has proved a source of trouble and I would respectfully suggest that she be dismissed from her position as teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School, and that she be removed from her place of residence on the Reserve, which she has been occupying the year round.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 24th enclosing Mr. Strang's letter of June 18th, wherein he recommends the dismissal of Mrs. Lydia E. Culton as teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Culton called here a few days ago and I took advantage of the opportunity to discuss with her the various complaints made by Mr. Indian Agent Strang. Mrs. Culton explained that she had not intentionally been discourteous to Mr. Strang but that she had been impatient with him at times for what she considered to be unnecessary delay in dealing with various matters in connection with the operation of the school which she had taken up with him. Mrs. Culton admitted that she probably had gone outside the scope of her duties as teacher in discussing local problems with the Indians, but that her motive in doing so was to be helpful to them and not interference with Mr. Strang's administration.\n\nI informed Mrs. Culton that it was essential that the fullest co-operation exist between the teacher and the Indian Agent and that I was satisfied she was to some considerable extent responsible for the trouble that had occurred. This teacher was also advised that if any further difficulty developed between herself and the Agent that the Department would be asked to dispense with her services. Mrs. Culton assured me that she would do her utmost to co-operate with the Agent and would strictly confine herself to the duties of her appointment.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nP.T.C.\nThe Secretary,\n\nAugust 27, 1942.\n\nIn view of the fact that Inspector Barry's reports indicate that the progress of the children under Mrs. Culton has been satisfactory and the difficulty in securing qualified teachers, I would recommend that the Department approve of Mrs. Culton's employment at Seabird Island for the coming school term.\n\nYour file is being returned herewith as requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Seabird Island Indian Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you express the opinion that Mrs. Lydia E. Oulton might be retained as teacher of the above-noted school.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of teachers existing at present throughout the Dominion, the Department is accepting your recommendation. Mrs. Oulton should be informed, however, that should she at any time in the future refuse to co-operate with the Indian Agent to the fullest extent possible she will be subject to instant dismissal. It might be well if Mrs. Oulton were advised also to confine her activities to the actual school work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

I have experienced trouble in this connection since Mrs. Oulton has taken over the school. She will not recognize the Chief and has made matters extremely difficult in administrative matters.\n\n(Sgd.) A. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1944.\n\nMr. A. Strang, Indian Agent, Lytton, B.C.\n\nWe have just received the September quarter return of the Seabird Island Indian Day School. This was dated in your office on March 21. The form should have been completed and sent to this office immediately after the end of September, 1943.\n\nPresumably the teacher was at the school but the return shows that not one child attended for even a half a day during that month. As some of them are only seven or eight years of age it is rather difficult to realize what use they would have been picking fruit etc. The Department is surprised that you forwarded this return without any comments and I should appreciate hearing from you why there was no attendance at all during that particular month.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLYTTON, B.C. April 4, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nDepartment File No.: 165-5-1\n\nIn reference to Departmental letter of the 27th ultimo with regard to the Seabird Island Indian Day School Return for the month of September I beg to advise that during the month of August and September last, all the Indian families of the Seabird Island Reserve moved to the hop yards at Agassiz and Sardis where they were making high amounts picking hops. As there were quarters provided for the Indians, the children as well as the adults were engaged in picking, with the result that no children attended the school that month. I had thought the return self-explanatory in this respect and for this reason had no comments to make at the time the return was submitted the Department. I regret that my failure to cover the return with a letter has caused such inconvenience to the Department.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D. Ottawa, April 12, 1944.\n\nMr. A. Strang, Indian Agent, Lytton, B. C.\n\nRe: Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 4, in which you submit additional information with respect to the operation of the above-noted school.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Indians were absent from the reserve last year during the months of August and September, would you consider it advisable to re-open the day school next year on September 1? If the Indians are likely to be absent this year, it might be well to re-open the school in October. You might look into this matter and let us have your recommendation in due course.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLYTTON, B.C. April 17, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nDepartment File No.: 165-5-1\n\nIn reference to Departmental letter of the 12th instant in connection with the Seabird Island Indian Day School, I beg to advise that, in view of the annual habit of the Indians of that Reserve to migrate to the Hop Fields during the months of August and September, it would be advisable to open the above mentioned School on October 1st, instead of September 1st.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nOttawa,\nApril 25, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Department has been in communication with Indian Agent Strang, regarding the Seabird Island Indian Day School. Last year the teacher re-opened the school on September 1, but no pupils were in attendance during that month. The Agent states that this condition arose due to the fact that the Indians had left the reserve to go to the hop fields during the months of August and September. Under these circumstances he suggests that the above-named school re-open on October 1 instead of September 1. I should appreciate having your comments on this recommendation.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of April 25th, regarding the proposed opening date of the fall term of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nI have been in communication with Mr. Indian Agent Strang regarding this matter and concur in his recommendation that the school re-open on October 1st instead of September 1st.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 16, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, approving the recommendation of Indian Agent Strang that the Seabird Island School re-open on October 1 instead of September 1. This will mean, of course, that we are back to the nine-month year at this school and I am inclined to feel that by reducing the term one month it is going to add to our difficulties in securing a teacher. However, if you are satisfied with the present teacher, you should ask her if she is willing to accept the school on a nine-month basis for 1944-45. If not, you should endeavour to secure another teacher.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nLYTTON, B.C. June 28, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nYour File No.: 215-7-3752.\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding, particularly, the last paragraph in connection with attendance at the Seabird Island Indian Day School, a subject commented upon by the Inspector's last report, I would advise that the non-attendance is confined, not to two, but to five different families.\n\nOn my last trip to that part of my Agency I discussed this matter with the parents concerned and have their promise that they will do better in the future. It would appear that the irregular attendance of pupils at this school is due, largely, to the fact that there is no one acting in the capacity of truant officer in this Agency.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of May 30th, regarding Inspector Calvert's report on Seabird Island Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Strang's report of the 28th ultimo regarding the poor attendance in which it is noted that the Indian parents have promised to give better co-operation in the future.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay, in his letter dated August 9, 1944, on File 1-1-3, has recommended an increase in salary to the teacher at this school but states that no increase should be allowed to the present incumbent - Mrs. Lydia E. Oulton. Commissioner MacKay recommends an increase of $5.00 a month when another teacher is appointed.

There is still a small number of absentees and the situation has been referred to the R.C.M.P. for investigation. Enforcement of Family Allowance regulations has served to increase the attendance.\n\nThe writer would again stress the point that a change of teachers at this school would aid greatly in creating better harmony between the school and parents of the children.

Oulton, teacher of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nOn several occasions, I have suggested to Archbishop Duke that a change should be made at this school but the shortage of qualified teachers has made it impossible to make the necessary arrangements. It is too late to make a change now that we have entered upon a new term, but the matter is being kept in mind with a view to taking action once a good opportunity offers.\n\nD.M.

Get them up to a certain point, then they remain done and when they return I must proceed. By the time the records are made and I can proceed with new work home they remain and do not return for months in some cases. It is then a case of reviewing again so they forget readily.\n\nThis makes it very hard for any teacher to advance pupils regardless of how hard you work.\n\nWhat I want to learn is this. Does the Department approve of comments made in column \"Remarks\" as I have made? Also this so that the Department may learn why the children do not advance in grades.\n\nWill you kindly inform me whether or not the Department approves of my remarks.\n\nYours Truly Lydia E.

Culton, employed as teacher at the Seabird Island Indian Day School, Lytton Agency.\n\nThe Department is aware that Mr. Indian Agent Strang on various occasions in recent years requested the removal of Mrs. Culton from the school on the grounds that she interfered in matters on the Reserve outside her province as teacher and also that she failed to extend to him the cooperation necessary in the best interests of the operation of the school and his administration of the Indians of the Reserve. A perusal of Inspection Reports on this teacher indicates that her work in the classroom could be regarded as fair and it is altogether likely that had she been content to confine her activities to her duties as teacher she would have been able to get along much better with the Indians and Mr. Indian Agent Strang.\n\nThe situation at Seabird Island has been the subject of discussion with Archbishop Duke since early last year with a view to finding a satisfactory solution, but in the absence of a suitable transfer the alternative was to close the school, a move that did not appear desirable. In conversation regarding this matter with Archbishop Duke a few days ago, I suggested to him that Mrs. Culton be transferred to Homalco Indian Day School which has become\nvacant as a result of the transfer of Mr. Grist to Pemberton, and His Excellency agreed to this arrangement. Having this in mind I went out to Seabird Island yesterday and informed Mrs. Culton that the Department could not permit the existing situation at the school to continue and that a change must be made. At the same time she was advised of the vacancy at Church House and agreed to accept the transfer to our school at that point. I would therefore recommend that her transfer from Seabird Island to Komalco be approved and that her salary at Komalco be the same as that paid to Mr. Grist while he held the position as teacher at that place. The Department's decision by air mail at an early date in regard to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nD. N. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 30 December 1946.\n\nMajor D.M.

In view of Inspector Davey's comments concerning Mrs. Bonnerterre's age and suitability, we concur in your remarks about her employment at this school. However, considering the extreme shortage of teachers, is there any possibility of employing her at one of your hospital day schools?

Before her application for the position at the Seabird Island School was forwarded to the Department I interviewed Mrs. Bonneterre and as a result of that interview I am convinced that she could not fit into any teaching position that might become vacant or is vacant at the present time. In addition to this I do not believe that she would consider employment at the Hospital as she was somewhat concerned about the possibility of contracting T.B.

The School Board has indicated a price of about $30.00 monthly for this service on the understanding that the children be inspected for cleanliness and that no more than eleven travel on the bus.\n\nA survey of the situation reveals that the accommodation of eleven children would meet the needs of the pupils for the coming academic year and I would therefore respectfully recommend that this offer receive the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nR.F.

The method you suggested for straightening out this matter is not suitable to me for many good reasons.\n\nAs yet there are several debts incurred from a long period of illness and unemployment which have the highest priority claim on my present salary. Also the method the Government has chosen to claim its income taxes and the other rules and regulations pertaining to it. Since the amount is large enough for me to think about I might point out that if in the eventuality of my sudden demise (such things occurring at any time to the least expectant) the money would be returned then I would have lost the benefit of its good use (the matter of my estate being already attended to).\n\nSurely a more amicable solution to this problem will be found. Please understand that I will try to assist you in anyway that does not necessitate my making cash payments for the settlement of this account.

It appears from reports received that her services have not been entirely satisfactory, and it is desired that a qualified teacher be engaged for the next school year. You should inform Mrs. Carpenter in due time that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church authorities, it will be necessary to consult them regarding the appointment of a successor to Mrs. Carpenter. You should take this matter up with the Church authorities in due time, and also with Mr. Inspector Cairns, and submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for the position. You will please keep this matter in mind and make all necessary arrangements, as requested above, in due time to have a suitable teacher engaged for the next school year.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector Cairns that you have been instructed to notify Mrs. Carpenter that her services will not be required after the end of June, next, and to take the necessary action to obtain the services of a successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

It was intended that the labour would be provided by the Indians without cost to the Department, but the teacher, Mrs. L. E. Oulton, employed a local white carpenter without authority from the Agent or this office. The teacher's reasons for this are that the Indians were not available to do the work at the time and as the weather was wet and stormy, such action was necessary. Mrs. Oulton has been advised that in future she must secure the requisite authority before incurring expenditures involving the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

He has answered in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. William Swan, Hatzic, B.C., would undertake the work on a daily basis. Mr. Swan is a well known and reliable contractor and builder and has done good work for us at both the Kamloops and St. Mary's Residential Schools.\"\n\nHe has also requested that your branch undertake the supervision and responsibility for the construction of this building.\n\nTherefore it will be in order for you to advertise for tenders for the construction of a standard one-room school at this point.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Photo taken at approximate astronomical bearing of S50\u00b0W in a direction toward the bridge over Maria Slough.\nRe: Seabird Island School, Lytton Agency\n\nAs requested, I visited Seabird Island together with Mr. Davey, Inspector of Indian Schools and Mr. Strang, Indian Agent, Lytton Agency, on May 12, 1947, to determine a suitable site for a single room school with teacher quarters.\n\nSeabird Island\n\nSeabird Island is a delta island about 5 miles long and 1\u00bd miles wide located in the Fraser Valley, 1\u00bd miles north east of Agassiz. The island, which is approximately 70 ft. above mean sea level, is covered with a heavy growth of birch, poplar, alder and willow, and some fir and cedar. Patches of land varying from 2 acres to 35 acres have been cleared and farmed by Indians. These farmed areas are on the south western two-thirds of the Island. The area is higher than most delta islands of the Fraser, and does not require dikes or pumping equipment.\n\nSchool Site\n\nThe area considered to be most convenient was a level area near the south west end of the island where the provincial government road crosses the island. At this point there has been established a church, small community hall and recreation facilities. See \"A\" and also photographs, Appendix II. The school site is adjacent to and north east of the playground. Diagram \"B\" is a rough sketch of suggested position of school buildings and domestic facilities. It also gives an indication of river condition. On May 12, 1947 river levels were at ground level at proposed site. The elevation of the site does not vary by more than one foot.\nNature of soil Drainage\n\nReferring to Sketch \"B\", the playground, church and community hall surface soil is of a clay and even grained fine sand which appears to drain fairly well. The site chosen for the school is about 6\" higher than the playfield and the surface soil is of even medium sized grain sand. The sand is not very firm and would require spread footings. Three feet below the surface this sand changes to a 1\" gravel mixed with sand. The gravel is reasonably firm and suitable for footings.\n\nThe water table of the site (which is true of the whole island) rises and falls according to the level of the Fraser River. The water table can be considered to be equal to the height of the river, except in winter when it is probably two feet higher. The Fraser generally reaches its highest level in June and at that time is probably some 6 feet above the winter level. Therefore, the highest water table occurs in June and may remain at a high level for one month.\n\nLevels of the river, school site and road bridge gap are shown on sketch \"B\". Fraser River levels are recorded at Hope, Chilliwack and Mission. Estimated river heights at Maria Slough adjacent to the school site have been determined from these records and incorporated into sketch \"B\" showing probable water table levels.\n\nAgricultural drain tiles could be used to drain away roof and surface to the river but would not be effective under maximum Fraser flood conditions. However, at this time the rainfall is fairly light. If at any time water closets were established in the school, a septic tank properly constructed would work effectively.\nWater Supply\n\nA small stream of about 1 gal. per minute flows down a steep mountain to the west of the island and the school site. It is said this stream does not dry up. A possible point of tapping this stream is some 200 feet from its mouth. This would require a pipe line 1400 feet long - 300 feet over land plus 600 feet over Maria Slough, from the proposed school.\n\nWater also may be obtained from a well located anywhere on the school area. Such a well would have to be some 16 feet deep. This well is recommended at this time. Chemical tests on water taken from a well 1 mile away showed such water to be very satisfactory for domestic purposes. See Appendix I.\n\nElectricity\n\nAgassiz some 4 miles from the school site is served with electricity from the B.C. Company. As there are few possible customers in the direction toward and past the school, the B.C. Company consider it will be some time before lines will be extended into this area.\n\nClimate\n\nClimate conditions are as recorded at Agassiz, namely:\n\nSunlight - 1422 hours\nRainfall - 62 inches\nAverage winter temperatures - December 37\u00b0, January 35\u00b0, and February 38\u00b0.\n\nExtreme temperature usually in January and seldom lower than 0\u00b0. This temperature may occur once in five years. Prevailing winter wind is from the east.\n\nRiver Levels\n\nExtreme high water levels such as that of 1894 apparently occur rarely. The 1894 flood was the highest in the period of record, 1875 to date, on the Thompson River. (RG 10, volume 6410, file 840-5, part 1)\nFraser and 1856 to date on the Columbia. It reached a gauge height of 25.75 feet on the Fraser at Mission. Flood waters about 20.0 feet on the Mission gauge apparently occur about once every five years. This level is considered the danger point for most diked areas in the whole Fraser Valley.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe school basement floor should not be below a level corresponding to 20 feet on the Mission gauge. A suggested level of 2.0 feet below the top of the bridge cap for the top of the basement floor should result in its being free of flood waters, except those of the magnitude of that which occurred in 1894. It is estimated that this level would correspond to a level of 23 feet at the Mission gauge.\n\nMosquitoes are very prevalent in this area during the early summer season and it is considered all windows which may be opened should be provided with screens.\n\nFuel available is wood, coal or oil. Sawdust might be available, but assured supply is doubtful. It is recommended coal fuel be used.\n**APPENDIX I**\n\n**CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER**\nfrom well on Johnny Bow's property, 1 mile from proposed school site.\n\n**LOCATION:** Seabird Island (in Fraser R.) **DATE SAMPLED:** May 12, 1947\n**IDENTIFYING MARKS:** 2 miles north of Agassiz **SAMPLED BY:** A.

Chemist\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Day School, Seabird Island I.N. #1,\nLytton Agency, B.C.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 11th last and your notation thereon dated April 15th, 1947, we have recently received from Mr. C.E. Webb, Vancouver, a report with plans prepared by Mr. Unsworth of his staff, relating to the site of the above named school.\n\nWe are forwarding to you herewith for the information and records of the Indian Affairs Branch two copies of each of the following:\n\n(a) extract from Mr. Unsworth's report,\n(b) appendices I and II to the report,\n(c) Plan (A) of Seabird Island and Plan (B) of the proposed school site.\n\nIt will be noted from the report that the site was selected by Mr. Davy, Inspector of Indian Schools, Indian Agent Strang and Mr. Unsworth as being the best suitable and convenient for the erection of the school.\n\nFrom the data furnished we would recommend that the basement floor be laid at a level of 2'-2\" below the present ground level at the site, and that the earth be raised up (terraced) around the building to an elevation of 2'-4\" above the ground level for a distance of about 15 feet around the building. This would ensure the building resting upon a solid sand and gravel sub-ball, the basement floor and the concrete footings being above the height of flood waters (excepting that recorded in 1894) and the possibility of drainage by gravity flow of water from the roofs, basement floor and foundation drains to Maria Slough\u2014a distance of approximately 450 feet.\n\nSuch drainage line is not, of course, included in the Trade Specifications covering the standard building with which the Indian Affairs Branch has been furnished.\n\nRegarding the water supply, it is recommended that a well about 16 feet deep be sunk at a point clear of the terracing approximately where shown on site Plan B. It will be noted that chemical tests show water taken from a well 1 mile away to be pure for drinking purposes.\n\nJ.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6410, file 840-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNo service piping into the building is included in the Plumbing Specification and it is assumed that Indian Affairs will install a cover with hand pump above the well.\n\nFly screens also are not included in our Standard Specification for this school, but since mosquitos are prevalent in the District, screens 1-1/8 inch thick with 14 x 14 galvanized cloth mesh should be made and fitted into all opening windows at the school. It should be noted also that storm sash which are included in our specification for this type of school will not be required at Seabird Island.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 27th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

Under the circumstances and with our shortness of staff and number of projects on hand, with which you are familiar, we are not in a position at the present time to say when the construction of this school can actually be undertaken.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, July 14th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Seabird Island Indian Day School,\nLytton Agency, B.C.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of June 23rd, we wrote to Indian Commissioner Mackay in the hope that he could arrange for the erection of the building. In his reply he states that it is impossible for him to undertake the supervision that will be necessary in constructing the school and consequently we trust that your Branch will be able to arrange for its erection. In this connection I might refer you to our memorandum of March 3rd.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPR/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 165-5-5 (W.T.)\nSeabird Island Indian Day School\n\nI have your letter of June 26th, 1947, and note that the Department is prepared to proceed to secure authority for the construction of the above noted school once information with respect to costs are obtained.\n\nThis is a project which should be handled in its entirety by the Surveys and Engineering Branch who should interview any builders interested in taking on the work, and prepare the necessary details with respect to estimated costs, as this office, although always prepared to do what we can to assist in such projects, has not the staff to undertake the supervision necessary in such construction.\n\nMy opinion is that it is going to be difficult to have construction of any importance undertaken by contract. The supply of materials continues uncertain and there are other factors influencing builders against taking contracts. It appears at the moment at any rate that we shall be under the necessity of employing a carpenter foreman to undertake the work under the supervision of the local office of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nD.

This would ensure the building resting upon a solid sand and gravel sub-soil, the basement floor and the concrete footings being above the height of flood waters (excepting that recorded in 1894) and the possibility of drainage by gravity flow of water from the roofs, basement floor and foundation drains to Maria Slough - a distance of approximately 450 feet.\n\n\"Such drainage line is not, of course, included in the Trade Specifications covering the standard building with which the Indian Affairs Branch has been furnished.\n\n\"Regarding the water supply, it is recommended that a well about 16 feet deep be sunk at a point clear of the terracing approximately where shown on site Plan B. It will be noted that chemical tests show water taken from a well 1 mile away to be pure for drinking purposes.\"\n\"No service piping into the building is included in the Plumbing Specification and it is assumed that Indian Affairs will install a cover with hand pump above the wall.\n\n\"Fly screens also are not included in our Standard Specification for this school, but since mosquitoes are prevalent in the District, screens 1-1/8 inch thick with 14 x 14 galvanized cloth mesh should be made and fitted into all opening windows at the school. It should be noted also that storm sash which are included in our specification for this type of school will not be required at Seabird Island.\"\n\nTherefore, it will be in order for you now to approach Mr. Swan at Hatzic and any other contractors whom it is felt would be willing to undertake the construction of this school.\n\nThe following changes in the specifications will be permitted,-\n\n(1) The elimination of the storm sashes and the substitution of fly screens for them.\n\n(2) If asphalt shingles are in short supply in your vicinity, we will authorize the use of insul-brick siding in its place.\n\nWe will expect to hear from you in the near future concerning the digging of the well recommended by Surveys and Engineering Branch and also with estimates from Mr. Swan and such other contractors who are interested. Immediately this latter information is obtained, we will request an Order in Council authorizing the construction of this school.\n\nBFN/MGD\n\nDirector.\"\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate January 23, 1948\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|\n|          |                |                      |                |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Mr. E.

Strang, Indian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nConstruction of One-room Day School and Attached Teacherage - Seabird Island.\n\nWe have now a stock of blueprints, specifications and bills of materials for our standard one-room day school and attached teacher's residence.\n\nThe Auditor General has insisted that, in future, the clauses of the Public Works Act with regard to advertising for tenders be adhered to. During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Seabird Island Day School in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us:\n\n(a) The names of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49. These other means\n\n..... involve\ninvolve:\n\n1. Direct approach to contractors when advertising has failed to produce tenders.\n\n2. Construction on a day labour basis.\n\n3. The erection of a prefabricated school.\n\nWith regard to (2) above, the Department, as previously stated, has a complete bill of materials for the construction of this standard school. Other agents have successfully had this school constructed this year by employing a foreman-carpenter and Indian helpers. The drawings and specifications are very clear and the Department buys all the necessary materials. I give you this information so that you can consider such a mode of construction if advertising fails.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving from you the information required in paras (a) and (b) above. We should also be advised as to the availability of hydro and water facilities and their distance from the school building.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 27, 1948.\n\nMr. A.

I am arranging to send you, under separate cover, a set of the plans and specifications of this particular school. In view of the fact that water will be provided from a well, as per Mr. Unsworth's memorandum of May 22, 1947, it is suggested that you consider the placing of the pump in one of three places:\n\n(a) in the basement, in the room marked as Store-room,\n\n(b) that it be installed to provide a flow of water into the sink called for in the blueprints in the kitchen of the teacher's residence.\n\n(c) You may consider it better to have this pump located in the yard outside the school. We have found that local conditions vary to such an extent that agents may wish to make a decision as to the best location of the pump.\n\nIn any event it is recommended that you now make\npreparation for the digging of this well. It is most essential that an assured source of water be provided before construction of the school is begun. We will expect to hear further from you in the near future concerning this matter.\n\nBernard N. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 12, 1948.\n\nMr. A.

Strang, Indian Agent, Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nSeabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 1h-2-165 of February 23.\n\nYour recommendation with regard to the well being dug in the basement has been noted. Unless you are assured of a steady source of water, it might be preferable to have the well dug outside the school building so that it can be easily cleaned out and will not become foul over the years.\n\nWe have had some difficulty with the pressure tank and small gasoline engines in other schools. This has been due to the fact that many teachers do not understand the operation of these gasoline engines and the Indian Agent has been plagued with minor repairs and adjustments, etc., to the engines. Therefore, we have been using hand operated pressure tanks with some success.\n\nThis would mean that the well would be just outside the school building and connected to the pressure tank in the basement by a pipe at least six feet underground. This pressure tank would be hand operated and the teacher would have to maintain the pressure once or twice a day in order that the pump would operate into the kitchen sink.\nFurther to our letter of January 30th, we have had several discussions with Inspector Ostrander of Saskatchewan. He has reported that Contractors are not particularly interested there in accepting a flat contract for the construction of this school. It is not his intention to recommend advertising but he is instead proceeding with the construction of these schools on a day labour basis.\n\nWe have, therefore, submitted two types of day labour tenders:\n\n(a) For a foreman carpenter at a wage varying from $1.25 to $1.50 an hour.\n\n(b) For a flat labour tender on the school (usually about $4,000.00).\n\nIn either of the above instances, the Department provides the materials as per the standard bill of materials which we have prepared. Could you please advise me whether there are any Contractors interested in the above proposals. If so, we can proceed to order the materials immediately for delivery in May and June. This would eliminate the necessity of advertising for Contractors.\n\nBernard F.

Immediately upon receipt of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or schedules referred to herein by the Minister of Labour regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and maintain in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, carried on or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names of tradesmen employed, all wages paid in full and total the wages paid and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claims for payment a statement attesting by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour in the various trades of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted.

In spite of the progress made in arranging for the construction of a school at this point I feel the Department would be well advised to consider the use of a prefabricated structure and would so recommend.\nMay 12, 1943.\n\nMr. Alex Strang, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Lytton, B.C.\n\nWith reference to requisition of the\n3rd instant, you may purchase the following\narticles for use at the Seabird Island Day\nSchool:\n\n6 tins Lye\n48 pkgs.

This would mean so much for the health of all concerned, and besides, add a practical lesson in what ought to obtain now in this Province in all homes.\n\nI am sure you realize why I write these few lines and if I can help to get this from the Department I would very gladly do whatever I can.\n\nIn the new school to be built at Anaham this year we are asking the same favor of the Department, and it means so much for so many for so little.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n\"W.M.

You will note that delivery is from four to six weeks, the reason being that windows, casings, doors, etc., do not conform with standard sizes commonly used in British Columbia. These items consequently must be made to order with considerable delay and higher costs. This is a point which I have for some time been considering bringing to your attention. The Department's standard school plans, while no doubt conforming with standard construction practice in eastern Canada do not conform with standard practice here nor does the sash, millwork, etc., conform with standard size here.\n\nI would suggest that construction costs could be reduced and construction expedited if arrangements were made for a revision of the Department's standard school plans for use in British Columbia. I can arrange this and submit amended plans and specifications for your approval if you so desire and in the meantime as far as the Seabird Island school is concerned I would suggest that an order be placed with Sigurdson Millwork Co. Ltd., in accordance with their quotation. There may be some minor duplications of items previously ordered from the Valley Lumber Yards.\nLimited, but to arrange for deletion of these minor items from Sigurdson's quotation would entail considerable delay and as it took over three weeks to secure the quotation we do not wish to delay the matter further.\n\nW.S.

These will be quoted upon separately and billed separately and the order will be covered by a purchase order from this office. The Company is also giving us quotations on the balance of materials required and in the event that these materials cost more than the amount which this office is authorized to purchase their quotation will be referred to you. This procedure is considered advisable for the reason that the contractors are anxious to complete the interior of the building so that they may receive payment on that part of their contract price due on completion of this particular phase of the work.\n\nW.S.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, D\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Seabird Island Indian Day School\nYour file 840-5 (E)\n\nWith reference to Supt. Strang's letter of November 24th attached and Progress Payment No. 3 in favour of Messrs. Laughington and Reynold, Mr. Strang and Mr. Reynolds called at this office recently and discussed with me the contract covering the erection of the Seabird Island school, and at the same time arrangements were made to secure the additional materials required for completion of the building.\n\nThe contractor's request for a progress payment at this time is not considered to be unreasonable inasmuch as had the necessary materials been made available to him as required the school would likely have been completed before this. I might mention that this office was under the impression, reference Mr. Neary's letter of April 15th to Supt. Strang and his reply thereto, that the Departmental Purchasing Agent had arranged for the supply of all necessary materials and it was only on receipt of your various Signals messages requesting us to secure materials that we realized that the matter had not been attended to. The exterior work completed by the contractor at this time is the equivalent or more of the interior work required by Progress Payment No. 3 and I feel that the payment should be made at this time.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nLytton, B. C.,\nNovember 24, 1948.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Progress Payment Number 3 in favour of Messrs. Laughington & Reynolds, regarding construction of the Seabird Island Indian Day School.\n\nI have indicated on the face of the Payment Sheet that interior work has been completed with the exception of floors and that additional work has been performed on the exterior of the building.

Laughington and Reynolds was entered into without reference to this office and we do not have a copy on file. Mr. Neary's message indicates, however, that in the absence of any reference to the contrary, the contractor's tender should include the provision of labour for the installation of the furnace, piping, etc., which should be supplied by the department.\n\nThe former Superintendent, Mr. Strang, and Mr. McGregor, who is presently acting as Superintendent at Lytton, are of the opinion that in as much as the contractors were unnecessarily delayed by our failure to make materials available when required with the result that they have lost money on the contract, the department should meet the cost of installing the heating system.\n\nThe attached tenders as listed below cover supply of the necessary materials and installation of the heating system, and you will note that each Company was requested to tender separately on material and labour so that if the department insisted on the installation being made by the general contractors, a separate order for materials could be readily placed.\n\nCENTRAL SHEET METAL WORKS:\nMaterial $447.00\nLabour 220.00 $667.00\n\nWHELEN HEATING AND SHEET METAL:\nThis Company apparently makes installations for Alcock, Downing & Wright Ltd.\nMaterial $462.15\nLabour 150.00 $612.15\n\n....cont'd.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.

If there is any further interference on the part of the local missionary in the matter of attendance, I should be pleased if you would report the same to the Department. I have noted that, for the time being, the parents are satisfied to send their children to the school. Your action in explaining the position of the teacher is commended.\n\nThat portion of your letter which refers to the proposed Hope and Seabird Island Indian Day School will receive attention in other communications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report the position I am in in regard to the proposed and also the existing schools in this Agency.\n\nYesterday I visited the Shalalth School, which is on the Seton Lake Reserve, and which is a joint Provincial and Indian Department school, and under the circumstances the teacher is supplied by the Provincial Government.\n\nThis school I am glad to report is progressing excellently, the children are making splendid headway and the parents are very well satisfied. The priest visited the reserve recently and told the Indians that they were to insist upon a Roman Catholic teacher, otherwise they were not to send their children. Naturally they were very concerned about this, and sent for me. I explained the whole thing to them and told them that we had no jurisdiction over the teacher, as she was appointed by the Provincial Government, and furthermore, as no religion was taught in the school, it would not make any difference anyway. My explanation apparently satisfied them for the time being. How long it will last remains to be seen.\n\nNow in regard to the proposed schools for the Hope and Seabird Island Bands, I have applied to Father Welch for a Roman Catholic teacher for each of these, but can get no satisfaction from him. He just replies that he is taking the matter up with Ottawa. I have also taken the matter up with Mr. Cairns, who advised me that there are no Roman Catholic teachers that he knows of available. He further states that he met Father Welch at Mission school recently who told him that if we put in a Protestant teacher at Hope he would see that there were no children attending the school. Now they will attempt the same thing at Seabird Island School. I feel sure that they will not attempt to supply us with a teacher, as I do not think there are any available, which would mean that if we put in a Protestant teacher, we will have to prosecute the Indians in order to see that the children are sent. The Indians themselves tell me they want the schools very badly, and do not care of what denomination the teacher is, as they realize that religion is not being taught.\n\nThere is certainly not room at the Mission School for all these children, and yet they try to prevent us starting day schools.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Would you kindly look up the correspondence and see me at your convenience.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, Nov. 16, 1923.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your confidential report of the 6th instant, relative to the advisability of appointing a Roman Catholic teacher at the Seton Lake combined Indian and White School in the Lytton agency.\n\nThis question was the subject matter of a petition, signed by certain Indians on the reserve, and in reply I informed them that the Provincial Government, at the request of the white settlers, commenced this activity. The Department agreed to pay half the salary and the current expenses, if the Indian children in the vicinity were allowed to attend a combined school. Either the local white trustees or the Provincial Government appointed the teacher and she is responsible to them. It might be advisable, in view of your recommendation, to have the parents of the local white children take up this question with the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. G.S.T. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n39 Clerk St.,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, January 24, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Winnie R. Larson, who has been teaching at Seton Lake for the past four months, with reference to her payment for the last quarter and we are furnishing her with the information she desires.\n\nIt would appear from her letter that she is no longer teaching at Seton Lake school, and I would be pleased if you would intimate whether a new teacher has been appointed. If so, you should state whether the new teacher was selected by the Provincial Department of Education or by the local trustees.\n\nPlease advise the Department also of the name of the teacher, if one has been appointed and, in future, I would request you to promptly advise the Department of any change in the teachers of this school.\n\nA request for supplies for this school was received here on the 14th instant, and the articles requested have been ordered from the Government Stationery Office. They are being sent addressed to Miss Larson, Seton Lake, B. C. If she has left the school, you should communicate with the postmaster at this point and arrange for the delivery of these supplies to Miss Larson's successor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of departmental letter dated January 24th, and in reply beg to state that Miss Winnie Larson's quarterly return for the Seton Lake School was sent in in the usual manner at the end of the quarter, and as cheques are now sent by the Department direct to the payee, I have no record here whether salaries are paid or not. No doubt Miss Larson's cheque was sent to Seton Lake, and it would be forwarded to her in due course.\n\nRe the appointment of the new teacher, I beg to draw the Department's attention to my letter dated January 24th, in which I stated that a new teacher, Miss Ruth M. Watson, had been appointed by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIf the requisition ordered for this school has been forwarded addressed to Miss Larson, Seton Lake P.O., B.C., these will be handed over to the right authorities.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.

This is very much to be regretted, as the pupils have been making very good progress. There has been a regular attendance of eight Indian children, the full number. I would very strongly recommend that the Department keep this school open, for in another year there are three more white children who will be available, and I think that then the Provincial Government might again be persuaded to bear half the expenses. The last teacher that we had, Miss Fox, was excellent, and got the children on very well, with the result that they were all moved up in their classes, and it seems too bad that now this school has been established, and doing good work, it should have to be closed.\n\nThe salary being paid was $90.00 a month, but as it is in an out of the way place and living is difficult, it is really none too much.\n\nUnder the circumstances and taking everything into consideration, I would strongly recommend that the Department give this favorable consideration, and decide to carry it on themselves.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nHS/MD\nOttawa, January 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, informing the Department that the Provincial Department of Education advises that, owing to the fact that there are only two white children in attendance at the Seton Lake combined white and Indian day school, they have decided to withdraw their grant towards the teacher's salary. Would it be possible to have them reconsider their decision, in view of the fact that there are still two white children attending the school and that next year there will be three additional students? You might correspond with the Provincial Department and mention these facts, and refer also to the difficulty in which the Department of Indian Affairs will be placed if they withdraw their support. The number of Indian children attending is hardly sufficient to warrant the Department continuing the activity without assistance. Please let us know the results of the correspondence with the Provincial Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nMr. Agent Graham has sent me a copy of a letter forwarded to the Indian Department at Ottawa. I visited the Shalalth School June 5th, 1924. There were NINE Indian pupils present. The number enrolled was ten.\n\nIt appears from Mr. Graham's letter that the Provincial Government has withdrawn its support from this school and we are faced with the problem of ten Indian children who will be deprived of an opportunity of getting an education unless the Indian Department is prepared to pay the teacher's salary in full.\n\nIt will be remembered that there is a building, desks, and school requisites. So the matter of keeping the school open is simply to pay the teacher's salary for six months.\n\nI have read the Agent's letter and would heartily recommend that the school be kept open at least till June 30, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to the withdrawal by the Provincial Department of Education of their grant towards the salary and expenses of the teacher of the combined white and Indian day school at Seton Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have received the communication referred to by you from Mr. Agent Graham. We have requested the Agent to take this matter up with the Provincial Department with a view to having them reconsider their decision, at the same time mentioning the difficulties in which this Department will be placed if they withdraw their support. We understand that there are still two white children attending, and that next year there will be three additional white students. We have requested the Agent to advise us as to the results of his correspondence with the Provincial Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 402, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to departmental letter dated January 8th, I beg to state that I have taken the matter up with the Provincial Educational Department, re getting some assistance from them on behalf of the two white children attending the Shalalth School.\n\nI am now in receipt of a reply from the Superintendent of Education, in which he states that this is impossible, as they have a correspondence course, and if the white children want it they can take this up.\n\nI might state that I have been in communication with Mrs. Burroughs, who lives in the vicinity of this school, who has offered to carry on this school on behalf of the Indian Department, for the sum of $60.00 per month, up till the 30th of June.\n\nMrs. Burroughs, I might state, has had high school education, and taken a business course, so would be quite capable of taking charge of this school, as the highest class is the fourth reader.\n\nI would like to strongly recommend that the Department give this matter favorable consideration, and continue the school on under these conditions, as it is too bad that eight Indians children, who are now attending regularly, should be barred from any education, as it will be impossible to send these children now out to the Boarding School. If the Department agrees to this, I will be glad if you will wire me, so that I can get the school started. I can get Mrs. Burroughs on the phone, whilst it takes several days to get a letter to her.\n\nHoping to have a favorable reply,\n\nAssist.

In this connection I beg to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Engage Mrs. Burroughs as teacher Seton Lake School. Total salary of $60 per month will be allowed until end of June, next.\"\n\nPlease arrange with Mrs. Burroughs to begin duties as soon as possible. The sum of $60 per month is the total amount that we can pay her for her services. We note you consider that her qualifications would be satisfactory for the work at this school. Please inform the Department of the date on which she begins duties and also state her Christian name as this information is necessary in the drawing of cheques for her salary.\n\nIt may be that more white children will be available for the next school year beginning September 1st and that the Provincial Department of Education would then reconsider their decision and continue their grant towards the salary of the teacher.

I wrote to the Dominion Department but I did only give white children here. I asked Mr. Graham if I took Indian children to make up the number would he find out if the Indian Department would help. He told me yes. We had a meeting here at was arranged that I would supply everything for the school except the logs. The Indians got the new logs & the sides & they put the school up. Now because I had to go down to Vancouver for a few months through sickness everything goes on the bum and the Indian Department takes the school and everything puts a white woman in to teach the children draws a salary of $60.00 per month and she knows no more about teaching than I do now if I Indian Department.\n\nShalalth Feb 28, 1925\n\nIndian Affairs.

She should not have been appointed teacher Seaton Lake school. Letter follows.\"\n\nWhen my night letter of January 27th, authorizing the engagement of Mrs. Burrows, was directed to you, it was taken for granted that you would secure a teacher for the Seaton Lake Day School whose religion was that of the Indian children who attend. The Department wish to supply Roman Catholic teachers at day schools where only Roman Catholic pupils attend is well known to you, and I am surprised that you nominated for the Seaton Lake School a Protestant teacher.\n\nPlease communicate with Mr. Inspector Cairns and arrange for the incumbency of a suitable teacher for this school when the month's notice to Mrs. Burrows is concluded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter of March 9th, together with a copy of one from Mrs. J. Nebagilati, in regard to the Shalalth School.\n\nThe correspondence we had in regard to this school you are acquainted with.\n\nWhen this school was first thought about Mrs. Nebagilati took the matter up with me with a view of getting a joint school started, as she had two children there who needed education, and there were three other wives. She asked me if I could get the Indian Department to join in as was done, and everything went along smoothly until the end of last year. For a very considerable time there were only the two white children attending, viz: Mrs. Nebagilati's, when the Provincial Government advised me that they had decided that they could not carry it on for only two children, and this is what I reported to you.\n\nWhat Mrs. Nebagilati says about the building is quite true. She was so anxious to get the school started that she was quite willing, if the Indians would cut the logs and erect the building, to supply the other material, such as doors, shingles, windows, etc., which she did, hoping to get assistance from the other white man who had three children, but it was not long before these two parties were not on speaking terms, with the result that Mrs. Nebagilati had to bear the whole cost. I am not in a position to say what she did pay for the different articles supplied, but think that she is entitled to some compensation, if the Indian Department intend to carry this school on solely as an Indian School.\n\nIn regard to the teacher, I might add that Mrs. Nebagilati has not been living in the vicinity for some time as she was in Vancouver running a boardinghouse, and as you know Mrs. Burroughs just offered to carry the school on as a stopgap, which I recommended to the Department in order that the school might not be closed. The whole trouble is that Mrs. Nebagilati and Mrs. Burroughs are not on speaking terms, and she resents Mrs. Burroughs teaching and earning the sum of $150.00 a month. Mrs. Nebagilati came to see me, and asked to see the correspondence, then apparently went away quite satisfied. I am very much afraid that it is just a storm in a teacup for it would be quite impossible for Mrs. Nebagilati to teach the school, and I am of course of opinion, but I do think that Mrs. Nebagilati would be entitled to some compensation for the money she expended in fitting up the school. I might say the school under Mrs. Burroughs is doing very well at present.\n\nTrusting that this explains the whole matter,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 21st, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the request made by Mrs. J. Rebagliati to be re-imburied for the expenditure incurred by her in the erection of a building now being used for Indian school purposes at Shalalth (Seton Lake).\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that Mrs. Rebagliati supplied certain materials in the construction of the building. Until the future of this school is decided, as to whether it will be conducted solely as an Indian school or whether it will be conducted as a combined school for white and Indian children, assisted by a grant from the Provincial Department of Education, we are not in a position to decide as to whether any compensation can be made Mrs. Rebagliati towards the expenses incurred by her or not. Should, later, there be a number of white children to attend, and the Department renew its grant, we could not consider reimbursing Mrs. Rebagliati, and she should in that event look to the Provincial authorities. However, if the school is conducted after the end of the present year, solely for the benefit of the Indian Children, Mrs. Rebagliati's claim will be given consideration. I shall be pleased if you will inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

I was quite aware that as the reserve was a Roman Catholic one there should be a Roman Catholic teacher, but at a moment's notice it was impossible to obtain one, and I had taken the matter up with Father Joseph Duplanil, who is the head of the Oblate Order. I am enclosing copies of letters written to Father Duplanil on the subject which will speak for themselves, so you will see that they were given every opportunity of recommending a teacher of their faith, but I got no replies to these two letters.\n\nThe first one was written on December 22nd, 1924, nearly a month before I ever took the matter up with the Department re Mrs. Burroughs. You will see the copy of a letter from Father Duplanil dated Dec. 8/23, in which he states that he could not recommend a teacher for this school.\n\nI am taking the matter up now with Mr. Cairns and hope that we may be successful in getting a teacher to suit, as I hate the thought of closing this school down, especially as Mrs. Burroughs was kind enough to step into the breach as a stopgap, and I have done all I can think of to get a Roman Catholic teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H.

Moreover a School is not called Catholic School because the teacher belongs to the Catholic Church.

He states that a few months ago he took this matter up with the Rev. John Duplanil, but without any result.\n\nAs Mrs. Burroughs's term, according to your decision, expires on the 15th of April, if there is no Roman Catholic teacher available, am I to close the school up indefinitely until the services of one is obtained, or can Mrs. Burroughs stay on?\n\nI think I explained fully that I had done all in my power to obtain a Roman Catholic teacher before.\n\nKindly wire me instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(H.

I note that arrangements have been made which permit the present incumbent to continue her services until the end of the current academic year.\n\nI regret that I cannot reimburse you for your transportation costs to Lytton. The requirements of the Auditor General are such that the travelling expenses of church authorities cannot be met from Parliamentary Appropriation.\n\nI trust that your holiday to the Old Country has been of much benefit and that you are able to attack your problems with renewed vigour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

April 19, 1925\n\nMr. Scott Roy,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour wire regarding the Otonabee School, addressed to Father John, Mission, Ont., could not be delivered personally as the Rev. Gentilhomme was visiting his Indian missions and could not be located. Acting upon your instructions, the company brought it to me. It came during the holy week, a very busy season for a Catholic priest; I could not get a suitable teacher on such short notice. However, I felt that a change or teacher in the middle of a term, was detrimental to the welfare of the children. On the other hand, I am sure that these children are better off in school than in the woods of Otonabee. Acting upon this opinion, I phoned to Very Rev. O'Keefe, the Provincial of the Order, in Rome. I was authorized by him to call on Mr. Graham, your agent of education, and to consent to retaining the present teacher of Otonabee School for the term. Of course Mr. Graham agrees. I shall be obliged to consult you before appointing another teacher in the future.\n\nOf course you know that Otonabee School has nine pupils, three are 13 years old, the other seven children are very small indeed.\n\nI beg to include voucher for my transportation to Ottawa. It is not fair that I should suffer financially when I am trying to repair the slander of your agent.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We note that you have explained the circumstances to the Catholic Church authorities who are interested in this school, and the Department is assured that you did everything in your power to have a teacher of the Roman Catholic faith appointed. As you have previously been informed, Mrs. Burroughs may remain as teacher for the balance of the present school year, viz. to June 30th.\n\nYou should, however, take up with the authorities of the Catholic Church the question of nominating a fully competent teacher for the next school year, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. If a teacher with rather good qualifications is secured, the Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $85 per month for the ten teaching months in the year. You should, in due time, forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher who is nominated by the Church authorities for this school for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your wire, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Burroughs may remain teacher Seton Lake School to June 30th.\"\n\nI beg to state in connection with this that Father John Duranil came to see me on the matter, and after going through all the correspondence, he stated that one letter apparently had gone astray as he had not received it, in which I had written to him, and asked him to nominate a teacher. I explained that I had done everything in my power to obtain the services of a Roman Catholic teacher, and as I had no reply to the letters I had written him, rather than let the school close I asked for the temporary appointment of Mrs. Burroughs. We agreed to this up to June 30th, and I have advised her accordingly.\n\nI wish the Department would advise me exactly the salary is to be offered for a teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

In this connection I would refer you to your letter of March 14th and official letter of March 21st, last. As you are aware, the Seton Lake School has been under the full control of this Department since January, last, and I would request you to state if you consider any payment should be made to Mrs. Rebagliati. If so, you should furnish a detailed statement of the amount which you consider is due her.\n\nI may say that if Mrs. Rebagliati's children have been attending the school since the Department assumed control, it is considered that some charge should be made, and we would, therefore, reduce the amount which you might state is due her for her outlay. In your reply, therefore, you should state whether this woman's children, or any other white children, have been attending the school since last January.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

I wanted to take out my arm chair and cushion that I put in for the benefit of our teacher but the door was locked and a padlock put on by Burrough he said Mr Graham told him to do that and if we opened the door we would be through up for breaking in I don't see what right Mr\nGraham has to do with the School as the Department in Victoria said I could not make Mr Graham one of the Trustees when he said he would be one now I will be more than obliged to you if you will get this settled up if the School is not to be run the same as it was at first yours\n\nMrs & Rebaglia\nOttawa, August 10th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. R.

Father Welch.\n\nWhile Mr. Finnegan has no professional qualifications, he has had 18 years' teaching experience. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $80 per month for the ten teaching months in the year.

The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $60 per month for the ten teaching months in the year.

R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. J. Rebagliati,\n14 - 12th Ave. West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to departmental letter dated September 1st, in connection with the claim made by Mrs. Nebaglatti for reimbursement for an outlay that she made in the erection of the building now used for a school at Shalalth on Seton Lake I.R.\n\nI wish to say if you will refer to her letter addressed to you and dated February 26th, you will see that she admits that she took the matter up with me, with a view of getting a joint school. This was done, as with the consent of the Indian Department and the Provincial Education Department the school was opened as a joint school.\n\nAccording to the Provincial Education Department's regulations, the parties applying for one of these schools have to provide the building. This the Indians and Mrs. Nebaglatti agreed to do, and supplied one. The Indians supplied the logs, and built the building, and Mrs. Nebaglatti the lumber, door, window sash, etc., but she could not have spent the sum of $150.00 on this, which she claims she did.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns and myself went into this matter very carefully yesterday, and came to the conclusion that Mrs. Nebaglatti only spent the money that she had to, in order to get the school started, and she had her two children educated in it whilst it was being run jointly by the Provincial government and the Indian Department. When the Provincial Department decided to withdraw their grant, and I applied to the Indian Department to keep it open on behalf of the Indians, Mrs. Nebaglatti took one child out, but the other one has remained on, and is still attending. This child, of course, has been attending just through the goodwill of the teacher.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, Mr. Cairns and myself came to the conclusion that Mrs. Nebaglatti has had her money's worth out of the building in the line of having her children educated, and as Mr. Finnigan, the present teacher, states that he has no objection to this child remaining on, we consider that Mrs. Nebaglatti has been well repaid, and that there is nothing due her.\n\nI might add though that there is a table and a chair belonging to Mrs. Nebaglatti, that the Department might purchase. The stove, which she put in there, was an old one, and is now completely worn out. This will have to be replaced. The door also, which was provided by Mrs. Nebaglatti, was secondhand, and will also have to be replaced, as it will be absolutely useless for another wintertime.\n\nAssist.

Rebagliati for reimbursement for smutlay made by her when the building now used as the Seton Lake Day School was being erected. I note that Mr. Inspector Cairns and you have gone into this matter very carefully and that you consider there is nothing due Mrs. Rebagliati, as her children have been attending the school. She will be advised accordingly.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase from Mrs. Rebagliati the chair and table at present in the school. The Department will expect you to secure these at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, Sept. 24, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nIn further reference to official letter of the first instant regarding your claim for reimbursement for expenses incurred in the erection of the building now used as the Seton Lake Day School, I have to state that Mr. Agent Graham and Mr. Inspector Cairns have gone into the matter very carefully. They advise the Department that the Indians supplied the logs and erected the building and that, while you supplied some lumber, etc., they do not consider your expenditure was very large. On the other hand, your two children attended the school while it was being run jointly by the Provincial Government and the Department of Indian Affairs and since last January, the date on which this Department assumed full control of the school, one of your children has been attending and no charge has been made. Taking this into consideration, it is felt that there is nothing due you.\n\nThe Department is, however, prepared to pay you a reasonable amount for the table and chair that you placed in the school and Mr. Agent Graham is being instructed to see you regarding this. No payment can be made for the stove, as it was an old one and is now completely worn out. The door also, which you provided, was second hand and will have to be replaced as it would be absolutely useless for another winter. Therefore, no allowance can be made for the door.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. J. Rebagliati,\nSeton Lake,\nB.

If you consider there is a sufficient number of children likely to attend during the winter months, you should make every effort to obtain the services of a teacher in time to begin duties when the school reopens after the coming Christmas holidays.

On receipt of departmental letter of June 29th, I took the matter up with Mr. Cairns, as he always likes to be consulted in these matters, and take up with the church authorities any matters referring to the teachers. I discussed this personally with him, and he promised to come to inspect the school himself, but circumstances willled otherwise, and he was away on sick leave, but I have written him several times since he returned to his duties with a view of having him visit this school at as early a date as possible. On my last visit to the reserve I went round to see if there were no other children available, and did get one put in, so every child of school age now on the reserve is on the roll. There of those have to travel a considerable distance, and, of course, in bad weather find it difficult to get there, especially as their parents are very poor.\n\nI am writing Mr. Cairns again to see if he can spare the time to visit this school with me.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Two of the children, who were constantly absent without leave, and apparently not controllable by their respective parents, were ordered by me to be sent to a Residential school, preferably Mission.\n\nGeo. J. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing the resignation of Mr. S. T. Finnegan, teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School, and in reply have to inform you that the same is accepted.\n\nWe note that Mr. J. T. Kiernan was appointed to succeed Mr. Finnegan for the balance of the present school year, and that he began duties on April 21st, last. It is doubtful if his services would be satisfactory for the next school year, and in this connection I would refer you to your report on this school for the month of May, last, in which you stated that Mr. Kiernan was unable to control the children. I shall be pleased to be advised whether you consider his services would be satisfactory for the next school year, and, if not, if you could arrange for the nomination of a suitable teacher.\n\nAt the end of the present quarter, the usual quarterly report showing the attendance, days taught, etc., should be prepared and forwarded through your office. The number of days taught by Mr. Finnegan and Mr. Kiernan should be clearly stated thereon, in order that the proper adjustment of salaries can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Finnegans, and asked for his resignation promptly. In fact sent him a copy of your letter, and only now am in receipt of his reply, in the form of his resignation, as he has been ordained a priest.\n\nMr. J.M.

It is noted that the progress during the quarter has been good, taking into account the sickness among the Indians during January.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher has caused accounts to be opened in the Royal Bank of Canada for three of the pupils, who have balances to their credit as mentioned by him. As these are the private funds of these pupils, the department could not advise the manager of the Bank to not allow them to withdraw their savings until they are twenty-one years of age, as suggested by the teacher.

Kiernan, substitute teacher at the Shalalth Indian Day School, has resigned, handing his resignation to Mr. Agent Graham.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that Miss Mary Wadel, who has taken her Matriculation examination and has served as teacher in the Osayoos Indian Day School, be appointed to this position, duties to commence January 1st, 1928.\n\nMiss Wadel has rendered faithful service. She has won the confidence and goodwill of both parents and pupils. The Osayoos school is in an isolated part of the Province and Miss Wadel on account of the loneliness of the location is sending in her resignation. She would like, however, to transfer to another Indian school.\n\nMr. Agent Graham, in whose Agency the Shalalth Indian Day School is located, joined me in a conference regarding the schools of his Agency. He is acquainted with Miss Wadel and assured me that he would be able to work with her for the welfare of the pupils.\n\nI might add that Miss Wadel has had two and a half years' experience in the Osayoos school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of J.

The salary allowed her will be at the same rate as she is at present receiving, viz. $55 per teaching month. Mr. Agent Graham is being informed of the approval granted for her transfer, the salary she will receive and the date on which her transfer becomes effective. We are also informing Mr. Agent Ball, Vernon, in whose Agency the Osayoos School is located, and requesting him to discuss with you the matter of obtaining a teacher for the Osayoos School, if in the opinion of yourself and Mr. Ball the teaching activity at this point should be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Kiernan, the substitute teacher at the Seton Lake Indian Day School, I beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Cairns has recommended the transfer of Miss Mary Wadell to succeed him. Miss Wadell has been teaching the Osoyoos Indian Day School in the Okanagan Agency since September, 1925. The Department is approving of the transfer of Miss Wadell to commence duties at the Seton Lake School at the beginning of the new year. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85 per teaching month. I have to request that you will give Miss Wadell every assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

As Miss Waddell is a Roman Catholic and acceptable to the church Mr. Cairns thought that this would be a good move, and so immediately wrote to you to this effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.

I am herewith enclosing you a summary of the transactions which occurred in connection with the proposed appointment of Mr. J. P. Kieran as teacher of the Shalalth Indian Day School.\n\nWith regard to the attendance at the Osayoos Indian Day School, I beg leave to say that I have not seen Mr. Agent Hall since I received your letter of the 21st inst.\n\nMr. J. P. Kieran is a capable man and I feel certain that if he is appointed results will be attained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools of B.C.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe following is a list of the transactions leading up to the appointment of Mr. J. P. Kieran as teacher of the Shalalth Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Mary Wadell resigned her position as teacher of the Osyoos Indian Day School, and asked for a transfer to another school.\n\nAs Mr. J. T. Kiernan, substitute teacher at Shalalth Indian Day School, resigned his position, Miss Wadell's appointment to this school was recommended to the Department.\n\nThis was approved by the Department, but in the meantime Mr. Ball persuaded Miss Wadell to stay on at Osyoos until June 30th, 1928.\n\nThe application of Mr. J. P. Kieran, of Vancouver, for the position of teacher at Shalalth School has now been approved by Mr. Graham, and is awaiting confirmation by the Department.\n\nThe Department's attention is hereby drawn to the fact that these two men have names very much alike. Mr. J. P. Kieran is an applicant for the position left vacant by Mr. J. T. Kiernan.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools;\nP.O. Box 606,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nW.M. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 606,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJune 22, 1931.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Shalalth Indian Day School (Seton Lake) in the Lytton Agency.\n\nI regret that I have to recommend that the services of the present teacher, Mr. Joseph R. Kiernan be dispensed with as from the end of the present school year.\n\nI have on my file of applicants a teacher who is a Roman Catholic, holds a First Class Certificate for Alberta, has twenty years experience, is at present employed as teacher of the Fort Babine Indian Day School, and whose wife is a registered trained nurse. I should like to have this teacher\u2014Mr. C.J. Daly\u2014at the Shalalth Indian Day School, should he be appointed to this position, I believe that the services of his wife as a Field Matron would be of the greatest possible advantage to the Indians on the adjacent Reserves.\n\nMr. C.J. Daly's address is Indian Day School, Fort Babine, Topley, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nJoseph P. Kieran. Age 61. No qualifications; experience three and a half years in this school.\n\nMr. Kieran, in my opinion, knows nothing whatever about teaching. As far as educational work is concerned, the school is in a deplorable condition.\n\nI have given the teacher a list of texts and work books which should be in the school. I have taught a number of \"Demonstration Lessons\" to indicate method in Number Work and Reading. I believe fact that this was wasted time, as the teacher is too old to benefit by the observation of the above lessons. I asked the teacher not to beat any of the children whom he had been doing. I do not consider it a good plan to carry a stick around in one's hand, as this teacher was doing when I reached the school. This man is quite unfit to exercise the functions of a teacher in my opinion.\n\nThe teacher walks around with a stick in his hand and shouts at the children. The discipline is weak. The teacher appears to have no idea that teaching is a scientific profession. He has no knowledge of method. Please see special recommendation attached to this report.\n\nI do not believe that the services of Mr. Joseph P. Kieran are satisfactory. I consider that, for the sake of the children at Shalalth, a change should be made at the end of the present school year.\n\nThough Mr. Kieran has now been the teacher of this school for over three years, the progress of the children is very unsatisfactory. He shows no signs of any training in teaching, being quite ignorant of method. He is not the type of man that should ever have been selected as a teacher for young Indian children. His personality and manner are in themselves enough to make a change in my opinion absolutely necessary.\n\nI, of course, regret the necessity of this recommendation, but if I am to do my duty, no other course is open to me.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Strang was with me throughout my inspection of the school. I understand that he will also make a similar report to the Department of Indian Affairs. It was at his special request that I visited the Shalalth School at this time.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nVICTORIA, B.C., June 21, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith submitting the report of School Inspector Barry on Shalalth Indian Day School in the Lytton Agency. It will be noted that a change of teachers is recommended owing to the unfitness for the position of Mr. Joseph P. Kiernan. I am of the opinion that Mr. C. O. Daly, who is at present teacher at the Fort Babine School in the Babine Agency, should be employed to teach the school at Shalalth and the services of his wife, who is a trained nurse, be utilized as a field matron to look after the Indians of the Seton Lake Band, in view of the fact that these reserves are a considerable distance from Lillooet where Dr. Stewart is located and there is no regular highway between Lillooet and the Indian Reserves, consequently these Indians are not visited by the doctor but on very rare occasions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Barry on his inspection of the Seton Lake (Shalalth) Indian Day School, and recommending that the services of the present teacher, Jos. P. Kiernan, be dispensed with. In this connection I have to say that Mr. Agent Strang will be requested to notify Mr. Kiernan that his services will not be required for the next school year.\n\nRegarding your recommendation that Mr. C. O. Daly, who is at present teacher at Fort Babine, be employed to teach this school, and that the services of his wife be utilized as field matron for the Indians of the Seton Lake Band, I have to say that there is no position established for a field matron in the Lytton Agency. If Mr. Daly and his wife are transferred to Seton Lake, the only salary we could provide would be for teaching services. It is considered that this arrangement would not prove satisfactory to Mr. and Mrs. Daly, in which event it will be necessary to arrange to obtain a qualified teacher in time to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will take this matter up with Mr. Inspector Barry and Mr. Agent Strang, with a view to nominating the services of a teacher. As the school at Seton Lake is under the auspices of the Catholic Church, it will be necessary that the teacher appointed be of that faith. We are requesting Mr. Agent Strang that he act with Mr. Inspector Barry in obtaining the services of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, July 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn has forwarded the report of Mr. Inspector Barry on his recent inspection of the Seton Lake (Shalalth) Indian Day School. The Inspector recommends that, owing to his unfitness for the position, the services of Mr. Jos. P. Kiernan be dispensed with. I have, therefore, to request that you will inform Mr. Kiernan that his services will not be required for the coming school year.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain a successor in time to reopen the school after the present summer holidays. Please take this matter up with Mr. Inspector Barry, with a view to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher. As the school is conducted under Catholic auspices, it will be necessary that the teacher nominated be of that faith. Please forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom Mr. Inspector Barry and yourself recommend for the position for the approval of the Department. The matter of obtaining a suitable teacher should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKee,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some three and a half years under appointment by the late Mr. Cairnes I have been the teacher in charge of the Indian Day School at Shalalath, British Columbia during which time I have been performing my duty to the best of my ability and, as I thought, to the satisfaction of the Department. Recently, however, much to my surprise, like a bolt from the blue I received a letter from Mr. A. Strang, the present Indian Agent of the Lytton Reserve that after the present Summer holidays my services are no longer required; no reason being given. This day I am writing Mr. A. Strang requesting the reason; a copy of my letter to him being herewith enclosed. Under separate cover for your perusal I am forwarding as specimens of my efforts a number of copy books of the children.\nIn case this matter shall not have yet come to your particular attention, this letter is being written and I request that you have an enquiry made and advise me of the reasons for this drastic action.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of prompt consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph P. Kieran\n\n(Joseph P. Kieran)\nOttawa, August 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, relative to dispensing with your services as teacher at the Seton Lake (Shalalth) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the report of our Inspector on the services being performed by you was such that no other course of action could be considered, and the Department directed Agent Strang to notify you that your services would not be further required.\n\nThe Department has received the copy books which you forwarded as specimens of the work done by the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. Kieran, Esq.,\nBridge River,\nB.C.\nLytton, B. C.,\nAugust 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated July 29th, in regard to the appointing of a teacher for Shalalsh Indian Day School on Seton Lake Indian Reserve No. 1, accepting the services of Mr. Desmond Burden-Murphy who applied for this position.\n\nI have advised Mr. Burden-Murphy of his appointment and requested him to open the school on or about September 1st, next, as instructed by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nBridge River, B.C.\n8th August 1931.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: Shalalath Indian School\nLYTTON RESERVE, B.C.\n\nBy reason of the shortness of time that remains before the reopening of school in September next, and of the distance between here and Ottawa I am writing you at more length concerning my recent dismissal as teacher at the above mentioned Indian School with the hope that I shall be reinstated so as to carry on at the commencement of the school term.\n\nMy dismissal does not seem warranted. I wish to direct your attention to the instructions given me by the late Mr. Cairnes, the then inspector and by whom I was appointed; these you will find under the heading of Remarks in my first Annual Report dated 31st March 1928; namely, to teach the children, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, and a little Geography, the map of Canada. Although, in the said Remarks in my said report I think I did not refer to writing, Mr. Cairnes very distinctly\ntold me that I could use my own judgment as regards the McLean system. In this regard I would ask you to look over the copy books that I sent you or to have them inspected by some of the Inspectors of Schools in your department who are experienced. You will note that I write the headlines and how I assist the children in this one matter.\n\nDuring the whole three and a half years of my employment I have never missed a minute away from the school; I have done many things for the children outside the curriculum; giving them candies every week; frequently bread and butter for their lunch when they hadn't any. I have kept their shoes in repair at no cost to them and at Christmas time I gave them clothes and shoes I got from Vancouver friends apart from and irrespective of the grant from the department.\n\nApparently, Mr. Gerald Barry, your new inspector, came to the school on the 15th of June last with his mind made up to have me fired and so to make as bad a report as he could. I have been informed since, that before coming to the school he had lunch with Mr. Jones, Manager at Bridge River of the British Columbia Electric Company and that when in conversing, Mr. Jones praised my system of education, Mr. Barry was not well pleased and made remarks to Mr. Jones to the effect that I was\nMr. Barry's appearance when he came into the school, and his subsequent, gruff, dictatorial and seemingly insulting manner bore out his predetermination. He spent about an hour and a half in the school, an hour of which he devoted to showing the children all he knew, and the remaining time asking questions. He would not look at the exercise books. The children were intimidated, and he insisted in talking to an eleven year old girl who had been only a couple of weeks at school and who can speak only very little English. He was very impressive in expressing that it was wrong to say \"2 and 1 is 3\" that such should be \"2 plus 1 is 3\"; and that \"4 from 5 and 1 remains\" is also wrong but that it should be \"5 take 4 away and 1 is left\". He found fault with the children counting on their fingers; said it should be done with matches. But, children have fingers when they haven't matches. Etc.\n\nI have no doubt that if some one else, a man experienced in such matters, were sent to examine this school and without preconceived ideas, my Indian children will compare very favourably with the children of any other school\u2014white or red\u2014.\nI think I am entitled to better consideration. Certainly, it does not seem just that I should be dismissed apparently for carrying out the instructions received from the former inspector, the late Mr. Cairnes.\n\nI am most anxious to continue as teacher at Shalalath School; as well, it is most disastrous in these times for me, a man of sixty-two years, to be so relieved of my only employment and source of sustenance.\n\nBe good enough to give this matter your present attention so that I may carry on in September.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Joseph P. Kieran)\nOctober 24, 1931.\n\nDear Miss Millar,-\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of October 19. I am glad to give you some information as regards the discharge from the Service of Mr. Joseph P. Kieran who was a teacher of the Indian Day School at Shalalth, B.C.\n\nAbout a year ago we appointed a competent School Inspector to take the place of the former incumbent of the office who had died. He is an experienced educationalist. I am attaching hereto, an extract from his report on this school, which caused the dismissal of Mr. Kieran. As there are many unemployed teachers in British Columbia, we were able to engage an excellent teacher to take Mr. Kieran's place.\n\nIt may interest you to know that when I was in Vancouver in August last, someone called on me on Mr. Kieran's behalf. He was accompanied by Mr. Kieran and I had the advantage of having an interview with him. I may say that I was very unfavourably impressed and I felt that no injustice had been done to the Indians by his dismissal and I am quite sure that there is no position in our Department to which he would be eligible for appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMiss A. E. Millar,\nSecretary to the Prime Minister,\nEast Block,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 19, 1931.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have before me a communication directed to Mr. Bennett by Mr. Joseph P. Kieran, who was apparently employed at the Indian School at Shalalth, B.C., for three and a half years. Perhaps you would be good enough to let me know the circumstances under which his services were dispensed with, in order that I may advise him. He is very anxious to be employed by the Department, if there is any vacancy where his services can be utilized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nBridge River, B.C.\nOct. 6th\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the pleasure of acknowledging receipt of your favor of 3rd inst., and to thank you for your courtesy and kindness in so promptly replying.\n\nYour letter is the first intimation I have received about vacating the residence at the Eaton Lake School. Mr. A. Strong - Indian Agent - never referred to it when here last, nor have I had any communication of any kind from him.\n\nI have never refused to leave this shack, as I was never asked to, and my position is simply this - I have no where to go, until I get something to do. I was not prepared for the position in which I find myself, as I had, perhaps, deluded myself in thinking, from\nthe remarks many times passed by Mr. Graham (then Indian Agent) that I would not be interfered with as I was carrying on as satisfactorily as I was.\n\nI have no money - indeed I owe the local storekeeper $74.00, and at the moment I don't see how I am going to pay him, as I depended on my usual cheque coming. I tried to dispose of my Radio for which I paid $150.00, but failed, although it is a practically new machine. Had I known that I would lose the school position, I would not have bought it. Anyway, I am in a rather unenviable position, and I would not remain one minute here if I had anywhere else to go. I cannot remain inside during school hours, as I can neither read nor write or account of hearing every word spoken in the School Room, and I am afraid to make any noise lest it might disturb them - so I have to go out somewhere from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. I assure you it is heartbreaking wandering around.\naround without anything to do, or\nanything to which to look forward,\nespecially in this country where\npractically one sees no one except\nan occasional Siwash Indian,\nand nothing to break the monotony\nof an idle and useless existence.\n\nI must get something to do,\nas I can not bear to be idle, quite\ninexpensive of the fact that one has\ngot to live. I care not what\nthe work is, subject, of course, to my\nphysical limitations, nor what the\nhours are, nor very much what the\nremuneration may be, as long as I\ncan get along fairly comfortably.\n\nI cannot refrain from\nremarking that some one still\ntakes enough interest in me, to\ncontinue writing untruths about\nme to the Dept.\n\nAssuring you that I neither have,\nnor have I had, nor could I have had,\nany intention of remaining here, only as\nslow a time as possible, and hoping that\nthis rather prolix explanation will\nclearly\nclearly show my position,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph P. Kieran\n\nP.S.\n\nI may, perhaps, be allowed to make some remarks about this residence.\n\nIt was erected by Mr. Shergan - who was then teacher here - from scrap lumber, and in the usual inefficient way of an amateur. It is a ban to against the school. He bequeathed it to his successor, Mr. Kierman, from whom I inherited it. It was then not in a habitable condition - the rain was coming down almost everywhere, the roof being merely covered with tar paper. The entrance steps were broken down. I have added to it an extension of six or seven feet, and put in two windows, remodelled the entrance, and shingled the roof. The shingles cost me nothing, as there was enough remaining over.\nover from the shingling of the School Room. These shingles were ordered before I came here, so that I had nothing to do with there being some over. The extension I added at my own expense, and I must say that it is now good enough for a not very fastidious spigle person. I don't mind any expense I went to about it, as I had three and half very happy years in it, and consider I got very good value. Mr. K. Graham knows in what condition it was when I came here.\nSeptember 30, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, applying for another position in the Department's service. I may say that your application for any position in the Government Service could not be considered until you have vacated the residence at the Seton Lake Indian Day School, as requested by the Indian Agent. I shall be glad to hear further from you when you have complied with our Officer's instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph P. Kieran, Esq.,\nBridge River,\nB.C.\nBridge River, B.C.\nSept., 24th, 1931.\n\nDuncan C.

As the salary did not admit of saving much money, I am in a very awkward situation, and I assure you that you would be doing a good act by appointing me to the position of Policeman at Lytton.\n\nI trust that you will take into consideration my three and a half years service in the Department, and my knowledge of the Indians, their habits and customs, and a good deal of their language.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph P.

Under the circumstances I have requested the Archbishop to make his nomination direct to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa.\n\nHarold Weeks is 26 years of age and holds the degree of B. Com. from the University of B.C. For some time he was Private Secretary to the Archbishop. After receiving his degree Mr. Weeks attended the Vancouver Normal School and now holds a B.C. First Class Interim Certificate. He is of course a Catholic and is anxious to teach in an Indian Day School.\n\nSome days ago Mr. Weeks called on me, as advised by His Excellency the Archbishop, and I introduced him to the Commissioner who agrees with me that Mr. Weeks is an excellent type of young man who, with his fine training at the University and Normal School, might later be worthy of a position under the Department in a capacity other than that of a teacher.\n\nShould the Department accept the Archbishop's nomination in due course, I shall arrange to give Mr. Weeks some help before he leaves for his school. His present address is 1240 Haro Street, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nShalalth, B.C.\nJune 30, 1938.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby respectfully resign my position as teacher of the Seton Lake Indian school.\n\nAs I am about to be married on July 5th-I thought it best to resign right away.\n\nI fully enjoyed working with the little Indians- both here and at Agassiz.\n\nThanking you and the Department for past favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) \"C. MacLennan\"\nOttawa, January 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the attached form, I may say that Mr. Desmond Burdon-Murphy was the teacher of the Seton Lake Indian Day School in the Lytton Agency from September 1, 1931, to June 30, 1932, at which time he resigned. We have not sufficient information on file to permit us answering the questions asked on your form.\n\nIf you so desire, you might communicate with Mr. A.

Gerald H. Barry, and I would respectfully recommend that, if at all possible, Miss MacLennan's salary be raised.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

You were paid salary of $900 in 1940. Single persons are exempt from payment of Dominion Income Tax up to $750 per annum.

She will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month. It is understood that the school will be in operation from October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nI am aware that the monthly salary rate is lower than Miss Winter received at Katzie, but at that school she was drawing a higher salary than the majority of the teachers in British Columbia. The reason for granting her this concession was that when she was appointed Indian Agent Daunt wrote to the Department in a letter dated April 5, 1930, stating that in view of the higher board rate she would have to pay at Hammond, where the school was located, he considered she should be allowed $105 a teaching month.\n\nIt is noted that you will forward nominations later for teachers for Seabird Island and Katzie.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

It seems that my letter advising Mr. Grist that this was discontinued during September and October did not reach him in time.\n\nIn regard to the children having very little besides what they receive at the noon day meal that is supplied by Mr. Grist, I beg to say that this is quite true, as these Indians are a poor lot.\n\nUnder these circumstances I would like to recommend that if at all possible the usual $3.00 be allowed for September and October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

The amount received from the Department has never covered the account and as in some cases I feel confident the lunch is almost the only meal the children receive I have always paid the difference. I was intending writing to you to ask for an increased allowance this year, but under the circumstances I suppose that this is useless.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Please obtain an itemized account covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the extra desks, I would request that you inform the Department of the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use. You should state, also, whether they are single or double desks. If these desks are supplied, it is necessary that they be of the same type as those at present in use, in order to have uniformity in the seating equipment. When we have full information, as requested, consideration will be given as to whether the desks can be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY'S REPORT DATED SEPT. 24, 1934, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SETON LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe school is a small log building located on P.G.E. Railway Lands. A small rent is now being paid to the P.G.E. Railway for this land. When this was arranged a couple of years ago this school was a considerable distance from any other building. It was in fact in the Brush. Now owing to great activity in the Bridge River Gold Mines, the B. C. Electric town of Bridge River and the P.G.E. village of Shalalth have grown greatly. There are P.G.E. buildings right up to the edge of the school ground. This in addition to the increase of attendance would indicate that it would be much better to have a new school building located on the Indian Reserve and situated much nearer to the homes of the children. The Indian Agent has asked for a new school building for some years; but I would not recommend it previously. Conditions have so greatly changed that I am now willing to support the recommendation of the Indian Agent. The schoolhouse contains a schoolroom about 20' by 16', far too small for the 15 to 20 children who will be attending there this year, and a small badly lighted room attached in which some teachers have lived in the past. The present teacher rents a cottage near the school.\n\nThe Department provides $3.00 per month for the six months November to April for the provision of noon lunches for the children, some of whom come a long way to school. I wish to recommend the increase of this sum to $5.00 per month for the above months, and the sum of $3.00 per month for the months of September, October, May and June. Dr. MacQuarrie who visited the school shortly before I did asked me to make this recommendation, and I am very glad to be able to recommend this increase as the money is very badly required and the food given to the children is of great help to them.\nSTATEMENT\n\nSept. 2, 1934\n\nMr. F.

C.\nOttawa, November 14, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in reporting on his visit to the Seton Lake Indian Day School on September 24th, last, states that there is a considerable increase in the attendance and recommends the erection of a new school located on the Indian reserve.\n\nYou will remember that, in the latter part of December, 1931, the Department leased a plot of land from the Pacific Great Eastern Railway Company. The building on this land, which is, at present, used for school purposes, was erected by Indians and White residents and has been repaired and added to by the Department. It must be considered Department owned.\n\nPlease let me know how far the reserve is from the present school. While we are not aware what amount will be available for building purposes next year, the Department desires you to state if, in the event of a new school being erected, you consider it should be erected on the reserve.\n\nIn the event of establishing a school on the reserve, would you consider it advisable to move the building at present used for school purposes to the reserve?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Right of Way through the Slosh Indian Reserve Seton Lake #1, and is therefore, only a few yards from the Reserve. The Indian Village is approximately one half mile distant from the school location, so in the event of a new school I would recommend it be erected on the Reserve. I would not consider it advisable to move the present school building as it is poorly constructed of logs and would, therefore, be difficult to enlarge to accommodate the increase in attendance.\n\nAny benefits that may be gained would not justify the expenditure entailed in moving this building owing to its location and the contour of the land adjacent.\n\nTrusting this is the information required.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

The school building which is nineteen feet by fifteen\u2014houses twenty\u2014one pupils\u2014and hence is not in accordance with regulations that nine cubic feet should be allotted for each pupil. I have now an enrollment of twenty\u2014one.\npupils, and Aprilst. the enrollment will be increased to twenty-five.

The Inspector wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"The Seton Lake Indian Day School is carried on in a very old log shack. As previously reported you will find that the school building is located on the lands of the P.G.E. Railway Co., and that we pay a certain rent.\n\n\"Should it be decided to build a small modern school here such a school would of course not be located on the railway property, but on the Indian Reserve. A new school to accommodate at least thirty children is required just as soon as the Department can find the funds for its erection.\"\n\nIt is hoped to be able to provide funds in the supplementary estimates for the erection of a new school at this point and I should, therefore, appreciate your completing the enclosed data form.\n\nYou will note that Inspector Barry suggests a school to accommodate 30 pupils. Do you consider that the school should be built large enough for this number? Should teacher's living quarters be also provided?\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch prepare the plans for our Indian schools and while definite answers should be given to all questions on the form particular\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nattention should be given to furnishing explicit information under the headings -- \"Description of site and conditions; etc.\" and \"Water supply; system required; source of water, etc.\". When replying you might let me have an estimate of the cost for which you consider a school could be erected on the Seton Lake Reserve. It would be appreciated if you would give this matter your early attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n| Item Description          | Quantity | Price |\n|---------------------------|----------|-------|\n| School Supplies           |          |       |\n| 1 lb Cocoa                |          | 75\u00a2   |\n| 1 lb Sugar                |          | 75\u00a2   |\n| 2 cans Cream Butter       |          | 1.30  |\n| 2 jars Jam                |          | 95\u00a2   |\n| 15 oz Shuck               |          | 1.50  |\n\nTotal: $5.00\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Shalalth General Store,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Shalalth, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1939 | LYTTON AGENCY |        |\n|      | Seton Lake Day School - $5.00 |        |\n| March 21 | To Groceries supplied to pupils of Seton Lake School for mid-day meals during March.

The present building is in extremely poor condition, it is in a poor environment, the window lighting is insufficient, the desk seating inadequate, and the ventilation in the school room is poor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEncl.\nShalalth, B.C.\nApril 5, 1939\n\n\"Secretary\"\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to suggest to you that the immediate need of a new school building here is a dire necessity.\n\nThe school, an old log building, is long overdue for the discard and has been repeatedly condemned by doctors.\n\nThe school building, which is twenty feet long by sixteen feet wide and nine feet high, houses seventeen pupils. After September the enrollment will probably be increased to twenty. Hence the school is not in accordance with regulations that each person should have 3000 cubic feet per hour.\n\nYour Department has been so very generous in the distribution of medicine that if ever you\nhere to see for yourself the dilapidated school in which my poor pupils are forced to inhabit five hours of the day, you would readily agree that more comfortable quarters, properly lighted and ventilated, would do infinitely more to further the children's good health as well as a happy environment in which to study and play.\n\nI am sure if you refer this important matter to the school inspector, Captain Barry, or to our Agent, Mr. Strong, they will be glad to testify to the immediate need of a new school building.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration in the matter, I am hoping for a favorable reply.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nFlorence A.

No. 1\nPROVINCE: British Columbia\n\nBRANCH: Indian Affairs\nDATE: June 6, 1935.\n\nAPPROPRIATION:\nVOTE:\n\nRECOMMEND CONSTRUCTION BY: BAYBERGER\nCONTRACT:\n\nREASON: CLASS OF INDIAN DAY LABOUR AVAILABLE.\nIndians unskilled labourers. Contract should require their employment as far as possible.\n\nBUILDING REQUIREMENTS: ROOMS AND ACCOMMODATION; NUMBER OF PUPILS;\nTYPE OF CONSTRUCTION:\nFrame building consisting of one schoolroom to accommodate up to thirty pupils, the usual cloak rooms, and two small rooms, one to be used as a room for vocational training of girls and one for the storage of drugs and as a dispensary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SITE AND CONDITIONS; SUBMIT PLAN; NORTH POINT;\nNATURE OF SOIL, DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER PARTICULARS.\nOn a hill side within about one hundred yards of Seton Lake but not on P.G.E. property. The soil is rocky with natural drainage.\n\nWATER SUPPLY: SYSTEM REQUIRED; SOURCE OF WATER, ETC.\nPresent supply is from Seton Lake by bucket, about one hundred yards from and a hundred feet below school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTOILET FACILITIES: SEWAGE DISPOSAL; SYSTEM REQUIRED; LOCATION.\nTwo outdoor toilets. Pits would have to be dug or excavated.\n\nHEATING SYSTEM: TYPE OF FURNACE OR BOILER; FUEL.\nHot air furnace to take wood and with two pipes to schoolroom and one to each of other rooms.\n\nLIGHTING SYSTEM: SOURCE OF POWER; SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.\nB.C. Electric lines are available near site but electric light is perhaps not essential although present school is very dark. Owing to high mountains, winter lighting is poor and very large windows will be necessary.\n\nBUILT-IN EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: BLACKBOARD AREA; CUPBOARDS, ETC.\nTwo large cupboards. Usual asbestoslate or equivalent blackboards four feet wide around two sides of schoolroom. Windows should occupy whole of one side and cupboards and doors the remaining end. Facing the end of the room with blackboard, windows should be on left and rest of blackboard on the right, doors and cupboards at rear. This is the standard arrangement as light must come over left shoulder of pupil.\n\nSHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS FOR MATERIALS: NEAREST SHIPPING POINT\nLOCAL TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES TO SITE, ETC.\nShalalth is on the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. There is no road for motor vehicles from Lillooet to Shalalth. Automobiles are freighted from Lillooet on flat cars to Shalalth when on their way to the Bridge River mining area. There is a poor road from the Shalalth P.G.E. Railway yards to the possible site of the new school, but motor trucks could manage this short haul quite well.\n\nREMARKS:\nThe site for this school should be carefully selected, with care to secure satisfactory recreation ground. No accommodation necessary for teachers.\n\nWould suggest full concrete basement, with windows to provide light for manual training.\n\nBasement should provide room for hot air furnace, manual training shop and wood storage.\n\nINFORMATION SUBMITTED BY:\n\nD.A.TE:\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the proposed construction of an Indian Day School replacing the existing structure at Seton Lake I.R.

(RG 10, Volume 6411, file 841-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the construction of the new Indian Day School at Seton Lake I. R. No. 1, I would advise that investigation of this Reserve showed that there were no unoccupied building sites, the Pacific Great Eastern Railway for some reason having been permitted to take a right-of-way obviously in excess of railway requirements, thereby taking nearly all the fairly level land on the Reserve.\n\nThe most suitable site from the point of exposure, drainage, general accessibility, and offering the most suitable recreation ground facilities on the Reserve, had been partly cleared, fenced and a house erected by the occupant, Sandy Shields, an Indian of the Band. In order to take advantage of this site, it would be necessary to move his house on to a piece of adjoining land, which is not large enough for the School and exposed to the prevailing winds. This property was thoroughly inspected by Messrs. Inspectors Coleman and Barry and Mr. Agent Strang, and it was considered that the minimum valuation of same was, as follows:\n\nClearing...........$50.00\nFencing............50.00\nInterest in good site.......150.00\nCost moving and re-erecting house...100.00\n$350.00\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nBut the Indian has expressed willingness to accept $300.00 for his interest in the land and cost of moving his dwelling, which is considered most reasonable under the circumstances, and I enclose herewith resolution by the Band setting the site aside for School purposes, and acceptance of $300.00 compensation by the Indian occupant, Sandy Shields, which I would recommend for approval, with the request that I be advised in the matter as soon as possible as the contractors are anxious to proceed with the work before the advent of winter weather.\n\nI would request that at least $200.00 of this compensation be met from the School Vote and, if necessary, I could purchase lumber, etc., required for the re-erection of the Indian's house from the funds set aside for new buildings and repairs to Indian houses, and would request authorization to proceed to expend whatever is necessary in this connection owing to the lateness of the season and the necessity of housing the Indian's large family without undue delay. If the full compensation is paid in cash, this authorization will not be required.\n\nI would appreciate your instructions by return airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Jones, building contractor of Vancouver, B.C., in connection with an extra toilet which he constructed at the new Seton Lake day school. Mr. Jones had the contract to build the new school.\n\nLast December it was thought that if funds were available an extra toilet for the use of the teacher might be provided at the school. Tenders were asked from Mr. Jones and another contractor and the matter was submitted to Major Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. who later advised that no funds were then available for such an expenditure. The matter was then dropped. However, at the end of January this year, Mr. Jones submitted his account for $40.00 for the cost of constructing a third toilet at the school and I notified him the account could not be forwarded for payment as the expenditure had not been authorized. Mr. Jones admitted in his letter accompanying the account that he had not been instructed to build this toilet but that as there were three built at the Creekside school, he would take the chance of building the extra one at Seton Lake.\n\nIt would seem that provision in the beginning for an extra toilet for the use of the teacher would have been desirable and I would therefore respectfully recommend the account be approved if funds are available. Mr. Jones' tender on the construction of the building was the lower of the two received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
