Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grants will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Band School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Cliffside Alberta this 30th April 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Wapiti Lake\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReg.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that all pupils named on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the STURGEON LAKE IND.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis... 6th January... 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Lesser Slave Lake Agency this 11th day of March, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.P.A. 403\nReq.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Surgeon Lake Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: JUL 9 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Thurgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31st, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Lester Slave Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School at Calais, Alta., on Sturgeon Lake Reserve for Quarter ended March 31st, 1945.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0182            | Dorothy Kipowane      | 13  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         | Sept. 16th '47             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0183            | Louise Anne Kipowane  | 11  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         | Sept. 1st '49             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0184            | Christine Thommie     | 15  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0185            | Jackie Thommie        | 16  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0186            | Rachel Thommie        | 16  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0187            | June Thommie          | 14  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0188            | Mary Thommie          | 13  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0189            | Gertrude Thommie      | 14  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0200            | Genevieve Mitchell    | 13  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         | Sept. 22nd '41             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0201            | Hermine Mitchell      | 14  |     |      |                 |                |                   |                         |                             | 91 - 54    |                                                                                                  |\n| 0202            | Mary D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils enter on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0182           | Dorothy Kegmaneet | 14  | 27       | 6th Grade      | 3rd Year          |                        | Sept 18/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0183           | Louiseanne Kegmaneet | 12  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 14/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0184           | Mary Stone        | 15  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 14/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0185           | Elizabeth Andrews | 15  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 22/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0200           | Eleanor Mitchell  | 14  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 22/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0202           | Emma Marie        | 17  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 22/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0206           | Florence Lewis    | 14  |          |                |                  |                        | Sept 22/37                | 90%        |                                                               |\n| 0208           | Mary D.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that each pupil was in the school. This Return may be completed by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31st 1949\n\nI have carefully

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3908\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School at Salmo, Alberta on Sturgeon Lake Reserve for Quarter ended June 30th 1947**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 194             | George Goodswimmer | 15  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 195             | David Raber     | 15  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 197             | Donald Johnson  | 14  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 199             | Howard Gage     | 14  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 201             | Michel Kipawanaw | 17  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 203             | Michael Raber   | 13  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 205             | Albert Mitchell | 11  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 207             | Albert Andrews  | 11  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 208             | Rene Stone      | 13  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 209             | Raymond Stevens  | 11  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 210             | Donald Kipawanaw | 11  | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 212             | Lawrence Moroso | 8   | 1   |      |                |                   |                          |                             | 9/1/40     |\n| 213             | Henry J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in all places covered on Return may be ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in all cases written on the Return, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nG.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per pupil grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDate: June 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINFORMATION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September 30 1950\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 30 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON OCT 11 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 4, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this OCT 11, 1950 Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 4, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON OCT 11 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Lesser Slave Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School at Calais, Alberta**\n\nReserve for Quarter ended September 30, 1950\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE ON OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0162            | Dorothy Kiyawasew        | 16  | I   |      |                |                    |                         | Sept. 37                    | 62         | Discharge asked                                                                                 |\n| 0163            | Louise Anne Kiyawasew    | 14  | I   |      |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |                                                                                               |\n| 0200            | Genevieve Mitchell       | 16  | I   |      |                |                    |                         | Sept. 41                    | 62         | Discharge asked                                                                                 |\n| 0202            | Hermine Manitos          | 16  | I   |      |                |                    |                         |                             | 62         | Discharge asked                                                                                 |\n| 0206            | Florestine Tchowis       | 16  | I   |      |                |                    |                         |                             | 68         | Discharge asked                                                                                 |\n| 0208            | Mary M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days for residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present in all cases entered on the Return, and may be obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal Antonio Girard\n\nDated April 2, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON APR 12 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON APR 12 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils whose names appear on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Res. Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any full payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1951.\n\nAct Principal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at HIGH PRAIRIE, Alta., this JUL 3, 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6575, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended SEP 30 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated OCT 8 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at HIGH PRAIRIE, Alta.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that each pupil entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sturgeon Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended DEC 31-1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: DEC 31-1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nHIGH PRAIRIE, Alta.\n\nDated: JAN 2-1952\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Sturgeon Lake...Indian Res...School for the Quarter ended...MAR 31 1952...10...\n\nPrincipal...H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the... Sturgeon Lake Indian Res... School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1952.\n\nPrincipal... Mr. Rowe...\n\nDated...

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the STURGEON LAKE INDIAN SCHOOL School for the Quarter CALAIS, ALBERTA ended DECEMBER 31, 1952\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated JANUARY 6, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nHIGH PRAIRIE, Alta.\n\nDated at this JANUARY 14, 1953\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Lesser Slave Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF THE STURGEON LAKE INDIAN RES.

For example, in the case of a pupil allowed out on holidays on July 1st and who returned on August 1st, grant should be requested for 92 days. In the case of any pupil who is absent from the school longer than the 31 days holidays for which grant is allowed, the grant should only be requested for the number of days such pupil was in the school during the quarter, plus 31 days.\n\nFrom the enclosed return the Department cannot decide if the principal requested grant for the annual holidays and we consider it advisable to send back the return for any corrections that may be necessary. Please show this letter to the principal, in order to assist him in preparing properly the return. As soon as it is completed it should be forwarded to the Department, in order that the amount of grant due may be paid.\n\nTo assist the finances of the school, the Department is making a partial payment on the grant, pending the receipt of the correct return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard, ALTA.\n\nRussell T.

For instance, a pupil allowed home on holidays on July 1st and who returned to the school on August 12, grant should be requested for such pupil for 92 days; on the other hand a pupil allowed home on leave on July 1st and who did not return to school until September 1st, grant should be requested for 73 days.\n\nA duplicate copy of this letter is enclosed and you should forward it to the Principal in order to assist him in preparing his return. Please request him to state on the return the dates between which the holidays were taken. In order to assist the Principal in his financing, a partial payment of $1800 will be sent.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard Alta.,\nunder separate cover and any balance due will be paid when the amended return is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School in October, last, states that 12 additional desks are required. In this connection I beg to say that this Department has supplied seating accommodation for 60 pupils at this school, the full number for which per capita grant is allowed. We find that 24 desks and 3 rear seats were supplied in 1922, and 28 desks and 5 rear seats in 1923, which would provide seating accommodation for the number stated. It is expected that the school authorities will see that the grant earning pupils have the use of the accommodation which was provided especially for them. If there are other pupils in attendance, the school should provide the desks required for them, and they should not utilize the desks provided for the regular grant earning pupils.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you as to the condition of the desks which were supplied by the Department and for what children the extra desks are needed as stated by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I., Auxiliary Bishop of Athabasca, called at the Department today and saw Dr. Scott with reference to the building programme at Indian residential schools in his diocese. His Lordship pressed for the reconstruction of the Wabasca R. C. School and urged that the Department provide a grant of $15,000 next year. They would like to know in time to get the early freighting done in March and April. His Lordship was glad to know that an addition at Sturgeon Lake was noted for Estimates and that Parliament would probably be asked for a grant of $3,000. He was also interested in the new wing at St. Bruno's. My opinion is he had never discussed this before, as he was pressing first for the reconstruction of Wabasca.\n\nRussell T.

The Department's understanding is that the building is old and that lamps are in use. Was it Your Lordship's intention that the electric light plant be used for the new boys' building which was recently erected?\n\nWhen the Department has more information, consideration will be given to transferring the old electric lighting plant at St. Bruno's to this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is our intention when funds will be available to erect a building for the girls and we hope it will be in the near future. Meanwhile it was our intention to have the boys' building wired as well as some outbuildings and use the plant until the girls' wing would be added when the plant will be working at its full capacity.\n\nI wish to state that Rev. Fr. Falher, Principal of St Bruno Residential School, advises me that the batteries of the present plant at his school are in bad condition. I believe we could find a man able to repair same at a minimum cost. Otherwise, new batteries would have to be installed.\n\nIf the Department wishes to have a reliable man for installing the new plant at St Bruno and removing, if such is the case, the old one to Sturgeon Lake, I could suggest Mr Roy Johnson, 9551\u2014103 A Avenue, Edmonton, Alta., who installed the plants at St Bernard's and Wabasca Schools to satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\n| Quantity | DESCRIPTION                        | Price | Price Total |\n|----------|------------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| 6        | Soda and Acid Recharges            | .40   | 2.40        |\n| 4        | Thermene (anti-freeze) extinguishers| 24.50 | 98.00       |\n\nPrepaid charges as per attached 13-8-31\n\nSales tax included 2328\n\nCertified correct, supplies furnished, charges fair and just.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A request was received to erect a house for the farm instructor, if one was appointed. As it is not intended to make this appointment, no provision was made to erect a residence for him.\n\nNo provision was made in the 1931 Estimates for the building of an Indian school at Sturgeon Lake, and no amount has been included in our Estimates since that time to carry out any work at this point. The school building at Sturgeon Lake is church-owned and the Department has received no request from church authorities for the erection of a new building or any extension to the existing one. In this connection, I would refer you to memorandum of October 20, 1932.\n\nWhen new school buildings, additions, alterations or repairs have been required to the schools in the Reserve, I have directed that such as all charges have been the general policy in the past to have the work carried out by the church authorities, the Department reimbursing them for part of the costs. The church authorities forward receipted accounts covering the cost of all material and labour, and reimbursement is made to the amount of the appropriation allowed for the purpose. The church authorities advise the Department in detail of the work proposed to be undertaken and receive authority and information concerning the amount of the cost for which the Department will be responsible.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...Rev.

(RG. 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 1)\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nOn my return to the office here I found a letter from the Sister Superior of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School, stating that she had planned to ask that the school be supplied with a typewriter, but evidently her nerve failed her when we were at the school, and she is now asking me if it would be possible for me to take this matter up with you. She states that even a second hand machine would be greatly appreciated, as they could make good use of it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 1st, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson,\n\nYou do not state in your letter anything concerning your return journey to Edmonton. I trust that Mr. Gooderham and yourself were able to get through without too much delay and inconvenience.\n\nWhen I looked out of the train window Wednesday morning and saw the rain pouring down on muddy roads, I wondered what sort of trip you would have returning to Fort St. John and feared that the portion through the Lesser Slave Lake country would give you considerable trouble. I should be interested to know something of the adventures and difficulties you encountered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSeptember 1st, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 28th, and note that the Sister Superior of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential school asks for a typewriter.\n\nThis matter will be taken up with the schools branch in an endeavour to see whether the request may be met.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM.

I must confess we spent far more than the amount as can be seen by the enclosed time sheets and accounts. I may add that the latter represent only a part of the expenses. I have not shown the lumber which amounts to $211.25 (viz 5150' at $30.00 per M.: $154.50\n2270' \" $25.00 \" \" : $ 56.75\n$211.25)\n\nas the figures presented are above the amount allotted, I had not the receipted bills at hand and I did not want to delay.\n\nI leave the whole matter in your hands and am assured of settlement before the end of the fiscal year. You will excuse our delay as one account has been paid only a few days ago.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard\n\nN.B.:\u2014I am sorry that I have Mr. Champagne's account and the Frontier Lumber's in single copy.

November 12th, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the St. Francis Xavier's Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Lake, in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency:\n\nAt the time of my inspection there were 55 children at the school, 50 of whom were grant-earning pupils.\n\nI visited the class-rooms and inspected the building, and spent considerable time with the children and the Sisters there, going over their different activities at the school. The Provincial School Inspector reported on this institution a short time ago, and found the class-room work very satisfactory.\n\nThe girls attending this school are being given as good a training in all branches of household science as it is possible to give them in such an institution, and I found that 7 of the older ones were not attending classes at all, but were getting special instructions in cooking, house-keeping, sewing, etc., to better fit them for their home life on the reserve. This is being done with the authority of the Department.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nActivities for the boys of this school are very limited. They get the regular class-room work, but as far as outside work goes there is nothing for them to do besides helping with a few chores, &c., and organized outdoor play amongst the boys is also lacking.\n\nThe children all looked well and happy. I checked over the meals they were being served and found that they meet the requirements of the children, evidence of which was shown in their healthy appearance.\n\nI need not describe the building, as I have done this on previous occasions, and you visited it a year ago last August, but as you know it is very dilapidated and I would say the dormitories are hardly fit for the children to sleep in. However, they are probably better than most of the homes on the reserve, so very little can be said about them. The buildings are all kept in as good a state of repair as possible, but you will understand the difficulty of keeping a building of this nature in condition, and in my opinion this is one place where a new school is required.\n\nThey raise a good garden, but the potato crop was more or less of a failure this year on account of the wet weather. They had fair success with other garden truck, however.\n\nThe school had 60 acres of grain in crop this year,\u2014wheat, oats and barley, but this was not threshed when I was there as there had been so much wet weather and snow. It is difficult for this institution to get any more land under cultivation.\ncultivation, as the land is covered with heavy timber, and before any more breaking can be done this bush has to be cleared away. Twenty acres of brushing was done this summer mostly by the staff and Indians from the reservation.\n\nThe School have 9 cows, 9 calves, 6 horses, chickens and pigs. It was necessary for them to send the rest of their herd down to Grouard on account of the shortage of feed.\n\nThe Staff at this institution consists of Rev. Father Girard, O.M.I., an Assistant Principal, 2 lay brothers and 2 hired men, as well as 11 Sisters of Providence. They seem to be an efficient staff of Sisters, and I believe they practically run the school as I do not think Father Girard takes very much interest in the affairs of this institution, being more concerned with the mission work and the administration of the farm, &c.\n\nThe Sister Superior made a few requests which I am forwarding to the Department in a separate letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Cont'd...\n\nand in a central position on the north boundary of the Sturgeon Lake Reserve. The closest railway point, at present, is Grande Prairie, which is about 70 miles due west. Until the past year, the road has been a rather difficult one to freight in supplies over during the summer months, and consequently supplies had to be taken in during the winter when the muskegs and lakes were frozen over. Last year a highway was built and bridges put in over the small streams, and it will now be possible to take in supplies at any season of the year. A highway right-of-way is being cut out this winter north east from the school to a point on the railway near High Prairie, and it is expected that a highway will be built during the coming summer. The distance will be about 50 miles, which will not only bring them closer to a railway point, but will save the long freight haul from High Prairie to Grande Prairie.\n\nThere were 77 pupils enrolled at the time of my visit, 39 girls and 38 boys. Four classrooms are provided with a teacher in each. The pupils appeared to be bright, and are making good progress in their school work. The Sisters in charge of the classrooms appear to be quite capable teachers, and referring to the Provincial School Inspector's report on their work, which was made last November, it would appear that he entertains a favourable opinion of their ability as teachers.\n\nThe pupils presented a healthy and well nourished appearance. It was noted that they were well and warmly clad. Their recreations, during the winter months, are skating and sledding and such outdoor games as are possible, and during the summer months they engage in outdoor games.\nST.

The boys' building was very recently erected. The upstairs provides a dormitory 25' x 64', with an 11 ft. ceiling. It contains 39 beds. This is a very good, airy, roomy dormitory. Twelve wash basins, and individual towels are provided. One room is set aside for an infirmary. The first floor is divided into classrooms, which are all well lighted. Three hot air furnaces are used for heating purposes.\n\nThere are three outside stairways, with easy means of access, provided as a means of escape in the event of fire. Fire extinguishers are placed at convenient points on each floor.\n\nThere is a spare room, 25' x 48', with a 10 ft. ceiling, which could be used as a dormitory and would provide room for 20 more beds if required.\n\nThe girls and Sisters are housed in what was the original school building. The first building was erected many years ago, and has several additions to it. It provides a chapel, kitchen, dining rooms, Sisters' bedrooms, as well as two spare bedrooms which can be used in an emergency as an infirmary, and a girls' dormitory, 72' x 25' x 9\u00bd', pitched roof, ceiled. Ventilation is obtained through the windows. There are 46 beds in the girls' dormitory. Twelve wash basins, and individual towels are provided. It is heated with a hot air furnace and stoves. Coal oil and gasoline lamps are used for lighting purposes. This is not an up-to-date building, and in view of its construction, it is not a very convenient building to work in. It is becoming old, and has served its purpose.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG. 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 1)\nST. FRANCOIS XAVIER INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) Cont'd.\n\npurpose. As soon as circumstances permit, it should be replaced with a more modern building.\n\nOutside stairways are provided for fire escapes, and fire extinguishers are placed at easily accessible places throughout the building.\n\nI found both of these buildings being kept clean and tidy, and in a very creditable condition.\n\nThree outside toilets are provided for the girls and three for the boys. I found the girls' toilets in a clean and sanitary condition, but the boys' toilets were in a disgraceful condition, and showed lack of supervision. I pointed this out to the Principal who said that the condition would be remedied at once.\n\nA small farm is operated; they have 60 acres of land under cultivation. During the past season they had 200 bus. of wheat, 500 bus. of oats, 50 tons of green feed, 800 bus. of potatoes, 140 bus. of turnips, 80 bus. of carrots, and a variety of other vegetables sufficient for their requirements throughout the year. The live stock consisted, at the time of my visit, of 35 cattle, 7 horses, and 8 pigs. They have also a large flock of poultry, and raised 240 chickens last season. They have 11 milch cows, 9 of which are kept milking steadily.\n\nThe children, I was informed, get milk to drink. An ample quantity of wholesome food is provided for their meals. They have porridge with milk each morning, and the food is varied; they have soup, meat, vegetables, fish, bread, fruit, and lard. The meat used is principally moose meat, which is easily obtained.\n\nThe girls are taught general housework, sewing, knitting, and fancy work. They keep the building clean under supervision.\nST.

I found the premises in a tidy condition.\n\nThe Rev. Father Batte, O.M.I., is in charge as Principal, with Father Giroux as assistant. An adequate staff of Sisters, including the 4 teachers and a trained nurse, take care of the inside work.\n\nI was quite pleased with the manner in which this institution is managed, and I consider that they are doing good work at this school.\n\nThere are a number of other schools in the Agency which I was unable to visit on this trip. I am informed that they have a particularly fine school at Wabasso, which has just been completed.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You may therefore inform the Principal that she may arrange that the older girls spend less time in the classroom and devote more of their study to courses in domestic science.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Repairs at foundation ............ $ 300.\n2. Painting of boys' building ......... 700.\n\nIn letter dated June 6, 1938, File 131-1-5, Father Lajoie was advised that, in view of the present purchasing regulations, it would be necessary for him to forward full particulars regarding any material required for repairs and improvements. He was requested to forward a separate letter for each of the schools in the diocese of Grouard.\nExtract from letter from Rev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I., dated June 6, 1938. Original on file 131-1-5.\n\nSturgeon Lake Residential School:\n\nAppropriation $1,000.00.\n\nWork to be done includes repairs to foundation of boys' building. Estimated cost: $300.00\n\nAbout 100 sacks of cement needed.\n\nShould I order this cement or if the Department will do? For such a small lot, I believe that we do better locally as we have to pay freight by the hundred pounds if we have less than a carload. I am asking for tenders which will be submitted to the Department if thought advisable.\n\nIt is very important that the work be done during the summer holidays not to disturb classes. The Principal and the teachers have requested me to start the work with the first days of July.\n\nWork to be done includes painting of the boys' building. Estimated cost .................. $700.00\n\nTo make a good job, 125 gallons of prepared paint are requested. Generally, we buy white lead and suitable oil. We save a lot in that way.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 6th instant which covers the repairs required at the Sturgeon Lake R. C. Residential School. In order not to delay the work at this school you may order the cement and the white lead and oil.\n\nWhen forwarding the accounts covering the cost of these articles you should attach a statement setting forth in detail the value that you have received for the money expended.\n\nThe total amount expended for material and labour must not exceed $1000.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I am told that it would be a loss if we don't take ways to send away from the foundations the water coming from the roofs. It means that we have to put eave-troughs around all buildings.\n\nPlease find enclosed a sheet giving dimensions and specifications.\n\nLet me point out that all freight coming from South has to be addressed at High Prairie Station, Alta.

It is imperative that a new building to replace same be erected in the near future. The old building is occupied by the Sisters and girl pupils. The kitchen, etc., are in this building. The building is heated by a hot-air furnace, a hole -- supposed to be called a cellar -- having been dug under the floor to place the furnace therein. Entrance to this cellar is made through a trap-door. Danger of fire is very great.\n\nAnother separate frame building, built in two sections, one in 1922 and one in 1928, joined together, is used for the boys' dormitory, play-room, and three class-rooms. This building is in good repair, but unfortunately, when built, proper attention was not given to the foundations. The building rests on a concrete foundation, which is cracking. In order to install furnaces, long narrow cellars were dug and lined with logs. As it is, the building is beginning to sink, and unless repaired, i.e., heavier foundations and proper supports put under the joists, it will soon be twisted and ruined. The proper thing to do with this building is to put a full-sized basement under same, having solid concrete walls to support the upper structure. This building is well preserved and is worth putting the necessary expense into the foundation to save it.\nThe Principal and other male members of the staff have separate quarters: The out-buildings, horse stable, cow barn, bakery, garage, implement shed, etc., are all well-built, frame buildings, well cared for and in good repair. The exterior of all buildings was painted last summer, and they present a well cared for and neat appearance. The provincial highway from High Prairie to Grande Prairie passes in front of the buildings, along the shores of Sturgeon Lake.\n\nWATER SUPPLY\n\nIn summer, water is pumped from Sturgeon Lake, a pipe-line being laid on the ground. In the winter time, water is hauled in barrels from the lake. This was being done at time of my last visit. I counted seven (7) water barrels in the small kitchen. When a new building is erected, provision should be made for an underground pipe-line to the lake, and proper pressure tanks installed to serve both buildings.\n\n(Sgd.) C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n| Names          | No. of Hours | Mon. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | Price Per | Amount of Wages | Received Payment |\n|---------------|--------------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Gauthier, O.  |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Gauthier, G.  |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Belanger, R.  |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Mahan, A.     |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Pruden, H.    |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Kibb, W.      |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Shaver, J.    |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n| Gallinger, J. |              |      |       |      |        |      |      |           |                 |                  |\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\nCheque No.: Recommended for payment\n\nBalance:\n| Name          | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Total | Price Paid | Amount of Wages | Received Payment |\n|---------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Geathtier, O. | 10     | 10      | 11        | 12       | 4      | 473   | .50        | 23.75           |                  |\n| Gauthier, G.  | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 493   | .40        | 19.80           |                  |\n| B\u00e9langer, H.  | 10     | 10      | 11        | 12       | 4      | 47    | .45        | 21.15           |                  |\n| Mahler, A.    | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 45    | .50        | 13.50           |                  |\n| Prudhomme, H. | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 45    | .50        | 13.50           |                  |\n| Kribb, F.     | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 45    | .30        | 13.50           |                  |\n| Shaw, Joe     | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 30    | .30        | 9.00            |                  |\n| Galliford, J. | 10     | 10      | 10        | 11       | 4      | 45    | .30        | 13.50           |                  |\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed and prices are fair and just.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The purchasing of the material was done according to the directions given by your letter of the 14th of June last, cf. 131-6-5.\n\nIf you wonder why I have reported higher expenses than the appropriations for that work, I will answer that it is not always easy to split bills, and besides it gives to the Department an idea of the expenses we have to go in to keep the buildings in proper shape. I do not hesitate to say that the Sturgeon Lake School is not a disgrace to the Department by its handsome look, by the exterior at least. I wish we could do the same for the interior.\n\nMay I add that the expenses reported are far from covering all the monies spent at Sturgeon Lake, this year, for painting and general repairs: sidewalks, stairs, fences, furniture, etc. Let me give an example. I have had to buy mattresses and pillows for over $300.00 for Sturgeon Lake only. Joussard's bill for mattresses amounts to about $150.00.\n\nI may seem pessimist, but I wonder how we will manage to rebuild the main building at Sturgeon Lake if the Department does not agree to help us. It is out of question of abandoning this School. It would be a disastrous setback. The school stands in the centre of an homogenous reserve where the population is increasing steadily. This should be weighed before taking a final decision. Mgr. Langlois may have taken the question with him on his passage through Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, Ont., Feb. 15th, 1939.\n\nHon. T. Grerar, Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nI have been charged by His Excellency Mgr. Ubald Langlois, O.M.I., Apostolic Vicar of Grouard, Alta., to lay before you the distressing situation of one of the Indian residential schools of the Vicariate of Grouard, namely the Sturgeon Lake Indian residential school.\n\nThis school has been established some thirty years ago for the benefit of a large band of Cree Indians. It is attended by 90 children, all Treaty Indian children. The main building has to be replaced; it is collapsing. (Let me point out that school is a two body construction. The main building which is to be replaced, sheltering the girls and the Sisters in charge; the boys' building, a comparatively new construction and solid yet. It is out of question of demolishing it.)\n\nSince a few years, application for assistance in rebuilding the school at Sturgeon Lake has been made by the former Vicar Apostolic, Mgr. Joseph Guy, O.M.I. Up to now, the Department of Indian Affairs has never found the way clear to do so. Everybody familiar with the situation agrees to say that the main building is getting dangerous and has to be replaced in a short future. The intention is to have the work done during the summer of 1940, not this year.\n\nIn the name of the present Vicar Apostolic of Grouard, I hereby apply for assistance from the Department. Our finances do not allow us to go in heavy expenses. The present school has been set up without any contribution from the Department due to the liberality of benefactors, but the financial crisis has killed the flow of donations. We can no longer rely on gifts for such an undertaking.\n\nAccording to figures made by an architect on a sketch of the projected construction, it will require between $50,000.00 to $60,000.00 to do the work. The intention is to build fire-proof. If we could get assurance that financial help will be given by the Department of Indian Affairs, we would start preparing for the summer 1940.\nWould the Department find it impossible to appropriate a bulk sum to be disbursed in one year. I take on me to suggest the financial help be given by increasing the pupilage on the children attending the school.\n\nSturgeon Lake being 60 miles away from the railroad, the material will have to be hauled on frozen roads. In order to be ready to start the work early in spring, I hereby request the authorization of having the plans drafted by the architects of the Department. With plans and estimates on hands, it will be easier to have everything ready on due time.\n\nThanking you for the interview of yesterday as well as for the attention you will give to this question, I remain, Hon. Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F.S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nfor His Excellency\nMgr. Ubald Langlois, O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard, Alta.\nFather Plourde brought in the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Grouard, in northern Alberta.\n\nThe request they had to make was that, in our Estimates for next year, there be included an amount for the building of a fire-proof Indian Residential School at a point known as Sturgeon Lake, about seventy miles southwest of High Prairie.\n\nFather Plourde expressed the opinion that he did not expect it would be possible to have this included in the present year's Estimates and I assured him that, in this respect, he was quite right.\n\nI suggested that the Vicar-General write to me, making his request for consideration next year. I stated that I could not promise favourable consideration but that, if the matter were before the Department, we would be glad to consider it when the Estimates for the following fiscal year were being prepared.\n\nThey raised a point as to whether the Department would be willing to prepare the plans for the school and stated that sometime during the summer or early autumn the Vicar-General would submit details, in a general way, of what he had in mind for this school. I stated this would be all right and that in any case, even if it could not be included in the Estimates for the following fiscal year, our Departmental Architects would probably have some slack time in the autumn months in which they might draft tentative plans. I told him to address his letter about plans to Mr. Hoey.\nFather Plourde also spoke about the possibility of having dormitory additions to the present Sandy Bay School made fire-proof in character and stated he had already made some enquiries from his colleagues in Manitoba as to the possibility of their providing some funds for this if the Department would be willing to increase its provisions to cover part of the additional cost. He thought the fire-proofing could be done for about approximately Forty Thousand Dollars, which would be twelve to fifteen thousand over the Estimate for frame construction. This he was to take up later by letter with Mr. Jackson.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOttawa, February 21st, 1939.\n\nDr. H.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nBanff, Alberta,\nFebruary 17th, 1939.\n\nREPORT on Water Supply Situation at\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\n\nI inspected the water supply situation at Sturgeon Lake School and discussed the matter as fully as possible with the local school authorities on 3rd February, 1939. Previously I had discussed the situation with Mr. S. F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Affairs at Calgary.\n\nThe school buildings are on a bench about 40 feet above high water level of Sturgeon Lake. During the summer season water is pumped from the lake. This supplies a sufficient quantity which is also suitable except for such times as during high winds resulting in strong wave action on the lake when it becomes cloudy with small sizes of suitable matter in suspension. As the 1-1/2\" water main from the intake to the buildings is laid practically on the ground surface, this system has to be discontinued at the first approach of frost in the fall of the year and cannot be operated until the following spring.\n\nThere is no plumbing of any kind in any of the school buildings. The water being pumped to a 150-gallon tank standing outside the kitchen and being carried from this tank to the kitchen by hand in pails. They also employ a temporary system of piping laid on the surface of the ground during the summer months whereby the water flows by gravity from the 150-gallon tank to the other small buildings and the garden.\n\nDuring the winter months water is carried in drums from a hole in the ice on the lake and stored in drums standing around the kitchen. The toilets are all dry and outside and there is practically no fire protection.\n\nAttempts have been made in the past to find sufficient and suitable water by digging wells, but without much success. They have two wells near the barn, one of which has gone dry and the other has barely enough water for the requirements of the stock. The well water, while being suitable for the stock, is considered to be \"too hard\" and unsuitable for human use. This, I might say, is the usual experience in this district.\n\n...........\nSeveral of the buildings at this school are very old. That used as the kitchen and girls' dormitory is in a very tumbledown condition and I was given to understand that the school authorities hope to have this replaced by a new building during 1940. The other main building used as the schoolroom and boys' dormitory is a comparatively new frame building on shallow footings and with a shallow dug-out cellar. It is hoped to place a full concrete basement under this building containing suitable space for a furnace room and water reservoir.\n\nAlthough the condition of the buildings does not come within the scope of this report, yet future building developments should be taken into consideration when laying plans for water supply. Water consequently, I would recommend that any improvements to the water supply system should be so planned that they would fit in and be adaptable to probable future building plans. In carrying out this idea, the water mains should be laid in a permanent location, while the installations inside the buildings should be temporary and inexpensive but suitable to meet all year round conditions for the time being.\n\nFrom all indications and the experience of the local authorities, I do not believe that sufficient or suitable water will be found in a well dug near the school buildings. But I do think it most probable that a sufficient and suitable supply will be found in a well dug on the lake shore at or near the present pumphouse. The local authorities seemed to doubt this but I am decidedly of the opinion that this should be tried before any expensive method is attempted. If water is found in this well, then I would recommend that the following be done:\n\na. The pumphouse be rebuilt in a tight and warm enough fashion for winter operation.\n\nb. The present 280 feet of 1-1/2\" galvanized iron pipe from the pumphouse to the main building be buried below frost line and extended into the cellar under the kitchen.\n\nc. A 440-gallon pressure tank be purchased and placed in the cellar under the kitchen and connected to the 1-1/2\" main.\n\nd. This 440-gallon tank should have a 1-1/4\" outlet main from which a 1/2\" line can run to the kitchen and temporary connections made during the summer for watering the gardens etc. These connections can be controlled by valves.\n\ne. The 1-1/2\" main to the kitchen be extended to the cellar under the boys' dormitory and connected to the 150-gallon tank which now stands outside the kitchen but which should be moved and installed in this cellar.\nEstimate of Cost of above recommendations:\n\nDigging and cribbing well near pumphouse $60.00\nExcavating trench and backfilling $15.00\nTaking up and relaying 290 feet 1-1/2\" pipe, laying 250 ft. new 1-1/2\" pipe and making connections $50.00\n250 lineal feet 1-1/2\" galvanized iron pipe $65.00\nPipe connections and fittings $15.00\nBuilding new pumphouse $150.00\n440-gallon Pressure tank $225.00\nFreighting 60 miles from High Prairie, Engineering expenses and contingencies $120.00\n\n$1,000.00\n\nI should point out that there is no electric plant at this school and the present pump is gasoline operated. It may be necessary to change it for a deep well pump or lower it into the well if water is found in the proposed well near the pumphouse.\n\nIt is possible that sufficient or suitable water will not be found in this well, in which case it will be necessary to obtain water from the lake. The present intake is 300 feet out in the lake from the pumphouse and the 300 feet of 2\" galvanized iron pipe is carried on a light trestle. This, of course, can only operate during the absence of freezing temperature and consequently is used only during the time of year when the lake is at its higher levels. During the winter, the lake water recedes so that it will be necessary to extend the intake a further 350 feet into the lake to reach water during severe freezing weather. This intake pipe should be buried in the lake bed below frost line and the problem is how to do this in this isolated locality without suitable equipment.\n\nThe most economical method to do the excavating for the trench is by use of a small dragline. From enquiries made while on this inspection trip, I do not believe there is one nearer than Edmonton, where the Provincial Government have an up-to-date 1/2 cubic yard machine. There is every likelihood that such a dragline could be used on the proposed improvements to the water supply system at Jousuard Residential School (see separate report for Jousuard). Also the Provincial Government will most likely be using a small dragline in the Peace River and High Prairie districts next summer. This being so, I suggest that at the suitable time an arrangement be made with the Provincial government Dept. of Public Works for the loan of the machine when it is in this vicinity and thereby effecting a saving on cost of freighting by dividing it between the Provincial Government and the jobs at Sturgeon Lake and Jousuard.\n\n..............\nIf it is found necessary to extend the intake out into the lake I believe the most suitable time of the year in which to do the work would be from 1st to 15th October which is when the lake is low and just before freeze-up.\n\nEstimate of additional cost required if it is found necessary to extend the intake a total of 650 feet into the lake from the pumphouse.\n\n250 feet 2\" galvanized iron pipe f.o.b. High Prairie, Alberta. $116.00\n\nExcavating trench in lakebed and backfilling (including an allowance for freighting dragline) $400.00\n\nLaying pipe $25.00\n\nEngineering expenses, freighting and contingencies $59.00\n\n$700.00\n\nThis cost would be additional to the $1,000.00 mentioned previously, which figure covered the cost of proposed work from the pumphouse to the buildings.\n\nAs is the case for the other Residential Schools in the Peace River District, I would recommend that any work done on the shop system be left to the local authorities under the Indian Affairs Bureau or our Engineering Service remaining in an advisory capacity only. The prevailing rates of pay are little more than half of what we would pay under the Department of Labour's Fair Wage Scale and it would make it decidedly awkward for the local authorities afterwards if we went in there and paid the higher rates for labour.\n\nE.K. Lebaplain\nAssistant Engineer.\nMarch 6th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply Situation at Sturgeon Lake Residential School\n\nAs instructed in your memorandum of January 20th last, arrangements were made for an inspection of the water situation at the above School. Reports have now been received and are attached in duplicate.\n\nIt appears that at present during the summer season water is pumped from Sturgeon Lake to a 120 gallon tank and then flows, by gravity, to the buildings and the garden.\n\nIn winter the above system is discontinued and water is carried from the Lake and stored in drums near the kitchen.\n\nIt appears that attempts have been made in the past to obtain a supply of water by digging wells, but without success.\n\nThere is at present no interior plumbing in the buildings but possibility of same being installed, especially in any new buildings that may be constructed shortly, should be taken into account in any present proposals for obtaining a water supply.\n\nOur engineer considers it most probable that a sufficient and suitable supply of water will be found in a well dug on the lake shore. Failing this the alternative is a long pipe line out into the lake. However, as the cost of the first or well experiment would apparently be only $60.00 it is felt that this method should certainly be tried first.\n\nWe therefore recommend the undertaking of work estimated to cost $1,000.00, as detailed on page 3 of our Engineer's report. It will be noted that except for the $60.00 item for digging new well on the lake shore, all this expenditure is for enlargement and improvement of the present system, particularly to make it a winter or year-round service.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIf sufficient water is not obtained by the above method, then it will be necessary to re lay, in the bed of the lake, the present 300 feet of pipe and also to lay an additional 250 feet, or a total of 650 feet of pipe to be laid below the frost line in the lake bed.\n\nThe estimate of our Engineer for this latter work is $700.00, as detailed on page four of his report. However, owing to the uncertain factors connected with the carrying out of this work, as mentioned in our Engineer's report we do not feel this estimate can be guaranteed until more definite information is available, and which information could be obtained when it is known if the work is necessary.\n\nAll labour costs in the above estimates are based on prevailing rates of pay in the district, as referred to in the last paragraph of our Engineer's report.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S.

The district is underlain by the Wapiti formation which contains several sand horizons that carry a good water supply in the Peace River district. I cannot tell to what depth you will have to drill here but it should be no deeper than the top of the black shale which underlies the Wapiti formation.\n\nThe chances are probably poor of getting a supply of good water from the bedrock of all the other schools and drilling should be confined to the surface deposits. The bedrock in these places is a black or dark grey shale.\n\nIt is impossible to tell exactly where you should drill, without having seen the ground. Usually in searching for water in the surface deposits, gravel ridges and stream valleys are good places to prospect.\n\nWe will be very glad to co-operate with you in any way we can, and if you wish to consult us please do so at any time.\n\nIf you drill please let us know what results you get in order that we may have the information on file.\n\n(Sgd.)

School,\nCalais, Alta.\n\nFebruary 12th, 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have been required by Father S. Lajoie, O.M.I., of Grouard, to write to you in connection with the water supply at the Sturgeon Lake Indian School, Calais, Alta.\n\nThe first plan was to secure water from the lake by deepening the intake so as to keep it from freezing in winter. This however has not been found feasible without an expensive machine and the digging of a well has been decided. We have been lucky enough as to strike water at the depth of 179 ft. This water is of a good quality as far as we can judge and in a sufficient amount for the needs of the School. It remains to complete the installation with a deep-well pump and accessories, suitable motor new pump-house and laying of pipes to connect the well with the former installation. This of course will require more funds than formerly allocated. Mr. C.M. Walker of the Engineering division at Banff, Alta., estimates the additional cost at $500.00, provided we use some of the material previously bought for the installation in the lake.\n\nConsequently I would appreciate that you give your attention to that important matter at your earliest convenience as every day brings us new expenses for hauling water from the lake by teams of horses and it is a most difficult proposition at spring. I hope that you will be able to forward me a cheque of $500.00 in the near future towards these new expenses, for which I thank you in advance.\n\nTruthfully yours;\n\nH. Fournier, O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal, Sturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School, Calais, Alta.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water supply systems at Grouard, Joussard, Fort Vermilion and Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nUnder date of the 13th instant a report has been received from our Supervising Engineer at Banff giving up-to-date information on the above projects as follows:\n\nGrouard:\n\nThe installation at Grouard was, from a report by Father Lajoie, dated January 30th, complete except for a connection to the 3 H.P. centrifugal pump. An ample supply of water has been secured. It has a salty taste. A sample has been sent to the Provincial Analyst to determine its suitability for drinking. The water has been tried in the laundry. Father Lajoie reports \"It is far from being truly soft but yet makes fairly good work especially when warm.\" Also, \"The well has solved a serious problem for the winter. There is just mud in the lake and no snow.\"\n\nJoussard:\n\nAt Joussard a flowing well was secured. Water mixed with some gas was obtained at a depth of 262 feet. The free flow is approximately five (5) gallons per minute. A sample has been submitted to Edmonton for analysis. No report received as yet. No report has been received to date on the status of the work at Joussard other than that the well had been completed.\n\nFort Vermilion:\n\nThe installation at Fort Vermilion has been completed according to plans including the construction of an intake into the Peace River. A statement of expenditures, submitted by Father Huguerre, has been approved by this office and forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSturgeon Lake:\n\nFather Lajoie of Grouard states that they would like the driller to proceed at once to Sturgeon Lake and drill a well there, as they have not found it possible to extend the present pipe line out into the lake with the construction facilities at their disposal and wish to complete this installation, if possible, by March 31st.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nI would, therefore, recommend that $500.00 be made available to Father Lajoie at once for drilling this well, this sum to be additional to the original allotment of $1,000.00.\"\n\nCommenting on the above it would appear that the installation at Grouard has been practically finished with an ample supply of water secured, and although this water is reported as having a salty taste, it would seem that this project can be considered as completed at least for the present.\n\nAs a flowing well was secured at Joussard, it would seem that the main difficulty at this point has been solved, although no final report as to completion of all work has as yet been received.\n\nThe Fort Vermilion project can apparently be taken as closed out, as all work has been completed and our Supervising Engineer advises that statement of expenditure has been forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nWith regard to the $500.00 additional amount recommended by our Supervising Engineer for Sturgeon Lake, I would refer you to our memorandum of December 7th last in which it was then estimated that an additional $500.00 might be required for this project. It would appear that the Indian Affairs Branch have not taken any action to date with regard to the supplying of Father Lajoie with this amount.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(sgd.) T.S.

A Memorandum to Council is being submitted and I feel certain that this will be approved. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would advise your engineer to have the work at Sturgeon Lake proceed immediately in order that it may be completed before the end of the current month. The additional amount of $500.00 required will be available.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWhen Bishop Langlois, of Grouard, Alberta, was in Ottawa some weeks ago, he discussed again the re-building of the school at Sturgeon Lake. You will recall that this has been mentioned several times by Bishop Breynat during the past few years. I told the Bishop that the matter was one which would have to be brought to the attention of the Minister and that I doubted very much whether Parliament would provide any funds for new residential schools until the war was over. I suggested to him, however, that there would be no harm in sending in a plan showing the old school buildings and also draft plan of the new buildings they would like to construct. I am now enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from Bishop Langlois dated March 14th; also copies of the plan of the old buildings and sketches of the proposed new buildings. I have acknowledged the receipt of the letter and told Bishop Langlois that I would bring the matter to the attention of the Minister on his return from the West.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nMarch 14 - 1940.\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson,\nSecretary,\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson,\n\nHere are at last the sketches I long ago promised you of the old buildings of our Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Lake, together with that of the proposed new building for the girls, and that also of the exact location of the old and new buildings on our property. The sketches are under separate cover.\n\nlo - The old buildings: I think that one look at the photos will be sufficient to convince you that it is time something is done to replace and modernize the Indian Residential School the Department of Indian Affairs has at Sturgeon Lake. The buildings are all log and frame. None of them has a foundation of either concrete, stone or brick material. As I already told you, the Girls' residence is tumbling down, and this is only one of its many inconveniences. The Boy's Residence will stand yet and fill the purpose for a good while, specially if a solid foundation is built and a little fixing up done. The classrooms are all sheltered in the Boys' Residence, and they'll have before very long to be put in a separate building as the number of children increases rapidly. But they'll do for the time being.\n\n2o - The proposed building is that of the Girls' and the Sisters. You will readily see that our plans are not extravagant; but if we obtain their execution we will all be satisfied. You will also notice that the new proposed building contains no chapel for the children and no heating plant. I intend to have the children use the Church we already have on the premises as their chapel, and this is the reason why I propose to move it between the new Girls' Home and the Boys' House. By so doing we will have more room in the new building for other purposes and save on the building cost. - As to the heating plant, I intend to build it on the new site of and underneath the Church. We would then have a central heating plant; actually we are using stoves in the Girls' Residence and a hot air furnace in the Boys\". I would suggest a steam heating plant for our new installation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 2)\n30 - The actual buildings are much too close to the main highway from Edmonton to Grande Prairie; therefore I propose to move them back a little further and dispose them differently. Another reason for their moving is this: The Provincial Government will soon bring the highway to a standard width, and so will of necessity cut a few feet off the frontage of our property. Useless to say that it would be better for the children to have their playgrounds a little distant from the highway. I suggest 200 feet; but we possess enough land to move the buildings further back yet, would you advise it.\n\n40 - Finances: How to finance such a reconditioning and building project? The estimates we have on the proposed Girls' Residence are between $45,000 and $50,000. Now, year in year out, we ordinarily receive from the Department each year a little over $10,000, for general repairs, odd constructions, improvements, replacements of machinery etc. at our 5 Residential Schools. If the Ministry of Mines & Resources was willing to double, or about, this amount for 4 years in succession, and give me free hands in this reconditioning and building project, I would agree to carry it into execution, under supervision of the Department, and at the same time take care of all the ordinary improvements and repairs in our remaining 4 Residential Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson, I perfectly realize that you cannot of your own accord take immediate steps in the matter, but I feel confident that you understand the underprivileged situation in which we are at our Sturgeon Lake School. This is the reason why I count so much on your sympathetic intelligence of things.\n\n(Sgd) U. Langlois, O.M.I.\nSturgeon Lakes Ind. Res. School,\nCalais, Alberta.

In the meantime I have made a statement of expenses made to date. Kindly find it attached. You will see that it exceeds the amount of allowances given or promised by the Department by $134.82.

Father Fournier, Principal of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe statement he forwarded is not sufficient for our purposes as we require receipted accounts for all material purchased and the usual receipted pay lists for any labour.\n\nFather Fournier shows total expenditures of $1634.82. When you were in the Department it was understood that the cost of the work done at Sturgeon Lake during the current fiscal year would not exceed $1500.00 and in the transfer of funds this is the total amount available. Of this sum you have already been advanced $1000.00 and an amount of $500.00 can still be paid to you.\n\nIt would, therefore, be appreciated if you would forward immediately receipted accounts and pay lists to an amount of $1500.00.\n\nAny accounts unpaid can be retained and will be considered when the 1940-41 appropriation is available.\n\nIn forwarding accounts which show charges for freight please make certain that you have a freight receipt. The mention of freight on a receipted account is not sufficient for our Treasury Branch. They require an actual receipt from the transportation company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. S.

Let me add a few words to the answer going right away by wire.\n\nAs specified in message, all the documents should be in Ottawa today or tomorrow unless they have been delayed by bad roads. According to a letter from Rev. F. Fournier, he expected to have all the receipts last Saturday. A regular service would have allowed him to mail them Monday. As he was to use Air Mail from Edmonton, it means that the envelope should have reached Ottawa by now. I hope that they did. At the worst, they should be in soon.\n\nI deeply regret the trouble we are giving you with this matter. Useless to say that I highly appreciate your numerous steps for a happy settlement. I have moved everything possible to have the documents rushed. For over two weeks, the only way to make Sturgeon Lake was horse back. There is no phone, neither telegraph there. Missing a train means four days delay.\n\nIt is obvious that you are making your best to keep the door open. I hope that all concerned will understand the situation and will wait a few days more if necessary.\n\nThanking you once more, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.B.

F. H. Fournier, O.M.I., Principal of the Sturgeon Lake Indian School, that they will need space for grain if nothing happens to spoil the coming crop. The prospects are very good. They will need room for two bushels of grain.\n\nWould you allow me to get the granaries on the allotment made for Sturgeon Lake? A granary of one thousand bushel capacity costs around $125.00. Metallic granaries are the most practical. They are weather and especially mice-proof. Wood building costs a little less, but is not so safe.\n\nDue to the fact that the granaries in view should be ready for the coming threshing, the beginning of September, I would appreciate if you would allow me to order directly from the Company. As a rule, I buy similar material from Western Steel Products Corporation. They have a branch in Edmonton and they give good service.\n\nI take the liberty of requesting an answer by Air Mail. It would be embarrassing not to have the granaries ready for the threshing time.\n\nThanking you for the attention you will give to this matter,\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

A thorough examination revealed that the cellar root has to be rebuilt. Fortunately, it is possible to secure locally the logs needed for that purpose.\n\nIt will take about 250 logs of 20', some of 25' at the average price of .06 a lineal foot. This is surely a very reasonable price. It seems advisable to add a light frame roof to the cellar. The lumber can be secured at the price of $15.00 a thousand feet. With your authorization, the work will start immediately in order to have the cellar ready to receive the vegetables in September.\n\nThe well at Sturgeon Lake is a success for the country. Plenty of soft water containing soda but not to such an extent to be prohibited for drinking. However, it can be used for cooking vegetables. At least, they get plenty of soft water for laundry and general use. They are extending the pipes according to the directions given by the Engineers....

(The nearest station).\n\nThe forms will require a certain quantity of lumber. Would you allow the School buying locally the lumber needed for forms and installation of the building at the following price: $15.00 a thousand feet for rough lumber and $19.00 for prepared lumber delivered on the grounds.\n\nThanking you in advance for the prompt attention you will give to this matter, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Bishop Lajoie's letter dated March 14, 1940, addressed to the Chief Executive Assistant, Mr. C. W. Jackson, states:\n\n\"As I already told you the girls' residence is tumbling down and this is only one of its many inconveniences. The boys' residence, however, will stand yet and fill the purpose for a good while, especially if a solid foundation is built and a little fixing up done.\"\n\nI regret to state that I cannot authorize you to purchase lumber locally. If, however, you send forward the amount of lumber required I shall be glad to do everything possible here to expedite its purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. S.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI regret to have been unable to answer sooner yours of August 26th ultimo due to absence and surplus of business at the opening of schools.\n\nThe carload of cement referred to has been delivered last week. We have been fortunate enough to do the hauling in dry weather. Many thanks for prompt attention.\n\nAs to the lumber I was asking authorization to get locally, I had forgotten to mention that this lumber has been cut at our own expenses in the past winters in order to be ready to do the work at Sturgeon Lake. As there is no Lumber Yard within a radius of 65 miles, it is out of question to buy lumber from dealers. Let me tell you frankly that it would relieve me if you accept to allow us using this lumber at prices given in my letter, the cost price. If it is not feasible, let me know. To order from outside would mean a trip to Sturgeon Lake in order to get all specifications and delay in work.\n\nHoping that you will find possible to grant the requested authorization, I remain, Dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. LaJoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant you may secure the lumber required at Sturgeon Lake from the supply which you cut last winter. It is noted that the cost will be $15.00 a thousand for rough lumber and $19.00 a thousand for prepared lumber delivered at the school.\n\nI regret that you did not state the number of feet of each kind of lumber required. However, in order that the work may not be unduly delayed authority is being given for local purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. S.

Sir:\n\nOn September 6th the Department placed an order for 500 sacks of cement for the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. A copy of the Purchase Order No. 3417 was forwarded to you.\n\nIt is understood that the account covering the cost of the cement was also sent to you. If the cement has been received, you should certify the account and return it to me at once. If the cement has not arrived or if the account has not been received, please let me know immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hegy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Fournier, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Sturgeon Lake Residential School,\nCalais, Alta.\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar:\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School\n\nI had a number of interviews this fall with Rev. H. Fournier, O.M.I., the Principal of the above school and with Dr. M.L. Little of Grande Prairie, the medical doctor at that point for the Indian Department, in connection with the Residential School.\n\nI feel very strongly that there should be a new school building at Sturgeon Lake. The present building is 25 or 30 years old, being partially log, boarded over, and has been built in sections. In the original part, some rather poor, local lumber was used. It is a three-story building and is heated by numerous stoves. The roof leaks and pans have to be set out to catch the rain. It is really in a most deplorable condition and a very dangerous fire-trap. You will appreciate that it is impossible to heat such a building as this with stoves, unless terrific fires are kept on. Undoubtedly, the building should be condemned, and I feel that the Department is taking a very grave risk in continuing to use it.\n\nA Residential School is urgently required at this point and the need will tend to increase rather than diminish. A day school would not serve the situation and would be quite inadequate. This residential school is doing exceptionally good work and should be continued.\n\nI appreciate the need for economy at the present time, but I have no hesitation in urging that the construction of a new Residential School at Sturgeon Lake should be proceeded with at once. I feel indeed that I would be negligent in my duty if I did not, in the interest of the health and safety of these Indian children, do my utmost to impress upon the Department the urgency of this situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.H. Sisson\n\nJ.H. Sisson,\nM.P. for Peace River.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sissons, M.P., in his letter to the Minister of Nov. 7th, copy of which is attached.\n\nAs we have no record of the present standing of the proposed construction of a new school at Sturgeon Lake, will you please furnish a report for the Minister's information, together with a draft letter to Mr. Sissons for the Minister's signature.\n\nN.J.F.

The Department pays an annual per capita grant at the rate of $160 and the enrolment at this date consists of 30 pupils.\n\nOur school building program and the repairs most urgently needed at Indian day and residential schools are carefully reviewed from year to year by the officials of the Department, in co-operation with representatives of the Churches. The claims of the Sturgeon Lake Indians for a new residential school have been carefully reviewed from time to time. I regret to state, however, that it was not possible to include in the estimates of this year the sum necessary for the construction of a new building at that point.\n\nI have just learned that last year a water system was installed by the Department at the Sturgeon Lake School, at a cost of $1,500.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 2)\nof a basement at the boys' wing of the building has been supplied.\n\nIt would appear that the construction of a school at Sturgeon Lake is inseparably bound up with the construction of schools at Tahassee, Whitefish Lake and Holy Angels. In view of this fact and the existing war conditions, it is not at all likely that the money necessary for the construction of these schools will be available at any time in the immediate future.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 15, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Sturgeon Lake Residential School is a church-owned school, operated by the Department in cooperation with the Oblate Order. This school has an enrolment at this date of 90 pupils.\n\nThe school buildings at Sturgeon Lake are of log construction. Reports on file would indicate that the buildings, particularly the girls' wing, are in a dilapidated condition. This building is heated by stoves and has been for a number of years an acute fire hazard. It will be noted, from a letter sent forward for the signature of the Minister, that $1,500 was spent last year in providing an adequate water supply for these buildings and that this year the lumber and cement necessary for the construction of a foundation at the boys' wing have been supplied. The desirability of proceeding with the construction of a new school at Sturgeon Lake has been reviewed from time to time and Bishop Langlois has been particularly insistent in his requests for a new building at this point during his recent visits to Ottawa. In response to a request received from Mr. Jackson, Bishop Langlois forwarded sketch plans of a new building to the Department about three months ago. In this connection I may refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum to me, dated March 15, 1940.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the construction of a new school at Sturgeon Lake, the cost of which\nwould in all probability exceed $150,000, if the building is to be fully modern and fireproof throughout, is inseparably bound up with requests that have been before the Department for a number of years with respect to the construction of an Anglican school at Wabasca, an Anglican school at Whitefish Lake and a Roman Catholic school at Holy Angels requested by Bishop Breynat. It should be borne in mind also that the Anglican school destroyed about two years ago at Carcross, Yukon Territory, has not yet been rebuilt and that the United Church school at Round Lake, Crooked Lakes Agency, Saskatchewan, is in an appalling condition and has been condemned by the Saskatchewan Government Sanitary Inspector.\n\nNo provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the building of an Indian day or residential school anywhere in the Dominion. In view of existing war conditions and the apparent desire on the part of the Government to keep expenditures in the regular services at the lowest possible figure, it is not considered either by the officials or by myself advisable to submit items for the construction of new buildings during the coming fiscal year.\n\nDirector.\n| QUANTITY | STOCK NUMBER | DESCRIPTION       | SIZE     | PRICE | AMOUNT | TAX | TOTAL |\n|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-------|--------|-----|-------|\n| 24       |              | Institutional Beds| 8'x5'    | 8.37  | 200.68 |     | 200.68|\n| 24       |              | Institutional Matts| 8'x5'    | 5.89  | 141.36 |     | 141.36|\n\n**Tax Included**\n\n**SHIPPED PREPAID TO**\n\nREV.

With all due respect, I feel that this school at Sturgeon Lake is not quite in the same category as schools at Wabasca, Whitefish Lake and Holy Angels.\n\nThe building which it is desired to replace at Sturgeon Lake is actually falling down and it would really be a waste of money to attempt to put it in a state of repair. I know that officers of your department have inspected the premises, and I am confident that they must be of the same opinion.\n\nI have had an interview in this connection with His Excellency, Bishop Langlois, who is taking a very keen interest in educational work among the Indians of that area. He is very anxiously concerned over the situation at Sturgeon Lake and, knowing something of the situation, I share his concern.\n\nI am very much afraid that if this matter is delayed, considerable harm will be done and I would therefore urge that before next year's building programme is determined, further consideration be given to the possibility of erecting this new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nsigned) J.H.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nHaving been told by Rev. F. Feournier, O.M.I., principal at our Sturgeon Lake Indian School, that you were requesting certified copies of invoice covering carload of Cement shipped by Canada Cement Co. Ltd. to High Prairie for Sturgeon Lake School, I had to apply to the Company for this invoice as it had never been received neither by myself, neither by Rev. F. Feournier. There's the delay.\n\nEnclosed four certified copies of this invoice. Let me point out that the Company is willing to grant the discount of 10\u00a2 a barrel even if the 20 days delay is expired.\n\nLet me point out that we have experienced some trouble this year with the handling of the goods ordered by the Department for us. All the material destined to the Joussard Indian School has been shipped to the Station of Grouard. It means that we had to haul this stuff from Grouard Station to Joussard, 16 miles, besides the fact that the freight rate is higher to Grouard than to Joussard. Having notified the Railway Company to stop the carload of Cement destined to Joussard at Joussard Station instead of Grouard according to the address, we were charged $12.00 extra for doing so. I would highly appreciate the Purchasing Agency always pointing out very clearly where the goods should be delivered.\n\nThe present is going by Air Mail in order to save time.\n\nThanking you once more for the attention you give to our problems, I remain, Dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

The amount of $234.00 paid in regard to that matter is correct and the error made in the writing of the account is a material one, the writer having apparently been confused by the length of the logs: 24 ft. and written 24 logs instead of the real number of logs used in the work, namely 40 logs, 24 ft. long.\n\nI am sorry that I did not check closely enough on this account myself when it was presented to me for payment and caused this trouble to your Department. To avoid further trouble to you, I have asked Mr. Michel Mathis to draw a new account, correcting the faulty one sent to the Department.\n\nTrusting that this will be found satisfactory,\n\nI remain:\n\nYours truly:\n\nRev. H. Fournier O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOblate Catholic Indian Missions.\n\nWinnipeg, June 16, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBishop Langlois spent several hours with me last Thursday discussing the Indian problems that he has to solve in his district. Among other things, you know that he is most anxious to make a start on repairing the Sturgeon Lake school; and has already proposed a plan to the Department to this effect. On my next visit to Ottawa I hope that you will give me sufficient time to go more fully into this matter.\n\nJ.F. Plourde\nO.M.I.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. Hoey\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI received, a few weeks ago, a very pressing letter from His Excellency Bishop Langlois of Grouard, Alberta, regarding the condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, this is one of the oldest Church-owned school buildings in Northern Alberta. For reasons which it is not necessary to enumerate in this letter, this school was very sadly neglected in past years when the Department was able to spend large sums of money on new buildings as well as on substantial repairs to old structures. As a consequence it is in such a condition that something must be done immediately if the Bishop is to continue to authorize his Missionaries to conduct a school for the Indians of the district.\n\nWould it be possible to secure the permission of your Department to spend, during the present fiscal year, on substantial repairs to the Sturgeon Lake School, at least 80% of the total amount provided for the five schools under the jurisdiction of Bishop Langlois? I understand that this would mean placing at his disposal about $6000.00. This latter sum is not large but if spent judiciously, and if the Church authorities are able to supply, as they think they will be, most of the labour free of charge, the repairs undertaken might be substantial enough to place this school, at least temporarily, in a condition which would enable the Church authorities to continue operating it as a residential school.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated as Sturgeon Lake is not easily accessible.\nand the freighting of all building materials takes a good deal of time. If the Bishop could be advised on or about July 20 that he is authorized to carry out his plans it is likely that most of the work which will be judged necessary to place the school in a livable condition could be done before the winter sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, July 21, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of November 15, 1940, and subsequent correspondence with Mr. J. H. Slissons, M.P., with reference to the above named school.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter recently received from Rev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., who writes on behalf of His Excellency Right Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $6,700.00 is provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the five Indian residential schools (Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake, Vermilion and Wabasca) situated in the Diocese of Grouard.\n\nYou will note that the proposal made by the church authorities is that the Department allow approximately $6,000.00 of this amount to be expended at the Sturgeon Lake School in order to make substantial repairs to it. The greater part of this amount will be expended for material as the school authorities expect to be in a position to supply most of the labour free of charge.\n\nFrom reports we have received there is no doubt that extensive improvements are required at Sturgeon Lake -\nLake. While the amount that we have available this year would not place the school in first-class condition, I believe that, if the school is to be kept in operation, some attempt should be made to keep it reasonably habitable.\n\nI would therefore appreciate the Minister approving the request made by Bishop Langlois.\n\nActing Director.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6375)\n\nFile 765-2, part 1\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\n- Quarterly Returns. 1941 - 1952.\n\nFile 765-3, part 1\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\nPayments of Grants. 1907 - 1940.\n\nFile 765-5, part 1\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\nSupplies & Accounts. 1915 - 1936.\n\nFile 765-5, part 2\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies -\nAccounts. 1936 - 1941.\n\nFile 765-5, part 3\nSturgeon Lake Residential School\n- Building Maintenance,\nSupplies & Accounts. 1941 - 1949.\n| Date       | Initial | Remarks |\n|------------|---------|---------|\n| 1/2/49     | PA      |         |\n| 3/3        |         |         |\n| 30/3/49    |         |         |\n| 24/5/49    |         |         |\n| 16/6/49    |         |         |\n| 1/7/49     |         |         |\n| 8/7/49     |         |         |\n| 24/7/49    |         |         |\n| 31-8-10    |         |         |\n| 1/2/50     |         |         |\n| 1/3/50     |         |         |\n| 1/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n| 3/4/50     |         |         |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs.

If they are put off, to that extent larger sums would have to be provided next year for them\".\n\nIn view of the above decision, I urge that His Excellency Bishop Langlois forward at once his recommendations in connection with the requirements at the five schools in his diocese. In the event of any material being required, full details should be given in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nMemorandum to:\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nWill you please refer to your memorandum of the 21st instant, file No. 131-6-5, to which was attached a copy of a letter from the Rev. Father Plourde, suggesting that the money provided in the current year's appropriation for the five Roman Catholic Schools in Northern Alberta should be used principally to make a start on the construction of some new buildings at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nI discussed the matter with the Minister this morning and he thought that it would not be wise to carry out the proposed suggestion, in view of the fact that the repairs and improvements to the other four schools are necessary and should be carried out this year. If they are put off, to that extent larger sums would have to be provided next year for them.\n\nThe Minister appreciates that many representations have been made to the Branch and to himself in regard to the condition of the buildings at Sturgeon Lake and as to the necessity of new buildings being constructed, the cost of which might be in excess of $50,000. He pointed out that the proposed expenditure of $6,000 towards the cost of one building would only be of temporary help and would probably not be of any permanent benefit. He stated that so long as the war continued and probably for a few years afterwards at least, there would be very little likelihood of any items being included in the Estimates for the building or repairing of Residential Schools. In view of this he thought that it might be advisable for you to take the matter up with the church authorities.\nto see if it might not be possible to close this school and establish a day school in one of the buildings now belonging to the Residential School.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, July 28, 1941\ninto consideration the amount of money spent annually by the school supplies. The cost so far as the writer is concerned is very close to $200 per pupil. This cost includes feeding and clothing the child. It should be kept in mind that the average cost of educating an Indian child in the day schools is about $80 a year, which is less than one quarter of the cost. If one compares the cost per pupil in rural white schools in Alberta, which averages about $80 a year, the question arises as to the extent to which the taxpayers of Canada should be asked to contribute to the cost of educating Indian children in residential schools when the amount is much higher than what they pay for educating their own children. There are, of course, many facts which make a comparison of this kind difficult, due to the fact that a good many of the Indian bands are more or less nomadic in their habits.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned before, the whole problem is one which will have to be given serious consideration. I think we should explore the possibility of establishing day schools in the Sturgeon Lake Reserve and operating them during the periods in the year when the Indians are on the Reserve.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that the Government is very appreciative of the burdens assumed by the churches of all denominations in connection with our Indian educational problem and the contributions, financial and otherwise, that they have made in the past in assisting the Department in carrying out this responsibility.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\nexpect to carry on all our institutions in the same way and on the same scale as we did prior to the outbreak of war. There may have to be changes in many of them, even in those that have been established for a long time and which, over a period of years, have been considered to be more or less permanent. Therefore we must keep all these shifts in mind in dealing with problems which though pressing at this moment may involve further expenditures of money.\n\nThis brings me to the request you have made that authority should be given to divert funds that have been provided for ordinary repairs to your other schools in Alberta in order that a start can be made on the construction of new and more permanent buildings involving much larger expenditures in the future amounting to approximately $50,000.\n\nI would not be frank if I did not say that due to the war and what will follow after the war, I think the time has arrived when further consideration will have to be given to the cost of carrying on the present Indian educational system. We must of necessity consider carefully making further capital expenditures on a number of the existing residential schools. I do not wish to suggest that there is not a need for residential schools in connection with the welfare of the Indians, but I think you will agree that this need is greater or less, depending upon where they are situated and the extent to which they provide the necessary educational facilities at a reasonable cost.\n\nThere are in the Sturgeon Lake Reserve approximately 350 Indians. The attendance in the Sturgeon Lake school during the last few years has averaged between 60 and 40. With two or three exceptions all of the children come from families belonging to this Reserve. I am informed that the school was started about the year 1912, in which year the grant was $2,800. In the year 1922-23 the grant had increased to about $5,300. In the year 1923-24 it had increased to $11,000, and last year it had increased to nearly $15,000. Although your church constructed the building during this period the Department made considerable annual expenditures for repairs and in 1923 made a grant of $5,000 towards the cost of construction of a new building. At the same time we have paid the cost of the night watchman.\nOttawa, August 25, 1941\n\nMy dear Bishop Langlois,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant in which you refer to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School and to the proposal Father PLOURDE made that the sum of $6,000 should be taken from the amount that had been allocated in this year's estimates for repairs to your schools in Northern Alberta and used for the purpose of making a start on construction of new buildings at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that the matter is one which has given me a great deal of worry and the decision communicated to Father PLOURDE was reached only after the problem had been considered very thoroughly and from every angle.\n\nI know it is not necessary for me to point out to you the enormous burdens Canada has assumed in connection with our war effort and which will increase as the war continues. The longer it lasts the more serious will be the consequences afterwards. We are now, as you know, spending at the rate of one and a half million dollars a year for war purposes. In addition we have to provide for the ordinary expense of running the Government machine. Further, we must find funds to assist Great Britain in making purchases in this country to the extent of almost another billion dollars. The providing of these large sums during each year the war continues is a very great task. When the war is over it will be a more difficult one to pay back the money we have borrowed. Undoubtedly there will have to be a very drastic curtailment in all government spending. Many of the privileges we have enjoyed and the benefits we have received at public expense will be cancelled or reduced.

In this connection may I refer to the Minister's letter to you, dated August 25, 1941. In this letter the Minister takes the position that in view of war conditions he is not prepared to commit the Government to the rebuilding of the school at Sturgeon Lake. However, we have been greatly disturbed by the statements made by you in respect to the actual condition of the girls' wing of the school and particularly the fire hazards that now exist. We are personally convinced, therefore, that the building should be either reconstructed or abandoned. With the limited funds at our disposal and the building program suspended, the abandonment of the school at this particular time is not in our judgment a practical proposal.\n\nIt has been decided, therefore, that steps should be taken toward the reconstruction of the building.\n\nRight Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alberta.\n\nCOPY SENT TO FATHER P LOURDE\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\nbuilding, and with this object in mind, the Minister is prepared to recommend that an order-in-council be passed, transferring to the Sturgeon Lake School certain unexpended balances of the Grouard, Joussard and Vermillion Schools. These unexpended balances amount to approximately $5,000. In your conversation with me you intimated that it was of the utmost importance that certain building supplies should go in by winter freight, and it is our hope that the amount of money now re-allocated will enable you to purchase these supplies.\n\nYou can readily appreciate how difficult it is for a government to undertake commitments that involve the expenditure of money, other than the amounts actually contained in the appropriations voted annually by Parliament. It is just possible, however, that an amount, approximately equal to the amount spent for repairs at the five schools in your diocese, might during the next four or five years be spent on the reconstruction of the girls' wing. This could only be done, of course, on the understanding that the Church would assume full responsibility for the repairs needed during this period at the other four schools and on the understanding also that the total amount spent by the Government at Sturgeon Lake would not exceed $25,000. In the course of your interview with me, you intimated that it was the intention of the Church to spend an amount equal to the amount spent by the Government in supplying labour and materials for the reconstruction work at Sturgeon Lake. If I am mistaken in this conclusion, you might state in your reply the extent to which the Church is prepared to contribute to this project.\n\nThe plans of the new building, prepared by you and submitted to the Department for consideration a couple of years ago, appear to be satisfactory. In the work of reconstruction every effort should be made to make the building as fireproof as possible. The work will of course be subject to departmental inspection and approval from time to time.\n\nIn conclusion, may I refer again to the Minister's letter of August 25, last, in which he referred generally\ngenerally to the advisability of reviewing our residential school policy in order that the cost of this method of education might be reduced. In approving of the expenditures at Sturgeon Lake it must be understood that we are doing so only because of the general insanitary condition of the building and the acute fire hazards to which I have already referred, and that we must still keep in mind the substitution of day schools for residential schools where local conditions render such action on our part at all possible. It must be understood also that the reconstruction of the Sturgeon Lake School cannot commit the Department in any way to an increase of pupils at the institution at any time in the years immediately ahead of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Rev.

The cost of the transportation of the material will be paid on receipt from you of a certified account in triplicate.

Though there are many conditions, nevertheless the most important point has been decided upon, and I am very grateful for the success obtained.\n\nMay I thank you, dear Mr. Hoey, not only in the name of the Indians who will above all benefit by your decision; but also in the name of the pupils who will at last have more sanitary quarters; and in that of the Sisters who co-operate unceasingly with the Canadian Government for the promotion of civilization.\n\nI infer from your letter that I am authorized by an Order-in-Council to purchase at once the materials required for the reconstruction of this house to an amount of approximately $5,000. I shall proceed immediately so that the building supplies may go in by winter freight, and that you may receive all invoices before the end of your fiscal year.\n\nThe proposition I had made to the Department was as follows, viz.: That La Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard would supply the labour, providing the Government would purchase the materials required for the construction.\nThis agreement still holds and since the Government is prepared to do its share, La Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard will do hers willingly.\n\nI note your desire to have the building as free from fire-hazards as possible and wish to assure you, in this connection, that your building Inspector will be welcome at all times.\n\nThe work will be done as economically as possible and the Government will have no reason to regret neither the money expended nor the confidence shown us in authorizing our making the purchases for this construction.\n\nKindly accept, Dear Mr. Hoey, my appreciation for your decision in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt. Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nVic.

However, it has been decided not to proceed with this building and the stone is available for free distribution to some other Department.\n\nAt the present time authorization has been given for considerable repairs to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School and it has been suggested that this cut stone might be useful.\n\nI am advised that Mr. Dawson, the resident architect of the Public Works Department, Vancouver, has plans of the proposed building at Dawson Creek and is also aware of the quantity of cut stone that is on the site. It would be appreciated if you would interview him immediately and ascertain if he believes that this cut stone could be used for foundation purposes or in some other part of the building at Sturgeon Lake. We would also like to know the quantity of stone available. Possibly you could also ascertain the approximate weight of the stone and what it would cost to transport it from Dawson Creek, B.C., to Grande Prairie, Alta. Both these stations are on the Alberta Great Eastern Railway.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDept.

To my mind the cost of transportation from Dawson Creek would be prohibitive and would be a matter for you to take up with a transportation company there. There are approximately 378 cubic feet of stone, about 26 tons.\n\nOf course it is all facing stone and cut especially for cornices, heads, sills, etc. and would not fit into any other building unless it is designed exactly the same, or it would have to be cut to suit yourselves.\n\nI do not think there would be any benefit in salvaging this stone after cutting it into the shapes you want it and paying transportation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.F. Dawson\nDist.Res.Architect.\n\nGFD/LM\nOttawa,\nFebruary 25, 1942.\n\nDear Bishop Langlois:\n\nIn connection with the material surplus to requirements at Dawson Creek B.C., which is being forwarded for the use of the Sturgeon Lake School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to the Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works.\n\nRepayment of the cost of transportation will be made to you upon receipt of a voucher to which should be attached a receipt from the railway company. I trust that this shipment will reach Grande Prairie before the end of the month as the amount available in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at Sturgeon Lake will lapse shortly after that date. Under these circumstances you will see the importance of not only forwarding the freight account mentioned above promptly upon receipt of the shipment but you should also forward accounts covering any other material that you have purchased to the extent of the grant which you have been promised from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This room is used, I understand, for special training that is being given to the boys and apparently they are having considerable trouble with dust rising from the floor.\n\nOf course you understand that if we purchase the linoleum it will mean less money for other expenditures as the amount provided in the current year's appropriation cannot be exceeded. However, I thought it advisable to bring the matter to your attention as you might like to have this linoleum supplied. If so, you should advise me exactly what quantity is needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nDear Bishop Langlois:\n\nI have been expecting to hear from you with reference to the work that you are doing at the Sturgeon Lake School this summer. The season is advancing and I should like to have detailed information regarding any materials that you need. It is extremely difficult to secure materials at the present time and, as a result, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned. As you are aware, we are required to make all purchases through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. U.

The recommendations made in this memorandum were accepted by the Minister's office and I would, therefore, appreciate your issuing purchase orders so that the above accounts may be paid.

The Department is very anxious to know, at the earliest possible date, the extent of the work that is being done at Sturgeon Lake this year. As pointed out in those letters, any material required should be purchased immediately, but before we can do this we will have to have detailed information from you so that purchase can be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

Langlois, O.M.I., for authority to purchase additional materials for the rebuilding of the Sturgeon Lake School, the Minister has now approved local purchase by Bishop Langlois of materials at a cost not exceeding $5,450.00. This amount represents the balance remaining in the current year's appropriation from the amounts provided for the five schools in the Diocese of Grouard.\n\nAs you are aware, the accounts covering the cost of the purchases must reach this office before the end of March in order that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nI understand that construction of this building has not yet commenced, but, if my memory is correct, Bishop Langlois stated that he expected to begin next summer. I am not exactly certain regarding the size of the building which the Bishop proposes to erect, but I should appreciate it if you would definitely inform him that in building it he should keep in mind the fact that the Department will be unable to allow a larger pupilage than that at present authorized. Consequently there will be no advantage in erecting a building larger than one that would meet present requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Crouard. For your information I attach copy of this letter. You will note that he was definitely informed that the total amount that the Government would expend at Sturgeon Lake would be $25,000.00.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1941-42 we expended an amount of $5,331.10. In memorandum of October 17 it was requested that the amount of $3,450.00 would be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake School and this has been done by Treasury Board No. T 232514 B, October 29. This makes a total amount available for expenditure of $8,450.00, or a total for the two years of $12,781.10. If this latter expenditure is approved, it would mean that the balance of the $25,000.00 would be made available in subsequent fiscal years.\n\nConstruction of the building has not yet actually commenced but it is intended to do so in the summer of 1943. Last year we authorized Bishop Langlois to make necessary purchases to the amount available and he has secured materials which have been carefully stored. He requests the same authority this year in order that additional materials can be obtained and shipped to the school during the winter freighting season. It is my intention to write to him and advise him that in erecting the school it should be kept in mind that it is not the intention of the Department to increase the pupilage allowed.\n\np.t.o.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith further reference to memorandum of October 17, regarding transferring certain amounts to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School, I would direct your attention to official letter of January 6, 1942, addressed to Rt.

In view of the regulations concerning purchasing, the following additional information will have to be supplied:\n\n1.

Of course, a certain amount of material was bought out of last year's appropriations; but the reconstruction of this School will demand a good deal more. Therefore may I hope that you will be able to increase by a small margin this year's appropriations over last year's so as to permit the purchase of the following material at the following approximate cost (the material and the cost have been estimated by a regular Contractor):\n\n- Doors, windows and floors (fir), approximately........... $3,600.00\n- One carload of bricks........................................ 325.00\n- 200 yards of gravel, at $3.85 a yard...................... 770.00\n- One carload of cement....................................... 500.00\n- Nails and other hardware.................................... 500.00\n\nTotal: $5,695.00\n\nPlus transportation cost, about......................... 1,500.00\n\nTotal: $7,195.00\n\nDear Mr. Phelan, if through your sympathetic assistance, we could get, during the present fiscal exercise, the sum of money and consequently the above mentioned material, I presume that, by the Fall of 1943, it would be possible to have the new School put up, covered and closed in for the winter season.\n\nThe appropriations for the following year would easily, it seems to me, take care of the heating plant and the stucco or imitation of brick material, which ever would be found preferable, for the outside finish. And so, by 1945, the Sturgeon Lake School would have at its disposal good and comfortable buildings; buildings that should certainly be a credit to your Department.\n\nWith best personal regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under the circumstances I am anxious to know if the purchases have been made, or if they will be completed within the next few weeks. As you are aware, the amount stated above is provided in our current year's appropriation which expires at the end of March and consequently accounts covering all expenditures will have to reach my office before that date. I should appreciate hearing from you in regard to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. L.

In memorandum of November 16, 1942, submitted to the Deputy Minister, it was recommended that the Church authorities be allowed to purchase materials at a cost not exceeding $5450.00. This recommendation was approved by the Minister and the attached voucher covers the expenditures incurred.\n\nAt the time the memorandum was prepared an amount of $5450.00 was available, but subsequent small payments made since that time have reduced the amount available to the sum mentioned on the voucher; namely, $5391.30. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order for the amount just stated in order that the account may be paid. As the attached accounts are receipted, the purchase order should be issued in favour of the Diocese of Grouard.

Beuglet, O.M.I., Administrator of the Diocese of Grouard, attached thereto.\n\nThere is at Sturgeon Lake an Indian residential school with an enrolment at this date of 30 pupils. This school is administered under the direction of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Grouard. Grants are paid by this Department at the rate of $150.00 per pupil per annum.\n\nThe residential school at Sturgeon Lake is an old, dilapidated and insanitary building. It has been during the last two or three years unfit for the purpose for which it has been used. The insanitary condition of this school building has been brought to our attention frequently by the Bishop of Grouard. It was finally decided that we would contribute an amount not exceeding $25,000.00 for the purchase of material and supplies, on the understanding that the church authorities would supply the labour necessary for the reconstruction of the building, without cost to the Government. Authority to enter into this agreement was received by this Branch from the Minister in a memorandum dated November 16, 1942. It was further agreed that the church authorities would forgo certain repairs at the other four schools operated by them, thus enabling the Department to effect certain savings in\n\nJohn Schofield, Esq.,\nController of Construction,\nDepartment of Munitions and Supply,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 26th, 1943.\n\nMr. Harold W.

We have made representations during a number of years to the Department of Indian Affairs relative to the construction of an Indian Boarding-school at Star Lake in the Vicarate of Grouard which is falling to ruin and has become a source of danger for the health of Indian children as well as a fire hazard. As early as 1941 the Department authorized the collection of material for the carrying out of this project. It was decided to build with wood; the size would be 106 feet long by 50 feet wide, with cellar, ground floor and second story which would be heated by steam and running water. We have all the building supplies on hand except the steam heating system; the plumbing and electrical material would still have to be obtained.\n\n2. b) Star Lake, Calais, Alberta\n   c) Immediately\n   d) Spring 1944\n   e) Indian boarding-school\n\n3. $35,000.00\n\n4. As explained above this school was built a long time ago and is going to ruin.\n\nIn sanitary grounds it was decided to build this school to protect the health of the children some of whom died last winter and this was attributed to the lack of comfort as this house is very difficult to heat. It is also a very serious fire hazard because the heating system is not all it should be.\n\nThat is why the Indian Affairs Department, having realized the absolute necessity of bettering the situation, decided that at all cost, in spite of present war conditions, to re-build this school.\n8. For 2 years now the Indian Affairs Department has each year been making a grant for the re-building of this school.\n\n9. The Federal Government has taken over the cost of the supplies for rebuilding this school and the Vicariate of Grouard will supply the labour.\n\n10.

These pillows were supplied free of charge, as they were surplus to requirements at one of the Air Force camps. As you are aware, the Department does not usually supply such articles to residential schools and as these pillows are stated to be in good condition I feel that the school management is obtaining them at a very reasonable cost if they pay the transportation charges. Under the circumstances we do not feel it advisable to refund the amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. Alac, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSturgeon Lake Indian Residential School,\nCalais, Alta.\nMcLennan, August 10, 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hogy  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 3rd addressed to Bishop Langlois, I wish to assure you that His Excellency's health is gradually improving and allows him to resume satisfactorily part of his former duties.\n\nI was getting ready to write to you regarding our Sturgeon Lake project when your kindly letter came in. As poor road conditions prevented us from starting the construction before mid-July, I had little to report until now.\n\nThe construction of what we might call the \"Girls' Hall\" at the Sturgeon Lake Indian School is well under way by now. The foundation has been laid and the walls are being erected. We presume that the building will be completed exteriorly in early September.\n\nQuite recently, the contractor in charge at Sturgeon Lake brought to our notice a logical fact, namely, that the installation of the heating and electrical systems should normally be started at the present time, presuming that the work can be continued during the colder months. Otherwise, the construction will have to be suspended as soon as the frame-work of the building is up, in September.\n\nBefore requesting estimates and Permits with regard to the installation of said \"systems\", I should like to know if the Department (according to the existing special agreement) would later refund our expenses, should we find the means to go ahead on our own and arrange immediately for said installation. - Your prompt reply would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWith best wishes and kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Beuglet, O.M.I.  \nAdministrator\nOttawa,\nAugust 26, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School,\nLesser Slave Lake Indian Agency.\n\nIn connection with the above I would direct your attention to official letter of January 6, 1942, addressed to Right Reverend U. Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, also to my memorandum of November 16, 1942.\n\nOwing to illness and absence from his Diocese, Bishop Langlois has not previously written to us this year in regard to the new buildings that he is erecting at Sturgeon Lake. However, I am today in receipt of a letter dated August 10, 1943, from Reverend L. Beuglet, O.M.I., Administrator of the Grouard Diocese, in which he states that poor road conditions prevented them from starting construction before mid-July. The construction of one wing of the building is well under way. The foundation has been laid and the walls are being erected and it is hoped to have the exterior of the building completed early in September.\n\nOn behalf of the Bishop the Administrator advises that it is now necessary to give consideration to the installation of the heating and electrical systems and he requests authority to proceed with the installation of these systems.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\nIn the letter mentioned in the first paragraph of this memorandum Bishop Langlois was definitely informed that the total amount that the Government would expend at Sturgeon Lake would be $25,000.00. During the fiscal year 1941-42 we expended an amount of $5,331.10. During the fiscal year 1942-43 the amount of $5,450.00 was expended. This makes a total expenditure so far of $10,781.10. In the current year's appropriation an amount of $5,500.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Sturgeon Lake School and I would, therefore, appreciate your authority to advise Bishop Langlois to proceed with the purchase of the heating and electrical systems, on the understanding that during the current fiscal year the Department can only allow an amount of $5,500.00.\n\nAs you were informed in my memorandum of November 16, 1942, the Bishop was advised that in erecting the school it should be kept in mind that it is not the intention of the Department to increase the pupilage allowed. In view of the contents of official letter of January 6, 1942, and also of the letter just mentioned, I feel that we are fully protecting ourselves.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School,\nLesser Slave Lake Indian Agency.\n\nIn connection with the above I would direct your attention to official letter of January 6, 1942, addressed to Right Reverend U.

The building is completed externally. The asbestos shingle siding, which was used for the outside walls has a very fine appearance. The carpenters are now working inside sheathing the ceilings and walls with gyproc. The plumbing is practically completed, and the boiler is already installed, but the plumbers are waiting for shipment of radiation to complete the heating system.\n\nThe contract for plumbing and heating amounts to $12,269. According to receipt, you will see that I have paid $4,840.95, leaving a balance of $7,428.07. I have also on hand paid accounts for lumber, bricks, cement, gyproc, forming a total of $5,000. Therefore, I would ask you to kindly include in next year's appropriation an amount of $12,000, to pay the balance of plumbing and heating and other accounts, as stated above.\n\nAll the passers-by stop to admire the building and speak of it highly. The personnel and children are anxious to move into it. In fact, it is quite a contrast with the dilapidated building! The Department is to be complimented for the financial assistance given and for the interest manifested in the fostering of this urgent project.\n\nWith every good wish and kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. Beuglet, O.M.I.\nAdministrator.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Langlois, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, promised that the Department would allow repairs required to the above school at an amount of ........................................ $ 25,000.00\n\nThe following payments have been made:\n\n1941-42 ............ $ 5,331.10\n1942-43 ............ 5,450.00\n1943-44 ............ 5,494.21 $ 16,275.31\n\nThe amount still due, as per Department's promise of January 6, 1942 .................. $ 8,724.69\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 4, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letters of the 25th ultimo, enclosing accounts in connection with the expenditure at the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. On checking these accounts it is found that those from the Canadian General Electric Company provide a discount of 1% if the account is paid within ten days. Present regulations require us to take advantage of all discounts. Consequently, as the total of the Canadian General Electric accounts was $579.01, we have deducted $5.79, or 1%, making the net amount refundable to you in connection with these Canadian General Electric Company accounts $573.22. With the addition of the payments you made to the Northern Alberta Railways, J.H. Ashdown Hardware and Lockerbie and Hole Limited, the total we can allow is $5,494.21, a cheque for which amount will go forward under separate cover to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nI also note from your letters that the total contract for plumbing and heating amounts to $12,269.00 and that with the payment made this year there is still a balance due that firm of $7,428.07. I also note that you have additional accounts on hand of $5,000.00. With regard to your request that the total of these, approximately $12,000.00, be provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1944-45, I regret that at the present time I cannot see how we can provide this amount. However, we will be prepared to make another payment of approximately $5,500.00. If you submit a request for a payment of approximately\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nDiocese of Grouard,\nMcLennan, Alta.\n$5,500.00 about the middle of May, 1944, we can handle the matter at that time. When forwarding a request for this payment you should, of course, attach receipted accounts to this amount.\n\nIn connection with repairs and improvements at the Sturgeon Lake School, I would refer you to official letter of January 6, 1942, addressed to Bishop Langlois, and direct your special attention to paragraph 5 of that letter in which it was intimated that the payment by the Department would be spread over a period of four or five years and that the total amount we promised to allow would not exceed $25,000.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Alac, who built the first Catholic Church at Grande Prairie, is in charge of the Mission and is assisted by Father Gigu\u00e8re.\n\nSister Saturnine is the Mother Superior who is assisted by ten other Sisters.\n\nThere are 85 pupils on the roll; all Indians.\n\nPractically all the work has been done by the Brothers.\n\nThe building was designed by Brother Laurin of Montreal, who is in charge of the work. Brother Allie of Quebec City is responsible for the painting; Brother Leduc from Montreal for brickwork, Brothers Belcourt and Dumas are also assisting in the construction. Brother Michael Mathis, who has been attached to the Mission for many years, has also made valuable contributions to the construction of this magnificent structure.\n\nThe old dormitory, built in 1907, will be later torn down; other buildings moved back, which will allow for more pleasing surroundings.\n\nDescription of Building\n\nThe building which is 120 x 50 feet is two storeys with a high, full cement basement, and an attic which can later be utilized.\n\nThe top floor contains recreation hall for girls, chapel for the Sisters, parlor for visitors' offices and infirmary for boys, parlor for Indian visitors, two dining rooms for Sisters and Fathers, room for those visiting the Sisters, sewing room, medicine room, recreation hall for the Sisters.\n\nThe basement contains a large kitchen, 2 dining rooms, one for boys and one for girls; laundry, bakery, store room, dining room for workers, milk room, pantry and steam bath room.\n\nThe building will be heated and electrically lighted from a central system located in a fire-proof building.\n\nThe entrance is artistically designed and in keeping with the general design of the building. The finest fir has been used in the floors.\n\nThe predominant colors throughout the building are white, cream and blue.\n\nA good part of the machinery for the construction was carried by the truck of the Grouard Mission. The driver, Brother Gaucher, is also a member of the late Fathers. The gravel, over six hundred yards, used in the building, was hauled from the Little Smoky. The lumber was planed by one of the brothers at the Wabasca Mission, who came especially for the purpose, with his planer.\n\nThe construction of the building has been carried on successfully and in spite of the fact that the Mission is 60 miles from a railway line and wartime conditions, due to the energy and skill of Revd. Father Mathis, M.I., of Grouard, whose only purpose and desire was to provide these boys and children a convenient and suitable building for the\n\nGRANDE PRAIRIE TRIBUNE,\nJULY 20, 1944\nLa Corporation Episcopale C.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn response to your inquiry regarding the cost and present condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School to the construction of which you were good enough to contribute a rather large amount, I wish to make the following statement:\n\n(1) The school has cost to date, that is to January 1st, 1945, $66,212.82.\n\n(2) There is still to be done some painting and carpenter work.\n\n(3) These two items will not cost over $500.00.\n\n(4) The furnishing of the school has only cost $601.32. The reason of this small expenditure is that the furniture of the old school was used for the most part. Of course it must be understood that, when conditions warrant it, the Department will supply such quantities of new furniture as it may be deemed necessary to place this school on footing equal to that of other Departmental institutions.\n\n(5) The diocesan authorities have contributed to date $49,937.51 and the Department $16,275.31. When the Department has fulfilled its pledge, this latter amount will be increased to about $25,000.00 unless it is deemed advisable, and justifiable as well, to contribute a larger amount than was at first promised by the Department. This would only be, in our estimation, just and fair as there was a large increase in building costs between the date of the promise made by the Department and the final completion of the building.\n\nThe school measures 120 x 50 feet, has two storeys and a full basement. This basement has a 9 feet ceiling, the ground floor 10, and the second story 9. There is moreover an annex for the boilerroom which measures 20' x 40', with a 9' ceiling. This\nwould give a total cubage of 175,200 feet. At the low cost of $0.40 per cubic foot, and we consider this to be a very low price due to the very high cost of transportation between Sturgeon Lake and supply centers, this new school would be worth $70,080.00.\n\nI am enclosing a photograph taken just before the outside scaffolding was taken down, which gives a fair idea of the size and appearance of the building, but a more up-to-date photograph will shortly be forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The total shown in your letter was $5,500.34. As you were previously informed, an amount of $5,500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation. The additional amount of 34\u00a2 is very small; but, unfortunately, we will have to confine our total payment to $5,500.00.\n\nOn reviewing the accounts which you submitted, it is found that the following freight receipts were not attached:\n\n1.

This month the residential schools at Calais, Joussard and Whitefish Lake were advised that containers for samples of drinking water would arrive and that bacteriological examination of the water would be done by the Provincial laboratory in Edmonton. The following results have been received to date:\n\nDrilled well - Calais:\nThe water represented by this sample does not show the presence of organisms indicating unfavorable contamination but gives a high bacterial count for such a deep well which, we think, indicates the entrance of surface water either over the head of the well or down the side of the casing. This should be excluded.\n\nTap in building - Sturgeon Lake:\nThe water represented by this sample does not show any bacterial evidence unfavorable contamination.\n\nResults from the other two schools are not yet in.\n\nMarguerite Weder,\n(Miss) Marguerite Weder B.

I explained in some detail the proper procedure and stated that no child should enter a school until it had been examined by a doctor, and found fit to attend. If, in the opinion of the doctor, it was not fit to attend, then nobody at the agency or at the school had any authority to force the child's attendance; and the parents or guardian should receive Family Allowances for such child.\n\nG.H.

Inspectorate.\nCalgary, April 12th, 1946.\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my visit to the Lesser Slave Lake Agency.\n\nGENERAL\n\nWe worked into our itinerary a visit to the Bishop's Palace at McLennan, where it was our good fortune to meet His Lordship, Bishop U. Langlois. His secretary, Rev. L. Beuglet, stated that the new school at Sturgeon Lake had cost $70,000.00 and wished me to report my impressions of this institution as it was his understanding that the Branch had offered to pay 50% of the cost.\n\nThis new school is a very well constructed building. It is modern and well planned; I was particularly impressed with the dormitories. I can quite believe it cost $70,000.00 since material and labour were higher in War years than previously. I would say that good value was received at that cost.\n\nThis school is situated on the shores of a beautiful lake and the Alaska Highway passes between it and the lake. It will attract the attention of tourists from all parts of the World, and it is hoped that the grounds and buildings can always be kept in a good state of repair, and attractive, because the many who will see it will get their impression of our educational institutions from what they see here.\n\nGeneralities were the topic of conversation with His Lordship and I left him impressed with the idea that he will co-operate with an open mind on all questions that will arise.\n\nG.

(RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\nOttawa, January 6, 1942.\n\nMy dear Bishop Langlois:\n\nIt is my understanding that during your recent visit to Ottawa you discussed with the Chief Executive Assistant the dilapidated and insanitary condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School and ways and means whereby in your judgment this school could be reconstructed.\n\nYou also discussed with me at the time of your visit the condition of this school and the necessity of certain repairs which were urgently required if the school were to remain in operation.\n\nThe condition of the Sturgeon Lake School has been carefully reviewed by the officials and the Minister of this Department on a number of occasions during the last two or three years. In this connection may I refer to the Minister's letter to you, dated August 25, 1941. In this letter the Minister takes the position that in view of war conditions he is not prepared to commit the Government to the rebuilding of the school at Sturgeon Lake. However, we have been greatly disturbed by the statements made by you in respect to the actual condition of the girls' wing of the school and particularly the fire hazards that now exist. We are personally convinced, therefore, that the building should be either reconstructed or abandoned. With the limited funds at our disposal and the building program suspended, the abandonment of the school at this particular time is not in our judgment a practical proposal.\n\nIt has been decided, therefore, that steps should be taken toward the reconstruction of the building.\n\nRight Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nand with this object in mind, the Minister is prepared to recommend that an order-in-council be passed, transferring to the Sturgeon Lake School certain unexpended balances of the Grouard, Joussard and Vermilion Schools. These unexpended balances amount to approximately $5,000. In your conversation with me you intimated that it was of the utmost importance that certain building supplies should go in by winter freight, and it is our hope that the amount of money now re-allocated will enable you to purchase these supplies.\n\nYou can readily appreciate how difficult it is for a government to undertake commitments that involve the expenditure of money, other than the amounts actually contained in the appropriations voted annually by Parliament. It is just possible, however, that an amount, approximately equal to the amount spent for repairs at the five schools in your diocese, might during the next four or five years be spent on the reconstruction of the girls' wing. This could only be done, of course, on the understanding that the Church would assume full responsibility for the repairs needed during this period at the other four schools and on the understanding also that the total amount spent by the Government at Sturgeon Lake would not exceed $25,000. In the course of your interview with me, you intimated that it was the intention of the Church to spend an amount equal to the amount spent by the Government in supplying labour and materials for the reconstruction work at Sturgeon Lake. If I am mistaken in this conclusion, you might state in your reply the extent to which the Church is prepared to contribute to this project.\n\nThe plans of the new building, prepared by you and submitted to the Department for consideration a couple of years ago, appear to be satisfactory. In the work of reconstruction every effort should be made to make the building as fireproof as possible. The work will of course be subject to departmental inspection and approval from time to time.\n\nIn conclusion, may I refer again to the Minister's letter of August 25, last, in which he referred generally\nto the advisability or reviewing our residential school policy in order that the cost of this method of education might be reduced. In approving of the expenditures at Sturgeon Lake it must be understood that we are doing so only because of the general insanitary condition of the building and the acute fire hazards to which I have already referred, and that we must still keep in mind the substitution of day schools for residential schools where local conditions render such action on our part at all possible. It must be understood also that the reconstruction of the Sturgeon Lake School cannot commit the Department in any way to an increase of pupils at the institution at any time in the years immediately ahead of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, January 6, 1942.\n\nMy dear Bishop Langlois:\n\nIt is my understanding that during your recent visit to Ottawa you discussed with the Chief Executive Assistant the dilapidated and insanitary condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School and ways and means whereby in your judgment this school could be reconstructed.\n\nYou also discussed with me at the time of your visit the condition of this school and the necessity of certain repairs which were urgently required if the school were to remain in operation.\n\nThe condition of the Sturgeon Lake School has been carefully reviewed by the officials and the Minister of this Department on a number of occasions during the last two or three years.

The longer it lasts the more serious will be the consequences afterwards. We are now, as you know, spending at the rate of one and a half billion dollars a year for war purposes. In addition we have to provide for the ordinary expense of running the Government machine. Further, we must find funds to assist Great Britain in making purchases in this country to the extent of almost another billion dollars. The providing of these large sums during each year the war continues is a very great task. When the war is over it will be a more difficult one to pay back the money we have borrowed. Undoubtedly there will have to be a very drastic curtailment in all government spending. Many of the privileges that we have enjoyed and the benefits we have received at public expense will be cancelled or reduced. We cannot expect to carry on all our institutions in the same way and on the same scale as we did prior to the outbreak of war. There may have to be changes in many of them, even in those that have been established for a\n\nThe Right Reverend O. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard,\nGROUARD, Alta.\nlong time and which, over a period of years, have been considered to be more or less permanent. Therefore we must keep all these things in mind in dealing with problems which though pressing at the moment may involve further expenditures of money.\n\nThis brings me to the request you have made that authority should be given to divert funds that have been provided for ordinary repairs to your other schools in Alberta in order that a start can be made on the construction of new and more permanent buildings involving much larger expenditures in the future amounting to approximately $50,000.\n\nI would not be frank if I did not say that due to the war and what will follow after the war, I think the time has arrived when further consideration will have to be given to the cost of carrying on the present Indian educational system. We must of necessity consider carefully making further capital expenditures on a number of the existing residential schools. I do not wish to suggest that there is not a need for residential schools in connection with the welfare of the Indians, but I think you will agree that that need is greater or less, depending upon where they are situated and the extent to which they provide the necessary educational facilities at a reasonable cost.\n\nThere are in the Sturgeon Lake Reserve approximately 350 Indians. The attendance in the Sturgeon Lake School during the past few years has averaged between 80 and 90. With two or three exceptions all of the children come from families belonging to this Reserve. I am informed that the school was started about the year 1912, in which year the grant was $2,500. In the year 1922-23 the grant had increased to about $5,600. In the year 1932-33 it had increased to $11,000, and last year it had increased to nearly $15,000. Although your church constructed the buildings during this period the Department made considerable annual expenditures for repairs and in 1929 made a grant of $3,000 towards the cost of construction of a new building. At the same time we have paid the cost of the night watchman.\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that, taking into consideration the amount of the per capita grant and amounts paid for annual repairs, text books and school supplies,\nthe cost so far as the Government is concerned is very close to $200. per pupil. While this cost includes feeding and clothing the children, it should be kept in mind that the average cost or educating an Indian child in the day schools is about $45. per annum, which is less than one quarter of the cost. Again, when one compares the cost per pupil in rural white schools in Alberta, which averages about $60. a year, the question arises as to the extent to which the taxpayers of Canada should be asked to contribute to the cost of educating Indian children in residential schools when the amount is much higher than what they pay for educating their own children. There are, of course, many facts which make a comparison of this kind difficult, due to the fact that a good many of the Indian bands are more or less nomadic in their habits.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned before, the whole problem is one which will have to be given serious consideration. I think we should explore the possibility of establishing day schools in the Sturgeon Lake Reserve and operating them during the periods in the year when the Indians are on the Reserve.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that the Government is very appreciative of the burdens assumed by the churches of all denominations in connection with our Indian educational problem and the contributions, financial and otherwise, that they have made in the past in assisting the Department in carrying out this responsibility.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

School. Please pay us the amount of $1,250.00, being the current year's appropriation for above School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nL. Beuglet, O.M.I.\nOttawa, January 18, 1945.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn response to your inquiry regarding the cost and present condition of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School to the construction of which you were good enough to contribute a rather large amount, I wish to make the following statement:\n\n(1) The school has cost to date, that is to January 1st, 1945, $66,212.82.\n\n(2) There is still to be done some painting and carpenter work.\n\n(3) These two items will not cost over $500.00\n\n(4) The furnishing of the school has only cost $601.32. The reason of this small expenditure is that the furniture of the old school was used for the most part. Of course it must be understood that, when conditions warrant it, the Department will supply such quantities of new furniture as it may be deemed necessary to place this school on a footing equal to that of other Departmental institutions.\n\n(5) The diocesan authorities have contributed to date $49,937.51 and the Department $16,275.31. When the diocese has fulfilled its pledge, this latter amount will be increased to about $25,000.00 unless it is deemed advisable, and justifiable as well, to contribute a larger amount than was at first promised by the Department. This would only be, in our estimation, just and fair as there was a large increase in building costs between the date of the promise made by the Department and the final completion of the building.\n\nThe school measures 120 x 50 feet, has two storeys and a full basement. This basement has a 5 foot ceiling, the ground floor 10, and the second storey 9. There is moreover an attic above the boilerroom which measures 200 x 50', with a 9' ceiling. This would give a total cubage of 175,200 feet. At the low cost of $0.40 per cubic foot, and we consider this to be a very low price due to the very high cost of transportation between Sturgeon Lake and supply centers, this new school would be worth $70,080.00.\n\nI am enclosing a photograph taken just before the outside scaffolding was taken down, which gives a fair idea of the size and appearance of the building, but a more up-to-date photograph will shortly be forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nA few days ago Bishop Routhier and Father Plourde discussed with the Minister the request that had previously been made for the Department to share in the additional amount required to complete the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School, Alberta. While the Minister did not make any promise, he stated he would be glad to consider the matter again when the time came to approve of the Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48. Will you please bring the matter up for consideration at that time.\n\nMarch 19, 1947.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nIndian Affairs.

J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., in which he stated that Sturgeon Lake School had cost the church, to January 1st, 1945, $66,212.82. The department had previously contributed an amount of $25,000.00 towards the cost of the above school. In order to make this payment, the Department reduced the amounts allowed to the other Indian Residential Schools in the Diocese of Grouard.\n\nIn Mr. Jackson's memorandum referred to above, it is stated that the Minister wished to consider the matter when our supplementary estimates for 1947-48 were being considered.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me know the Minister's wishes with regard to the request for an additional payment towards the cost of the above school.\n\nDirector\nCol.

Mr. J. Allison Glen, on May 15th, 1946:\n\n\"You will remember that when I pleaded for an additional grant of $10,000.00 for the construction of the new Sturgeon Lake School, I stated that a letter from Mr. Hoey mentioned the intention of spending a sum by the Church equal to the amount to be supplied by the Government. This letter of Jan. 6th 1942 of Mr. Hoey to Bishop Langlois states that \"In our conversation interview with me you estimated that it was the intention of the church to spend an amount equal to the amount spent by the Government in supplying labour and material for the construction work at Sturgeon Lake\". You must have this on file. You must well realize that the building of this school was a Government responsibility and that if the Church had pleased for years before the war and during the war finally consented to pay for its construction it was because the state of the old building created a constant threat to the health not to mention the comfort of the children and staff. Perhaps Mr. Jackson does not realize this sufficiently. In my mind for years previous to the war, the Department of Indian Affairs did not attend sufficiently to its duty of providing itself the schools in practically the whole of Northern Canada and certainly not both in the Churches so schools would have been built. In the present case of the Sturgeon Lake School, because through no fault of ours we had to spend a sum of $50,000.00 Mr. Jackson tells us that we have no basis on which to claim any additional help because we have spent more. It appears to me that a sympathetic understanding or the case would of itself suggest that help, when we first first place gave far more than the Government then was our burdened duty because the Department could not then build. Would you therefore be good enough to reconsider your attitude, and let me know your decision.\"\n\nI fear that my arguments were not brought out in a sufficiently clear light and I would be extremely anxious that next year the reasonable ness of our plea be stressed and the very heavy burden that was unduly placed upon our shoulders be lightened by reimbursing our Episcopal Corporation.\n\nWith kind regards to yourself and the other members of your Department, I remain.\n\nHenri Routhier, O.M.I.\nBishop of Naissus,\nCoadjutor of Grouard\n\nCopied:\nCS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt.of Welfare & Training,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nRe purchase of Bake Oven for the Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nThe Sturgeon Lake Residential School being interested in obtaining a Bake Oven having a capacity of 72 loaves, I enclose herewith a copy of Brantford oven catalogue and you will see illustrated on page five the Brantford two deck portable oven, either coal or wood fired, having a capacity of the size wanted. Enclosed also a letter from the Brantford Oven & Rack Company, quoting a price of $629.00 f.o.b. their factory.\n\nIn your letter, file 131-9-5 (WT), dated June 6th, 1947, you advised that the amount of $350.00 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of a dough mixer and Bake Oven.\n\nI fail to understand how both a dough mixer and bake oven can be bought for the amount of $350.00, when a bake oven alone having the required capacity will cost $629.00, f.o.b. the factory. I feel assured that the matter of the cost of this equipment was not given careful consideration. Will you please advise how the Department can reconcile the amount of $350, which was provided for this expenditure with the cost of the equipment.\n\nHowever, I wish to reiterate that the size of Bake Oven required at the Sturgeon Lake Res. School is a 72 loaves capacity and I would recommend the No. 2 Oven, offered by the Brantford Oven & Rack Company. As the Company states that the approximate delivery on this oven would be three months, it is hoped that the Purchasing Department will attend to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Neary, re requisitions for the Residential Schools in the Grouard Diocese, signed by Rev. L. Beauglet, O.M.I. at McLennan, Alta. Sept. 13, 1948.\n\nAt Sturgeon Lake, a new cow and horse barn is required to replace the old dilapidated log one which threatens to cave in. It is the intention of the Principal to build this new barn in 1949. If $2000.00 were available immediately from the 1948-49 appropriation the lumber could be bought this fall so that construction of the building may begin early in the spring of 1949, and a further amount made available from the estimates of 1948-49 to carry out the project.\n\nI believe, Mr. Neary, that the above requisitions are legitimate and trust that you will give them your very careful consideration.\n\n(Sgd) Rev.

We are now in receipt of a letter from Dr. E. L.

Lapp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nRegional Supervisor Gooderham has forwarded to us a copy of his letter to you dated 23rd February, 1949, in connection with the poor lighting facilities in the classrooms at Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nPlease let us know the cost of carrying out the improvements suggested by Dr. E.L. Stone in order for us to authorize the expenditure. You realize, of course, that this is a Church-owned school and we only have a limited amount provided in our appropriation for repairs and improvements.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Lighting - Sturgeon Lake Residential School\n\nReference is made to your letter of March 3rd, file 765-5 (E.1) regarding the cost of carrying out the improvements suggested by Dr. E.L. Stone to the lighting in the classrooms of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nThe Vanderagen Hardware of High Prairie will supply fifteen opalescent glass shades and fifteen 60 Watt bulbs for a total of $54.75, prices subject to change without notice.\n\nMr. A. Engbretson, a local electrician, stated today that, considering the fact that Sturgeon Lake is sixty miles from High Prairie, the cost of installation of the fifteen shades would be $25.00. Therefore the total cost of carrying out the improvements would be approximately $80.00.\n\nReverend Father Roue, Principal of the School, has informed me that the capacity of the power plant at the school is very limited and that it is doubtful if the increased load could be carried should 60 Watt bulbs be installed. Father Roue states also that the teachers plan the work so that activities that do not strain the eyes are used when the classrooms are insufficiently lighted.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\n18th March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant regarding the improvements suggested by Dr. E.L. Stone to the lighting in the classrooms of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the contents of the last paragraph of your letter, it is felt that it would not be to much advantage in supplying the extra lamps recommended by Dr. Stone. However, you should discuss the matter again with the Reverend Principal, and if you ascertain that the increased load can be carried by the present power plant, authority is granted for an expenditure not exceeding $80.00.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

This estimate is based on 40 working days for 6 carpenters.\nwho have agreed to work for $6.00 a day. This estimate is within the $4000.00 which I am told can now be used for this project. The building will not be fully completed, but there will only be the cement floor and installation of stalls for the sires and calves which can be completed when the balance of the amount has been voted by your department.\n\nI therefore hope that you will be able to authorize the purchase of the lumber immediately so that the work can be proceeded with during the holidays. We are giving you the name of Mr. Tingstad as a possible source for the lumber supply but you are at liberty to buy it from other merchants if you so desire.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.O.

This construction was necessary and for a good many years we intended to have it built, but the finances of the school did not permit to realize our project. Now thanks to the Department we can start to build. The cement and lumber have already been received. There is something that we still need before we can start building; it is a supply of nails. We have tried everywhere in Edmonton and so far have not been able to get any. They tell us might have some in a month but nothing definite. Would you be willing to buy what we need through your purchasing agent, as undoubtedly he has more chance than we have to secure this item. If you decide it that we should pay the cost of nails we are quite willing to do so as long as we get them, and I hope it would not take too long. Enclosed is a list of nails required for the construction.\n\nWith sincere thanks,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN.

I saw their present equipment when I had occasion to visit their school last September. I found it so inadequate that I doubt very much if it will last over the winter.\n\nIf there is not sufficient funds standing to the credit of the school, would you authorize His Excellency Bishop Routhier to advance the money for this purchase?

Hambly, Inspector of Schools, Grande Prairie, has again stated that the lighting facilities in the classrooms in the Sturgeon Lake School are completely inadequate and that there will almost certainly be serious damage to the children's eyes if the lighting is not improved.\n\nReverend N. Rouse, principal of the school has informed me that the capacity of his present lighting plant is only 3 K.H.I. and that it is much too small to light the buildings at the school. Father Rouse would be willing to install one of the two large A.C. Diesel plants which will not be needed at the \"Abasca C.E. Residential School.\" I therefore recommend that one of the plants be moved from Abasca to Sturgeon Lake immediately so that the classrooms may be properly lighted.\n\nIt would also be necessary to supply the Sturgeon Lake school with a small A.C. plant of about 3 K.H.I. capacity for use at night when little power is needed.\n\nG.S.

Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nReference is made to your letter of February 23rd, 1949, file 131-4B-2 and to our letter of November 7th, file 131-4-2.\n\nMr. J.K.O. Hambly, Inspector of Schools, Grande Prairie, has again brought to my attention the fact that the lighting facilities in the classrooms in the Sturgeon Lake School are completely inadequate and that there will almost certainly be serious damage to the children's eyes if the lighting is not improved.\n\nWhen I visited the school on November 22nd I asked Reverend N. Rouse, Principal, if his present lighting plant had sufficient capacity to allow installation of more lights and larger bulbs in the classrooms. He stated that the lighting plant is in very poor condition and that it has insufficient capacity as it is rated at only 3 KWH. Since the Sturgeon Lake school has several buildings the lighting plant at best was completely inadequate.\n\nI asked Father Rouse if he would be interested in an A.C. diesel plant such as those at the Wabasca C.E. School. After studying his needs Father Rouse came to see me today and stated that he would be in favour of installing such a plant. Therefore I strongly recommend that one of the two plants at the Wabasca C.E. School be brought to Sturgeon Lake and installed immediately.\n\nA small A.C. diesel plant of about 3 KWH capacity should be purchased for the Sturgeon Lake school for use at night when little power is needed.\n\nG.S. Lapp\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6375, file 765-5, part 3)\nRe: Sturgeon Lake Residential School.\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter received from Mr. Lapp which brings up the question of the lighting in the above school. On a previous occasion the Superintendent of Indian Health Services commented on the poor lighting facilities in this school.\n\nApparently there are two identical power plants in the new dormitory block at the Wabasca Church of England School. They are powered by D6 International Diesel Motors which reportedly consume considerable fuel and hence are considered too expensive to operate during the evenings. Also since the residence recently erected for our assistant at Wabasca is dependent upon the school plant for electricity, this residence is likely to be without light during the evening hours because the school plant will be too expensive to operate continually.\n\nIt is assumed that the two identical plants were provided at Wabasca so that power would always be available should one of the machines break down. Mr. Lapp suggests the following to remedy conditions existing at Sturgeon Lake and Wabasca:\n\n1. Transfer one of the D6 units from Wabasca to Sturgeon Lake to improve lighting facilities at Sturgeon Lake; the present plant does not supply sufficient power.\n\n2. Purchase a small 3 K.W.H. plant to replace the large unit taken from Wabasca. This small plant could be operated at night and assure power for the assistant agent's residence and the school, should the large one break down.\n\nMr. Lapp also suggests that we purchase a small unit for Sturgeon Lake but I do not consider this necessary because they can continue to use the old unit when needed.\n\nI believe you are familiar with the type of plants supplied to these schools and if the arrangement is satisfactory to you and the funds are available, I recommend the purchase of the small unit for Wabasca and the transfer of one of the large units to Sturgeon Lake. You realize of course, that the Sturgeon Lake School is a church owned building.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Pratt as he will be interested in it so far as it concerns the assistant agent's residence at Wabasca.\n\nIf shipment of this equipment can be carried out now, we would be taking advantage of the lower winter freight rates.\n\nG.

O., submitting the following:\n\nThat there are six girls in Grade VIII and two in lower grades who are nearly 16 years of age, and this will probably be their last year in school. The Sister Superior has suggested that instead of keeping the above-mentioned girls in the classroom all the time they be kept out of the classroom the greater part of the day and receive added training in household science, such as cooking, sewing, &c. Personally I think this is an excellent idea, but before replying to the Sister Superior, I shall be glad to have the Department's opinion in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

It is noted that all of these girls are about 16 years of age and that this will likely be their last year in school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Residential School has written:\n\n\"The parents of this child, whose mother is paid under No. 72 Sturgeon Lake, are living apart; the mother being with another man. The child has been left with her father who cannot take care of her properly. Consequently she must be considered as a neglected child. Her father has put her at the Mission after his wife left him and made application for her admission at Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School and whom I could only accept as a grant earning pupil. The family has always followed the Indian mode of life.\n\nSgd: H. Fournier, Principal.\"\n\nI also have the information that the above child is a sister of Olga, Delphine Kiyawasew, aged 12, a grant-earning pupil in the same school. I also have been informed that the mother of this child has left her home to go and live with another halfbreed named Badger.

P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nSturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School, Calais, Alta.\n\nJanuary 8th, 1939\n\nStatement of Lucy Noskiye.\n\nThe parents of this child, whose mother, Mary Noskiye, is paid under No. 72, at Sturgeon Lake, are living apart; the mother being with another man. The child has been placed by her father, Alfred Noskiye, a non-treaty Indian at the Sturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School, as he could not take care of her properly, after his wife left him. This family has never owned any property whatsoever and has always lived an Indian mode of life. Alfred Noskiye has made application for his daughter's admission at the Sturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School, as a grant earning pupil, last October. This admission has been deferred by the Department, till new information be given about Alfred Noskiye and Delphine Kiyawasew #0154.\n\nThe information about the former, is given above. Delphine Kiyawasew #0154 has been reported as daughter of Mary Noskiye and sister of Lucy Noskiye. This statement is right. She is also a daughter of Alfred Noskiye, but has been adopted by Pierre Kiyawasew No. 24 of the Sturgeon Lake band. It is a known fact that some old people adopt children of their relatives, whether treaty or non-treaty. Such is the case for Delphine, a daughter of Alfred Noskiye and Mary Noskiye, who has been adopted by Pierre Kiyawasew, previous to her admission at the Sturgeon Lake Ind. Res. School.\n\nIt follows that Mary Noskiye, mother of both children, has never been married to Pierre Kiyawasew.\n\nH.

Residential School.\n\nI enclose herewith the letter of the Principal giving the information and may add that Alfred Noskiye, the father of the child Lucy Noskiye, is a halfbreed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

Res. School,\nCalais, Alberta. October 4th, 1939.\n\nStatement of Marie Lucy Martineau.\n\nThis child, 3 years old, was brought by her father Elzear Martineau, to the Joussard Ind. School, when his wife died last summer.\n\nwhereas:\nThe father is unable to care properly for that child,\nNo suitable home has been found for her,\nNo room was available at the Joussard Indian School,\nAll the children of this family have been raised at the Sturgeon Lake Ind. School, and live actually on the Sturgeon Lake Reserve,\n\nThe Principal of the Joussard Indian School, has sent the child to the Sturgeon Lake School, with the consent of her father.\n\nI, therefore, send an application to the Indian Department, for admission of Marie Lucy Martineau at the Sturgeon Lake Indian School as a grant earning pupil.\n\nThe reason why the signature of the father does not appear on the application is obvious, as this man does not live on the Sturgeon Lake Reserve, but on the Sucker Creek Reserve, 80 miles away.\n\nH. Fournier, O.M.I., Principal.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nOctober 19th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the application for the admission of Marie Lucy Martineau, aged 3, to Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis child's mother died last August and it has to be admitted that the father is unable to care for her. Up to the present I have found no recommendable families willing to adopt the girl and except for the offer of the Sturgeon Lake Residential School, there is no prospect of my being able to place her with a reliable family before the winter.\n\nI am therefore recommending that she be placed in the Sturgeon Lake School but not under the school \"per diem\" grant; her age would not permit her to attend to the classroom.

P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOn this date Father FOURNIER of the Roman Catholic Mission, Calais, informed me that the above boys had run away from the School about 7:00 p.m. of the 19-9-40. The two KALAISON boys had run away about a week ago but had been picked up about 3 miles east of Debolt. Father FOURNIER informed me that some of the other school children thought that these boys were headed for Grande Prairie as the step-father of the KALAISON boys was working in the harvest in the Kleskun Lake district.\n\nI left the Detachment at 10:00 a.m., via P.C.R. 8159, accompanied by Father FOURNIER and Henry LAROCQUE. Patrol went as far as Moody's Crossing enquiring from everybody along the highway, but the children had not been seen. At Moody's Crossing, the shore of the Smoky River was examined for two miles in both directions for tracks or signs of building a raft, as Mr. MOODY, the Ranger, would not take these children across, and of course the children knew this, and we suspected they would build a raft and try to cross this way as the river is quite narrow at this point. However, nothing of this nature was discovered, and the patrol returned to Calais making further enquiries all along the way, but still nobody had seen the children. Arrived at the Detachment at 4:30 p.m.\n\nAt about 6:00 p.m., this date Grant McMillan, Manager of the Hudson's Bay Co. Post, Calais, brought four of the children to the Detachment, and stated he had picked them up about 2 miles west of Clarkson Valley, but that Frank KALAISON had run into the bush and got away. These four children were returned to the Mission, and the writer accompanied by Henry LAROCQUE, left for Crooked Creek at 5:30 p.m., but could not be searched, but it was impossible to follow his trail due to the leaves on the ground. Patrol continued as far as Crooked Creek but no trace of the boy could be found. Patrol returned to the Detachment at 8:30 p.m.\n\nI do not believe this boy went very far after being seen by Mr. McMillan, but simply hid in the bush as he no doubt was scared. It is quite likely he will be picked up by somebody before very much longer as everybody from Calais to Moody's Crossing is on the lookout for him. Further report will be submitted when this boy is located.\n\nS.U.I.\u2014NO EXPENSE (J.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6376, file 765-10, part 1)\nThe Indian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.,\n\nI am in receipt of the letter of the Chief of the Training Division of the 19-10-43 regarding the application for admission of Albert Joseph Awasis, No. 207, to the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. In my letter of the 14th Inst. Ult. I advised the department of my findings when checking the applications against the records in the Agency Annuity Paylists. It may well be that the boy is 7 years old, but in 1940, when the census was taken of the Indians in this agency the parents stated that the boy was 2 years of age.\n\nI am not very familiar with the handling of the School returns, this being done in the past by Mrs. N.F.L'Heureux, the former agent's wife, but I presumed that before the forms were sent to the Department that they were to be checked here for details as to eligibility for admission. This I did and then forwarded with my report to the Department. I have not seen the parents as they reside some 160 miles from here and the application was made to the Principal of the school and forwarded here in the usual way.\n\nW.B. Skead\nLesser Slave Lake Agency\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves the transfer of Rosanna Kiyawasew from the Sturgeon Lake Residential School to the Grouard Residential School, in order that she may follow the course in Home Economics.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Father Guimont of the Sturgeon Lake School, in which he dwells at length on the difficulties of recruiting which he has experienced this year.\n\nIt must be admitted, of course, that these difficulties are due in great part to war conditions and that some of them will disappear when peace is signed; but others are of a special nature and should be called to your attention.\n\nBefore doing so, however, I must insist again on the advisability of Indian agents being advised early in May or June that it is imperative for them to cooperate with school principals in recruiting when they themselves have difficulties in doing so. I have already called your attention to several cases where recruiting would have been made much easier, if the agents had taken an active part in it. I know, of course, that the agents are all very busy, and that most of them wish to cooperate with our principals, but a timely reminder on your part will always be useful.\n\nThe special difficulties with which the Sturgeon Lake School is confronted come from the assistance of pupils at Public Schools who normally should go to Sturgeon Lake. I am not aware of any clause in the Indian Act forbidding Indian children from attending Public Schools, and, on general principle, I can not myself object to such a course; but as a matter of fact, most Indian parents desire their children to attend these schools so that they will be relieved of all supervision from the Indian agent, and free to keep their children at home whenever they wish to do so.\nIn support of the above, I wish you to bear in mind the following:\n\n1. Indian parents are totally indifferent to the education of their children.\n\n2. Their traditional indolence and poverty make it impossible for them to clothe their children properly. They have no conception of a daily assistance at school and, as a consequence, the attendance of these Indian children in public schools is even lower than the attendance in Indian Day-schools.\n\n3. Indians desiring to send their children to public schools live on the outskirts of towns and villages, at distances ranging from three to five miles. Such distances preclude regular school attendance.\n\nWith the above in mind, I can only conclude that in almost all cases Indian parents who enroll their children in public schools do so because they wish to keep them at home. This also brings me to the conclusion that Indian children who are enrolled at the Calling Lake Day-school should be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake School as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG10, Volume 6376, file 765-10, part 2)\nOttawa, December 27, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to recruiting for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have carefully considered the statements made in your letter, and it is my intention to communicate with the Indian Agent, drawing special attention to your suggestion that pupils attending the Calling Lake White School should be placed in the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile,\nvia Kinuso, Alberta.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of information to the effect that the Principal of the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School has had considerable difficulty in recruiting pupils during the past year. We realize that some of these difficulties are due to present conditions, but at the same time I would like to have your assurance that you have supported the Principal in every possible manner in securing new pupils and in returning pupils who were allowed home on summer holidays and delayed their return.\n\nI am also informed that some Indian parents have been placing their children in white day schools. As you know, these schools are located some distance from the place where the Indian resides and in the ordinary course of events I doubt very much if the children attend regularly. I have in mind particularly the Calling Lake White School. I would like to know how many Indian children are enrolled at that school and I would also like to know the average attendance of these children from September 1 to the Christmas holidays. If the attendance has been as irregular as I suspect, I would like your opinion regarding the possibility of having these children placed in the Sturgeon Lake Residential School, where they would receive regular training and proper care and attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Napoleon Kiyawasew\nAge: 7 March 12 1937\nName of Band: Sturgeon Lake\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 75\nFather's full name and No.: Alexis Kiyawasew - 75\nMother's full name and No.: Elizabeth Campbell - 75\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: R.C.\n\nDoes applicant speak English?

As these pupils have obtained grant previously and are shown on the Return as having entered school as early as 1941, we would like a definition of the expression \"Not accepted\".\n\nOpposite the names of pupils 212 and 0228 there is a notation \"Too young\". No grant is requested for either of them. If these children are eligible for admission and have been placed in the school owing to unsatisfactory home conditions, application forms should be submitted giving full particulars. The Department may be able to approve their admission and allow you to draw grant for them even though they cannot attend class.\n\nSome of the pupils whose names appear on the return have been absent for at least two quarters. If they are not likely to return within the near future you should apply for their discharge and if at any time in the future they should wish to be readmitted, you may ask the Department for permission to do so.\n\nPupil No. 197 is shown on the March Quarter Return as being absent owing to illness. Pupil No. 198 was presumably in the school during the March quarter but is stated to be absent during the June quarter. Has a mistake been made in requesting grant in connection with these two pupils?\n\n-2-\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am positive they were mailed\nsame day as Returns. However owing to weather conditions, also\npoor roads, our mail service leaves much to be desired. Personally\nI shall investigate into the matter at our P.O. tomorrow.\n\nThe notation\n\"Not accepted\" after the names of pupils, Reads on Discharge,\n\"Put out of Treaty attending day school\"\n\nPupils 212 and 0228 belong to the\nsame family, they are orphans (of mother) I have been given to\nunderstand request for grant was made for both, when they were first\ntaken to the above, but owing to their age this was refused.\nNo 212 has since been adopted into a family. He is now of school\nage, and will probably enter school in September. Am not sure of\nexact time, in April, or May last, grant was again requested for\nNo 0228. Having no reply up to present date, this accounts for\nnotation \"Too young\" which follows her name in June Return.\n\nIn June Discharge was filled\nout for a number of pupils not likely to return in the near\nfuture.\n\nPupil No 197, on the March Quarter Return is my mistake. It was\npupil No 198, that was ill. He was also Put out of Treaty, his\ndischarge was sent in June too.\n\nOn May 2nd, R.C.M.P. brought here No 220,\nOwing to former notice regarding absence of pupils for less than\none month, during quarter, accounts for my mistake for 91 days\non June Return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. P.

Both boys gave the staff of the school considerable trouble. The fact that the boys were undermining the discipline of the school was brought to the attention of Mr. Gooderham and myself when we were in Wabasca in October. It has been suggested by Reverend Father Guimont, Principal of the school, that Gabriel and John be taken to the Sturgeon Lake Residential School. Reverend Father Rou\u00e9, Principal, Sturgeon Lake Roman Catholic Residential School, has agreed to accept the boys if authority for their transfer comes from the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nGabriel and John left the Wabasca R.C. School some time before the Christmas. John was allowed to go to his home on November 13th for the weekend. He did not return. Gabriel was expelled from school on November 23rd because of misconduct.\n\nWill you give authority for the transfer of Gabriel Auger and John Yellowknee from the Wabasca School to Sturgeon Lake?

POIRIERE, Principal of the Indian Residential School complained that Joe MICHELLE, who was fifteen years old, had refused to attend school this term. Rev. POIRIERE stated that he approached the father of the boy, Louis MICHELLE, and was informed by the youth's father that he did not wish to have his son attend school this year. The father stated that he was going to have the boy assist him with work that he was going to do, such as cutting cord wood and trapping. Rev. POIRIERE stated that he had watched the boy and found that he was not assisting his father; therefore, he was of the opinion that the youth should be made to attend school this term.\n\nThis same date I contacted Joe MICHELLE and questioned him in this regard. I found that he was not assisting his father as he was supposed to do, and he was more or less wasting his time by loafing around the settlement.

Indian Residential School,\nCalais, Alberta.\n\nRe: Admissions and Discharges\n\nDear Father Rose:\n\nAmong your responsibilities as Principal of an Indian Residential School is that of submitting form I.A. 1069. This form is to be submitted in duplicate monthly to any Indian Superintendent from whose agency children have been sent to your school. If three or four agencies are represented, then you must send this form to the Superintendent concerned, covering of course only the children from his particular superintendency.\n\nFor example, if two children are admitted to your school from the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, then you must send form I.A. 1069 covering the admission of these children to the Superintendent at High Prairie, Alberta.\n\nWe cannot over-emphasize the need for prompt action on your part in sending in this form. Complaints have been received indicating that you are not sending in this information and as a result considerable overpayment of Family Allowances has been made to the Indian parents concerned. This will cause some hardship to them in future months when it may be necessary to suspend payment of Family Allowances in order to recover the sum overpaid.\n\nMuch unnecessary correspondence and considerable ill feeling result from overpayment of Family Allowances. It is, therefore,\nnecessary for me to insist that form I.A. 1069 be forwarded promptly to the Indian Superintendent concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nB. F.
