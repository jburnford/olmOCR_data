Macleod, has\ncome up for trial this week before Col. MacLeod. A great deal of\nevidence was given by the plaintiff\nand the court room was filled\nwith people anxious to hear the result.\nThe case of action arose out of an\narticle published in a previous issue of\nthis journal in which we took issue with\nthe town solicitor on the question as to\nwhether the town council were now\nincorporated or not, maintaining that it\nwas, and that there was no necessity for\nasking the North-West Mounted Police to\npass an ordinance to legalize what was already\nlegal, as the Town Council were led to\nbelieve by the advice of the town solicitor,\non the silly plea that such an ordinance might\nbe necessary. But the counsel below\nassuredly from our calling in question the\nadvice given by the town solicitor, was\nconcerned by the town solicitor in giving\nthe advice he did, the latter claiming\nthat the town solicitor had no authority\nand ad\nadvice had been a libelous injury.\n\nMr. A. Sifton acted for the plaintiff,\nwhile Messrs. Macleod and Knowles\nappeared for us. After the evidence had\nbeen given Mr. Macleod was placed in\nthe witness box, and proceeded, upon\ncross-examination, to deny the charge by\nstating that he had no doubt in his own\nmind as to the legality of the incorpora-\ntion. Counsel for the plaintiff then\nobjected to the evidence being given\nowing to the lapse of time between\nthe receiving of the petition for incor-\nporation and the election, and also\nobjected to the Town Council having\npassed the ordinance to incorporate the\ntown. The town clerk produced the\nordinance and disclaimed all knowl-\nedge of the alleged libel, and admitted\nall the allegations made, and dis-\ncharged the jury.\n\nWe have been put to trouble and\nexpense in doing our duty to the public\nby opposing what we considered was\nunjust legislation, and justified in our\ncourse by the evidence of the plaintiff\nhimself!\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nAND SASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\nPUBLISHED BY\nJ.

I do not, of course, contemplate that any person opposed to the present Government would be permitted to stand, but believe a party has done so much for the district that it deserves a species of folly that I do not think even the Government's greatest enemy would care to engage in. In view of the vast number of electors to political influences in this district some one should be chosen who possesses the confidence and would command the support of the greatest number of electors.\n\nWhile not wishing in any way to influence the selection of Prince Albert, I desire to state that I wish to remind them that amongst those from whom selection will be made there is no lack of distinguished characters. The people of Saskatchewan who one in the past has shown himself an earnest, energetic and faithful advocate of the interests of this district, and one who has spared neither labor nor expense in promoting what he considers to be the welfare of the people in the country where his own name is so largely invested. I refer to Mr. D. H. Macdonald. Before long I may not appear promimently before the people of Prince Albert, nor do I know that he will be able to make his appearance here; but I do know that if his friends or those who are in his confidence can say for him that they have been convinced of his fitness for the position of Prince Albert in the matter, shall we appeal to the politicians of the most capital to nominate a man and throw in our lot with them.\n\nSouth Branch, Nov. 19th.\n\nSETTLER.\n\nTERRITORIAL NEWS.\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nThe Bulletin, Oct. 30, says\u2014\n\nH. S. Young, of the H. B. Co., arrived from Fort Edmonton last week. Roads good, weather fine. Twenty-seven persons had dinner at noon meal at Beaver Lake on Lac la Biche. The lake was skating. Potatoes are very plentiful and crops generally are good, but hay scarce. The question of raising taxes at the spring session. The future looks promising and there are prospects of a fair sale. The Beaver Lake Cemetery was opened this fall. The old map of the 18th, consequently useless, was found, and the future will likely be dark. The Catholic Mission is putting up a new school building on the old saw mill site near the river. They expect to send this fall. P. Prudhomme gives up his mill project and removed nearer the settlement.\n\nCALGARY.\n\nThe Tribune, Nov. 22nd, says\u2014\n\nA young man named Thomas Macdonald employed by H. B. Co., was seen with foreman and general overseer of bridge work at Diamond, was struck by the head by a pinion engine on the road and so severely injured that he died almost immediately.\n\nLord Boyle, who arrived in town last Monday, is much pleased with this region, and would be surprised if anyone could find anything but the best spring. The snow would be close at hand when the H. B. Railways completed their line to incorporate the English market.\n\nNorth West Council.\n\nC. D. NORTHGRAVES,\nWatchmaker and Jeweller,\nAT T. W.

The land lots there were sold at very high figures, and the question of the Government having the right to speculate on large areas of the town site. He contended that it retarded the growth of the town materially.\n\nMr. Jolly also complained of resolution 23 as being unfair from Mr. Second. He had been to Moosejaw. Was it not absurd that a young man ten feet tall of the town should continue to pay taxes for the benefit of the undeveloped lands of the town? Present figures were calling for a higher rate of taxation. He believed these undeveloped lands would remain in the hands of the land companies for years to come.\n\nHis Honor said all last year's resolutions were sent through the Secretary of State. He would suggest that any resolution relating to a particular department should be sent direct to that department.\n\nMr. Harrill asked whether the Council could send the Northwest Land Company to pay taxes.\n\nHis Honor\u2014Don't think so.\n\nMr. Second thought there had been many resolutions which ought to be paid. He referred to the action taken by the Calgary corporation.\n\nMr. Cayley remarked that the Cayley case could hardly be looked upon as a test case. Land companies had legal rights, and did not make any ordinance. The matter was now before the courts.\n\nThe matter was one for the law courts.\n\nMr. Jolly moved that the replies to last Council's resolutions, and the report of the district, be added to the memorial committee. Adopted.\n\nMr. Second introduced an ordinance to incorporate the Regina General Hospital.\n\nThe bill will be sent forward.\n\nThe bill to incorporate agricultural societies was passed with some amendments.\n\nSome discussion took place on subsection 2, section 5, of the Ordinance to amend the School Ordinance of 1886.\n\n\"To arrange, provide for the payment of salaries and expenses of the officers of the school board.\"\n\nMr. Ross objected to the Council having the power of school appropriation on the Board of Education.\n\nHe thought the matter would stand as it was. The Council were responsible to their constituents, and should be elected.\n\nHe thought the Council should have the granting of the school appropriations in their own hands.\n\nJudge Reaume differed with Mr. Ross. School inspectors were officials of the board. If the latter were not paid by the board the board would lose control of them.\n\nMr. Second also differed with Mr. Ross. The board was the proper party to expend the money. He thought the Council was not willing to grant the authority as a member of the board was to be elected by himself.\n\nMr. Ross could not agree with the remarks in the remarks of Judge Reaume.\n\nHis Honor said he had listened with a great deal of attention to the remarks on the house committee, and was in favor of discussion. He understood some members of the council thought the Board of Education should have the power of instructions with regard to the expenditure of school funds.\n\nSo far the board was governed by the ordinance. In part he would say as chairman of the board that he would be glad to have the responsibility of expending the educational appropriations out of the school funds. He was glad to see the care some gentlemen exercised over the Council funds. That was quite right. He thought it was right to see such a watchfulness exercised over every item of the local funds. This control by the board was necessary. Great care exercised in the proper expenditure every dollar was more satisfactory to the county than certainly to himself. (Loud applause.)\n\nMr. Second thought it unfair of Mr. Cayley to spring that upon him. No body knew better than the board and their requirements better than the board, and he still maintained the board had a right to pay its officers.\n\nMr. Second advocated the establishment of Grammar and Normal schools in the territories.\n\nMr. Perley thought Normal schools premature. He thought the establishment of Grammar schools more necessary and suitable for the Territories. A first class Normal school was a great thing, and all the work was high class in the Territories.\n\nMr. Second thought Normal schools desirable to train their teachers. One half the teachers now employed on the Territorial board were uncertificated. A Normal school getting a grant would never take the place of a Normal school.\n\nMr. Perley wanted to get a high school in Regina. He thought the name came to that extent, that spirit, he would let the country know it.\n\nMr. Perley strongly repudiated the views of Mr. Second. He had never advocated a measure in the interests of the town he represented.\n\nMr. Ross agreed with Mr. Perley as to the advantages of grammar schools.\n\nMr. Grover, as inspector, might be a good man, but he was the first man he would choose to be a teacher, excluding the present day Normal school.\n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the more salient features of the ordinance to amend the school ordinance:\n\n1. Sections 5 and 6 of last year's school ordinance repealed.\n\n2. The board of education must meet at least twice a year for the payment of salaries and expenses of the board and to make regulations which may be made fit for the general organization of schools.\n\n3. Teachers' certificates will be of four classes, first, second, third, and provision.\n\n4. Section 23 is repealed, and the following substituted: \"Trustees shall be resident electors.\"\n\n5. Sections 25 and 26 are repealed.\n\n6. The following added to the ordinance: \"The school district may be the secretary of the school district, but not the treasurer.\"\n\n7. By this ordinance the trustees shall be remunerated for their services by a sum not exceeding 2\u00bd per cent on all monies passing through his hands in the district, the proceeds of school districts to be used for school purposes.\n\n8. School houses may be built, paid for by the district, or paid for by the owner of property which may be included in the school district, the annual or semi-annual payments, the whole cost of each building not to exceed $500.\n\n9. Sections 124, 134, 142, 143, 145 and subsections 2, 3, and 4 of 151 are repealed.\n\n\"Because I'm not going there,\" said a friend to whom he was talking. \"I don't want to meet that fellow Vigorous. I own him.\"\n\n\"You met him yesterday and shook hands with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it was different then.\"\n\n\"Because he expected me to pay him for the last lot of clothes I bought from him. He said he had something to tell that fellow I owed having to pay me. But I have been disappointed. You see the Judge has got the same view of the case as I did.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Smith,\" said a young lady at a church fair, \"I want your help for my baby.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Smith, \"what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I have just sold a tidy for $10 that coat was worth $15. Now, tell me what percentage that is.\"\n\n\"A transaction of that kind, my dear Mrs. A.,\" said Mr. Smith, who is a banker, \"is out of the question.\"\n\n\"Auntie to Mayonnaise.\u2014Are you disturbed with coughing and sneezing?
