B. Curry, Esq.,\nIndian School,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have finished the test for the sample of water which you sent in and find a slight trace of sewage contamination in our test of the 5 cc quantity, but the report was negative in all the smaller quantities. It is possible that there may be some slight seepage into your supply. When plated out in beef extract agar it gave a bacterial count of 6,833 bacteria per cc. This is much higher than is allowable in a good drinking water since the standard for a first-class water calls for a count of 100 bacteria or less. There was also amongst these fairly large number of organisms which liquefy gelatine, and it would act on protein matter in the water if such is present, possibly causing a bad odor if the water has been standing for some time. Outside of these points we did not see anything objectionable.\n\nMaybe by looking into and cleaning source of supply you can improve the quality of your water. There is always danger of typhoid contamination wherever we find a positive sewage test, although this danger arises only in the case of human sewage of typhoid origin. Animal sewage will also give positive test but may not in itself be the cause of human disease.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nProfessor of Bacteriology.\n\nThis sample of water was taken out of the taps in the School, being part of the regular supply \u2014 H.B.

Motor Road, from Fred Butcher's gate to Birtle Station is 9 miles. Fred Butcher's place about 3\u00bd miles from Solsgirth.\n\nAfter noting the above you will have a correct idea of the locations.\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 24 Oct., in which you state the water power Dr. Report is before you, re the Edmonson well - one clause of the report \"It does not...\"\nappear to be fed by a flowing spring.\" Then what is a flowing spring? This well was pumped to within 15 inches of the bottom, and it could not be got lower. At this level, it came in as fast as we pumped it out, rate about 800 gallon per hour. If this is not a spring what does the water power do, call it? It certainly flowed boiling out of the ground, and quite visible.\n\nNow as to being \"unfit without treatment,\" what did you find in the sample of water out of this well, sent in by Mr. Pinkin, Sup't of the Brandon Experimental Farm. When Mr. Gow was here testing Mr. Edmonson's well, there was a couple of \"gophers\" drowned in the well because of an opening in the platform and Mr. Edmonson is sure other gophers had met a like fate behind the well casing\u2014and any contamination from them can be easily overcome. When Mr. Gow was here he promised...\nto send a report to Mr. Edmonson, on the sample of water taken away, this promise was kept, and the report said there was 336 Colin Bacilli, per C.C.\n\nYou say the Dept. is hesitant about this water supply - why so? This water is clear as water can be, good to taste, has no bad odor when taken from the well, nor when left standing several days - nor when boiled. For about 15 years the community have used it and with no ill effects. And after all, as we say \"the proof of the pudding is in the eating.\"\n\nThe Dept. need not hesitate using this water that tests 336 per C.C. There seems to have been no hesitation letting the School use the present supply - for many years - that tests 6.833 per C.C. (I will enclose you this report.) And even with this 6.833 per C.C., since coming here in May 1927, I have been able to maintain fair health. The health had been bad previous to my coming here.\n\nMr. Edmonson is not satisfied with Mr. Cow's report and he has sent other samples of water out of this well to two or more places for analysis.\nHe may have the results by now but I have not heard.\n\nSo far as I am concerned, I from the very first, last spring, passed my judgment on the Edmonson place, and I have no reason as yet to change it. I feel my reputation is at stake. Last spring I said the Edmonson place was suitable as a farm and as a school site. I am now in my 20th year in Indian School work, and if after all these years I do not know a suitable place, after a careful examination, well it is time I stepped aside and let a man with better judgment have a try. I do know the work at Alberni was 500 times better when I left than when I took hold of it, and the same change is taking place at Birtle today\u2014Birtle citizens are taking note of the fact. (See Letter from \"Board of trade\" enclosed.)\n\nThe Church authorities have endorsed the Edmonson site. The people of Birtle, in a petition sent you endorsed it. In your last letter 24 Oct., you say \"If you learn of a likely looking...\"\nBirtle, Man.\n\nfarm in the meantime, do not hesitate to report to the Dept.\" I have nothing else to recommend until the Edmonton place is definitely turned down, after that there is 3rd section (marked in green on map enclosed) that might be considered. It is off the main Prov. Motor Road. By touching the corner of this property and a spur for unloading coal might be obtained. Later I may give fuller data.\n\nI have no place yet for my stock and there is about four inches snow. It is cold and blowing hard tonight. I do give them feed but cannot provide protection. The simplest, least expensive protection would be a (board-tar paper roof) and walls of single boards, banked with straw, and should be for at least 10 head of stock\u201430 feet long and 12 wide. Shiplap lumber is $4.20 to $45.00 a 1000. Material will cost not less than $100.00 and labor extra. Yours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\n\nIndian Affairs.

Currie\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNovember 6th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Ferrier has asked me for an opinion on the well which is located on the Edmonson property near Bintle, which property it is proposed to purchase for the new Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is a most difficult matter to give a worth while opinion on a water supply which one has never seen. The following facts must be considered:\n\n1. Whether the supply is now safe.\n2. If not, whether it can be made safe.\n3. If so, whether it is liable to become unsafe through circumstances which may readily arise.\n\nThe water in this well has been subjected to at least three bacteriological tests, two of which show that the samples taken were unsafe for drinking. The third showed that the sample was good. The balance of probability is that in its present condition this well is unsafe.\n\nIt is stated to be located in the bottom of a ravine which is a natural water course and flooded in the spring. The protection of the mouth of this well might be a matter of some difficulty, but it is also stated that the water course can be tapped at a point above high water mark. Unless, as is not probable, the main source of supply which feeds the well is contaminated, I do not see any reason why it cannot be so protected from surface pollution as to make it safe. The fact that one sample was safe would seem to indicate that the main source is not contaminated.\nI should think that a new well should be dug at a higher elevation and surrounded by a fence to enclose an area at least 100 feet square and that the new well should be capped and a pipe brought out of it so that the pumping station could be located outside the fence. It seems probable from the depth of the present well that this could be done so that a shallow well pump could be used. The engineer has examined this well and has sent in samples of water to bacteriologists who have never seen it. A bacteriological report can only refer to the sample which is received at the laboratory. It seems to me that a complete sanitary survey of the neighbourhood is required, particularly as there has been a great difference of opinion. The Provincial Government should have a man, or if not, I am very sure that there is a military sanitary officer at Winnipeg whose judgment on the matter would be reliable.\n\nE.L.

Wilson, Esq.,\nMayor, Town of Birtle,\nBirtle, Man.\nNovember 15, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with further reference to the Edmonton property. I intend to bring this whole question to the attention of the Honourable Mr. Stewart at an early date. In the meantime, you had better prepare a shelter for the stock that cannot be accommodated in the barn. An expenditure of $100 for materials is authorized, and you may engage some expert labour to assist you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirds, Man.\nNovember 14, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE CHARLES STEWART,\n\nI am attaching hereto extracts from the file relating to the Emmington farm as a site for the proposed new Indian Residential School at Birtle. Several other properties have been examined, but none is suitable.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Commissioner Graham is really the only one to condemn the Emmington farm. Reverend Mr. Curry was principal of our school at Albert and is recognized as a good farmer and stock raiser. As he is strongly in favour of this property, I am inclined to give it consideration, particularly as it is the only one in the vicinity of Birtle that is at all suitable.\n\nAs far as the water supply is concerned, the quantity is ample and those best qualified to judge believe that a good quality can be secured and maintained. I should be glad to have your instructions.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nI have an extra set of enclosures in my desk.\nMr. Edmunson has a section of land on the main Provincial Highway, Winnipeg to Edmonton. About half of the section is under cultivation, 87 acres summer fallowed last year. This is a good clean farm, well suited for mixed farming; has a fine stone house with bath; a small house for his farmer; a barn, fair condition. It will not meet our need but certainly has considerable value. There are about ten portable graineries. And this place has the four things I specially had in mind in looking for a good location; plenty of good land for agriculture; a good building site; good drainage; and last and most important an abundant supply of good water. This water supply cannot be valued for our purpose less than $5000. It is of choice quality. This farm is as close to Foxwarren as it is to Birtle. Here we are on the C. P. R. Winnipeg - Edmonton Br. and have two trains daily, each way. Mr. Edmunson is asking $25.00 an acre for this property. To my mind for our purpose this is a snap. This is a farm Mr. Edmunson has made ample to retire on. And would be a revenue producer from the very start. This property is slightly rolling and I have picked out a site that would be a commanding situation for the new school, slightly higher than the highway or any of the surrounding district, and would admirably lend itself to making the school on such a site an imposing structure. Something that would be a real attraction on this much travelled Provincial Highway.\nI went to this place first and I consider it most unsuitable. The farm is badly broken up with coulees and stone ridges, and 50% of the land is covered with bluffs, and above all, the land is, to say the least, dirty. When Mr. Currie stated that this was a clean farm he did not state facts. I doubt very much whether Mr. Edmanson made sufficient on this land to retire on, which he states he did.\n\nTo put buildings costing $80,000.00 on this land is the last thing in the world I would recommend. I do not think you could get any expert to pass this farm as being suitable. It has a good well, it is true, but this is all it has to recommend it.\nThat evening we arranged with the owner of the land to secure an engine and the necessary equipment and on the following morning we tested the well for water supply. It would seem reasonable to expect a permanent supply of water. Regarding the quality, I may say that it has no unpleasant taste and I am by mail this morning forwarding you two one quart sealers. One of the containers was boiled before being used. This is marked on the sealer, in case you wish to have the bacteriological test made. The other was well washed and rinsed with the well water before being filled.\n\nSURFACE: This is a well-drained piece of land with several shallow water courses. There are practically no indications of sloughs although poplar trees and some willow brush are dotted over the farm. The property presents a rather ragged appearance. There is no reason why once a large number of these bluffs are ploughed up that the farm would not have a good appearance. There are about seventy acres of land that is quite stony in places.\n\nSOIL: There appeared to be about 12 inches of solid clay soil. In most places the solid clay soil appeared to be immediately below the black soil and other places we found a whitish gravelly clay between the black soil and the more solid clay below. It is my opinion that the soil would be easy to work and because of being well-drained could be cultivated early in the spring. Excepting on the stony part I believe the soil would be quite productive and would grow good crops of grain, grasses and leguminous crops.\n\nWEEDS: Canada thistle is a predominating weed at the present time. The wild oats were also in evidence and one field appeared to have stink weed. We also found three patches of two or three acres each with couch grass and in one of the fields I noticed a number of patches of couch grass from six to ten feet long and three to four feet wide. There were a few plants of sow thistle. Given careful cultivation and proper crop rotation for a few years I believe that most of the weeds could be brought under control without too great an effort.\n\nBUILDING SIZE: The main objections to my mind to this property are the stoney area in the centre and the fact that there is a road allowance between the two half sections.\n\n* See memo hereunder.\nREPORT OF DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES, INDIAN AFFAIRS, FOLLOWING BACTERIOLOGICAL REPORT ON SAMPLES SUBMITTED BY MR. TINLIN.\n\nThe water submitted for examination from the Birtle School site was in two jars, one of which was stated to be sterilized and the other rinsed with the water itself. The sterilized jar shows contamination in a moderate degree and the unsterilized one in a marked degree. Neither of these samples of water would be suitable for drinking purposes without treatment.\n\nA test of this sort is of very little value by itself. If the well is open it is subject to contamination which would not occur if it were closed and protected. If the surroundings were bad the water would be polluted, but might be rendered safe by cleaning up the ground near the well, removing possible manure piles, etc. There is no information on these points, and it is therefore impossible to say whether the well, as distinct from the samples, is a safe well or not.\n\nThe test for hardness indicates that the water is soft and should be suitable for boiler use as water goes in the west.\nA rather deep coulee runs through the farm and along the bottom of this coulee I noticed two or three wells that were apparently abandoned and not in use. The well that is now the source of water supply for the farm is located in the bottom of the coulee and is in the path of a natural water course during the spring break-up. The well was found to be 6' diameter and 15' deep and contained 4 feet of water.\n\nAn examination of the well showed that about 10 feet of clay overlaid the gravel and the well penetrated the gravel only two feet. The gravel appeared to continue two feet below the bottom of the well. The gravel was very fine. This well has been in existence many years and has never shown any signs of failure.\n\nThe pumping test carried out on this well was a rather severe one, some 15,650 gallons being pumped in two days, or sufficient to supply for one week the anticipated requirements of the proposed Indian School. This well is a shallow surface one located in a coulee and contrary to expectations appears to be fed from an ample reservoir. The water is pleasant to the taste and is comparatively soft. From the results of the pumping test I am of the opinion that this well will provide ample water supply for the proposed Indian School. If utilised for this purpose, however, it will be necessary to tap the reservoir 25 to 30 feet away so as to get away from the bottom of the coulee.\n\nA sample of the water was taken from this well at noon on October 3rd after some 11,000 gallons had been pumped out, special care being taken in the handling of the sample. Within twenty-four hours it was in the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba for analysis. Their report shows that Colon Basilli was present; the bacterial plate count per c.c. being 356. They report that the water is unsafe for drinking and unfit without treatment for the requirements of the proposed Indian School.\nThis water is clear as water can be, good to taste, has no bad odor when taken from the well, nor when left standing several days - nor when boiled. For about 15 years the community have used it and with no ill effects.\n\nMr. Edmonson is not satisfied with Mr. Cow's report and he has sent other samples of water out of this well to two or more places for analysis.\n\nThis evening about 6 P.M. Mr. Edmonson called and gave me the attached report of a sample of water from his well. This sample was sent to the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nThe report speaks for itself. Mr. Edmonson has another report at home, that was secured from another reliable college, that he has promised to let me have. This report is also favorable as to the quality of this water.\n\nIf there was any doubt in my mind on this Edmonson site, I would never say a word. But it is such an ideal site \"Building Site\" \"Drainage\" \"Water Location\" and a very fair farm, with good soil. The two faults with the farm are in places there are some stones, and it has some ravines, not deep, but enough to make it \"rolling\". The ravines also serve good purposes and have advantages as well as disadvantages.\n\nI will show you that it can be developed into a profitable beauty spot. The building site is outstanding and lends itself to making a school on such a site a prominent landmark on this much travelled Provincial Highway, and present indications are that the coming summer may see the Prov. Hydro pass this property. It is sure to come before long - if not next year.\nNovember 6th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nDr. Scott:\n\nMr. Ferrier has asked me for an opinion on the well which is located on the Edmonson property near Birtle, which property it is proposed to purchase for the new Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is a most difficult matter to give a worthwhile opinion on a water supply which one has never seen.

Stone, M.B.,\nDirector of Medical Services\nNovember 29, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe present property of the Birtle Indian Residential School consists of 50 acres, on which the buildings are situated, and a quarter section farm, nearly 3 miles to the north east. The 50 acres itself is very hilly and stoney and is only partly suitable for garden purposes and pasture. The land to the east, south and west of the school property is all hilly and is cut up by the Birdtail creek. The town of Birtle is situated immediately to the south. To the north of the school, there is the C. P. R. Winnipeg-Edmonton line, and it may be possible to find suitable farm land nearer than the quarter section at present owned.\n\nThe nature of the water supply for the school has not been reported recently; but I understand that, for cooking and drinking, they secure water from a deep well, 800 yards from the school, on neighbouring property. This water is quite hard. They store rain water from the roof, in a large cement cistern and use this for the laundry. All water used for sewage disposal, fire protection, cleaning, etc., is secured from the C. P. R. pumping plant, at a pressure of 40 lbs.\n\nRussell J.

Currie\nDecember 9, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the temporary arrangements you have made for the live stock at the Birtle Indian Residential School. I have had discussion with the Honourable Mr. Stewart, concerning a new property, and the question of the present site was breached. I do not know what you would think of this suggestion, but I should be glad to have your remarks without delay.\n\nAs I review the earlier correspondence regarding the Edmunson water supply, I note that I have never expressed the doubt in the mind of our Architect, concerning the amount of water available there. To be safe, the institution that we contemplate establishing would need 5,000 gallons per day. I know that the Edmunson well has produced more than this on two successive days, but the Department is not sure that it will supply this amount regularly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th Inst., re site for our new school, and you suggest using our present site, and ask what my opinion in the matter is. In many respects the present site is good. It is near to town, High School, Station and has a good view, and natural drainage. In fact there are just two things lacking in the present site\u2014two things lacking in the present site\u2014one is playground accommodation, and farm land near to the school. Both of these can largely be overcome. If $2,000 to $3,000 were spent leveling and grading the grounds of the present site, the playground accommodation would be solved, and farm land is available, not very far from where we are.\n\nAt present our water supply is abundant\u2014but the quality is anything but good. Our water is pumped direct from...\nthe Birdtail River. The water itself is good enough\u2014were it not contaminated by sewage. But were a filter plant installed the water would be good and an abundant supply\u2014I think were a well dug back from the river 200 feet, and allow the water to filter into the well from the river it would be \"good.\" In this case the well would have to be deep enough to be considerable under the river bed level. From this well it would have to be pumped to the school, which would be an easy matter.\n\nWe have now been since last March selecting a site, and have got down to the Edmondson Property. \"The Butcher Place\" and the present site. I am afraid to consider other sites\u2014lest another year is lost before a selection is made. As it stands my first choice is the Edmondson Place; the second choice the present site and third choice the Butcher place.\nWhat I want now is action, you know my wishes\u2014let make your selection\u2014and secure the site. Let the contract, and the Contractor can assemble a lot of the necessary material now, and be in readiness to start the building as soon as the spring opens up, say early in April and have it ready for use by the time of opening of the Fall term. Positively I will not attempt to carry on another winter in this building. It is nothing short of criminal. The following pupils have had Pneumonia already this winter\u2014Elizabeth Tanner, Ruth Runner, James Cate, Alfred Bone, Gordon Bone, Cecil Rattlesnake, and Mrs Johnson (staff). I attribute the cause to the heating plant, which is done, and danger to the pupils, and it requires constant care, but with ours, and it requires constant care, but with the best of care a steady heat cannot be maintained. The best of care a steady heat cannot be maintained. One with the furnaces going full capacity\u2014one part of the building will be hot and another part of the building cold, and in a few hours the conditions will be just the opposite, the hot rooms will become cold\u2014and the ones that were cold will become hot. Besides there is a waste of fuel\u2014we are burning away over a ton of coal a\nBirtle, Man. 192\n\nI am on the 4th car of coal this winter, over 30 tons to the car. It seems altogether too bad to be thus situated when we could as easily as not have been enjoying the comforts of our new school now.\n\nYou speak in this your last letter that 5,000 gallons per day of water should be available, to be safe, and that the department is not sure that it will supply the Edmonson well will do this regularly\u2014I am sure, that the water in this well is unlimited. This well has given good service 15 years. It has supplied water for 150 head of stock for Mr. Edmonson, met the neighbors' needs and the supply was never questioned. This is the driest year the oldest inhabitants of the district remembers. More of the sloughs and wells in this part dry this year than ever before, and this well was tested at the driest time this fall after meeting the community needs for months. After pumping close to 1,000 gallon per hour\u2014for two days steadily\u2014the next morning the water was back to starting point. If this can be accomplished in the driest year\u2014we need not worry that it will ever fail\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\ndeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have a letter from Mrs. McKerrow\nof the W.M.S., Toronto. She says she was talking\nto you over our school site, and she mentions\nthat the geological expert informed your\ndepartment \"that the water supply would likely\nnot be continually sufficient for such a large\nschool, on the Edmondson place,\" and that it\nwas the intention to make a further test by\nboring a new well a number of feet from the\npresent well, as soon as the cold weather will\nallow it.\"\n\nI do not see any reason why such\nboring might not be done at once, if it is considered\nnecessary - it is a better time to do it now than\nin the spring.

First I satisfied myself that this well was fed by a spring\u2014of never failing supply\u2014Then Mr. Tinlin, Capt. of the Brandon Experimental Farm tested it, and said it appeared to be ample. Later Mr. Gurney of the Water Power Co. tested it and when he was finished said \"I do not believe we can pump it dry.\"\n\nNow I would like further tests made at once. Before any thaw sets in, either boring a new well near the present one, or what would probably be cheaper and even more satisfactory\u2014pump the present well\u201424 hours daily for two weeks\u2014or longer if you think wise\u2014Three men\u20148 hr shifts\u2014would keep the pump in\nConstant operation - any ordinary man that can run a gas engine is all that is required - and every farmer can do that; 3 men for 15 days at $50.00 a month $75.00 Gasoline and Oil about $25.00\n\nOr for the whole month the cost would be only about $200.00 and surely then if the well stood up under such demonstration at such a time, that every doubt as to the quantity should be removed. This would be far cheaper than boring a new well, as it is not much drilling you will get done for $200.00. And such a test now would let us get a head and close the deal and let the contract so work can be started as soon as weather conditions were suitable.\n\nI have used 65 ton of high grade coal since 11 Dec and am unloading another car today.

C. Edmondson, in the past number of years. The two statements are quite favorable, and indicate Mr. Edmondson's place is quite suitable for the production of seed grain of good quality.\n\nFrom my own close observation, at all stages of growth, during the past summer, Mr. Edmondson's crops presented an excellent outlook considering the dry season, and I understand his crop threshed out well.\n\nI have given much consideration again, to the water situation on this place. I cannot bring myself to believe a better well will be found in this district than Mr.\nEdmondson now has. It is only about twelve or fourteen feet deep. But when Mr. Edmondson was digging this well he tried to make it deeper but could not as the water came in so fast. The bottom of this well is a fine porous gravel. Gravel about the size of a large seed of barley. You can push a pole down into this fine gravel many feet. My idea would be to dig a new well say 20 feet square, sink it, if possible, 16 feet deep or more, and put a cement wall about this and a building above to hold your pumping plant. I do not think it is a situation where drilling can be used to advantage.\n\nI think I am as careful to secure a good water supply as anyone need be.

B. Gow, Assistant District Chief Engineer of this office, on the water supply on properties in this area. Mr. Gow submitted reports on October 8th dealing with wells tested on the Edmunston property, the north half of Section 25 and the south half of Section 26, -7-27-W., and of the Butcher property in the S.W.\u00bc -7-17-25-W.\n\nIn reviewing these reports I note that the well on the Edmunston property is a very shallow well and while it stood up fairly well under the tests to which it was subjected yet the bacterial report showed the water contaminated and unfit for personal consumption without treatment. This being a shallow well it always would be subject to contamination from surface drainage and would require continuous treatment to make it safe for use in a residential school. The well on the Butcher property is on the other hand a deep well and the bacterial tests show that the water is pure and satisfactory for school use, but the tests carried out by Mr. Gow as to quantity were not sufficient to place any assurance that there is sufficient water available to meet residential school requirements.\n\nIn reviewing the situation and discussing it with Mr. Gow we are of the opinion that before any decision is reached as to the selection of a property for school purposes in this vicinity that further thorough investigations should be made with the object of securing a water supply sufficient in quantity and quality for the school requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

The town of Birtle is situated in the Birdtail valley, which valley at this point is approximately 200 feet deep and one mile wide. The Canadian Pacific Railway does not pass through the town but crosses the Birdtail valley three miles west of Birtle, and Birtle Station is located on top of the plateau about 2,500 feet north of the centre of the town. The present school is located on the north slope of the valley, about 2,500 feet from the centre of the town and about midway between the Creek and Birtle Station.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nWater Supply for Present School.\n\nThe Indian School at Birdle obtains its water supply from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway has a water tank adjacent to their station for supplying their engines, and obtain their water supply from Birdtail Creek. Their pumping plant is located on the creek bank almost directly south of the station and about 3,000 feet distant. The pumping plant consists of a Triplex pump, manufactured by Goulds, with 7 inch plunger and 8 inch stroke and belt connected to a 25 h.p. Semi-Diesel oil engine. The intake consists of a reservoir 8' x 8' x 12', located just above high water mark, but directly connected to the river by a ten-inch pipe line. The water is pumped to the water tank through a six-inch cast iron pipe line. The normal daily requirements of the railway vary from 20,000 to 100,000 gallons, depending upon traffic conditions.\n\nThis pipe line passes within 300 feet of the school and is tapped at this point by a pipe line leading to a tank in the upper story of the building. The school has always had an ample supply of water. The water is not filtered or treated in any way.\n\nVery low run-off conditions prevailed during the summer and autumn of 1929 throughout the area drained by Birdtail Creek and similar conditions have prevailed during the present winter, resulting in very little flow in the creek. However, the creek is fed by numerous small springs along the valley and has never been known to go completely dry. To date there has always been ample water to supply the demand.\n\nWater Supply for New School.\n\nThe only source of water supply for a new school located on the old site is from Birdtail Creek, or from springs in the valley adjacent to the stream. Whether springs can be located to supply sufficient water for the new school can only be ascertained by borings, not feasible at the present time.\n\nTwo schemes for obtaining water supply to the new school are open for consideration:\n\n(1) The Department can construct their own intake, install their own pumping equipment, and lay a pipe line direct to an elevated water tank in the vicinity of the school.\n\n(2) The Department can make arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to derive their water supply from the Company's pipe line as is now being done. This involves laying a new pipe line from the point where the C. P. R. water line would be tapped to an elevated water tank near the school.\nWith either scheme it will probably be advisable to erect a 10,000 gallon wood stave tank with tower and employ a gravity system through the school and other buildings. This tank will necessarily have to contain a filter bed and a chlorinating plant will be necessary for the school water supply system. In this report I will not attempt to give any detailed or accurate estimate of the cost of water supply to the school, such not being possible until the actual location is chosen. However, a very rough estimate has been made of the necessary outlay for each scheme in order to make comparisons.\n\n**Scheme No. 1.**\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Construction of Intake                    | $300.00  |\n| Pump house, building, drains, etc.        | $1,200.00|\n| Pumping Equipment, oil engine, etc.       | $1,800.00|\n| Pipe Line - Pipe - Excaviation, laying and backfilling | $3,000.00|\n| Tank - Tower, all enclosed & Filter bed   | $6,000.00|\n| Chlorinating Plant                        | $1,800.00|\n| **Total**                                 | **$14,100.00** |\n\n**Scheme No. 2.**\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Pipe Line - C.P.R. Line to School         | $625.00  |\n| Tank - Tower, all enclosed & Filter bed   | $6,000.00|\n| Chlorinating Plant                        | $1,800.00|\n| **Total**                                 | **$8,425.00** |\n\nIt will be seen that Scheme No. 2 permits a saving of approximately $6,000.00 in capital outlay. Furthermore the writer is of the opinion that favorable arrangements can be made with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company whereby their annual charge for supplying an ample supply of water for the school would be less than the annual cost of operating a separate pumping station as outlined in Scheme No. 1.\n\n**Sewage System.**\n\nAt the present school the sewage passes into a septic tank and the outflow is allowed to spread over the slope below. The present site and the site in the vicinity of the present one affords splendid drainage facilities and a satisfactory sewerage disposal system can be secured. The soil is a hard clay overlying a scapstone formation. It will be advisable to pass the outflow from the septic tank through a disposal bed, otherwise contamination of the water supply might result.\nConclusions.\n\nFor a new school erected on or in the vicinity of the site of the old school, the natural source of water supply is Birdtail Creek. This stream will doubtless always provide an ample water supply. However, I would like to point out that Birdtail Creek is ordinarily a small stream flowing in a deep wide valley at this point and subject to wide variation in flow, but usually high water only prevails at the time of the spring freshets. The valley is extensively utilized for grazing purposes and during heavy rains drainage into the stream from the slopes of the valley is rapid. Under such conditions the water is unfit and unsafe for domestic use and cannot of course be made fit and safe by filtration and chlorination. The degree of chlorination necessary to ensure a safe water supply may be such as to result in an unsatisfactory supply for domestic purposes.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nFebruary 21st, 1936.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of January 30th regarding the selection of a suitable site for the proposed new Indian residential school near Birtle, Manitoba, I enclose herewith a report, received from our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, on the water supply available on the site of the old Birtle school.\n\nIn this report you will notice there are two alternative schemes outlined, one of which proposes the construction of a separate intake on the Birdtail river and the other proposes to take water from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's pipe line as was done in connection with the old school. The report also refers to facilities for sewage disposal at this site.\n\nI shall be glad to have your further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

In the meantime owing to the evident contamination of the water which is being used in the school I would ask you to kindly instruct your District Chief Engineer to arrange immediately for the installation at the existing school of a chlorinating plant. This chlorinating plant should be selected and installed so that it can be transferred to the new school when same is erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst.

I know that you are disappointed we are not acquiring the Edmonson farm, but the engineers and our own officers were not satisfied with the water supply. Your letter of December 17th last, concerning the present site, has helped me to decide in its favour. In due course, I am sure we can overcome the disadvantages, and it certainly has many advantages.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nMarch 27, 1930.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI write to inform you that all efforts to secure a suitable water supply on the Edmunsen and other farms have failed. I feel we could not do better than re-establish the Birtle Indian Residential School on its present site. The Rev. Mr. Currie is being so informed. I am sure he will be satisfied with this decision, as he states in a recent letter that the present property is his second choice. He believes that suitable playgrounds can be provided and that good farm land can be secured in the immediate vicinity.\n\nWill you please ask your Board to consider transferring the property to the Department? With title in the Crown, there would be no objection to spending public money on new buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerroll,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lawn St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nYour communication in regard to Birtle Indian School came before our Board, and we were very pleased indeed to hear of the possibility of getting on with the school very soon.\n\nWe still feel that if a site where farming operations, on a larger scale, could be carried on, it would be very much better, and we feel that if an adequate supply of water could be obtained, the Edmison farm would be by far the best place available. However, if this seems impossible, our Society is quite willing to make arrangements to turn over to the Government at any time, our land where the present school is built, reminding the Department, however, that the only farming land we have is about three miles distant, which makes it difficult to transfer the boys backwards and forwards for the work. May I ask you what the procedure is in regard to turning this over to your Department, is there a consideration allowed for the land, do we make out a deed to your Department, putting in the name of the Commissioner, or the Deputy, or in what way is the transfer made? Our Board will be very glad indeed to make whatever arrangements seem best.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary C. M. Kerroll\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nApril 11, 1930.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerrell:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the site of the Birtle Indian Residential School. The new buildings will require a large expenditure of public funds, and, as the property will be used for Indian educational purposes under Presbyterian Church management, I feel that the land which is at the School should be transferred to the Department for a nominal consideration, say $1.00. I intend to arrange for the purchase of at least 160 acres of farm land right at the School. My suggestion concerning the quarter section which your Society owns is that it be sold or traded and that you add to whatever farm we are able to secure.\n\nThe Department will be glad to arrange for the transfer of the 30 acres on which the School is situated. Please let me have the name of the lawyer who will represent your Society and arrange to place in his hands the certificate of title.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerrell,\nWomen's Miss. Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lawn St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nIn last week's issue of the Birtle newspaper, I noted a paragraph which stated that it had now been definitely decided to erect the proposed new Indian Residential School at Birtle, on the old site.\n\nMr E.J.Wilson, who is the editor of the paper, also Mayor of the Town of Birtle, spoke to me on the street about the matter, calling my attention to the article in the paper. Mr Wilson informed me that he had received the information from Mr J.A.Glen, M.P., who had received it from yourself.\n\nA day or so later, Mr Currie, the Principal of the Indian School, requested me to go to the school and see a site which he had picked out for the new buildings, on the present property. I spent most of the afternoon with him, and we both concluded that it would be almost impossible to make an attractive place there, as well as being difficult to develop a farm on the three quarter sections that the Mayor proposed should be bought for the school. These three quarter sections are immediately east of the school property, and stretch from the Bird Tail Creek for one and a half miles north, and a half mile east, the quarter nearest the creek being useless for any purpose but pasture, as it is a bed of rocks.\n\nI later met Mr Wilson again, and asked him what he thought of Mr Ewbank's farm, as a site for the new school, in view of assuming that the water - would -\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nThe report was held on old site\nwith some adverse criticism.

He agreed at once, that Ewbank's farm would be an infinitely better site in every way. It would be practically the same distance to pump the water, as if the school were to be located in the best situation on the present property. Mr Wilson also stated that the Town would contribute considerably in the matter of getting the water to the school, if it were to be built on Ewbank's farm, though in what way I do not know, as I did not discuss this with him, as he stated that he would write to you himself. Electric light and power could also be procured from the Birtle town plant.\n\nMr Currie, the Principal of the school, informed me that he had received a telegram from the Presbyterian Church officials at Toronto, asking him if he could recommend the present site, for the erection of the new school, and that he had replied in a decided negative.\n\nMr Ewbank's farm is just at the top of the hill on the opposite side of the valley from the present school, and consists of a half section of first class land that has been well farmed for years. The eastern boundary of this farm is the gravelled road running north and south between Birtle and Minota, and the new Provincial highway passes the north east corner of the farm. If considered necessary, the farm across the road from Mr Ewbank's, and being a half section belonging to Mr H.Uzell, could also be purchased, making a full section of land for the school farm.\n\nIf the new school were to be built on the Ewbank farm, it would still be in Birtle, which, apparently is what the people wish; the water proposition would be no more difficult, and drainage would present no difficulties; and taking the future into consideration, as well as the farming aspect, the school would be in an infinitely better situation.\n\nI trust that I may not be considered too presuming, in forwarding to you the above unsolicited suggestions regarding a site for the new school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.G.

MacDonnell, 159 Bay Street, Toronto, and proceed to make whatever arrangements are necessary. It may take a few days to get our five trustees to sign, but there is absolutely no doubt of the transfer being completed, as it has been ordered by the Board.\n\nI hope that this will be of help in getting an early start at the new building.

Your proposal to utilize the present location and add to it by purchasing properties to the north and east, is approved. I am sending Mr. Lazenby a copy of this letter with the request that he cooperate with you and secure the best possible terms for the quarter section to the east, which is owned by the town of Birtle. Similarly, the property to the north that is desired should be made the subject of an option.\n\nYou should also learn what arrangements are necessary to secure the town lots to the north of the School. Further, Mr. Lazenby and yourself should secure a written offer from Mrs. Wm. Patterson for the 120 or 130 acres owned by her. As all her holding can be secured for $600, there is no merit in limiting our purchase to that parcel south of the railroad tracks. A little later, we will consider the half section owned by Mrs. J. Patterson. Would she take the school quarter section which is to the north east in part payment for her farm?\n\nI am pleased to state that the Department hopes to provide a better building than was first intended.

They have plans, blue prints, and estimates for this purpose, but these were drawn up 25 years ago, and have never been utilized.\n\nWithout this portion of the quarter, however, Mr Currie did not want any of it at all, as there would be nothing of any use on the portion north of the river, the best pasture being on the south, which also has on it about 300 cords of good poplar wood.\n\nThe Council then suggested selling the north portion -\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nportion at a price of $800.00, and leasing the south portion to the Department for a ten year period, at $25.00 per year. This, I did not approve of, deeming it best that the Department should own the property outright, by purchase.\n\nI therefore proposed that the Council grant an option to the Department, on the whole quarter section until the 31st July next, at a price of $500.00 for the portion north of the river, and $500.00 for the portion south of the river, making a total price of $1,000.00 for the quarter section, inserting a clause giving the Town the privilege of purchasing back the portion south of the river at $500.00 at such time as they may require it for a public enterprise, which, after considerable discussion, was finally agreed to.\n\nThe plans the Council has, for the making of a summer resort on the south portion of the quarter section, have now been shelved for the past 25 years, and, I believe they will not now be used at all. It is extremely doubtful that the Town will ever exercise the privilege contained in the above mentioned clause.\n\nMr Currie obtained an option until the 31st July next, from Mrs Wm (Katherine) Patterson, on the S.E.\u00bd of Sec; 7 Twp; 17 R:26 W.P.M. excepting certain parts of this quarter belonging to the C.P.R., Imperial Oil L'td, and others.\n\nI am forwarding herewith, copies of the two options aforementioned, and retaining the originals on file at this office.

The total to be purchased would therefore be approximately 625 acres, which is not too much, considering the nature of the land. The total cost would be $8,300, which is less than $13 an acre. It appears that the southwest quarter of Section 16, which is over two miles from the school and which is owned at present by the institution, cannot be used in a trade for any of the parcels we require.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school itself is located within the limits of the Town of Birtle and there is also a quarter section of land located in the Rural Municipality of Birtle, used for farm purposes.\n\nThe letter of instructions was not quite clear as to whether or not all the properties should be transferred to His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada. For your information we are reporting in separate letters on the respective properties and in this letter will deal particularly with the south west quarter of section 16 in township 17 and range 26.\n\nThis quarter section, located in the Rural Municipality of Birtle, stands in the name of the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The title is under the Torrens System and is clear of encumbrances, and there are no taxes outstanding against the land. We are sending you in this matter the original certificate of search which we have obtained from the Land Titles Office, also Tax Certificate showing the property clear of taxes to the end of 1929. The title is perfectly satisfactory, in fact it is the best obtainable, and a transfer from the Board of Trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada would give a perfectly satisfactory title.

The Department does not intend to acquire the S. W. \u00bc of Sec. 16, T. 17, R. 26, reference to which is made in the enclosed copy of a letter from your Agent of the 17th instant. The parcel to be acquired is approximately 25 acres and is situate in the N. E. \u00bc of Sec. 6 - within the limits of the town of Birtle.

Options have been taken on these, and I should be grateful if you would have your agent search title and, if found satisfactory, prepare conveyances. The parcels in question are:-\n\n1. Fractional S.

(The vendors have insisted that a clause be inserted in the instrument of conveyance in this connection, giving them the right to purchase that portion of the quarter section which is south of the creek, in the event that it is needed for municipal purposes, such as a park, etc. Mr. Indian Agent Lazenby reports that he believes the town of Birtle will likely never exercise this right.)\n\nMrs. D.T.L.

June 2 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI should like to offer to your Department, for consideration, my farm. It is the west half of 417, 26, W. This will be just one mile from the proposed new site of the Indian School. There is 105 acres of cultivated land, its now mostly into crop & the balance will be summer fallow. This farm is fenced on 3 sides, there is excellent pasture with the creek running through. There is about 160 acres of brush, that hasn't been cut. This timber carefully handled will sell for more than any of the land around here. There is a good & roomed house on the place, comfortable stables, but not elaborate. There is a road allowance direct from the Indian School site to the corner of my farm, so there is no trouble for the school getting all the timber they want there for fuel for a great number of years.\n\nMr. Currie of the Indian School has been over this place & knows all about it. The price I am holding this at is $25.00 per acre.\n\nVery Poor Copy\nHoping you will give this a favorable consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nF. A. Wilcocks\nJune 10, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Wilcocks:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, concerning your willingness to sell your farm for the use of the Birtle Indian Residential School.

I have heard rumours that the new building is to be erected near the present site but I cannot believe the Department would do this. The land there is absolutely unsuitable for teaching farming and to have a farm at some distance from the building would not be practicable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nInspector Graham of Regina is bringing considerable pressure to bear on our Manitoba women in regard to the Birtle site. He has not written me direct, but has sent very urgent messages to Mrs. Robson of Winnipeg. He thinks that the whole question of the Birtle site should be reopened and is not at all satisfied with the water, the farm or the situation. I am bringing this to your attention as it appears to be causing some unrest in Manitoba. I have not brought the matter to the attention of my own Board, for two reasons, one that it is not meeting during the summer months, the other that we consider it a closed question with the Government, and are quite willing to abide by the decision arrived at after so much difficulty and worry. I hope that it will not cause any additional anxiety, but I am bringing this to your attention. I know that Mr. Graham does not appear to be satisfied with having any site near the town of Birtle, for what reason I am at a loss to judge.\n\nI am glad to hear that tenders are being asked for and that things are moving on. What can we do to facilitate matters? May I see a copy of the plans? I think you showed me one when I was in Ottawa, but things were so nebulous that I did not pay to it the attention I should have.\n\nMay I thank you for all your trouble.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nJuly 8, 1930.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerrell:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the Birtle site and the developments concerning the new building.

You also state that in addition to the 30 acres already used by the School, the Department is hoping to secure the N.W.\u00bc of Section 5, the W. \u00bd of Section 8 and the Fractional S.E.\u00bc of Section 7\u2014all in Township 17, Range 26, W.P.\n\nI am rather surprised at the Department buying this land. You were on this farm with land it is utterly unfit for school purposes. If the new school is to be erected on the hillside there will be no playground, in fact I am told that there is a drop of 85 ft. behind the site.\n\nI do not know on whose advice the Department is acting, but if it is that of the late Principal I think the question should receive further consideration. It is anything but an ideal site for a school, and there is no water. I know that water can be pumped from the Birdtail Creek, but this will be an expensive operation, and I doubt if it is fit for domestic use.\n\nThis letter may be considered private information if you so desire, but I think it is my duty to bring these matters to your attention.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nActing on the instructions contained in yours of the 8th inst., I immediately got in touch with Claydon Ltd., and Mr. Gow by wire and succeeded in having Mr. Mitchell of Claydon Ltd., and Mr. Gow meet me at Birtle yesterday.\n\nWe thoroughly examined the property owned by the Dept. of Indian Affairs and selected a site for the new school considerably north of the present school, and at a much higher level; in fact the site is on almost the highest portion of the property. It is the only one that would in any way allow of adequate playground facilities. The whole property is really the side of a hill sloping from north at the C.P.R. right-of-way, to Birtle Creek at the south.\n\nMr. Gow had in mind a site on a lower level, about halfway between the selected site and the old school, with a view to obtaining the water supply by gravity from the C.P.R. tank; but upon investigation we found this far too crowded to allow of playgrounds around the school. I believe it is now Mr. Gow's intention to pipe, by gravity, from the C.P.R. tank to the school into a filter tank and then use the usual pressure tanks to distribute to the fixtures.\n\nThe selected site is dependent upon the closing of two or three unused streets; but this matter was thoroughly gone into with Mr. Lazenby, the Agent, and the town solicitor, who assured us that this was only a matter of form in the final passing of the necessary bye-law as it had already been passed by the town council.\n\nThe school will now face South and the barns and stables will all be to the East so that it becomes necessary to throw the plan completely over. I have instructed the Contractors to do this, and stated that I would ask you\n\n1.\nask you for two sets of the plans printed from the reverse side of the tracings, as this will help quite a little even though the lettering will be reading backwards. Could you forward these to them at an early date?\n\nThe matter of the septic tank was gone into and this will be located to the south east of the building. Mr. Gow will of course be going into details of both this and the water supply at greater length.\n\nI have arranged with Mr. Mitchell the foreman to let me know as soon as he has the excavation cut when I will run down for another inspection, and so on about once a week until I receive further instructions from you.\n\nThe site to be excavated is covered with a thick growth of small poplar trees, and in view of the fact that the contractor had his men and equipment there ready to start I instructed him to clear this; and as the specifications state that the site will be cleared by the Dept., there will be a small extra on this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of July 8th, I met Mr. Swan at Birtle on the 16th, and a site for the new Indian School was chosen. Mr. Swan said he would be writing you fully with respect to the selection of the site and some matters pertaining to the closing of streets and opening up a new road by arrangement with the Town of Birtle.\n\nAs you will have noticed from the contoured plan forwarded you some time ago, the area in which the new school was to be located is very broken with a steep descent to the creek. The only level areas sufficiently spacious for a school site appear to be the present school site or on the level plateau within about 500 feet of the Canadian Pacific Railway Right-of-Way. The latter area was selected as the most advantageous site for the school.\n\nHowever, the selection of this particular site will add somewhat to the cost of the water installation and will also increase the operating costs after the system is put into use. The selection of the site on the plateau near the top of the valley renders it undesirable to depend upon a gravity system entirely, as the storage tank would have to be erected too high. It is now recommended that an elevated tank be constructed about 20 to 25 feet above the ground elevation, so that water service in the basement of the building be supplied by gravity. A pressure tank system will be installed in the building to supply the three upper floors. This system will be operated practically the same as the new Indian School at Brandon. It is also suggested that arrangements be made for the Canadian Pacific Railway to do the pumping to the tank.\n\nThe site selected offers no difficulty in the matter of drainage or sewerage disposal. I am arranging to have plans and drawings prepared for water supply and sewerage disposal systems, together with estimates of costs. This will involve seeing what arrangements can be made with Canadian Pacific Railway officials in Winnipeg, re the cost of pumping of water.\n\nIf it is your wish that this office proceed with the preparation of drawings, and of the proposed layouts and estimates, I will be pleased to submit the same at an early date. I would, in any case,\nstrongly recommend that the water supply system and sewage disposal systems be proceeded with at any early date as possible, as being mostly outside work it can be most economically performed during the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

He pointed out to me that tests of various wells and water supplies around the district had proved inadequate to supply the amount of water required by the school.\n\nHad I been confronted with the water supply problem, unaided by Mr. Gow's expert knowledge, when selecting a site I would have been inclined to ask that I be allowed to examine other property; even if it were some miles away and the present property had to be abandoned.\n\nI trust that I read your instructions correctly when I assumed that you wanted me to help select the best site on the property of the Department, and not to look around the country for a site on other property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nJuly 29th, 1930.\n\nThe Department of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nBIRTLE AND FRACTIONAL S.E. &\n7-17-26 W. - YOUR REF. B.5737\n\nThere has been some difficulty in obtaining the necessary information regarding the title to the fractional S.E. 7-17-26 West, which is being purchased from Mrs. William Patterson, the consideration being $800. The title to this property is under the Old System and is not at all satisfactory. There are several exceptions out of the quarter section and the boundaries of the various portions excepted are not clearly defined. My Agent reports on the land as follows:\n\n\"I have also checked down all the lots and blocks under Plan \"S\". My conclusion is that with the exception of 3 lots to be particularized later and the right of way and station grounds and of course streets and lanes so far as they are dedicated by the registration of the plan, the land is in the name of Katherine Patterson, about half of it in her personal ownership and the other half in her as administrator of Wm. Patterson. Just the division of this will be shown later.\n\nFollowing is report of the instruments:\n\n3132 - Mortgage S.F.I John Patterson of the City of Brandon, Farmer, to The Western Canada Loan & Savings Co., securing $400, on the E.W. 7-17-26 W. I. On the Company's usual form and all past due. Execution is o.k.\n\n3650 - Agreement for Sale from said Patterson to the Man. & N. W. Railway Co. of Canada agreeing to sell all right, title and interest in and to all lands required by said Company for right of way and also for station grounds or for any other purposes of a like nature and upon S.E. 7-17-26 W. I for $1. This agreement is dated 14th October, 1885. Execution is o.k.\n3922 - Agreement for Sale from said John Patterson to the Man. & N.W. Railway Co. of Canada for the sale of such part of the E. 1/2 7 for Right of Way and station grounds not to exceed 20 acres and half remainder of said half section in alternate blocks or alternate blocks of lots or partly one or partly the other as may be agreed upon. The condition is that the railway shall be built and suitable passenger and freight stations with requisite sidings put upon said half section before 1st January following the date of the agreement. The railway at its own costs to subdivide the remainder of said half section but only so much as may be required from time to time for lots. Execution is o.k.\n\n4099 - Partial Discharge of Mortgage 3122 and is a good release of S.E. 7-17-26 W 1.\n\n4073 - Agreement dated 3rd July 1882 between Jno. Patterson of Birtle in Man. Farmer, and John Walley of Birtle, Merchant, whereby Patterson agrees to sell to Walley a lot on the S. side of the S.E. 7 being 66 ft. on the road allowance between 6 and 8 and 230 ft. to the N. of said line being half acre for $1. Walley agrees to build a reasonably good building on said land within one year. Execution is o.k.\n\n4207 - is a conveyance from said John Patterson to the Man. & N.W. Railway Co. of Can. granting 17.76 acres of S.E. 7-17-26 W1 particularly described as commencing at a point in the E. boundary of said section 7 where it is intersected by the centre line of the railway at a distance N. along said E. boundary of 465.5/12 ft. more or less from the S.E. corner thereof. Thence N. along the E. boundary of 7, 50 10/12 ft. more or less to a point distant 50 ft. at right angles from the centre line of the Railway. Thence westerly parallel with said centre line and at a distance 50 feet at right angles thereto, 962\u00bd ft. more or less to the easterly limit of the station grounds as shown on plan of Birtle Town plot made by R.E. Young, P.L.S. dated 27th Sept., 1886. Thence N. parallel with the E. boundary of section 7 and along the easterly limit of the station grounds as shown on said plan 202 2/12 ft. more or less to the N.E. angle of the station grounds as shown on said plan. Thence westerly along N. boundary to the station grounds parallel with centre of the railway and at a distance of 250 ft. at right angles therefrom 1693 ft. more or less to the centre line of section 7. Thence S. along centre line of section 7 604 ft. more or less to the centre line of the railway. Thence continuing S. along the centre line of section 7 150 3/12 ft. more or less to the S. limit of the station grounds as shown on said plan of Birtle. Thence easterly along the S. boundary of the station grounds as shown on said plan and parallel with the centre line of said railway and at a distance of 150 ft. at right angles therefrom 1693 ft. more or less.\nto the S.E. corner of the station grounds as shown on said plan. Thence N. Parallel with the E. boundary of section 7 and along the easterly limit of the station grounds 100 S/12 ft. more or less to a point 50 ft. at right angles from the centre line of the railway. Thence easterly parallel with the centre line of the railway and at a distance of 50 ft., at right angles therefrom 962\u00bd ft. more or less to the E. boundary of section 7, 50 10/12 ft. more or less to the place of beginning and being that portion colored pink on a tracing attached. Has usual habendum and no covenants.\n\n20448 - Patent from the Crown to John Patterson of 17-26 Farmer for the \u00a7.1 7-17-26 containing 320 acres. Only reservation of navigable water. Bears Sale No.3368.\n\nPlan 29 is in accordance with the annexed tracing in 4507 so far as it affects this quarter.\n\nAs to Plan S, there are 31 blocks numbered on the plan and two lettered A & B, and it is a subdivision of all S.E. 7 except the Railway property. All the lots in the odd numbered blocks are in Katherine Patterson's name also is Block B, with certain exceptions to be after noted. All the even numbered blocks are in Katherine Patterson as administrator of WM. Patterson deceased together with Block A, with one exception, that being Lot 2 in block 26 which still stands in the name of Betsy F. Patterson being expressly excepted in the deed conveying all the rest of the property. The exceptions from the odd numbered blocks are Lots 1 and 2 in block 25 which stands in the name of Florence Frost and Lot 1 block 27 which stands in the name of T. Waters.\n\nI would think it desirable upon this title also to get a quit claim deed from the N. & M.W. Railway Co. for all those portions not conveyed by them. I think the agreement clouds the title to the whole quarter section as well as Instrument 4507 being in error. The first dimension in this description reads 485 ft. 5 in. This should be 546 ft. 5 in. I have checked this with the plan and with the tracing attached to the deed and the 584 ft. 5 in. is the dimension given on them. I enclose a sketch of the tracing and plan.\"\n\nAs there are several objections which can be taken to the present title I think that a Torrens Title should be obtained. In that connection I have prepared the necessary application and enclose same herewith so that it can be completed by the Department of Indian Affairs. My Agent has taken the matter of the proposed torrens application up with the District Registrar and reports as follows:-\n\"The District Registrar says that he thinks the best way for you to do is to apply for the whole property in one application. He will issue title for the lots and blocks separately from the title to the streets and lanes as before title can issue for streets and lanes you will have to have the plan cancelled. When the plan has been cancelled he can issue the second Certificate and you can have the two consolidated.\"\n\nIf you will have this application completed and returned I will at once proceed to have it filed and ascertain what material and evidence the Registrar will require before title will issue.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) J. W. Pratt,\nPer \"M.S.\"\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter, dated 29th ultimo, from our agent in this matter, together with application for Torrens title, which I would request that you complete, if suitable, and return same to this Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nASST.

B.5737\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th inst. as to the cost of obtaining the torrens title to the properties being acquired for the Indian Residential School, I may say that the cost depends entirely on the amount of work involved in complying with the requisitions of the Registrar. As soon as the application for torrens title is filed the Registrar looks at the record of title in his office and then sends a letter stating specifically what his requisitions are before torrens title will issue. It is therefore difficult to estimate exactly what the cost will be in each case as it depends on the amount of work involved in complying with the requisitions of the Registrar.\n\nA torrens application has been filed covering the property being purchased from Mrs. A. L. Patterson and for your information I enclose copy of requisition list which is not necessarily simple. The material in this case is being furnished and it is hoped that torrens title will issue at an early date. Enclosed also for your information you will find a copy of the Registrar's requisitions covering lots in Blocks 211, 212, 213 and 214, Plan \"M\", which are being acquired from the Town of Birtle. I do not anticipate much difficulty in obtaining the material in this application.\n\nAs to the cost of the Plan, I have written to the Registrar at Neepawa asking for his suggestions as to the most economical method of proceeding and I should have a letter from him within the next day or two. As soon as there is anything further to report I will communicate with you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) John W.

MURPHY,\n\nWith reference to the selection of a site for the Birtle Indian Residential School, I may say that, at first, the Department was considering the Provincial Demonstration Farm, 2 miles south of the town. In March of last year, the Manitoba Government withdrew their offer to sell the property, as strong opposition to the proposal had been expressed by the people of the district. I then considered the advisability of locating the new school building on the Waywayseecappo Indian reserve, which is 20 miles north of Birtle, not far from Rossburn. It was pointed out, however, that there were many advantages if the school could be kept nearer the town of Birtle.\n\nProperties in the vicinity of Birtle were then considered. The Edmonton farm, 4 miles north of Birtle, and the Brayshaw property, 12 miles east, were examined and were both found unsatisfactory. Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, could not agree with Principal Currie that the Edmonton property was suitable. The Brayshaw farm had many disadvantages and the Honourable Mr. Stewart directed that a site near Birtle be secured.\n\nIn July of last year, Mr. Graham was instructed to immediately secure options on suitable farms near Birtle and to test for domestic water supply at the Department's expense. The Edmonton farm and the Scantlebury Brothers property, both 2 miles south of Birtle, were considered. In the meantime, there were still representations from the people of Birtle that the Edmonton property, north of the town, should be given further consideration. The Dominion Water Powers of the Department of the Interior were asked to report in connection with the water supply. They reported against the reliability of the supply on the Edmonton and Scantlebury properties. I had the Edmonton property examined by the Superintendent of the Dominion Demonstration Farm at Brandon, who confirmed Principal Currie's statement that it would be fairly suitable for school purposes. Mr. Graham's objection was that the land was stony and cut up. The Dominion Water\nPower Branch were asked to report on the water supply there. This was found to be fairly ample, but unsatisfactory for domestic purposes without treatment. The well did not appear to be fed by a flowing spring and it would be extremely difficult to ascertain where the contamination took place.\n\nNo decision could be reached last year because of the failure to locate a farm on which there was good arable land and a suitable water supply. During the winter, it was decided to favourably consider the present site and to examine farm land near the school. Principal Currie was satisfied that the school could be successfully conducted on the old location. The school would be near the town of Birtle and old associations could be continued. One very important consideration - that of electric power - was settled. A good building site with suitable drainage was present. Playgrounds and gardens could be prepared at no great cost. There is a good train service to Birtle and the site is close to the station.\n\nThe Town Council of Birtle urged that the old location be considered and they offered to sell at a fair price the actual building site and suitable pasture. The only disadvantage was the nature of the land in the vicinity and the Principal and others were satisfied to make the best of it.\n\nIn January, last, the Dominion Water Power Branch were asked to report on the water supply and sewage disposal possibilities. It was found that an ample supply could be secured from the C.P.R., and, after chlorination, it would be entirely suitable. In March, it was decided to use the old location and to purchase enough land in the vicinity so that farming could be conducted.\n\nI may add that the Ebwank farm, on the south side of the valley at Birtle, was mentioned at this time, but, as it was much less convenient to the railway and as the people at Birtle were in favour of the old location, the proposal was not seriously considered.\n\nThe following properties, as shown on the next page, have been acquired. These parcels comprise a total of 655 acres, which is not too much, considering the nature of the land. The total price is $8,301, or an average of $12.67 per acre. The land has been valued by an independent appraiser at $8,446, which figure does not include a price on the 50 acres which we are securing from the church. This is worth at least another $500, so that the independent appraisal for the total is approximately $9,000.\nROUGH SKETCH, SHOWING PROPERTY ACQUIRED FOR THE BIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n- Fractional N.

The lands in question may be described as follows:-\n\n(All being in T.17, R.26, W.P.)\n\nFractional N.E. \u00bc Sec. 6, approximately 30 acres, to be purchased from Presbyterian Church Missionary Society, at a consideration of $1,000, to be used for playgrounds, garden and pasture.\n\nBlocks 211, 212, 213 and 214, Plan No. 1, in N.E. \u00bc Sec. 6, approximately 20 acres, to be purchased from the town of Birtle, at a consideration of $500.00. This is the actual building site.\n\nN.W. \u00bc Sec. 5, 160 acres, to be purchased from the town of Birtle, for a consideration of $1,000.00. This quarter is required for pasture and to gain access to the creek. There is some wood (approximately 300 cords) on it.\n\nW. \u00bc Sec. 8, 320 acres, to be purchased from Mrs. J. Patterson, for a consideration of $6,000.00. This is the only farm land within easy reach of the school site. All recognize that it is not good farm land, but Principal Currie states that it can be made to meet the need.\n\nFractional S.E. \u00bc Sec. 7, approximately 125 acres, to be purchased from Mrs. W. Patterson, for a consideration of $500.00. The part of this parcel south of the track is required to round out the property. The northern part of the parcel is good pasture. There is a good well on this property and some wood.\n\nThese parcels comprise a total of 655 acres. The total price is $8,301, or an average of $12.67 per acre. The land has been valued by an independent appraiser at $6,445, exclusive of Parcel A, which is considered by the department to be worth not less than $500.00, making a total value of the properties of approximately $9,000.00.\n\nThe Title to these properties is being searched by an agent of the Department of Justice.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThe undersigned has the honour to re-\nquest that authority be granted for the purchase by the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs of the aforementioned lands for the\npurpose hereinabove mentioned, at the said price of $6,301.\nFunds for this purpose are available from Parliamentary\nappropriation.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nWith reference to the selection of a site for the Birtle Indian Residential School, I may say that, at first, the Department was considering the Provincial Demonstration Farm, 2 miles south of the town. In March of last year, the Manitoba Government withdrew their offer to sell the property, as strong opposition to the proposal had been expressed by the people of the district. I then considered the advisability of locating the new school building on the Waywayssecappo Indian reserve, which is 20 miles north of Birtle, not far from Rossburn. It was pointed out, however, that there were many advantages if the school could be kept nearer the town of Birtle.\n\nProperties in the vicinity of Birtle were then considered. The Edmunston farm, 4 miles north of Birtle, and the Brayshay property, 12 miles east, were examined and were both found unsatisfactory. Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, could not agree with Principal Currie that the Edmunston property was suitable. The Brayshay farm had many disadvantages and the Honourable Mr. Stewart directed that a site nearer Birtle be secured.\n\nIn July of last year, Mr. Graham was instructed to immediately secure options on suitable farms near Birtle and to test for domestic water supply at the Department's expense. The Fulton farm and the Scantlebury Brothers property, both 2 miles south of Birtle, were considered. In the meantime, there were strong representations from the people of Birtle that the Edmunston property, north of the town, should be given further consideration. The Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior were asked to assist in connection with the water supply. They reported against the reliability of the supply on the Fulton and Scantlebury properties. I had the Edmunston farm examined by the Superintendent of the Dominion Experimental Farm at Brandon, who confirmed Principal Currie's statement that it would be fairly suitable for school purposes. Mr. Graham's objection was that the land was stony and cut up. The Dominion Water\nPower Branch were asked to report on the water supply there. This was found to be fairly ample, but unsatisfactory for domestic purposes without treatment. The well did not appear to be fed by a flowing spring and it would be extremely difficult to ascertain where the contamination took place.\n\nNo decision could be reached last year because of the failure to locate a farm on which there was good arable land and a suitable water supply. During the winter, it was decided to favourably consider the present site and to acquire the land near the school. Principal Curry was satisfied that the school could be successfully conducted on the old location. The school would be near the town of Birtle and old associations could be continued. One very important consideration - that of electric power - was settled. A good building site with suitable drainage was present. Playgrounds and gardens could be prepared at no great cost. There is a good train service to Birtle and the site is close to the station.\n\nThe Town Council of Birtle urged that the old location be considered and they offered to sell at a fair price the actual building site and suitable pasture. The only disadvantage was the nature of the land in the vicinity and the Principal and others were satisfied to make the best of it.\n\nIn January, last, the Dominion Water Power Branch were asked to report on the water supply and sewage disposal possibilities. It was found that an ample supply could be secured from the C.P.R., and, after chlorination, it would be entirely suitable. In March, it was decided to use the old location and to purchase enough land in the vicinity so that farming could be conducted.\n\nI may add that the Ewbank farm, on the south side of the valley at Birtle, was mentioned at this time, but, as it was much less convenient to the railway and as the people at Birtle were in favour of the old location, the proposal was not seriously considered.\n\nThe following properties, as shown on the next page, have been acquired. These parcels comprise a total of 655 acres, which is not too much, considering the nature of the land. The total price is $8,301, or an average of $12.67 per acre. The land has been valued by an independent appraiser at $8,445, which figure does not include a price on the 30 acres which we are securing from the church. This is worth at least another $500, so that the independent appraisal for the total is approximately $9,000.\nROUGH SKETCH, SHOWING PROPERTY ACQUIRED FOR THE BIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n- Fractional N.E. \u00bc\nFractional N.

S. MacDonnell, K.C., of Toronto, in connection with the conveyance from the Women's Missionary Society covering the property of the Indian Residential School at Birtle. A copy of the letter is enclosed, which explains itself.\n\nAs suggested by Mr. MacDonnell, I am communicating with Mr. Piiblado at Winnipeg, who is acting for the United Church and with Mr. Farquhar, solicitor for the continuing Presbyterian Church. I will endeavour to have a proper conveyance completed as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) John W. Pratt.\nNovember 27th, 1930.\n\nMessrs. Pratt & Lauman,\nBarristers & Solicitors,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAfter an extended illness I have returned to work and find your letter of the 5th instant together with the file of correspondence preceding. I regret that there has been such a delay and shall try in future to see that there is no more.\n\nIn our letter to you of July 14th it was explained that, owing to a peculiarity in the law of Manitoba, the Masters of Titles declined to accept for registration a conveyance of property from trustees for the United Church to trustees for the continuing Presbyterian Church. And our W.M.S. must obtain its title from the trustees for the continuing Presbyterian Church. Special legislation, we understand, was being arranged for at the last Session of the Manitoba Legislature. But apparently it has not been completed.\n\nI have been in touch with Mr. H.C. Thomson, who is acting in the matter of conveyancing for the continuing Presbyterian Church but he is unable to give me any information as to how things are getting on. He advises me simply that the conveyance of property have been held up. I understand, however, that Mr. Plaice of Winnipeg is acting in the matter for the United Church and Mr. Alex. Farquhar, Standard Bank Building, Winnipeg, is acting for the continuing Presbyterian Church. These gentlemen, particularly the latter, should be able to tell you what the situation is.\n\nAs soon as the W.M.S. can obtain a deed from the trustees of the continuing Presbyterian Church they will be glad to make a conveyance to your client.\n\nHas our office sent you a draft conveyance? From the file in hand I cannot be sure and the junior who was looking after the matter has not left us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) H.S.

This route was used for some thirty years by consent of the former owner of the west half of section 8.\n\nHowever, anticipating that this land might be sold, I applied to the Canadian Pacific Railway some years ago for a crossing at the south west corner of my property to allow use of the road allowance north of section 5, and 6. Now, however, due to the location of the new school buildings, the town has passed a by-law closing this road allowance.\n\nOn hearing of this I placed a protest with the Provincial Government, who then refused to ratify the by-law until such time as the matter was settled to the satisfaction of all parties.\n\nI would like to have if possible some legal arrangement granting right of access to my property across the west half of section 8-17, 26 W. I would be glad to have your views on this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Katherine Patterson.\nOttawa, 23rd July 1932\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing for your information a copy of a letter received from Mrs. Katherine Patterson, 190 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, Man., in connection with the closing of the road North of Secs.5 and 6, Tp.17, R.26, W., and also in connection with the owner of the E.\u00bd Sec.8 being allowed ingress and egress over the W.\u00bd Sec.8-17-26-W.\n\nWith a view to arriving at a satisfactory settlement of this question, you should investigate the matter, and after discussion with the Principal of the Indian School, forward to the Department the recommendations of yourself and the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nP.G. Lezenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 2)\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter No. 106-1-9 of the 23rd July, enclosing therewith a copy of a letter addressed to the Department by Mrs. Katherine Paterson of Winnipeg, in which she asks right of access to her property across the West half of Section 8-17-26, acquired by the Department for the Birtle Residential School.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I beg to say that Messrs Pratt & Lauman, Barristers, of Birtle Man; are acting under instructions they have received from the Department of Justice; Mr W.G. Ferguson, Barrister, of Minnedosa Man, is acting on behalf of Mr Johnson, the present tenant holding Mrs Katherine Paterson's property. This morning, arrangements have been made for a meeting of Mr Pratt Mr Ferguson, Mr Johnson, Principal Currie of the Birtle Residential School, and myself, to be held at local Land Office Friday afternoon August 5th next, to discuss this situation and endeavor to arrive at some amicable arrangement. Mr Pratt also suggests including in the meeting, Mr Price Phillips of Birtle who is a surveyor, and has already done some work for Mr Pratt in the above connection.\n\nI would point out, however, that the fourth paragraph of Mrs Katherine Paterson's letter is apt to convey a false impression to the Department. In this paragraph, Mrs Paterson states that some years ago she applied to the Canadian Pacific Railway, for a crossing at the southwest corner of her property, to allow use of the road allowance north of sections 5 and 6, but that now, due to the location of the new school buildings, the town of Birtle has passed a by-law closing this road allowance. This would imply that this road allowance had been in use but such is not the case, as it is impossible to make use of it, on account of rocks and a very deep gully.\n\nI will make a full report to the Department after having attended the meeting next Friday. I may say now, however, that Principal Currie is very strongly opposed to allowing a road through the school property, as there is a good gravelled road on the north boundary of section 8 which he feels should be used by Mrs Katherine Paterson's tenant.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wilson\nMayor.\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 1st instant, in reply to Departmental letter No. 106-1-9 of the 23rd July 1932, I now beg to report that on the 5th instant, at the town of Shalal Lake Man; I met with Mr. John Johnson, the present occupant of the NW\u00bc of Sec; 8-17-26 WEM, and Sec; 9-17-26 WEM which is owned by Mrs Katherine Paterson; Mr W.G. Ferguson, Barrister, of Minnedosa, who is Mr Johnson's legal adviser; Mr J.W. Pratt, Barrister, of Birtle, who is acting on behalf of the Department, to secure title to the closed road allowances; and Principal Currie of the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe matter of allowing ingress and egress across the NW\u00bc of Sec; 8-17-26, which has been purchased by the Department, to and from the east half of the same section, for Mr Johnson, the occupant of the east half of Sec; 8, and all of Sec; 9 north of the C.F.R., was discussed at this meeting.\n\nOn the 15th May 1930, the Council of the Town of Birtle passed a resolution, granting an option to the Department, to sell to the Department the N.W.\u00bc of Sec; 5-17-26, and Blocks 211, 212, 213, and 214, for the total sum of $1,500.00. The final clause of the resolution reads as follows:\n\n\"The Town agrees to close all roads adjacent to the above mentioned property, and to take in exchange, the road across the S.E.\u00bc of Sec; 7-17-26.\"\n\nThe Department took up this option, and on June 5th 1930, I received an acknowledgement of the Department's acceptance, from the Mayor of the town, a copy of which is attached hereto. In this letter, the Town agrees to do everything in its power to facilitate the transaction, and will furnish any documents or evidences of title which may be required.\n\nIn due course, the Town Council proceeded in the proper legal way, to close the road allowances mentioned in their option to the Department. This matter was advertised for a certain period of time, in accordance with the law, and any person who considered that their interests would be affected by the closing of the mid roads, were given opportunity\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA.

At this meeting, Mr Johnson appeared and objected. Principal Currie, of the Birtle Indian School and I also were at the meeting, and both sides of the question were heard and considered by the Council, who then decided that Mr Johnson had no case, and therefore the by-law closing the road allowance was given the necessary second and third readings, and passed.\n\nBoth before, and since that time, Mr Johnson has been a source of considerable trouble to Principal Currie. He has continued to cross the school farm, cutting and tearing down fences belonging to the school farm, and smashing locks off gates, and making himself a trail across the school crops of barley and potatoes on the S.W.\u00bd of Sec; 8, and also coming across the railway and through the school barn yard.\n\nAt the meeting at Shoal Lake, mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter, after a thorough discussion of the matter, Principal Currie stated that he strongly objected to Mr Johnson having a road or trail of any sort across the school farm property, but that if the town were \"forced\" in any way to expropriate any of the school land to provide Mr Johnson access to his place, in lieu of the road allowance they had closed, the proper place to make such a road, would be straight across the west half of Section 8, between the north and south quarter sections; i.e., between \"A\" and \"B\" as shown on the accompanying sketch, and that in such case, the road must not be more than 30 feet wide, and must be fenced with woven wire fence on both sides, the school providing one fence, and the town the other, each fence to have two gates. Mr Johnson insisted that such road between \"A\" and \"B\" should be a \"Public\" road, but must cease to be public at point \"B\", where he would have a gate installed to keep anyone going from this public road on to his farm.\n\nOn returning to Birtle from the meeting at Shoal Lake, I met the town council in session, and put this proposition to them. They stated that they would certainly not open such a road leading to a \"blind\" end. The council informed me that the Municipality had offered to open the road allowance between sections 8 and 9 from point \"C\" to point \"D\" shown on the sketch, for Mr Johnson, and that Mr Johnson had refused to have this done. This was verified by telephoning to the Reeve of the Municipality. It will be noted from the sketch, that Mr Johnson has this road allowance fenced off at the north end, and has the road allowance cultivated, and under crop.\n\nThe following day, I conferred with Mr J.W.Pratt, who stated that Mr Ferguson, Mr Johnson's lawyer, was to be at Shoal Lake on the 11th, and suggested that it might be wise to try and arrange a special meeting of the Town Council for that evening, and ask Mr Ferguson to be present. This was done, and, previous to the meeting being opened, Mr Ferguson accompanied the Mayor of Birtle and one of the Councillors to the locations of the roads and trails concerned, and looked over the actual situation. At the meeting, the town - agreed -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nagreed with Mr Johnson's lawyer, to open a 30 foot roadway east and west across the centre of Sec 8 from point \"A\" to point \"C\", provided he were willing for such roadway to cross his half of the section, and have the Municipality open the road allowance from \"Q\" to \"JW\", so that the public could use the road if they so desired; but they would not consider opening any roadway halfway across the section to stop at a gate through which the public were not permitted to pass. If Mr Johnson would not agree to this proposition, then the town council were willing that the matter should be settled by legal process.\n\nThe Town Council contends that the closing of the road allowance north of sections 5 and 6 has in no way been prejudicial to Mr Johnson's interests as this road allowance has never been in use and could not be put in substantial use except at a cost of several thousands of dollars, which the town is not prepared to incur, to accommodate one man. Here I would again refer you to the fourth paragraph of Mrs Katherine Paterson's letter to the Department, of the 7th July last, which implies that this road allowance has been in use, and the closing of it had shut off access to and from her property, when such is not the case.\n\nReferring again to Mrs Paterson's letter, the third paragraph, it is stated that the route across the west half of section 8 was used for some thirty years by consent of the former owner of the east half of section 8. According to the former owner of this half section, from whom the Department acquired it, the route across this land was a mutual agreement arrived at between two brothers, William Paterson, late husband of Mrs Katherine Paterson, and John Paterson, late husband of Anna Lincoln Paterson from whom the Department purchased the west half of 8.\n\nMr Johnson, moreover, had been forbidden to cross this land by the tenant occupying it when the Department purchased it.\n\nThe whole matter is primarily one to be settled between the Town of Birtle, and Mrs Katherine Paterson, of course. The town has agreed to furnish title to the property including the closed road allowances, but the town's by-law closing these roads is being held up by the Municipal Commissioner, until such time as a settlement has been arrived at between the town and the owner of the east half of section 8, and section 9. The objection is, that Mr Johnson has a long way to go from the S.E.4 of Sec 8, to the elevators at Birtle station, with the grain threshed on that quarter section, if he has no way across the west half of 8, and I may here state that this quarter section is advertised for sale for arrears of taxes on the 26th August, the arrears amounting to $168.20 including costs. All of this quarter section south of the railway is pasture land, and there are only about 50 acres north of the railway, cultivated. Further developments will be reported to the Department at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.G. Azenby\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johnson, who is reported to have continued to cross the school farm, cutting and tearing down fences and making a trail across the school crops of barley and potatoes in the S.W.\u00bc Sec.8. The Principal of the school is very much opposed to Mr. Johnson having a road across the school property.\n\nAt a recent meeting of the Town Council, which was attended by Mr. W.G. Ferguson, Barrister, Minnedosa, representing Mr. Johnson, the Council informed Mr. Ferguson that it would open a public road 30 ft. wide across the centre of Sec.8. This offer by the Town would provide every access to which the owner of the E.\u00bd Sec.8 could be considered to be entitled and if the departmental property is to be subjected to a forced road through the W.\u00bd Sec.8, the Department would insist that it be located in this position.\n\nThe matter of providing access to the E.\u00bd Sec.8 appears to be the responsibility of the Town of Birtle and not of this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. Katherine Patterson\n100 Arlington Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n(A.F.

Some complications, however, have arisen because Thomas Johnston who farms parts of Sections 8 and 9 east of the School property filed an objection against the Town By-law closing the part of the road allowance north of the N.W. 5-17-26 West. An objection was also made by Mrs. Katherine Patterson who is the unpaid vendor of the Johnston property.\n\nThe By-law closing the road was duly passed by the Town of Birtle and was filed with the Municipal Commissioner in the Legislative Bldgs., Winnipeg, for approval. The Municipal Commissioner has not sanctioned the By-law on account of the objections and has indicated that he will set a time and place for hearing the objections to the By-law.\n\nOn behalf of the Department I have continued to urge a settlement of the matter as speedily as possible so that you can secure title to the property in accordance with the Agreement. Since the objections were first made I have had a number of attendances upon the Town and upon Johnston and the Municipal Commissioner's Department, with a view to securing title without delay.\n\nFor your information under separate cover I am sending a diagram prepared by Mr. P. R. Phillips, Civil Engineer, which shows clearly the location of the various properties and the road allowances which are being closed.\n\n... ...\nI understand that the matter has been brought to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs and that Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Birtle, has made a complete report to the Department. Mr. Lazenby fully understands the situation and realizes the difficulties which have been experienced in securing titles to the ranch houses in question. I was present with Mr. Lazenby at a meeting in Shoal Lake and before the Birtle Council recently, watching the interests of the Department, and I know that Mr. Lazenby is fully familiar with the situation.\n\nI shall be glad to forward any further information which may be required.

The Minister asks that this correspondence be returned to him and that he be advised as to the possibility of meeting the wishes of Mr. Johnson.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclos. (Lr. & sketch)\n6th February 1953\n\nMemorandum\n\nThe Minister,\n\nThe attached correspondence from Mr. Frank Mansaring to Col. H.A. Mullins, M.P., refers to a complication which has arisen as a result of a sale by the Town of Birtle to this Department of the N.W.\u00bc Sec. 5, Tp. 17, R. 26, which were purchased for the purpose of the Birtle Indian residential school. One of the terms in connection with this sale was that the Town agreed to close all roads adjacent to the property purchased and to take in exchange the road across the S.E.\u00bc Sec. 7, Tp. 17, R. 26. This involved the official closing of the regulation road allowance between Secs. 5 and 8, but the road along this allowance had never been constructed and on account of the nature of the ground on which it is located could not have been opened except by an expenditure of several thousands of dollars, on account of the fact that it is very rocky and along the edge of a deep gully, as you will note from the topography shown on the attached plan.\n\nMr. Johnson, whose house and farm buildings are located on the N.W.\u00bc Sec. 9 in the position indicated on the plan, leases the E.\u00bd Sec. 8 from Mrs. Katherine Paterson, Winnipeg. (This property is shown in yellow on the plan and adjoins the school property which is shown in blue on the plan.) It appears that prior to the acquisition of the W.\u00bd Sec. 8 for the school that the former owner of the W.\u00bd, who was the brother of the owner of the E.\u00bd, consented to the use by the owner of the E.\u00bd of the trails indicated in red on the plan.\nThe Principal of the school reports that Mr. Johnson has been a source of considerable trouble for sometime and that he has continued to cross the school farm, cutting and tearing down fences belonging to the school, smashing locks off gates and making for himself a trail through the school crops of barley and potatoes. The road along the North and West of Sec.8 is a good gravelled road to which Mr. Johnson has access over his own trail in N.W.\u00bc Sec.9 as indicated on the plan. The road allowance between Secs.8 and 9 has not been opened and Mr. Johnson has this road allowance under cultivation.\n\nIt appears to the Department that if Mr. Johnson is to be provided with any other outlet than that now available over the road allowance to the North of Sec.9 that the responsibility of providing such access rests with the Town of Birtle and not with this Department.\n\nThe Principal of the school has strongly objected to Mr. Johnson having a trail across the school property and it is considered that, if the Town finds it necessary to provide Mr. Johnson with access across Sec.8 by expropriating a portion of the school land, the proper place to establish such a road would be straight across Sec.8 between the N. and S. \u00bc sections. This was intimated to the Town by the Principal of the school who also suggested that in that event the school would construct a fence on one side of this road through the school property, if the Town would provide a fence on the other side. Mr. Johnson made objections to this by insisting that such a road should be a public road through the W.\u00bd Sec.8 but that it must cease to be a public road upon entering the E.\u00bd of the Section and that he would install a gate at that point to prevent anyone continuing along the road into his farm. The Town Council then took the attitude that they would not open a road leading to a blind end as it was considered necessary that a road of this nature should continue to the road allowance between Secs.8 and 9 and as the Municipality had offered to open a road allowance between the N.\u00bd Secs.8 and 9, it would supply a continuous route from the roads now in\nexistence along the North boundaries of Secs.8 and 9. This, of course, was not acceptable to Mr. Johnson as he has this portion of the road allowance under cultivation.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, I do not consider it to be either necessary or desirable for the Department to permit Mr. Johnson to cross the school property over an unauthorized trail, as it seems to me to be a question which should be dealt with by the Town of Birtle.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTOWN OF BIRTLE\n\nBirtle, Man., February 23rd,\n1933.\n\nHon.

G.\nLazenby and the Principal of the School, Mr. H. B. Currie,\nto agree to an outlet for the occupant of the E.\u00bd S and\nsection 9. The occupant of the E.\u00bd S has had the use of a\ntrail over the W.\u00bd S and over part of the road to be closed\nfor many years. It is a question open to endless argument\nwhether prescriptive rights have been established to the said\ntrail. In any case we cannot proceed with the By-law until\nthe occupant on the E.\u00bd S has been provided with a road or\ntrail in lieu of the existing trails. We have had numerous\ninterviews and he has now agreed to withdraw his objection to\nthe By-law if provided with a roadway taking the N.\u00bd 30 feet\nin width of the S.W.S-17-26. In this event the Department\nwould require to transfer said 30 foot strip to the Town.\nThis would be the cheapest and simplest way to close out the\nmatter.\n\nAt the time the option was given by the Town this\ndetail was not thought of. The Town have done everything\nhumanly possible to meet the requirements of the Department and\nthey now require the co-operation of the Department in finally\nclosing the transaction.\n\nThere is ill feeling between the Principal of the\nIndian School and the occupant of the E.\u00bd S over these old\ntrails.\n\nIn view of the present situation and in view of\nthe fact that no amicable settlement can be made, we suggest\nthat you send to Birtle an independent investigator to get\ninformation of fact and law and make an impartial report to\nyou for your final consideration and decision.\nWe want above all to have this matter completed without additional expense and opening of new roads and if the Department would consent to granting to the occupant the right of ingress and egress over the 30 foot strip of land above described, we could proceed with the By-law and finally convey Title to the Department of the Dominion Government Road Allowance.\n\nAs this matter has been dragging on for considerable number of months we would appreciate your careful investigation and consideration and if necessary obtain an impartial and independent report from some outside party.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Johnson to the final action in closing the road allowances which the Town wishes to abandon in accordance with the terms of sale of certain properties to this Department for the purposes of the Residential School, that this Department convey to the Town a thirty foot strip across the S.W.\u00bc Sec.8-17-26-W.P.M. and adjoining the North limit of said quarter section. He also states that Johnson will withdraw his objections if this is done.\n\nIn view of the circumstances and in consideration of the advisability of ensuring that the present unsatisfactory passage of Mr. Johnson across the school property be discontinued, the Department is disposed to consider favourably a transfer as suggested. It is noted in your letter of the 12th August last that this location is in accordance with the views of Mr. Currie.\n\nBefore a decision is made, however, it is desired to have an expression of your views and those of the Principal of the School. Should you or the Principal see any objections to this proposal, these should be fully set forth in your report.\n\nIt is presumed that the School would require gates on each side of the road to provide access from the S.W.\u00bc to the N.W.\u00bc. If the Department were to transfer the land required without compensation, it is thought the Town should erect the necessary fences and gates on each side of the road; the fences to be of a type approved by yourself and the Principal. You might ascertain from the Mayor if the Town would be ready to undertake this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\n(A.F.

MURPHY\n\nHis Worship Mayor Nanwareing,\nBirtle,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No: 106-1-9A of the 10th instant, in reference to the matter of Mr Thos. Johnson's claim for access to and from his farm, across the Indian Residential School farm.\n\nIn reply, I beg to report that I have interviewed the Mayor of Birtle; also Mr G.A. Zauman, of Messrs Pratt & Lauman, Solicitors, of Birtle, concerning this matter; and they have in turn consulted with Mr Johnson.\n\nIn consideration of the Department agreeing to convey to the Town of Birtle the most northerly 30 feet of the S.W.\u00bc of Sec; 8-17-26 WM, the following tentative agreement has been arrived at, subject to the approval of the Birtle Town Council, Mrs Katherine Paterson, and the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\n1. Mr Thos. Johnson consents to allow anyone from the Indian School to use the road or trail through the center of the east half of Sec; 8-17-26, of which he is the purchaser, to go to and from the S.W.\u00bc of Sec; 16, which is a part of the Indian School farm.\n\n2. Mr Johnson would undertake to keep closed, the gates at each end of the proposed 30 foot roadway, across the center of the west half of Sec; 8 which is a part of the Indian School farm, and instruct his servants to do so also.\n\n3. Mr Johnson will consent to a time limit being established for the use of the proposed 30 foot roadway across the center of Sec; 8; such time to expire if he, and his family leave the farm on which they are now living, provided the consent of the vendor (Mrs K. Paterson), is also obtained.\n\n4. The Town of Birtle will undertake to erect the necessary fences and gates to enclose the proposed 30 foot roadway, as soon as their financial condition will permit.\n\nRe: Clause 1. Principal Currie, of the Indian Residential School stipulated that if Mr Thos. Johnson -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, 30th March 1935\n\nSir,\n\nYour ref. No. 15A\n\nI have to advise you that the Department agrees in principle with the conditions of the tentative agreement which is outlined in your letter of the 23rd instant.\n\nHowever, before it is submitted to the Department and after it has been completed by the Town of Birtle and by Mr. Thos. Johnson, purchaser of the E.\u00bd Sec.8 and Mrs. Katherine Paterson, vendor of that \u00bd section, it should be submitted to the Provincial Municipal Commissioner at Winnipeg by the Town of Birtle, with the request that the Town be advised if, as a result of this agreement, he will sanction the by-law closing the road allowances which were to be closed in accordance with the terms of sale to this Department by the Town of Birtle.\n\nThe agreement should then be forwarded to the Department, accompanied by a copy of the Commissioner's reply, and if this is favourable, the Department will be in a position to approve the agreement and take the necessary steps to obtain the authority of His Excellency the Governor General in Council to transfer the land required for right of way to the Town of Birtle.\n\nP.G. Lazenby Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary.\nJohnson, be given the privilege of crossing the school farm, he should also permit the school to cross the east half of the same section, to take a short cut to the S.W.\u00bc of section 16, and Mr Johnson agreed to this stipulation.\n\nRe; Clause 2. Owing to the fact that the Town of Birtle is at present not in a position financially, to erect the fences to enclose the roadway proposed, it will be necessary to have a gate set at each end of the roadway, which will have to be opened and closed every time anyone uses the road, and Mr Johnson undertakes to keep these gates closed and to instruct his men also to keep them closed.\n\nRe; Clause 3. Though Mr Johnson is the \"Purchaser\" of the farm he now occupies, (Mrs Katherine Paterson being the vendor), there appears a strong probability that, owing to his not being able to live up to his obligations, the vendor may re-possess the farm, and this clause was put in at my suggestion so that if Mr Johnson at any time leaves his farm, the right to use the proposed 30 foot roadway across the school farm, automatically expires. This would avoid the possibility of the roadway becoming established as a public road by usage and custom.\n\nClause 4, is self explanatory.\n\nBefore the Mayor of Birtle can sign the above agreement, it will of course be necessary that the Council pass a resolution authorizing him to do so; as his signature would bind the Town to erect the two fences as soon as they became in a position financially to do so. Then there is the possibility that Mrs Katherine Paterson would not care to sign the agreement on account of Clause No; 3.\n\nThe present proposal is to have the agreement drafted and submitted to those concerned for signature, and if all these are procured, to then submit it to the Department for approval or otherwise.\n\nI may say that Principal Currie of the Birtle Indian Residential School approved of the terms of the agreement.\n\nA further report will be forwarded to the Department in due course.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nF.G.

In earlier purchases made by the Department of the school property at Birtle, it was arranged with the Town that they would close these roads and transfer them to the Department, but as you are aware, a Mr. Johnson who occupied the E.\u00bd Sec.8, insisted on being allowed to use a trail through the school property in the W.\u00bd Sec.8 and, therefore, objected to the roads being closed.\n\nThe Municipal Commissioner would not approve of the Town By Laws Nos.282 and 288, closing these roads, until Mr. Johnson's objection was removed. This was accomplished by transferring to the Province for a right of way 30 feet in width along the North of the S.W.-\u00bc Sec.8 to provide access to the occupant of the E.\u00bd Sec.8. This has been completed and the Town is issuing title to the portions which were acquired.\n\nIt is necessary that these be filed under the Torrens system. The Registrar's fee for this is $52.00. This fee varies according to the valuation of the property, including the buildings thereon, which has been filled out by the Agent of the Department of Justice at $10,000.00. I presume this amount has been arrived at by interviewing the Agent and the Principal of the school. Kindly advise me if this amount may be taken as reasonably correct and also as to whether this cheque for $52.00 is to be drawn on the School Vote or the appropriation for legal fees and I shall have the application properly completed and forwarded with the cheque, in order that we may receive our Certificate of Title.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nREQUISITION FOR ENCUMBRANCE CERTIFICATE\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nNOT VALID UNLESS SIGNED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nREQUISITIONS WILL BE NUMBERED IN ONE GENERAL SEQUENCE IN THE ACCOUNTS BRANCH\n\nBRANCH: SCHOOLS DATE: Dec. 20, 1933\n\nACCOUNTS BRANCH\n\nVOTE NO.: 188 YEAR: 1933-1934\n\nE.

There are very few farmers who can afford to do this, and also take the chance of not getting water.\n\nWe have interviewed the Provincial Government and while they say this work does not come under their control, they are of the opinion that the dam should be repaired, and their Deputy Minister of Mines and Natural Resources, Mr. Attwood, is prepared to recommend it.\n\nIt will not be a very expensive piece of work; there is only about 150 feet washed out, but the town can not afford to do it.\n\nHoping you will do your very best to help up,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A.

McGill -\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter the Minister has received from Andrew Doig, of Birtle, referring to a dam which helps to supply the Indian School with water. Will you please let the Minister know if this dam was constructed by the Indian Department, or if there is any responsibility upon it to keep it in repair.\n\nEnc. (1)\n\nG.W. Jackson.\nJune 19, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 17th instant, with copy attached of a letter from Andrew Doig, Birtle, Man., referring to a dam which helps to supply the Birtle Indian Residential School with water.\n\nIn this regard I would say that the Department made arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for water supply for this school from the Company's pipe-line - the school authorities paying an annual charge for this service. The railway company pipe their supply of water from Birdtail Creek to a water tank, from which source it is piped to the school. This water, for all school purposes, is filtered and chlorinated and a water softener softens all drinking and hot water used.\n\nAfter a search of our files, I am unable to find that this Department contributed to any part of the cost of erecting a dam on the Birdtail river. There is no doubt that, with the dam gone, the situation may become serious for the school, especially in a very dry time in summer and also in the winter, when the river might freeze to the bottom. The Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior was written with regard to the above, and they advise that it might be possible, if the matter was referred to the Department of Agriculture, who administer the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, that the rebuilding of the dam might be undertaken. The Department has recently taken up this matter with the Deputy Minister of the Department of Agriculture, but, up to the present time, has received no reply. In view of the fact that the school authorities pay the C. P. R. an annual rental for the water service, I am of opinion that there is no responsibility on the Department to assist in the costs of rebuilding the dam.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 16th, in which you quote a letter received from Rev.

I understand that the application will be approved by the Manitoba Committee and forwarded to Regina to the Director of the Water Development Committee.\n\nWith respect to the water supply for the Indian School at Birtle, I believe that the Canadian Pacific Railway has been utilizing the Birdtail Creek for its water supply for a long period of years and has not to date experienced shortage of water, either summer or winter. The dam referred to by the Rev. Mr. Lockhart has only been in existence the last two or three years and incidentally has been the cause of considerable trouble to the water supply at the Birtle Indian School.

As you will note, this refers to the rebuilding of the dam in the Birdtail River. The Dominion Water Power Branch was requested to report, and in letter dated June 15th, 1936, Mr. Gow wrote:\n\n\"I wish to advise that the Manitoba Committee have received an application from the Town of Birtle with reference to the rebuilding of the dam under the provisions of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act.

In my opinion this dam is not a necessity nor an advantage insofar as the Indian School at Birtle is concerned.\"\n\nIn view of the contents of Mr. Gow's letter, the Department did not consider that the rebuilding of the dam was a proper charge against the Appropriation for Indian Education, and, consequently, no further action was taken at that time.\n\nWe are now in receipt of another letter in connection with this matter, urging the Department to take action on the grounds that the Birtle School is experiencing difficulty in obtaining a sufficient quantity of water. Our correspondent states that the Principal of the Birtle School intends to again write the Department in this regard, but no such letter has yet reached us.\n\nI would appreciate your considering this matter carefully and advising the Department whether you agree with Mr. Gow's opinion or whether you think there is any likelihood of a diminished water supply at the Birtle School. Please let me have your reply at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to a letter forwarded under date of June 15th last relating to a proposed dam across Birdtail Creek at Birtle, Manitoba. In that letter I stated that in my opinion the dam was not a necessity nor an advantage insofar as the Indian School at Birtle was concerned.\n\nBirdtail Creek is one of the streams upon which we carried out hydrometric studies over a period of years. It is fed by springs and insofar as we are aware, it has never ceased to have some flow. However, during the past summer and this autumn there has been very little rainfall in the watershed and the flow in the stream is now very low. It is possible the springs may fail this winter as a result of the continued sub-normal rainfall conditions. Such failure would have serious consequences for the Indian School which is dependent upon the river for its water supply.\n\nI understand that all efforts to have the dam constructed during the present summer under provisions of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act, have failed since Birtle is not considered to be within the drought area. There is a strong local demand for the construction of the dam and while it does not exist in existence for two years or more will neither a necessity nor an advantage to the Indian School, yet it is now quite possible that the water supply might fail because of the extension of the dry area to the Birdtail Watershed. The construction of a dam now might avert a serious condition of water shortage this winter and I believe the Department of Indian Affairs would be justified in assisting in the construction of the dam.\n\nShould such assistance be granted, it should be stipulated that the Municipality be required to operate the dam during the summer months in accordance with the directions of officials of the Department of Indian Affairs. This provision is necessary so that the pond could be emptied occasionally during the summer of low water to prevent repetition of the trouble experienced with algae growth during the summer of 1934. During that summer the flow in the river was quite low and the water in the pond became quite stagnant, permitting algae growth which when taken into the filter, chlorinator and water softener at the Indian School, caused a great deal of inconvenience at the school and was the cause of serious complaints from the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that Mr. Gow's opinion is somewhat different from that expressed in his letter of June 15th, last.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it might be advisable to obtain a full report regarding the cost of building the proposed dam. This is required in order that we may have definite information before us, but it should be understood that, at the present time, this Department does not admit responsibility for contributing to the cost of the proposed dam, nor have we any funds available for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

M. Doig and addressed to Mr. A. MacNamara, Deputy Minister of Public Works, Winnipeg, regarding the water supply at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would refer to my memorandum dated June 22nd, last, to which was attached copy of a communication from the Acting District Chief Engineer, Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Winnipeg. At that time the Engineer stated that, in his opinion, the erection of a dam was not a necessity nor an advantage, in so far as the Indian school at Birtle is concerned. In a further communication from the District Chief Engineer to the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Ottawa - a copy of which is attached - he is now of opinion that, owing to the little rainfall during the past summer and this autumn, the flow is very low, and that it is possible the springs may fail this winter and such failure would have serious consequences for the Indian school, which is dependent upon the river for its water supply.\n\nThe water supply for the Birtle Indian Residential School is obtained from the Canadian Pacific Railway tank at Birtle station, from which it is piped to the school. We understand that the C. P. R. obtain their water\n\nSchools\nfrom Birdtail Creek, on which it is proposed to erect the dam. The Department has no information as to all the interests concerned, the cost involved in erecting the dam, the proportion of the cost that the Department would be called upon to provide, or in what manner the school supply of water is endangered, should the dam not be constructed.\n\nThe Director of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Ottawa, was requested, on the 21st instant, to have their District Engineer furnish a full report regarding the cost of building the proposed dam. Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, was forwarded a copy of the District Engineer's attached report of the 17th instant. Mr. Hamilton is fully conversant with the situation at Birdtail and he was requested to advise whether, in his opinion, there was any likelihood of a diminished water supply at the Birdtail School and if the construction of a dam would be of advantage in so far as the school water supply is concerned. Until we receive the report of the District Engineer and Mr. Inspector Hamilton, there is no information on our file as to the cost that would be entailed to the Department in the construction of the dam, or what share of the cost this Department would be called upon to provide. You will be advised immediately upon receipt of the report of the District Engineer and Mr. Inspector Hamilton.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nED\nWINNIPEG, MAN., November 24th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 106-1-9 dated November 18th, and to state that I have just returned from Birtle and discussed the water situation with Mr. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, and also with Mr. A. G. Smith, the Indian Agent.\n\nThe question of a water supply is a serious matter at this school. During the past year, the Birtle district has received very little rain and many of the wells and springs have gone dry. I quite realize that some years ago there was no dam at Birtle and yet there was plenty of water to supply both the C.P.R. and the school. However, with the continued dry spell, I am not prepared to say that a dam is not necessary. At present the river is very low and there is the possibility that with the extreme cold weather, a shortage of water may occur. I would like to point out that there are at least four parties interested in retaining a supply of water, namely - the Town of Birtle, the Provincial Government (in the interest of forty or fifty farmers who, in the past, hauled their water supply from this source), the C.P.R., and the Indian Department. It seems to me that the C.P.R. should be equally as interested as we are. However, I feel that if assistance is granted from the Department for the building of this dam, cheaper water should be supplied to the school. At present I am advised by Mr. Lockhart that the water costs approximately $40. per month.\n\nI would also point out that when the dam was intact, the water became very stagnant, permitting the growth of algae which blocked the filter and chlorinator, making it almost impossible to get any water to the school. If a new dam is erected, it should be provided.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 3)\nbe provided with gates so that the water could be released when necessary to prevent stagnation and the growth of foreign matter. The control of these gates should be placed with the Dept. of Indian Affairs if financial consideration is given when it is erected. I am pointing this out because the stale water perhaps has no effect, except in connection with our equipment at the Birtle School, consequently there would probably be some objection raised to allowing the escape of water.\n\nIn view of the scarcity of water throughout this district, I am inclined to think it would be advisable to have the dam re-built if only as a precautionary measure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nREPORT ON DAM AT BIRTLE, MANITOBA\n\nEarly in June of the present year the Town of Birtle and the Rural Municipality of Birtle made representations to the Governments both of Manitoba and the Dominion, requesting that financial aid be granted to repair the dam on the Birdtail river just west of the town. They stated that the main part of the dam had been carried away by the high water of this spring, and pointed out that this had resulted in a serious water-shortage for many interests that had depended on the pond created by the dam for their supply for domestic and other uses.\n\nThe matter was referred to the Water Development Committee for attention, and on Monday, July 11th, an inspection of the dam was made by Messrs. Vallance, Russell and Attwood, the Dominion and Manitoba representatives on the Committee for Manitoba.\n\nFollowing this inspection, the writer was instructed to proceed to Birtle, together with Mr. L. H. Carter, agricultural representative, and Mr. F. A. Dagk, office engineer, for the purpose of making a survey of the dam and securing definite information as to its value in providing a supply of water, particularly to the farming population of the district.\n\nThe party travelled by car to Birtle on July 16th, completed the field inspections on July 18th, and on the latter date returned to Winnipeg. The data secured are contained in this report and that of Mr. Carter, supplemented by the plans attached hereto.\n\nHISTORICAL\n\nThis dam was built about the year 1886 to provide power for operating a small grist-mill and about 1894 was taken over by J. D. McArthur, who installed a saw-mill in place of the grist-mill. Subsequently the spillway portion of the dam was washed out, and it remained in this damaged condition until the year 1931.\n\nIn the latter year the Town of Birtle took over the dam and repaired it, in order to provide a permanent supply of water for the adjacent residents, whose wells and other sources of water were beginning to dry up as a result of deficient precipitation. This work was completed as a relief project at a cost of approximately $2500.00, of which the Dominion contributed $750.00, the Province, $450.00, and the Town, the remainder.\n\nThe dam operated satisfactorily until the spring break-up of this year, when a large mass of ice, borne by the swift current of the flooded stream, was forced against the spillway portion of the dam and carried part of it away. The gap so made was enlarged by the flowing water, and finally included the greater portion of the spillway. As a result of this damage, the river has now dropped to a low level, and the dam has entirely lost its effectiveness in providing a permanent pond as a source of water-supply.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF DAM\n\nThe site of the dam is at the head of a former small rapid, one-half mile west of the town of Birtle. At this point the left bank of the river is high and rises steeply from the water's edge, whereas the right...\nbank rises only two or three feet to a broad flat that extends for about three hundred feet northerly before commencing to rise gradually toward the main steep bank of the valley.\n\nThe dam is 410 feet long and extends from the south bank across the stream at the head of the rapid and then along the upstream edge of the flat on the northerly side. As reconstructed in 1931, the southerly end for about 100 feet consisted mainly of a low crib seven feet wide, filled with clay gravel and boulders and sheeted on the upstream and downstream sides. This crib was faced on the upstream side with a sloping fill of clay, heavily riprapped, and was backed on the downstream side with a fill of boulders.\n\nThe spillway occupied a length of about sixty feet of the crib work portion of the dam, and its crest was about three feet lower than the top of the upstream sheeting on the non-overflow section. Near the south end of the spillway was a fish-ladder, the upper end of which was 0.85 feet below the spillway level.\n\nNorth of the spillway the dam consists of a clay fill about three hundred feet long extending along the flat to the main north bank. This fill has a top width of from twelve to eighteen feet, side slopes of about two horizontal to one vertical, and a maximum height of seven feet above natural ground-level. In 1931 the Town built a concrete coping-wall into the upstream edge of the top of the fill, and also placed riprap along the upper part of the upstream slope.\n\nNear the north end of this embankment is a timber and concrete sluiceway, which formed the intake for the mills that formerly existed at the site. This sluiceway is controlled by a gate at the upper end and has been used from time to time to empty the reservoir. Below the lower end there is a small channel that leads to a bend of the main river downstream.\n\nThe damage done this year was confined to the cribwork portion of the dam, and was so extensive that the only way in which the dam could again be made operative is to replace this section entirely. No damage was done to the clay embankment, but this section had to be protected by sand-bags to prevent over-topping during the flood period, and should be raised about two feet to avoid the possibility of future damage.\n\nThe extent of the pond created by the dam, when operating, was not fully determined, but the water was said to be maintained at a uniform level for a distance of three miles upstream. Between the dam and the westerly border of the town the main body of the pond was one-half mile long, and averaged about four hundred and fifty feet wide. In this section the flats that are now exposed were formerly covered by from four to five feet of water.\n\nThe attached general plan (Plate No. 1), supplemented by the attached photographs, shows details of the dam in its present condition.\n\nINTERESTS DEPENDENT ON DAM\n\nThe attached report by Mr. L. H. Carter, Agricultural Supervisor, sets forth the difficulties that have been experienced by the local farming population in securing a supply of water during the recent dry years, and shows that many of them have been dependent on the pond created by the dam, from which they have hauled...\nwater for domestic use and for their livestock. From the agricultural standpoint, therefore, it is very important that the dam be repaired and a dependable supply of water again made available.\n\nThe situation of the town of Birtle with respect to a water-supply is not so acute as that of the surrounding agricultural area, as the town lies in the lower part of the main river-valley and the wells have not gone dry. The maintenance of the pond above the dam has, however, distinct advantages for the people of the town by providing water for uses other than domestic, including its availability in case of fire.\n\nA minor interest from the economic standpoint, but important in the view of all the local residents, is the value of the pond created by the dam as a recreational asset. The Town, since taking over the dam in 1971, has developed a small park and tourist camp just below the dam, and the pond above has been much used for boating and bathing.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nIn view of the fact that the local agricultural community depends so largely on the Birdtail river as a source of water-supply, and that such a supply can only be made definitely available, particularly during the winter months, by means of ponding the water at such depth that it will not freeze to the bottom, it is recommended that full financial assistance be granted to the Town of Birtle for the repair of the dam.\n\nPROPOSED RECONSTRUCTION\n\nIn order to put the dam in shape to maintain the pond at its former level, the following operations are involved:\n\n1. The site will have to be cleared of the remaining cribwork portion of the existing dam, and a new spillway section constructed as shown in location on Plate No. 1 and in detail on Plate No. 2 attached hereto.\n\n2. The embankment portion of the dam should be raised about two feet (to elevation 101.0, local datum), in order to prevent overtopping during floods.\n\n3. Stop-logs should be provided to secure an added depth of one-foot above the proposed spillway level.\n\n4. A new fish-ladder should be constructed (not shown on plan), at the south end of the spillway.\n\nIn order to carry out this work, the site may be unwatered by placing material removed from the existing damaged structure along the upper edge of the gap through which the water now flows, and excavating a small ditch from the site to the foot of the rapid below. During construction, the flow of the stream can be carried through the existing sluice at the north end of the dam.\n\nESTIMATE OF COST\n\nThe following estimate of the cost of reconstruction\nis based on the use of B.C. fir for the timber portion of the dam, and on the use of boulders, which may be secured locally, for crib-filling and riprap. Unit prices are fairly standard, but may be decreased to some extent, depending on the wages paid for labor and on the accessibility of local materials.\n\nTimber portion of dam in place,\nincluding iron, 36M. f.b.m. @ $65.00/M--$2,470.00\nBoulder fill, 300 cu.yds. @ $1.00 900.00\nEarth fill, 500 cu.yds. @ $.50 250.00\nRiprap, 150 cu.yds. @ $3.00 450.00\nRemoving present structure and unwatering site, 200.00\n\nTotal ----------------- $4,270.00\n\nB. B. HOGARTH\n\nAugust 4, 1936.\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the proposed dam project on Birdtail river at Birtle. It is noted that considerable additional information is necessary before any action can be taken at Ottawa.\n\nWe are enclosing copy of a report by Mr. B. Hogarth, dated August 4th last, together with blue prints that supplies much of the information requested. The writer also discussed with Mr. J. C. Holden, Divisional Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the interests of the Railway Company with respect to the project. The project was also discussed with Mr. A. MacNamara, Deputy Minister, Department of Public Works of the Province of Manitoba, regarding the attitude of the Province. The interests of the Town of Birtle had previously been discussed with the Mayor and one of the aldermen on the occasion of their recent visit to Winnipeg.\n\nMr. Holden stated that the Railway is very anxious that there be an assured water supply at Birtle for their trains, that the Company is now replacing its water tank at that point, that it has contributed towards the maintenance of a dam in the past and is prepared to assist in the carrying out of this project. However, the Company is not prepared to make arrangements with the town itself as regards the reconstruction of the dam, but would prefer to act independently or in co-operation with the Dominion and Provincial Governments.\n\nMr. MacNamara stated that the Province was interested in the project inasmuch as it affects a municipality that is receiving relief assistance and that it had been represented that the reservoir would provide a water supply for many of the farmers in the vicinity who find their wells going dry and are in difficulty as regards water for their stock. However, it did not appear to come within the category of relief projects. He intimated, however, that the Province might contribute 10% of the cost in lieu of the relief that is being granted the Municipality, that the Dominion government might contribute 25% and the Municipality the balance, through assistance from the Canadian Pacific Railway and local interests.\n\nThe Town of Birtle would appear to the greatest beneficiary from the project as proposed. The people of Birtle do not use the river as a source of drinking water but claim that the reservoir does maintain the water level in the wells upon which they depend for their water supply. Undoubtedly the pond created is of major importance in the view of the townspeople because of the recreational features it provides and its attraction for tourists. The Municipality claims it is unable to provide the necessary money to reconstruct the dam without assistance.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs built the Birtle Indian Residential School in 1930, replacing the school that had been\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, OTTAWA.\nin existence there for many years. The school obtains its water supply from the Canadian Pacific Railway and is accordingly dependent upon Birdtail river as its source of supply. The Railway Company is under no obligation to provide a continuous water supply even though the school is charged for the water provided. The water consumption at the school is approximately 6,000 gallons daily for which it pays 21 cents per 1,000 gallons. The rate was reduced from 25 cents, three or four years ago as a result of strong representations made to the Railway Company. I do not know how serious the situation is as regards the probability of the river going dry this winter due to the exceptionally dry summer and autumn and the absence of any storage since the dam was washed away last spring. The Department of Indian Affairs probably are not justified in taking the risk of a water shortage if their assistance will ensure the completion of the dam project.\n\nIt is quite possible that the requirements of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Department of Indian Affairs do not necessitate the extensive pondage provided by the proposed project. However, in view of all the interests involved it would appear advisable to complete the project in accordance with the suggestions outlined in Mr. Hogarth's report. Provision of a fish ladder appears unnecessary and it might be advisable to change the type of construction in view of the dam being constructed under winter conditions.\n\nIn discussing the situation with Mr. Holden, the writer suggested that in lieu of contributing a certain percentage of the cost of the dam, the Company might revise the rates now charged for water supplied the Indian School. A reduction from 21 cents to 18\u00bd cents per thousand gallons was suggested. Mr. Holden thought he could secure the approval of Company officials for such an arrangement, provided the Company would be relieved of maintenance of the dam. It was pointed out to Mr. Holden that I was not authorized to make any such suggestion but was merely getting his views before making such a suggestion to my Director.\n\nThe average monthly water bill paid by the School is now approximately $40.00 or $480.00 per year. The proposed revision would reduce the annual charge to approximately $390.00 and while the annual saving would not accrue directly to the Department of Indian Affairs, yet by adjustments in the grant made to the operators of the School, an indirect saving would be affected. This saving would warrant the Department of Indian Affairs sharing in the cost of the dam project.\n\nThe writer suggested to Mr. MacNamara that in view of the reluctance of the Canadian Pacific Railway to make any arrangements with the Town of Birtle with respect to the dam project, that an equitable arrangement might be for the Department of Indian Affairs in co-operation with the Railway, to contribute 50% of the cost of the project, up to a total cost of $4,000.00 for the project, the Province and Municipality to contribute the other 50%; one condition being that the Municipality seek no assistance from the Canadian Pacific Railway. Mr. MacNamara stated that he thought such an arrangement would ensure completion of the project. Of course it was pointed out to him that the writer had no authority to make any such arrangement but was merely ascertaining the Province's reaction to the suggestion before forwarding it to Ottawa.\n\nThe matter of control of the dam upon completion was taken up with Mr. Attwood. It was pointed out that in view of the reservoir being the source of water supply for human consumption at\nthe Indian School that the Department of Indian Affairs would require some control over the regulation. It was finally decided that if the project be undertaken, the Provincial Department of Health would be asked to declare the area surrounding the reservoir, a sanitary district and exercise control to safeguard the water supply.\n\nThe question of the actual construction of the dam was not discussed but it appears reasonable to assume that the Provincial Department of Public Works would accept responsibility for supervision, employing local labor from relief rolls, insofar as it is available.\n\nThe writer expects to hear within a day or so from Mr. Holden as to the views of the Canadian Pacific Railway. I appreciate the fact that I have had no authority to go as far as I have regarding suggestions made to Mr. Holden, Mr. MacNemara and Mr. Attwood. However, as pointed out in the final paragraph of your letter, prompt action on the part of all concerned is essential if the dam is to be built this year and I believe if arrangements can be completed in accordance with my suggestions, it will provide an equitable distribution of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\nDecember 3rd, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 21st with reference to the proposed dam across Birdtail creek at Birtle, Manitoba, I enclose herewith a letter from Mr. Gow, dated November 27th, which describes the general situation with respect to the proposal for re-building the dam and the interests affected thereby. Mr. Gow also makes certain suggestions as to how the cost might be allocated between the interests affected. With respect to the Canadian Pacific Railway you will note that Mr. Gow expects to obtain further information as to their views on the matter.\n\nAttached to Mr. Gow's letter there is a copy of a report by Mr. B.B. Hogarth, dated August 4th, 1936, which gives the history of the existing dam and the estimated cost of the reconstruction amounting to $4,270.00. This report was prepared for the information of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Committee. We had already obtained a copy of this report from Dr. E.S. Hopkins, Acting Director of the Central Experimental Farm. Dr. Hopkins explained that this report was of a confidential nature but when he was informed that a copy of it had been received from Mr. Gow as a part of his own report on the subject, he stated that there was no objection to its being transmitted to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWith respect to this report Dr. Hopkins states:\n\n\"I may say that the attitude of our Department in this matter has been that since Birtle is scarcely in the real drought area and since the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Vote was to be specifically confined to the drought area, we could not undertake this project.\"\n\nWith respect to the various suggestions made by Mr. Gow in his letter as to the manner in which the cost might be allocated between the interests affected, I should be glad to know if you would like us to secure further information.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Copy of this letter is enclosed for your information.\nAs you are no doubt aware no funds have been specially provided to cover this grant, it being expected that the work would be performed and paid for from last year's appropriation, and it will therefore be necessary to obtain the approval of the Acting Minister to charge the amount involved to the Special Supplementary Estimates, Vote 321.\n\nUpon receipt of the approval of the Acting Minister and statement from the Town of Birkin as to the actual expenditure a Memorandum to Council will be prepared requesting the necessary authority to make this grant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 23rd, 1937.\n\nT.R.L.

The Company is under no obligation to provide a continuous supply even though the school is charged for the water provided. In the event of a shortage of water in the river, therefore, the school would doubtless suffer. The construction of the dam referred to is therefore of vital interest to the school, and for this reason the department would be justified in making the contribution agreed upon last December.\n\nA memorandum to Council has been prepared asking for the necessary authority to make this grant to the Town of Birtle, who, as stated in memo of June 17th carried out the work.\n\nYou will note in the correspondence and statements attached to the memo to Council that the Engineers of the Province of Manitoba have stated that the dam has been built in a very satisfactory manner and in accordance with the plans furnished by the Dept. of Public Works and Labour of the aforesaid province.\nIndian Affairs.

Will you kindly take up with them this matter on the basis that they will benefit from the construction of the dam without making a contribution, and advise the department as soon as possible what decision has been arrived at.\n\nThis information is necessary before making a submission to Council asking for authority to make the grant agreed upon last year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-9, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nJuly 8, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memoranda of June 23rd and July 5th with attached letter and enclosures from the Deputy Minister of the Department of Public Works and Labour of the Province of Manitoba, regarding the construction of the dam over the Birdtail River at Birtle, Man., I would refer you to my memorandum of the 17th of June.\n\nI might supplement this report by advising that the Birtle Indian Residential School, constructed in 1930, obtains its water supply from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and is accordingly dependent on the Birdtail River as its source of supply. The Company, I understand, is under no obligation to provide a continuous supply even though the school is charged for the water provided. In the event of shortage of water in the river, the school would doubtless suffer. The construction of the dam referred to is, therefore, of vital interest to the school.\n\nMr. Gow, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, furnished a report on this dam in November last, in which he suggested that in the event of the C.P.R. not contributing towards the construction or future maintenance of the dam they might revise the rates charged the school for water. Mr. Gow has been asked to take up the matter with the Company on the basis that they will derive benefit from the construction of the dam without making a contribution.\n\nOn receipt of Mr. Gow's report I shall furnish a further report on this matter.\n\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of July 8th with further reference to the matter of the construction of the dam over the Birdtail Creek at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nI am advised by Mr. MacInnes that the affidavit supporting the statement of the expenditures and also the detailed statement in connection with the expenditure, are not now available in his office - the originals having been forwarded to you and no copies were kept at Winnipeg. As these are the only two items of importance, I would point out that I have not been able to check on the same.\n\nI discussed with Mr. Holden, District Engineer, Canadian Pacific Railway, the matter of revision of the water rates now charged the Indian School at Birtle. Mr. Holden informed me that the Canadian Pacific Railway have contributed towards the cost of the construction of the dam. The contribution was in the nature of material, such as cement and lumber and the approximate cost of the same would be about $600.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that they had made a contribution towards the construction of the dam, Mr. Holden did not believe that his superiors would now be willing to consider a revision of the water rates. However, he would discuss the matter with his senior officers and advise me later whether anything could be done.\n\nNo doubt the Municipal Authorities at Birtle have included in the total cost of the dam, the value of the material received from the Canadian Pacific Railway and it is questionable whether or not the Dominion Government should be requested to pay 25% of the cost of such contribution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nReferring to your memorandum of the 8th instant, your file 106-1-9, in reference to the dam which was constructed at Birtle, Manitoba, Mr. Pratt forwarded to you a statement showing the total cost of the dam and the request from the Province for a cheque for the amount of the Department's contribution. In your memorandum you stated that Mr. Gow was taking the matter up with the C.F.R. for the purpose of ascertaining whether a revision of the rates might not be secured. This, of course, has nothing to do with the payment of our share of the cost. Will you please make the necessary arrangements to obtain the authority for the payment of our share.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nSecretary.\nJuly 26, 1937.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT in December last the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, agreed to contribute one-fourth of the cost of the construction of a dam over the Birdtail River, at Birtle, Manitoba, up to an amount of $1,000.00.\n\nTHAT the construction of the said dam is particularly advantageous to this department as the Birtle Indian Residential School obtains its water supply from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and is accordingly dependent on the Birdtail River as its source of supply.\n\nTHAT the department would not be justified in taking the risk of a water shortage at this school, and it is deemed advisable, in view of the circumstances, to contribute towards the cost of the construction of the aforementioned dam.\n\nTHAT the construction of the said dam has been completed by the Town of Birtle at a total cost of $3,600.45.\n\nTHAT funds are available in the Special Supplementary Estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, of the Department of Mines and Resources under Vote 381, 1937-38.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that a grant of $900.00, being one-fourth of the cost, be now made to the Town of Birtle, as this department's share of the cost of the construction of the said dam.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nJuly 26, 1937.\n\nPrecis of Memorandum to Council,-\n\nRequesting authority for payment to the Town of Birtle of one-fourth of the

She has two brothers, Bernard and Basil, still living on that Reserve. Miss Menitoken met a man by the name of Lafontaine, to whom she was legally married. They lived together only for a few months. Lafontaine was either a white man or a half-breed. He was not an Indian and was not a member of any Band.\n\nAfter separating from Lafontaine, she ran wild for a few years, and then went to live with Isadore Ledoux, with whom she has lived the greater part of the time since, and, I am informed, is living with him today.\n\nThe mother of these children has not lived on the Reserve since marrying Lafontaine, and had no children prior to her marriage. Isadore Ledoux is a member of the Muskeg Lake Band, but has not lived on the Reserve for years. He was legally married to a Miss Lafonde, who left him owing to family difficulties and is, I understand, living with his brother on Muskeg Lake Reserve.\n\nThe mother, I believe, is and always has been an R.C. The father was an R.C. and tried last Fall to have his children admitted to the R.C. School at Duck Lake, but was refused by the Principal on the grounds that the children were not eligible. Ledoux, I understand, now claims he has been a Presbyterian for the last two years.\n\nI have delayed replying to this letter in order to interview Mr. Bell, Clerk, Battleford Agency, who was formerly in the Carlton Agency, and knew all about these people.

Their mother is and always has been a Roman Catholic. Ledoux, who claims to be the father of the children, has always been considered a Roman Catholic, although he claims he became a Presbyterian two years ago. Last Fall, however, he attempted to have these children admitted to the Roman Catholic School at Duck Lake, which action inclines me to believe that he is only changing his religion for the purpose of getting the children into an Indian School.\n\nIf my understanding is correct that illegitimate children belong to the mother and take her religion, then these children are without question Roman Catholics. If, on the other hand, the father's wishes are to receive consideration, I feel that we would not be justified in accepting his statement that he became a Presbyterian two years ago, due to the fact that last Fall he applied to have these children admitted to a Roman Catholic School.\n\nI would therefore recommend that if these children are admitted, it be under Roman Catholic denomination.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Recently the following information was received from Inspector Robertson:\n\n\"They are illegitimate. Their mother is and always has been a Roman Catholic. Ledoux, who claims to be the father of the children, has always been considered a Roman Catholic, although he claims he became a Presbyterian two years ago. Last fall, however, he attempted to have these children admitted to the Roman Catholic School at Duck Lake, which action inclines me to believe that he is only changing his religion for the purpose of getting the children into an Indian School.\n\n\"If my understanding is correct that illegitimate children belong to the mother and take her religion, then these children are without question Roman Catholics.

E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal, Birtle Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\n\"I would therefore recommend that if these children are admitted, it be under Roman Catholic denomination.\"\n\nThe Department concurs in the conclusion reached by Doctor Robertson and if the children are at present in the Birtle School they should be returned at once to their father or transferred to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI feel certain that you will immediately comply with our instructions in regard to these children.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. McGookin,\nActing Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nCharlie Shingoose No.207 of the Waywayseecappo Band desires to have his daughter Violet transferred from the Birtle Residential School to a Roman Catholic School, as the girl has now been baptized a Roman Catholic. Shingoose was a Presbyterian but now states that he does not belong to any denomination. His wife is a Roman Catholic.\n\nAs the girl Violet is now 14 years of age, I am of the opinion that it is not worth while transferring her, as in two years she can be discharged.\n\nI expect that similar cases will come to our attention in the near future, and I would like to have your direction in the matter. Several pupils in the Birtle School have been baptized Roman Catholics though the parents signed themselves as Presbyterians on the application for admission forms. It is possible that they did so because the Birtle School is much nearer to the Reserves than the Roman Catholic Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

CASE)\n\n19-5-39.\n\n1. Relative to the above I have to report at 11:15 P.M. this date I received a phone call from Mr. Lochart, Superintendent of the Birtle Indian Residential School, to the effect that the above named Indian boy had run away from the school on the evening of 18-5-39. Mr. Lochart informed me that Mr. J.G. Hough, Boys Superintendent of the School had been out around the country looking for him and could not find him. Mr. Lochart also stated that this boy came from the Waynaysegoop Reserve. I.R. Speers was informed and as there was a Pow-Wow this night at the home of this boy's mother on the Reserve, he thought that the boy might be there and could be caught. Mr. Lochart informed me that he had communicated with Rossburn Det. and was informed that Capt. Speers was away on other duties at this time. Arrangements were made to meet Mr. J.G. Hough at Angusville when he would show me the way to the home of Mrs. Mentuk on the Reserve.\n\n2. At 11:30 P.M., same date, I patrolled from Russell to Angusville, via R.C.1663, where I met Mr. J.G. Hough, and some other Indian boys from the Birtle School, and together we patrolled to the Waynaysegoop Reserve. While driving through the reserve to the home of Mrs. Mentuk, and while we came to the home of Young Shingoose, it was observed that the Pow-Wow was being held at this home. On entering the home of Shingoose where the Pow-Wow was in progress, and from enquiries made I was reliably informed that the above named boy had been at the Pow-Wow, and had left about fifteen minutes previous to our arrival.\n\n3. We continued to the home of Mrs. Mentuk and found that the house was padlocked. We continued around other homes where we thought this boy might be located, but without results.\n\n4. It was quite obvious to the writer that this boy on seeing the car coming, ran out into the bush and hid until our departure, and would remain on the alert for the remainder of the night.\n\n5. Return patrol was made to Angusville where Mr. J.G. Hough and the Indian boys transferred to their own car, and the writer returned to Russell, arriving at det. at 3:15 A.M. 20-5-39. Mr. Hough is returning to the home of the above named boy in the early hours of 22-5-39, when it is thought that he will be at home and asleep. He is arranging with Capt. Speers to accompany him on this trip.\n\n6. In view of the above this file will be considered closed at this det. and handed over to det. concerned.\n\n7.

The staff made enquiries regarding the boys and were informed by other pupils that the boys said they were going to Regina Fair which was on that week. Mr. Lockhart, the Principal, was on holiday, so I telephoned to the R.C.M.P. at Russell and also at Regina, giving them a description of the boys and asking them to look for them. I also informed Mr. Ostrander, the Indian Agent at Kamsack, of the boys' disappearance, and asked him to let us know if they turned up on the Keesekoose Reserve.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. have since broadcast a description of the boys from Regina by radio, and have asked all detachments to be on the look-out for them, but so far no trace of the boys has been found.\n\nDuring the last two weeks in June the boys were at Portage La Prairie Fair, Dauphin Fair, and Yorkton Fair with a member of the school staff, exhibiting School horses, and I suppose they enjoyed these Fairs so much that they also wanted to see Regina Exhibition.\n\nI do not know of anything else we can do to locate the boys.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

If this statement is correct why did Tanner sign an application on April 14, 1938, for the admission of his son, Nelson Tanner, to the Birtle school. At that time Tanner stated he was a Presbyterian.\n\nYou approved this application. Were you not aware at that time if all the statements made by Tanner on the application form were correct?\n\nPlease make immediate inquiries with a view to determining for what length of time Tanner has been recognized as a member of the Roman Catholic Church. On receipt of your reply, giving this information and explaining why you approved the original application for the admission of one of Tanner's children to the Birtle school, the request that we have recently received will have further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn August 8th I wrote to you regarding the children of Francis Tanner No.242 of the Waywayseecappo Band who are now pupils of the Birtle Residential School. Tanner desired to have them placed in a Roman Catholic School as he did not wish to have brought up under Presbyterian auspices. So far I have not had a reply from you.\n\nAs you have approved of the discharge of pupils under similar circumstances recently, I am having these children remain at home until I have your decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\n\nBirtle, Man., Sept. 21, 1939.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWill you please note the following - Jean Mecas 0331 was admitted to the Birtle Indian Residential School on Sept. 4th, 1934. The age given was \"10 years on 2nd of December 1933\". The application bears her father's name, Donald Mecas. He gave as his religion \"Presbyterian\".\n\nI received word through your Agent, Mr. A.G. Smith, on May 6th, 1939, as follows: \"I have to advise you that the Department approves of the discharge at the end of the current academic year of 0331 Jean Mecas\". This came as a surprise to me, knowing that Jean had not reached the age of sixteen years, and also that she had been so short a time in school.\n\nMr. Smith informed me that Donald Mecas, being a Catholic, did not wish Jean to remain any longer in a Protestant School and that he was having her transferred to a Catholic School to be there for one year with no per capita grant. Jean asked for admission into the Presbyterian Church as a member in full communion. No persuasion was used. She was not even personally asked by any one of our Staff. She made the approach herself, and then having satisfied myself as to her sincerity she was duly received. She is now on the Reserve with her grandparents, who are protestants and who cared for her for some years before her admission to our School, and with whom she spent her holidays from year to year. She says she will not go to a Catholic School and that she will not be a Catholic.\n\nI would like to respectfully ask of you - Do you not think that I entrusted with the care and training of this girl should have a chance to express myself before action were taken for a removal of this kind?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned - E.H. Lockhart.\nOttawa, September 28, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nDr. Johnston has passed on to me a letter addressed by you to the Department, dated Birtle, Manitoba, September 21, 1939.\n\nIn this letter you express surprise that a pupil, named Jean Mecas, enrolled at your school, was discharged with departmental approval at the end of the last academic year.\n\nThe records here indicate that this action was taken in response to a request contained in a letter received by the Department from Indian Agent A. G. Smith and dated Birtle, Man., April 28, 1939. In this letter the Indian Agent states:\n\n\"Donald Mecas, No. 223 of the Waywaysecongo Band, does not wish the education of his child to be continued under Protestant auspices. This man is a Roman Catholic. His daughter is Jean Mecas, Register No. 0631, age 15 years, at present a pupil in the Birtle Residential School\".\n\nIn view of a number of disputes that had arisen in respect to the religious status of Indian pupils and particularly certain Indian pupils in attendance at Indian residential schools, the Department of Indian Affairs secured from the Department of Justice a ruling in respect to the matter, on the 23rd day of December, 1922.\n\nThis ruling, in part, reads as follows:\n\n\"A Protestant child is one born of Protestant parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices. A Roman Catholic child is one born of Catholic parents or one whose father or widowed mother has decided to have him or her educated in a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices\".\n\nThe records here indicate that this ruling was submitted to representatives of all the churches cooperating with the Department of Indian Affairs in educational effort at that time and was accepted by them as fair and reasonable in view of all the circumstances. It is just possible, however, that you may not have received a copy of this ruling.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa, September 29, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Johnston:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent forward to Rev. E. H. Lockhart, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Dr. Robert Johnston,\n197 Carling Avenue,\nOttawa.\nBirtle Manitoba\n25th September 1939\n\nSEP 28 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter No.106-1-10 of September 13th, with reference to the request of Francis Tanner of the Waywayseecappo Band to have his children removed from the Birtle School and placed in a Roman Catholic School.\n\nFrancis Tanner states that he always has been a Roman Catholic. This may be true though both Tanner and his wife were pupils in the Birtle School years ago. Tanner states that he did not know that he gave his religion as Presbyterian in the application for admission form, but I do not believe that statement, as he desired to have his children in the nearest school to the Reserve, and on that account gave his religion as Presbyterian.\n\nSince the Roman Catholics built a church on the Waywayseecappo Reserve two years ago, several Indians who passed as Presbyterians are now Roman Catholics.\n\nMany years ago the Roman Catholics had a church on this Reserve, then for years they had no regular services, with the result that some of the original Roman Catholics became recognised as Presbyterians, now many of these people are returning to their original faith, with the result that we really do not know what religion they belong to, and in some cases they do not know themselves.\n\nAbout a month ago a Roman Catholic woman was baptized as a Presbyterian, maybe as a matter of convenience to get her child into the Birtle School, or she may be quite genuine in her desire to become a Presbyterian. The child will be a pupil in Birtle School, and I could certainly not refuse to sign the application on the grounds that the Mother was a Roman Catholic before becoming a Presbyterian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith, Indian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 25th ultimo to the effect that Francis Tanner is now recognized as a Roman Catholic the Department approves the discharge of his children from the Birtle Indian residential school.\n\nPlease let me know the name of the Indian woman to whom you refer in the last paragraph of your letter. Has an application for the admission of her children to the Birtle residential school been forwarded for our consideration? In such cases you should always supply complete information. In other words the report contained in the last paragraph of your letter of September 25 should have been forwarded to the Department when the application form was sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

His father, James Bone, gave Maurice's age as seven years. The Baptismal Records say he was born June 25, 1924. He was therefore fifteen years old on July 25, 1939. His state of education at the time of entrance was illiterate. During his eight years in school, he has been in accordance with the regulations of the Department, attended classes, and attended classes during the school year. His parents have not returned him to school since the holiday season. They want him discharged.\n\nI cannot see any reason why Maurice should not be in school until he is sixteen years of age. His parents have no need of him at home for their support.\n\nYour Agent, Mr. A. J. Smith, has told me that I am not aware that Maurice or his family have been absent from the Reserve for several days, and that during that time four draft horses, given to them by yourself, were turned loose on the Reserve and fell harness locked up. I put this at a time when the horses should have been at work.\n\nMay I hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. H. Lockhart\nBirtle Manitoba\n27th October 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from the Rev. E.H. Lockhart regarding Maurice Bone, a pupil in the Birtle Residential School from the Keeseekowenin Reserve.\n\nThe parents of this boy are very reluctant to let him return to school, owing to some trifling trouble the boy's mother had with Mrs. Lockhart, the Matron of the School, when she last visited there. James Bone, the boy's father, is fairly industrious, and Mrs. Bone is a splendid worker; in fact, the family is the best we have on the Keeseekowenin Reserve at the present time. This boy is their only child, and they are naturally anxious to have him at home, especially as they have some cattle which will give him some work to do. Under the circumstances I do not think it advisable to bring the boy back by force, and therefore recommend his discharge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

In view of the information contained in your letter the Department does not consider that it would be advisable to force the boy to return to the Birtle school at the present time. On the other hand I am inclined to feel that it would be preferable not to formally discharge him. Possibly within a short time the parents will return him to the school of their own free will.

LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man., Nov 16, 1939\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that according to the Indian Act all Indian children are to receive school education from ages seven to sixteen years, and that a reason or reasons is desired by you for retaining a pupil for a longer period.\n\nSarah Lynn 0284 is now 17 years of age. She was 9 yrs old when she entered school eight years ago. She is therefore one year short of the regular period of education. Both her parents are both deceased.\n\nIsabel Dreamer 0304 wants to become a deaconess or nurse. She also has no home to go to.\n\nIrene Blackbird 0296 has had eight years in school and is therefore one year short of the regular period. Her ambition is to become a deaconess or nurse.\n\nDora Bird 0317 is entered in my last report as secretary. She is most emphatic in her statement that she wishes to go to Reserve as soon as possible.\n\nWillie Westgate 240 has had eight years in school. He is therefore one year short of the regular period. He does not want to go to Reserve at this time. He would like to work in an automobile factory when he leaves school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man.\n\nI urgently request that all these pupils be continued in school.\nIt is a great pity that any of their children\u2014boys or girls\u2014go at the tender age of sixteen years into the environment of the reserve, scores and scores of visitors to our Indian Residential schools say what a pity they ever go back to that life on the Reserve.\nCan you not get a happy Lord (you will understand what I mean) for each Reserve and develop an industry or Industrial farming etc., where Indians will be employed at certain wages and under certain definite conditions of living? They would often do many times as much work as they are now doing and Satan who finds the work for idle hands to do might begin to breed bankruptcy in his business.\nIndians have cut and sold wood to me, and I know that if I were given a market to them and you gave them their right of it they would very soon strip the Reserve of all timber. Knowing that they would get less price per cord as soon as cut as the remainder when they had delivered the wood to me.\nAnd remember that wood-cutting is one of the hardest kind of manual labor of the present day.\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nREV. E. H. LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nBIRTLE, Man.\n\nIn this connection I would also mention the fact that your agent, Mr. Smith & Nicholson had Indians at work where they were blasted with lead from head to foot at the States' Fair. If the school had only been managed by six employees quit before the work was ended. And he, I believe, went home to cut and start his.\n\nAs one deeply interested in the follow-up of the boys and girls who have been under our care in the school and also in all Indians as I see them, I now wish to respectfully give you a little of what is my kind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This boy attended Sandy Bay School for about a year, but his Father, who was formerly a Roman Catholic, was baptized as a Presbyterian, and did not desire the boy to be brought up under Roman Catholic auspices; hence the boy was discharged from the Sandy Bay School as authorized by your letter No. 126-9-10 of Oct. 8th 1938.

In October of the past year, I am advised by the Rev. Lockhart that Alex was baptized by him and became a member of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Crump, the missionary on the reserve is not a fully ordained minister. Therefore, the Rev. E. H. Lockhart supervises Mr. Crump's work and administers certain rites of the Church. The statement was prepared at the school and signed in the presence of Mr. Crump and Mary Begg, after which Alex was baptized by Mr. Lockhart.\n\nUnfortunately, there is great rivalry on this reserve between the Presbyterian missionary and Father Comeau, with the result that many of the Indians do not know from day to day which Church they belong to.\n\nI can only add that, in my opinion, a child should be raised in the same faith as its parents. I think we must recognize the decision of the parents and, in this case, the father has taken his stand as a Presbyterian and has requested that his daughter be transferred from a Roman Catholic School to a Protestant school.

No\nmore will support that idea strongly.\nYou will understand that when confronted with a case\nlike this on a Reserve 445 miles from our school there\nis a temptation to take for granted or at least hope\nthat your Department will approve and therefore\nto avoid another round trip of 930 miles.\nThere been urging that the morals of your Department\nbe better in regular town life may appeal for children,\nand I have decided that I shall not bring another from\nsuch a distant Reserve without all doubt removed as\nto your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.H.

Gordon is now in London, England. Frank is an ex-pupil at home. Walter Lloyd and Helen are in school. Mrs. Johnston has an illegitimate child, Lorna, here duly enrolled.\n\nI made a special trip to St. Thomas to get children whom I could not bring at the end of August because of whopping cough. Mrs. Johnston has another illegitimate girl, Wilda. She was quite urgent that I take her. The missionary and teacher at the day school, Redwood, supported the idea. I did not yield to the persuasion until Mrs. Johnston informed Redwood and myself that the father of Wilda is in Gregg. Any return Wilda's mother or will you approve of her admission? I hope you will do so. I am very interested in her and know that she is being much better.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant the Department is prepared to consider the admission of Hilda Johnston to the Birtle Residential School.

Prince,\nIn Charge Indian Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\nWaywaysseecappo Reserve,\nBox 346, Rossburn, Man.,\nMarch 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI trust you will forgive me for writing to you today, but this is an opportunity of getting a letter away to you quickly.\n\nThe business is concerning a boy, Kenneth Campbell Mentuck, of the above Reserve. The father is Roderick Mentuck, an adherent of the Presbyterian Church. The boy is baptised into our Church by Rev. E. H. Lockhart. The mother of the boy is R. C., although she came forward for baptism and was baptised in Birtle by Rev. E. H. Lockhart on August 21, 1934. She is dominated by her father and mother who are R.C. and I suppose it is these people who demand that she send her boy to a school other than Birtle, and I expect that means a R. C. school.\n\nI wish you would take this matter up with the Indian Dept. particularly the agent Mr. A. G. Smith at Birtle, Man. Roderick Mentuck is greatly worried by the threat of his wife, who at present is away from here and visiting with her parents at Valley River Reserve, Man. Mrs. R. Mentuck her threatened to put her boy in school by March 15, 1941. So there is no time to be lost. Roderick Mentuck wishes his boy to be put in Birtle Indian School right away.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nH. Crump\n12th March 1941\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am sending you the enclosed letter.\n\nPerhaps you could give me some information, in due course, on the matter mentioned therein.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRobert Johnston.\nOttawa, March 13, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDr. Johnston has sent forward to me your letter addressed to him of March 8, 1941. It is noted that in this letter you express the opinion that Kenneth Campbell Mentuck, of the Waywayssecappo Reserve, should not be sent to a school conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI regret to state that it is impossible for me to express an opinion with respect to the religious status of this boy until I have secured additional information. I am anxious to know if Roderick Mentuck and his wife are living together at the present time or if they have separated. If they have separated, has Mrs. Mentuck been given custody of the children? I should like to know also the age of this boy and if he has in the past been enrolled at an Indian day or residential school.\n\nI feel confident that you are reasonably familiar with the procedure followed in the enrolment of pupils at an Indian residential school. Forms for this purpose are provided by the Department. These forms are signed by the father of the child, if living, and by the mother or legal guardian if the father is dead. If, as you state, Roderick Mentuck is anxious to have his boy enrolled at the Birtle Residential School, he should apply to the agent for an enrolment form.\n\nMr. H. Crump,\nWaywayssecappo Reserve,\nBox 346,\nRossburn, Manitoba.\nform, sign this form, which will be signed also by\nthe agent, and sent forward to the Department. If,\non the other hand, he signs a form asking that his\nboy be enrolled at a Roman Catholic School, it is\nexceedingly difficult for the Department to refuse\nhis request. In other words, the Department is\nlargely guided by the wishes of the parent in\nsuch cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, March 13, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Johnston:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter directed by me to the Reverend H. Crump, Missionary on the Waywayseecappo Reserve, Manitoba. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn response to your request, I am returning herewith Mr. Crump's communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

I do not want them to be sent home for their own safety and in the interest of our school. They exert influence on the others.\n\n031 Violet Shannacq. I recommend her discharge on August 31st.\n\n032 Irene Wilson. This girl is deaf and dumb. She is getting along well on her own. She has a hearing aid. She will be discharged when she can take care of herself. She is doing well in school.\n\n037 Clara Bird. This girl is now doing well in school. I do not know the attitude of her parents or whether she remains living here. I would like to see her again soon.\n\n034 Edith Brandon. I would like the privilege of writing you again. I am learning patience and help requests. She has a stepfather. She does not want to go home.\n\n038 Isabel Dyer. This girl has not a lot of money to go to school. Her mother lives off welfare. She should be allowed to stay. Isabel has not had the opportunity to learn in school.\n263. After Johnston and 283 Kenneth etc are a very influence on the other boys. They are now doing good work. A great change has come over Kenneth within two year. He has certainly wakened up. I would urge their continuance in School.\n\n278. George Brewer. I recommend his discharge by this date August 31st.\n\n290 Gordon L Bone was a delicate boy and in consequence was admitted May 2nd 1934 and has been here only five years.

Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nBirtle Man.\n\nNovember 17th\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have been very much disturbed about my children, and so had trouble with the Indian agent concerning them.\n\nI understand that if a child is not quite healthy he can not enter School, and if there were healthy, they should go to School when they are old enough.\n\nI have a boy who has been troubled with eczema on his face ever since he was a very small fellow, and I have had three doctors treating him ever since he first had it, but they cannot cure him.\n\nSo as I know how bad it affects him I did not send him.\nSchool in the first place.\n\nBut the Indian agent was after me to send him, and so was the Principal of the School. He said they could easily cure him if he were in school, even after what the doctors had done for him, and that he was to get constant treatment and that he would use the best and mildest soap they could give him.\n\nWell I sent him to school hoping they may be able to cure him; he got a few treatments when he first entered school & then he was even more neglected than he ever was at home.\n\nHe told me even uses scrubbing soap to wash his face except when his mother buys him soap, which he keeps in his pocket.\n\nAnd he has come home for his holidays two summers with his face full of sores. He could\nHardly open his eyes, and his lips was so swollen he can not open his mouth to enjoy a good meal.\n\nWhat was worse he did not have as much as a salve to put on his face, on both times. It would have made me feel better if he had, as we should think they were at least doing something to ease his pain.\n\nThere is a nurse right in the school, and the doctor goes up often but when I sent my girl back to school in August 1940 I told the Principal I wasn't sending the boy back & told him why, well they got the doctor up & we could see that he had never seen the boy's face while in school.\n\nI have another little boy who has not been in school yet. This boy catches cold very easily and so he has had pneumonia.\nThree times already.\n\nI have told the Indian agent all this in a letter before when he told me to put the boys in school.\n\nBut last week he came up to me and said I was to take the boys to school this week.\n\nWell I told him I wouldn't. He asked why, and I had already told him why, and he said he would send the police after them.\n\nI know they have to go to school but they are my children and I want some respect shown to me regarding them.\n\nI shall send the little boy in as soon I am positive that he can take real good care of himself.\n\nI have seen the boys in the school without caps, without shoelaces, snow in their boots, mittens wet & shrunken so.\nsmall they cannot fit, and yet sliding on the hill in winter shivering & faces so blue with cold.\n\nHow can I send my boy there when he wouldn't be watched whether his feet are dry or if he had good mitts & shalocks. For even at home where his mother watches these things closely, he catches colds.\n\nAnd as I said before I shall send him just as soon as he can take care of himself even at his play he shall go to school.\n\nAnd the older boy will be sixteen years old coming May 8th.\n\nIf there is a law in the Indian affairs for policemen to come & take children for their fathers & put them in school I shall be very pleased to know.\n\nAnd if so why doesn't the agent get after the parents of the other children as well as me.\nIt seems to be after my boys more than the other children; he does not help me feed them. I provide for my own family. And I have never used any of the government things to help me along too.\n\nThere were quite a lot of cattle given to this reserve a few years ago and although I have a big family he did not give me one to keep, and gave them to a few with whom he is more friendly than the rest of us; they got from $5 to $10 each.\n\nAnd a short while ago my wife asked if she can keep one cow, as all the children love milk, the agent told her I had no cow barn. A cow barn can be built of logs & plastered good within one week by a single man.\n\nI've almost always had quite a lot of hay & would\nhave to sell most of it anyway.\n\nThe Indian agent does not treat the Indians alike; he has his favorites.\n\nLast winter when flour was given to the Indians, 25 lbs per person, he said he was not giving any to my two boys and he didn't.\n\nI think why he has no use for me & wouldn't treat me good is\u2014when the tractor first started plowing on the reserve Mr Smith told me that any man who clears any land while he would like to farm, he get it plowed for them, so I cleared up a bit of land too in the valley and there was a piece of land along side which I wanted plowed along with my clearing, and they were fencing a cattle pasture & they wanted to fence right through where I wanted my plowing done. So I told not to fence it as I wanted that land.\nWell they didn't fence it, but at the same time I was told I would not get my land plowed. The agent said so himself so I also stopped clearing as I knew I wouldn't get it plowed anyway although I had worked hard week clearing that land.\n\nThey had already a cattle pasture big enough for several hundred cattle, besides there are other places that would make good cattle pasture but not farming.\n\nThe agent has his favorites that is why I hear he'd come upon them, house full of drunk but let's them go & when he found one drunk in town he put him in the car & brought him home.\n\nI suppose if I was a drunke drunkard or a jail bird he'd have some respect for me.\n\nI have never in my life been in jail nor even been in court.\nI've always been a quick man\nI hate to have trouble with the\nIndian agent nor anyone else.\nBut when he said he'd send\nthe policeman after my toys\nI couldn't stand it.\n\nEvery parent's child is dear to\nthem even the birds & beasts.\nSo if he is sending the police\nI am afraid we are going to\nhave more & bigger trouble.\n\nOne thing more\u2014The staff in\nthe school are not always very\nkind to the children, that is why\nthey are always running away from\nthe school; the Indian children\nhave feelings are well as any other.\nSo when mistreated they think\nthey must get away from the un-\nkind people without stopping to\nthink of dangers they might\ncome across on the way.\nI have seen the toys doing\na lot of running away lately.\nI shall be very pleased.\nif you would kindly help me in my troubles.\n\nI should like very much if you could write to me personally and let me know what I should do to keep out of all this trouble. And please tell the agent all I said. He is - A. G. Smith\n\nIndian Agency\nBirtle\nMan.\n\nI am yours truly,\n\nSam. Bolpa\nBirtle\nMan.\nBirtle Manitoba\n1st December 1941\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter No. 106-1-10 of November 24th, has been received, and also the enclosed letter from Sam Bohpa of the Bird Tail Sioux Band to the Department.\n\nThis man does not cause any trouble, but will not send his two boys to school although I have given him every chance to do so. One boy is troubled with eczema and was treated for it at school. As you are no doubt aware this disease is very troublesome, and will break out after it appears to be cured. That is the case with one of his boys. They should not miss the chance of an education however on account of this trouble as it is not infectious. The other boy has had pneumonia two or three times and may not be strong enough to attend school, but that is for the Doctor to say when he examines him. Dr. Edwards the Medical Officer for the school knows the boy well and has treated him for Pneumonia.\n\nDuring Inspector Hamilton's recent visit to that Reserve, he said these boys should be in school, and suggested that I prosecute the Father under Sec. 10 Para. 4 of the Indian Act, if he would not send them, and I intend to do so, unless you instruct me not to.\n\nSam Bohpa is not much of a worker and the children are not very well provided for at home. He is a fair trapper, but will never make a Farmer hence my refusal to break land for him or give him cattle.\n\nRegarding Bohpa's complaint about the clothing that the children wear at school. Two or three years ago I think that he had every right to make that complaint but now the children are clad much better. Your records will show that the school children have been very healthy in recent years, and Pneumonia is much more prevalent on the Reserves than in the school.\n\nBohpa claims that I have favourites on the Reserve. The Indians are of course bound to think that\nas the farming Indians do receive more help than the others in many ways. Bohpa did receive horses and other help from the Department years ago to help him to start farming, but it was a waste of effort, as he would never make a farmer.\n\nI informed Bohpa that his boys would have to attend school, but if he did not desire to send them to Birtle School, I would take the matter up with the Department and see if they could be admitted to Cecilia Jeffrey's School at Kenora. Of course he would not desire to send them so far from home.\n\nDuring the last six years no children in this Agency have been forced to attend school, as I hate to use compulsion. The children do belong to the parents, and as a parent I would strongly object to being forced to send my children to a boarding school by the Government. However due to my leniency there are several children of school age on the Reserve, and unless we take a firm stand in some cases, it will become worse, and it will be hard to obtain sufficient pupils for the schools.\n\nAt present there are more pupils in the Birtle School than they are actually paid grant for, but they are willing to take more in.\n\nI would suggest that you write to Bohpa, informing him that his children have to attend school, if physically fit, according to the provisions of the Indian Act. If that is done I do not think any further compulsion will be necessary.\n\nIn the meantime I will take no further action, until I hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 9, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant with reference to the children of Sam Bohpa of the Bird Tail Sioux Band.\n\nPlease tell this Indian that the Department wishes to have his children of school age examined immediately by the Medical Officer. If he pronounces them physically fit the Department wishes the children placed in the Birtle Residential School at once. In the event of Bohpa not complying with these instructions you are authorized to take necessary action under the compulsory clause of the Indian Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nAnd having seen how the boys are being looked after in winter at the school, I would like to ask you if I can keep my boy through winter anyway.\n\nI know that he's got to go to school and if he was in good perfect health I would never keep him at home & go into all this trouble.\n\nI will put him in school but I am asking if he can stay at home for the winter.\n\nI am asking you again if you would kindly write to me and let me know if there is law to put a man in jail, if he thinks his child is not fit to go to school.\n\nIt's all right for a white child to go to school because he can make a living for himself from what he learns but not so for an Indian, no matter how much he knows he'll never be anything.\nbut a poor man on the Reserve.\nAnd the Indian boy who has not as much education as the one who has been in school since a tiny fellow, is the very one who thinks of earning something & making & having a home.\nBut the boy who has a lot of time in school is the one who is not so smart about having a decent home, but go about using terrible language even in front of little children.\nThis is all for now but I shall be waiting for an reply.\n\nSamuel Boppa\nBirtle\nMan.\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Leo Goodvoice.\n\nThe Leo Goodvoice you have reference to was in attendance at this school for several years and proved to be a very desirable type of lad. He was conscientious about his work, both in the classroom and outside. He applied himself diligently to anything he undertook. He is the type of fellow who, given the opportunity under proper guidance, could go to great lengths as an influence for the betterment of his people.\n\nI would like to see Leo re-instated, if possible at this school for another year or two, as I think he has great promise.\n\nTrusting that this is the information that you desire, and that it will help you to arrive at a decision, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.E. Candy,\nActing-Principal.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that representation was made to this office to the effect that Leo Goodvoice, of the Round Plain Reserve at Prince Albert, was an outstanding pupil and should be sent to the Indian Residential School at Birtle for another two years. This is where he previously attended school.\n\nI now wish to say in this connection that before writing this letter I wrote to the School at Birtle and I am attaching herewith the letter I received in reply. I might say that this boy was discharged from the School last Summer, having reached the age of sixteen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

In view of his age I believe it would not be desirable to have him return to the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nWould it not be possible to have him take advantage of the Youth Training Programme? A recent report from Indian Agent Goderhan indicates that a group of boys from his Agency have enrolled for this training and the results are extremely satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

At 11.45pm of this date a phone call was received at this office from A.SMITH, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba, stating that six juveniles had run away on 29-1-42 from the Lizard Point I.R. near Rosseburn, Man. Among them were two youths from the Lizard Point I.R. near Rosseburn, Man. namely Harry CLOUD, age 16 yrs, and Jimmy MENTUK, age 15 yrs. They had left Birtle in the P.M. of 29-1-42, and were allegedly seen leaving a freight train near Gordon, 29-1-42, at Solsgirth, Manitoba. Mr. SMITH believed that it was likely the youths might have walked from Solsgirth to their homes on the Lizard Point I.R. and would possibly be at home by this time, he requested that their homes be checked this afternoon if possible and to arrest the youths if found and then advise the Agency and they would arrange transportation. The other four youths were from another Reserve but it was thought they might also accompany CLOUD and MENTUK.\n\n2. The writer patrolled per hired livery team and cutter, roads being impassable for police transport to the Lizard Point I.R. and there carefully checked and searched at the homes of Harry CLOUD and Jimmy MENTUK, without result, no damage was done during these searches, and it was with the permission of the parents, further patrol and check of various other relatives failed to reveal any trace of the missing youths, and the patrol checked at the premises of Howard NIELD the overseer and he advised a close watch would be kept for the youths. The patrol returned to detachment at 5.00pm, 30-1-42.\n\n3. On return to detachment and during the absence of the writer, 2/Oct.

McConnell, of Yorkton Det., to the effect that three Indian students had run away from the Indian school at Birtle Manitoba, and the principal was anxious to have them located, and detained. Youths were as follows:\n   Dennis KITCHENOMIA - Aged 17.\n   Ernest KITCHENOMIA - Aged 14.\n   Edward BOE - Aged 16.\n\n2. On receipt of the above information, J.L. BRYANT, Polly Indian Agent was advised, and discreet enquiries were made among reliable Indians, who promised to advise this detachment, should the youths appear on the reserves in this vicinity.\n\n3. At 5:00 PM this date, advice was received from J.L. BRYANT, Indian Agent that the youths had arrived on the Cote Indian Reserve this PM, and were at present located at the home of Mr. KITCHENOMIA, a relative. Advice to this effect was conveyed to A.M. KANEK, Principal of the Birtle Indian school, who requested that the youths be picked up by the police, and detained until train time this late PM, and then placed on the east bound train with single tickets to Roblin, at which point, he would arrange to meet them.\n\n4. The writer with Cst. Fontaine, immediately patrolled via Pol/Car Code 8260 from Kamsack to the Cote Indian reserve, where Ernest KITCHENOMIA and Edward BOE were located at once. Enquiries, concerning Dennis KITCHENOMIA revealed that he had run away at the same time as the rest, but had remained in Saskatoon, with the intention of joining the Prince Albert Volunteers. J.L. BRYANT, Indian Agent provided the writer with two requisitions, to present when obtaining tickets, for the three Indian juveniles, which would cover a seating of forty cents in each case. After making exhaustive enquiries, which indicated that Dennis KITCHENOMIA was not on the reserve, patrol returned to Kamsack at 8:30 PM. The two lads promised to remain on the train, until it reached Roblin, Man., and the writer put them on the east bound train at 9:30 PM, after providing them with single tickets to that point.\n\n5. I might state further in regard to Dennis KITCHENOMIA, as this lad is 17, it appears that little can be done if he does not wish to return to school. His brother Mr. KITCHENOMIA, was contacted, he being a L/Cpl. in the 16-2nd Sask. Horse, presently stationed at Saskatoon, who stated that he would find his brother, and if he did not wish (SEE PAGE TWO)\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\nRe: Dennis KITCHEMONIA et al - Runaway Indian Students\nBirtle Indian School - Birtle Manitoba.\n(ASSISTANCE TO DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES)\n\nDID NOT WISH to return to school, and could be\ntaken into the army, he would consent to his joining\nthe army.

Complaints were few and mostly trivial. The Indians are planting more gardens, and so far prospects for the root crop, which concerns them most, are good. The epidemic of truancy at the Residential School has apparently stopped. In my opinion the many changes in staff during the term was the cause of it. I think they have a good staff at the school now but unfortunately several are leaving at the end of the term.\n\nA.G.

These transfers have a tendency to interrupt their studies and must result in a great deal of perplexity and confusion to the pupils themselves. The recommendation made by you in the second last paragraph of your communication is perhaps the best arrangement we can make in view of all the circumstances. If you could assure us, however, that there is a day school within easy reach of these people the Department is of the opinion that these children should be discharged from the Sandy Bay School and encouraged to attend a day school. If no day school is available, however, your recommendation that the senior pupils be permitted to complete their education at Sandy Bay and that the younger children be enrolled in due course at Birtle is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G.

Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary for the Indians in this district has taken Mary Anne Cook of the Waywayseecappo Band, pupil No. 0376 of the Birtle Residential School, to the Sandy Bay Residential School. The parents desired to have her go to Sandy Bay School, and state that they are Roman Catholics, though when she was admitted to Birtle School the Father was Presbyterian. The Presbyterian Missionary has reported the matter to me.\n\nThis girl has been at home for two years as she had Tuberculosis, but after examination at a Clinic recently, she was pronounced fit for school. No Application for Admission to Sandy Bay School for this girl has come in yet to the office, and I would suggest that the Department refuse to pay grant for her for a time at least.\n\nIn view of your decision regarding the children of Francis Tanner of the same Band, as per your letter No. 126-9-10 of August 31st, we have to take some action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Mary Anne Cook, No. 0376,\nBirtle Residential School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant and to state that the Department cannot, with the limited information at our disposal, authorize the enrolment of the above-noted pupil at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nIt appears that there is, at the present time, a religious war on the Waywayseecappo Reserve and keen competition between those engaged in missionary effort amongst this particular band of Indians. In view of this fact, I think it might be well if you had an understanding with the Principals of the Birtle and Sandy Bay Residential Schools that no pupils would be enrolled at either school, or transferred from one school to the other, without your consent and Departmental approval. In the case of this particular girl, the Principal of the Sandy Bay School should be notified of the Department's decision. My personal opinion is that this girl should be returned to her parents on the reserve until her case is very carefully reviewed by you and until a recommendation in respect to the school at which she should be enrolled is sent forward by you to the Department. This decision should be sent forward to the Principal of the Sandy Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nR.A.

Robert Johnston, D.D.,\n197 Carling Avenue,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Johnston,\n\nRe. children of Francis Tanner, Waywayseecappo Reserve,\nRossburn, Manitoba.\n\nDuring the period of my visit to this Reserve in the month\nof August the missionary arranged for me to have an interview\nwith one of the Indians on the Reserve, Francis Tanner, by\nname. In the course of the interview it developed that he\nand his wife had been Roman Catholics, but that now he wished\nto abjure his faith in that Church and wished to connect him-\nself with the Presbyterian Mission on the Reserve. I had\nquite a lengthy conversation with the Indian and his wife and\ntried to explain to them the characteristic principles of the\nReformed Faith. At the conclusion of our talk he signed an\nadjuration of his faith in the Roman Catholic Church, and in-\ndicated at the same time his desire that his children should\nnow attend the school at Birtle. A copy of this was left\nwith the Indian Agent, at Birtle, with the request that it be\nforwarded to Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from Mr. H. Crump, our mission-\nary on the Reserve, whose letter I laid before the Executive.\nIt would seem from this letter that the Roman Catholics have no\ndifficulty in getting children who had been attending the Birtle\nschool to go to their school if the parents make such a request.\n\nThe missionary told me about this Kathleen Cook. There was no\nother reason for the change, as far as I could learn, but what\nis stated in Mr. Crump's letter; but that was sufficient for her\nto be taken to Sandy Bay School.\n\nI hope you may be able to do something in Ottawa about this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWAC W\nencl.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, September 30, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence relating to the education of the children of one Francis Tanner, of the Waywayseecappo Reserve.\n\nIt is regretted by the officials here that we have to bring this matter to your attention in a period when the time at your disposal must of necessity be somewhat limited. However, the tendency on the part of certain Indian families to transfer their children from a school of one denomination to a school operated under the auspices of another has in our judgment reached somewhat serious proportions. We feel that everything humanly possible should be done to discourage this tendency. It is difficult to think of anything more cruel than the act of taking children from a school where they have become acquainted with their teachers and with their associates and putting them into a school where everything is strange and where the general environment may differ radically from the one to which they have become accustomed.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to visit the Waywayseecappo Reserve and to interview Francis Tanner and his wife. You will note the decision reached by the Department on the recommendation of the Indian Agent, that four of these children be left at Sandy Bay and four be enrolled at Birtle. This decision has been very vigorously challenged by representatives of the Presbyterian Church who called at my office a few days ago. Indeed there is in the church an extreme element who are anxious, even at this date, to make a public issue of the matter. Dr. Johnston and Dr. Cameron appear to be somewhat reasonable, however, and are of the opinion that even at this stage the matter can be settled somewhat amicably. Both these clergymen are very indignant at the enrolment of one, Mary Anne Cook, No. 0378, at the Sandy Bay School, which action, they contend, was taken without the knowledge or consent of the Indian agent. The correspondence relating to this pupil is also sent forward for your guidance.\n\nWe are anxious that you should secure all the evidence that may be available in respect to the religious status of Francis Tanner at this time. Dr. Johnston contends that the Tanners have always been Protestants and that Francis Tanner himself was educated at the Birtle school. His contention is that Tanner has become a Presbyterian as the result of individual research and investigation and is fairly intelligent. We should like to have your comments on these statements. If you are satisfied that the Tanner family have indeed in truth become\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n558 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nPresbyterians, the Department would be disposed to have all the children returned to Birtle. The representatives of the Presbyterian Church are bitterly opposed to the division of the family and stated that under no consideration would they permit the family to remain divided.\n\nI should like to have a report from you, stating to what extent recruiting is permitted on the reserves in the Birtle Agency without the knowledge and consent of the agent. Has it been the practice for representatives of the churches to go on to a reserve and recruit pupils without the consent of the agent or the approval of the Department? The fact that a pupil may be taken into a school as a non-grant-earning pupil does not in my judgment render this practice in any sense more tolerable. I would rather think that Indians, although they are wards of the Government, have still some rights in a nation which at this date is engaged in a war for freedom.\n\nYou are probably aware that the revision of the Indian Act is at the present time under consideration. I am anxious to know if you could, with your experience, suggest amendments to the Act that would help us to correct certain abuses, particularly the interchange of pupils at our residential schools. I have felt for some time, and I am still of the opinion that these disputes cannot be properly decided by a court of competent jurisdiction. I do not consider it fair to the officials here or to our officials in the field that we should be called upon from time to time to decide on the religious status of a particular Indian family. We have seldom at our disposal in these cases the information necessary to reach a sound conclusion. I have promised the representatives of the Presbyterian Church that this investigation would be undertaken and completed by you at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Education of Tanner children, Nawayasgagano Reserve, Birtle Agency\n\nAs requested in your letter dated September 30th, 1942, I investigated carefully concerning this case and would report my findings as follows:\n\nI considered it advisable to interview as well as Francis Tanner and his wife, his two brothers, his sister, and his mother and father. I found Basil Tanner, the father, was raised a Catholic. He claims to have spent about ten years in the Lebret School, and after that one year in the old Regina School. His wife, a Sturgeon, was always a Presbyterian.\n\nThis couple had three sons and a daughter, and all were educated at the Birtle Indian Residential School. The old man claimed he was not concerned as to which religion they accepted but he did want them educated.\n\nThe daughter, Mrs. Eli Bunn, belongs to the United Church of Canada.\n\nJohn Tanner states he is a Presbyterian and was married by the Rev. Mr. Lockhart. His wife stated she was a Roman Catholic; but wanted her daughter educated at Birtle.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Edward Tanner stated they were married by the Priest but about one year ago he and his family joined the Presbyterian Church.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Francis Tanner were married by the Presbyterian minister, Mr. Wilson. As pointed out above, Francis was educated at Birtle and he attended the Presbyterian Church until the Catholic Church was rebuilt about eight years ago. His wife prior to her marriage was a Ben girl from the Bird Tail Sioux Reserve. Her people are Presbyterians.\n\nI understand from Francis and his wife that for two years the visiting Priest tried to get his children for Sandy Bay School. According to Tanner, he was told the children would be better cared for and better educated. Tanner claims that after hearing this for about two years he believed such to be the case; and in order to obtain it for his children he joined the Roman Catholic Church. Now after having his children in the school for some time he finds they are not learning any better - do not receive any better treatment, and above all they are further from home and he cannot see them during the year. In view of this he feels he has made a mistake and so now wants the children back in the Birtle School. As before, he knows he cannot do this and remain a Catholic and so he stated he was finished with the Roman Catholic religion and told the Priest. He has now renewed his connection with the Presbyterian Church. I asked Francis how he could satisfy himself in making changes from one church to another. He answered - \"There is no difference anyway. Mr. Crump and the Priest preach just the same way\", and that his main concern was to get the best for the children.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nNow as to whether the Tanner have now become Presbyterians in sincerity and truth. This, I think, is already answered and in my opinion he did not leave the Presbyterian Faith to join the Catholic Church and later leave the Catholic Faith to join the Presbyterian because of any deep religious convictions; but merely for the purpose of getting his children accepted at the different schools. Even now he states there is no difference and that Mr. Crump and the Priest preach the same. This statement, I am sure, shows how little he truly understands as far as sincere and abiding religious teaching is concerned.\n\nAs to the extent of recruiting on reserves by representatives of different churches, I have already stated what information Tanner gave me; namely, that the Rev. Father carried on his campaign for two years before Tanner finally consented. We have no way of knowing what any minister or clergyman talks about when visiting on the reserves. He may be teaching religion, or recruiting for some school, or both; and no doubt both might be quite proper if the clergy would confine themselves to members of their own congregation or to Indians who do not claim allegiance to any faith.\n\nNow as to suggestions re the revision of the Indian Act to overcome difficulties similar to the one in question; I would suggest the application forms now in use be changed and made a more solemn document. The question of Religion should be at least a Declaration, not merely a statement, and it should be declared before the Indian Agent and the Clergyman concerned; and once this declaration is made, and a pupil accepted into a school, it should remain in that school until the final discharge is granted.\n\nAgain, no pupil should be accepted into any school prior to approval by Ottawa. No principal nor anyone working for a school should be allowed to take children from a reserve unless the arrangements set down above have been carefully followed.\n\nIn closing I may say that in view of the fact that Tanner was educated at Birtle as was also his wife, and also that now he has returned to the teaching he followed while there, I have no doubt he is as much a Presbyterian as anything. He definitely stated he was finished with the Catholic religion and would not again consent to allowing his children to attend a catholic school.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa, October 16, 1942.\n\nRe: Education of Tanner children\n\nDear Doctor Johnston:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter written by me to Inspector Hamilton. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend Robert Johnston, D.D.,\n197 Carling Avenue,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 16, 1942.\n\nRe: Education of Tanner children\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that it is our intention, just as soon as the time at our disposal will enable us to do so, to investigate very carefully and very thoroughly the procedure not followed in recruiting Indian pupils for enrolment at residential schools.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, it would seem advisable to have the Tanner children, for the time being at least, enrolled at the Birtle Residential School. Francis Tanner, however, should be definitely informed by the Indian agent that it is not the intention of the Department to transfer his children, periodically, from one residential school to another. Such transfers must of necessity result in a great deal of confusion and bewilderment to the helpless pupils and result, as well, in a great deal of bitterness and misunderstanding amongst missionaries engaged in missionary effort on the Waywayseecappo Reserve.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Indian Agent Smith, for his information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n556 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nCOPY SENT TO MR. A. G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1945.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the R.C.M.P. with reference to the theft of a bicycle by Lloyd Johnston, a pupil of the Birtle Indian Residential School. It appears that this boy was in town as late as 10 o'clock at night on May 25 and at that time he stole a bicycle. The police report further indicates that he took the bicycle to the Birtle School and apparently several of the boys rode the bicycle around the school grounds during the afternoon of Sunday, May 25. Eventually the owner of the bicycle recognized it and laid a complaint with the police.\n\nThis report is rather disturbing for two reasons:\n\n1. It seems inadvisable to allow school pupils to be in town unattended at such a late hour in the evening.\n\n2. It is difficult to understand how Lloyd Johnston and the other boys could ride the bicycle around the school grounds on Sunday afternoon without some member of the staff observing them and questioning them regarding the manner in which they came into possession of the machine.\n\nI should appreciate your communicating with the Principal regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss J.

He states that they have graduates from Brandon School in the Air Force, and that many of the graduates learn to operate tractors, which is not the case in the Birtle school.\n\nI do not know much about the Brandon school, but I imagine that both are operated along the same line, and that the curriculum is similar. If we allow this transfer others will probably wish to do the same. One woman on this Reserve has a girl in Brandon school and I think it likely that she is the cause of the dissatisfaction.\n\nThe chief complaint about the Birtle school on all the Reserves is that the parents cannot visit the school during the winter months as they are not allowed to sleep in the school.\n\nBlackbird wrote to Mr Hamilton requesting the transfer and I have talked the matter over with him. Blackbird refuses to send his children back to Birtle, and Mr Hamilton advised me to refer the matter to you before taking action.\n\nA.G.

The reply was that no necessity could be seen for allowing the transfer and that Blackbird should be advised that his children should be returned to Birtle School immediately. I was not able to contact Blackbird until the children went back to school, and I then found that he had sent them to Brandon.

They are quite willing to take them home and bring them back at their own expense, and to see that they all get back to school on time.\n\nOn account of the fact that they are not allowed to visit at the school during the winter months they are very anxious that this privilege be granted them.\n\nRecruiting for this school is very difficult at present and I am afraid that we will have to use compulsion, though I am against this method personally.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a request of the Rolling River Band to have their children allowed home on holidays at Christmas from the Birtle Residential School. Somewhat similar requests have been received from other schools in years past and the policy of the Department has always been to refuse such permission.\n\nPractically every residential school makes arrangements for the parents to visit and see their children at some time during the Christmas holiday period. However, if children were allowed away from the school at that time there is no doubt that many complications would develop. It is almost impossible to prevent some contagious disease being brought back to the school and, as a result, there would be unnecessary suffering caused the children as well as considerable expense and effort required on the part of the school management. Taking everything into consideration the Department feels that it is very undesirable to allow children home on holidays from residential schools during the winter. As stated in the first part of this letter, favourable consideration cannot be given to this request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nLeask, Sask.

Florence Lang, Indians Secretary, Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, 279 Lytton Boulevard, Toronto 12, Ont.\n\nWe had intended giving Helen Johnston of the Mistawasis Reserve, the opportunity of taking the Mothercraft course here in Toronto but, as Mrs. Robertson would like her to have matriculation standing, we have offered to give her a chance to stay at Birtle and take the high school work in the Birtle town school at our expense. If she succeeds, she will come to Toronto and after that it will be possible to get her into a hospital for the regular nurse's training. There would be an opening for her in our hospitals, or possibly as a nurse on the reserve, I am sure. I hope that this arrangement will meet with your approval. We are very anxious to encourage some of the pupils to take high school work.\n\nExtract from Mr. Hoey's reply dated March 10, 1944.\n\nI note with interest your reference to Helen Johnston. The policy of your Society, which aims at the encouragement of Indians to proceed with high school studies or vocational courses, is in my judgment very praiseworthy. The arrangement you are making for the accommodation of this particular pupil at the Birtle School is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n| No. | Name | Period in School | State of Education | On Admission | On Discharge |\n|-----|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|     |      |                 |                   |             |             |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n**NOTES:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Webb, principal Indian Residential school at Birtle and Mr. A.F. Smith Indian Agency which I went to Birtle on 29th April to see my little daughters and Mr. Webb principal send it my daughters down town with poor clothes and its not worth a school girl so I show this clothes to Indian Agency Smith and than I buy new clothes for her and some school childrens told me that they didn't get enough eat always hungry and so which I want my little daughters to remove from there to another school because I have another girl age enough to go to school but I don't liked to bend her to Birtle Indian School so I want you to give her discharge from the school and I will send her to another school with my other girl and if you don't discharge her I wouldn't never send any childrens in Birtle Indian School and when ever school childrens finished the school they used to get something from Department but now they never do it now and =\nSchool teachers are making money on our childrens and one thing I want to tell you beside that is my oldest son killed in the War 1942 and I wrote to pension Commissioner to give me the pension of my son that killed in the War because my eyes are not much good and my age is 44 now and another thing so my wife she had her own girl before I was married her and this girl her father die and so we keeps her and we stay out side Reserve we can not take her in side Reserve because she's half breed and I told Mr Smith about it this before and Department wouldn't not allow her to go in Indian school what its makes Wiffenrods she's half Indian and half White will you give her permission to go in side the Reserve and I might put her in the school too and I want to go back to Reserve But the girl hold us back just because she has no place to go so please Reply this letter and let me know what its best to do it about girl another thing that is what its makes Wiffenrods the white peoples when they age up to 70 years old they gets =\npension and the Creeks peoples gets\ntrick money Every year and Sioux\nIndians gets nothing so which Sioux\nIndians were having meeting on th Birdtail\nSioux Reservation and They told me to\nReported to you This matters to gets a\npensions when They Age up to 70 year\nold Every Sioux Reservation They are\nhaving meeting about this So you\nReply this letter back to me Please\nwe have lots of things Reporting to\nour Indian Agency But They never do\na things Right for us just sit on his\nass and make money so I am Reporting\nto you this matter by my own Writing\n\nFrom yours truly\n\nThomas Hart Henry Benn\n\n0346 Beulah Benn 1942\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa  \n\nI am returning herewith the letter which you received from Thomas Hart Benn regarding his children and other matters.\n\nBenn did bring his daughter to me in April complaining about her shoes. The shoes were in very poor condition, and I took the matter up with Mr. Webb, the Principal. Mr. Webb stated that he had had great difficulty in obtaining girls' shoes, and had some on order for months, which had not yet been delivered. He was purchasing some locally but could only get two or three pairs at a time, which of course would not go far.\n\nSince Mr. Webb has been Principal I have had less complaints from the Indians about matters at the school than previously, and I think the children have been well fed, and considering present conditions, I am sure they have been better dressed. More care has also been taken to provide a balanced diet. Thomas Benn had a son killed in England, under circumstances which I believe are not pensionable. In any case Benn is quite fit to work and would not get any pension. Regarding his present wife's half-breed daughter, who he states the Department would not allow to attend the Birtle School, I took this matter up with the Department in February 1940, and Mr. Hoey replied as follows: \"Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and the Department does not consider that these two children are eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to an Indian Residential School.\" In view of Benn's attitude I would not recommend that this decision be reviewed at present, though it might be advisable to re-consider it at a later date. Benn is a real agitator and trouble maker.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nAugust 2, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, returning letter which we received from Thomas Hart Benn. In view of the information contained in your letter, you may inform Benn that it is not our intention to approve the discharge of his children from the Birtle Residential School at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nI would refer you to Agency letters 15-4979, dated 10th January and 15-5126, of 21st February, and Department replies 106-1-10 of 14th January & 26th February re education of Charlie Wabash' children.\n\nIn Department's letter of 26th February the matter was deferred until June. I should now like to be notified as to the school the Department considers the girl Edna should attend.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Edna Wabash\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 30, in which you seek information with respect to the residential school at which the above-noted pupil should be enrolled.\n\nWhile it is the general policy and practice of the Department to have children placed in a residential school conducted under the same religious auspices as the father of the children, we cannot see how any good purpose would be served in sending this pupil to a Roman Catholic School, if both parents are anxious that the child should be enrolled at the Birtle Presbyterian School. It is noted also that the children of Charles Wabash have been baptized by a Presbyterian clergyman and apparently brought up in the Presbyterian faith. In our judgment, therefore, this pupil should be enrolled at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nR. A.

Mr. Webb, the Principal, started after them as soon as possible by team, but could not find them. In the morning of the 18th they went into a farm house near the Lizard Point Reserve where their homes are, and both had frozen feet as they had slept in a straw stack all night. As the temperature that night was thirty below zero, it is a wonder that they are alive. Mr. Ament whose farm they went to, advised me by phone as soon as they got there, and I requested him to drive them to the Doctor at Angusville as soon as he had given them something to eat. The Doctor took them to Russell hospital by car and they are still there and will likely be in hospital for some time as the Doctor thinks some toes will have to be amputated.\n\nSo far as I can learn the boys had no particular reason to run away.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 3, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to two pupils who have truanted from the Birtle Residential School. Please let me know the names and register numbers of the two boys. I would also like to know the approximate time they left the school and the approximate length of time which the Principal spent in searching for them. Please state also on what date you were notified by the Principal regarding their truancy. If there is any other information which you may have regarding this matter, you should forward it. Cases such as this are very liable to cause trouble or at least enquiry, and it is very important that we should have the fullest possible facts.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter No.106-1-10 of the 3rd inst.regarding the two boys who ran away from the Birtle Residential School on February 17th and had their feet frozen.\n\nThe boys were Charles Mentuck, register No.355, and Wilfred Longclaws No.339, both belonging to the Lizard Point Reserve. The boys left the school between 2 p.m.and 4.30 p.m.when their absence was discovered. The Principal started to look for them as soon as they were missed which was about 4.30 p.m.He went out by car but could not get far as the side roads were blocked.Then he arranged to hire a driver and team and left for the Reserve about 7.30 p.m. He was out all night and was still searching for them on Sunday morning (the 18th inst.) when I advised him by phone to a farm near the Reserve, that the boys were found. He advised me about 7.30 p.m. that the boys were missing, before he left with the team.I phoned to Russell and to Angusville to try and send word to the parents that the boys were missing,and to get them to start searching from that end.\n\nThe boys are still in Russell hospital and will both be there for some time yet.I saw Dr Sharman at Angusville this week,who is caring for the boys,and he informed me that the boys were doing better than he expected, and he hoped that amputation might be unnecessary.Gangrene had set in on Mentucks foot,but was checked by the use of Sulpha drugs and Penicillin.Mentuck will likely have to go to Winnipeg at a later date to have some skin grafted onto his foot.I was pleased to get this information as he thought part of the foot would have to come off ten days ago.\n\nThere are children of school age on the Reserves of the Agency who should be in school, but on account of...\nthe danger to the children when they run away from school.\nI have so far avoided compulsion by force, and do not desire\nto take the responsibility of forcing the children to attend\na boarding school, unless you instruct me to do so.\nI am of the opinion that a driving team should be kept at\nthe school during winter for use in case of truancy. The\nchildren do not take the highways when running away and the\nside roads are usually blocked for cars during winter.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n1. Mr. V.

Ret file to Mr. Chelatly Mar 3/45\n\nP.C.\n\n11.31 for suggestions you\nare requested to this\ninvestigate this\ncopy PMH\nOttawa, March 13, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nIn a letter dated February 27, Indian Agent Smith advised us that two boys had truanted from the Birtle Residential School and, as the result of exposure to cold, he was afraid at that time that it would be necessary to amputate some of their toes. For your information, I enclose copy of my letter of March 3 to Mr. Smith and also copy of his reply dated March 9.\n\nAmplifying my letter to Mr. Smith of March 3, I feel it almost unnecessary to mention that even though it appears that every endeavour was made to locate the boys, there is frequently someone who will say that our staff has been negligent. With this in mind and in order to have very complete information on file regarding this case, it would be appreciated if you could find it possible to visit the Birtle School and interview those interested. It would also be advisable to either visit the Russell Hospital or for you to get in touch with Dr. Sharman and obtain an up-to-date report regarding the condition of these boys.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Truancy Cases - Birtle School,\nDept. Letter 106-1-10, March 13th.\n\nThis report deals with Charles Mentuck, register No. 255, and Wilfred Longclaws, No. 239, both about eleven years old, and both belonging to the Waywayseecappo Reserve. These boys ran away from the Birtle Residential School between 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon, February 17th. It was a clear, cold day, and the thermometer that night registered 20\u00b0 below zero.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. Webb, discovered their absence at about 4:30 p.m. He made enquiries from the boys but all he could learn was that they went towards the track. He telephoned some nearby neighbors to be on the lookout and then took his car and drove to Solsgirth, where he had to leave his car. He walked some distance in the direction he expected they would go, in the hope of heading them off. He finally decided to return to Birtle and try to hire a driving team. He got back about 6 p.m., and after arranging for a team he again phoned settlers north of Birtle and also contacted Indian Agent Smith, who was at Shoal Lake. Mr. Webb left the School by team at 7:30 p.m.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Smith telephoned Mr. McTavish at Angusville, who lives near the reserve, and asked him to notify the Indians and to ask them to start hunting. Mr. McTavish said the Indians were nearly all at Rossburn attending a hockey game. Mr. Smith then telephoned the storekeeper at Rossburn and asked him to notify all the Indians he could. He also telephoned several farms north of Birtle and some living near the reserve.\n\nMr. Webb drove all night on different side roads and around straw stacks. He played out two teams of horses and with the third team landed on the reserve at 8 a.m., February 18th. One Indian was just hitching up to start out to hunt.\n\nAt about 8:30 a.m., a Mr. Ament, a farmer near the Waywayseecappo Reserve, telephoned Mr. Smith that the boys had just come to his house after sleeping in his straw stack. He said their feet were frozen and they needed medical attention. Mr. Smith requested him to phone the Doctor and to take the boys to the hospital in his covered sleigh. He also sent a message to Mr. Webb, who immediately started out again and met Mr. Ament and the boys at Angusville, and from there they proceeded to the Russell Hospital. The children were received medical care from Dr. Sharman and Dr. Shaw. I might add here that at 5 a.m. Mr. Webb was at a loss to know what was best so he telephoned the R.C.M.P. at Rossburn and requested their assistance.\n\nThe boys apparently had no specific reason for leaving. They said they wanted to go home. I might add that Wilfred Longclaws has a brother a year or two older who plays hockey with the school team. Wilfred cannot play because of a heart condition. The school team was playing on the Saturday...\nafternoon against a Birtle team on the town rink, and Mr. Webb thinks Wilfred was feeling badly because he couldn't take part, so just took this way to relieve his feelings. The boys are all very fond of hockey and proud of their teams, and I have no doubt this had some bearing on the boys' decision to run away and go home.\n\nThe one boy, Charlie Mentuck, is back at school now. I examined his feet and found them entirely healed. The skin is red and blotchy on the toes and around the heel; but there is no soreness. He was wearing warm, hand-knit socks and gum rubbers, and attending class.\n\nWilfred is still in the hospital at Russell. I had Dr. Sharman show me his feet and was surprised to see them in such good condition. They appeared to be practically healed and the doctor is convinced that no surgery will be required unless something unforeseen happens. Wilfred stated that he was resting well and had no pain. The doctor attributes the wonderful improvement to the use of sulfa drugs and penicillin.\n\nThe distance from the school to the reserve is about nineteen miles and the boys could go east or west a mile or two before starting north; so the Department will realize how difficult a task faced anyone starting out to hunt these boys. In addition the country is partially covered with bush so that one might easily pass within a few hundred feet of the boys and never know it. In view of all the information gained I feel that both Mr. Webb and Mr. Smith did what they could and certainly no time was lost in securing medical help as soon as the boys were found.\n\nI am convinced that \"truancy\" is the greatest cause of worry for any principal, especially during the winter months. I knew of no way in which it can be entirely eliminated; but more constant supervision during play hours and on Saturdays and Sundays would at least serve as a preventive. I would also recommend that the Agents and Principals be given a free hand to call on the R.C.M.P. for help. One never knows how serious a run-away can be and without doubt the police should be requested to assist. I mention the use of the police because of Departmental Circular 15-1, dated June 21st, 1943. I feel the police should be in at the beginning, not after others have failed, because that may then be too late. There is a detachment at Rossburn and one at Shoal Lake, and I feel confident that these men would be only too eager to assist, especially during the winter months. The above-mentioned circular should at least be moderated and the Agents left free to call on the police for help at any time.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, March 23, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding Charles Mentuck and Wilfred Longclaws, who truanted from the Birtle Residential School.

Both Joe Cook and his wife are graduates of Birtle School themselves, though they professed to be Roman Catholics since then. Joe Cook's parents are Roman Catholics and his wife's parents were Presbyterians.\n\nI cannot say just how sincere he is in his desire to change.

Rusaw, Principal.\n\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n15th November, 1945\n\nMr. A.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the past this school has received grants to help defray the costs of transportation for the children to school in September and for return in June. Other schools are receiving the same now. This September twenty children were brought back to school by train from the Mistawasis Reserve west of Prince Albert at a cost of $154.00. Four children were brought down from the Round Plains Reserve near Prince Albert by automobile at a cost of $48.00. This makes a total of $202.00 as cost of transportation to bring these children to school. This amount was paid out in cash by the W.M.S. funds for the school.\n\nI am asking that you please seek financial help from the Department of Mines and Resources to cover these expenses. When the children return next June, they will have to travel by train again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. N.M. Rusaw.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of Birtle Indian Residential School, requesting Department assistance towards the costs of transporting the children to and from the School at the beginning and end of the school term.\n\nSome years ago the Department made an allowance for this purpose, when a voucher, covered by receipts, was presented.\n\nA.G.

If these children are not likely to return to the school in the near future, you should apply for their discharge in order that the Principal may have the necessary authority to remove their names from the return.\n\nRecords also show Donald Bunn as born October, 1929, and is, therefore, 16 years of age.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nThe Indians of the Waywayseecappo, Bird Tail Sioux, Keeseekoowenin, and Rolling River Bands, who have children in Birtle Residential School desire to have them home for a holiday at Christmas time. They would come to the school and get them, and promise to bring them back at the expiration of the holiday on time. I really think that they would do so, and that a short holiday at Christmas would tend to eliminate truancy during the coldest and most critical months of the year, when a child is liable to freeze to death if they run away. It would also give the school staff a chance to have a breathing spell for a few days.\n\nThe children's homes are within from 15 to 70 miles from the school, and there is no accommodation at the school to put the parents up for a night if they come to visit the children at Christmas time.\n\nMr. Rusaw, the Principal of the School, is in favour of a short holiday at Christmas, and I think it could be tried out for a year, and if the children did not come back as promised it could then be discontinued.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 8th November, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant suggesting that certain pupils of the Birtle Residential School be allowed home for holidays at Christmas. You do not state for what length of time you consider they should be allowed out, but presumably it is for a week.\n\nSeveral schools have tried the same experiment and while some of them at least would not admit the fact, it still remains that our experience shows that holidays at this period of the year are never advantageous to the child or the school management. Invariably many of the children come back suffering from colds and other sickness and as a result the school becomes a hospital for several weeks. Such condition certainly interferes with classroom work. We have issued circular letters in regard to this matter on several occasions and when we extended the summer holidays to a period of two full months it was definitely understood that this would obviate the necessity of granting weekend holidays or holidays at Christmas for which no authorization can be given.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nElphinstone, Man. Nov. 9th, 1945.\n\nSuperintendent-General,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Christmas Holidays.\n\nThe Indians of Elphinstone, Rolling River and Rossburn Reserves have instructed me to write to you in connection with the arrangement of Christmas holidays for their children who are attending the Residential School at Birtle. I understand that the Principal, Mr. N. M. Rusaw and the Indian Agent, Mr. A. G. Smith, both approve of an arrangement whereby the children will be given leave of absence from the School so they can return to their homes for Christmas and a holiday extending over the New Year. The Indians are quite prepared to arrange for transportation for their children and to see that they are returned promptly on the day appointed and they realize that they will forfeit a holiday for another year if they do not attend to the prompt return of their children. It is thought that granting a holiday will lessen the tendency to Truancy and will give a welcome break to the School Staff. It is quite natural that the parents are insisting upon a return of their children for holidays at the Christmas Season and I have no doubt that you will make the necessary arrangements and advise the proper Authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Allison Glen, K.C., M.P.,\nMinister of Minrs & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Jim:\n\nHere is a matter which may interest you. The Indians of Rossburn, Elphinstone and Erickson have been seeking permission to have their children home from the Birtle Indian School for Christmas and New Years. I understand that the Principal, Mr. M. M. Rusaw, is agreeable. Mr. Smith tells me that he has also recommended it. The Indians are willing to pay the transportation and to see that the children are returned on time.\n\nHowever, the Department, in view of their past experience, has ruled that they will not permit a Christmas holiday from the school. The reasons they give is that too often the children do not return promptly and that they come back with colds, etc., which turn the school into a hospital for some two weeks after the holiday.\n\nThe parents feel so strongly in the matter that they may go and take their children by force; and they would get a lot of sympathy from the public at large. Perhaps you can do something to adjust the situation and prevent unnecessary upset. The Indians are very jealous of their rights and I think they would see to it that the children are returned promptly so that they could enjoy the privilege another year.\n\nKind personal regards,\n\nSincerely,\n\nWalter.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDec. 10, 1945\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBirtle Indian School\n\nThe Minister has received the attached letter from Mr. W.C. Richardson, LL.B., Barrister, of Elphinstone, Man., dated Dec. 7, stating that the Indians of Rosebud, Elphinstone and Erickson have been seeking permission to have their children home from the Birtle Indian School for Christmas and New Years; he understands the Principal is agreeable, and - quote: \"Mr. Smith tells me that he has also recommended it\"; the Indians being willing to pay the transportation and to see that the children are returned on time. A ruling of the department, however, would apparently not permit this. Note specially - I quote further: \"The parents feel so strongly in the matter that they may go and take their children by force; and they would get a lot of sympathy from the public at large\".\n\nMr. Richardson asks if something cannot be done to adjust the situation.\n\nWill you please have the matter looked into at once and with a return of the letter let the Minister have a draft reply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. Hoey:\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\nMinister's Office\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nThe Minister addresses Mr. Richardson as - \"My dear Walter\".

In the first place, if such permission were granted at Birtle, we would be obliged to extend it throughout the Dominion. If this were done, it would involve children travelling many hundreds of miles in some cases to reach home for Christmas.\n\nIn a residential school, children are well fed and special arrangements are made for their enjoyment at the Christmas season. It is generally one of the coldest times in the year, and there is little doubt in my mind that many of the children allowed home on holidays for Christmas would either not return promptly upon the expiry of their leave or would contract certain illnesses, which would not only affect themselves but would possibly be contagious.\n\nI realize that many Indian parents are\n\nW.

Two years ago the parents from the Rolling River Band were going to take their children home when they were in Birtle for the Christmas entertainment at the school, whether we allowed them to do so or not. However they went home without them, though some of them were quite ugly about it. This year I think the parents from all the Reserves are planning to do this. Possibly some person is putting them up to it.\n\nIf they should do this drastic action will probably have to be taken to stop it, should all other methods fail. Kindly advise me what action should be taken if the need should arise.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 13, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G.

Martin Rusaw, the Principal of Birtle Indian Residential School, stating he has heard from Mr. Bowman, C.P.R. agent, inquiring when and if the Indian children were going back to Prince Albert by train, so that arrangements and connections could be made to bring them directly through. It was agreed by the Board of the Women's Missionary Society that we should ask for a grant to help cover this transportation expense. It is four hundred miles one way and takes twenty-four hours of steady going by truck. In the past the trip has been made by truck, but this has not been satisfactory because of the long hard trip for the children, shut in the back of the truck.\n\nMr. Rusaw states the expense of this trip is in the neighbourhood of $150.00 to bring the Prince Albert children in and about $30 to cover the cost of gas, oil, etc., to transport the children from the Reserves around Birtle.\n\nWe are given to understand other denominations receive this grant and we would be very pleased to hear from you at an early date so that arrangements can be made with the C.P.R.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. A.B.)\n\nM.

Edwards M.D.\nBirtle Manitoba\n23rd September 1946\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith applications for admission into the Birtle Residential School for the following children:\n\n- Ronald Bone\n- Jean Bone\n- Frank Bone\n- Marrillia Bone\n- Isabelle Violet Bone\n- Cathrine Bone\n\nRonald, Jean, Frank and Marrillia are all ex-pupils of Sandy Bay School, and I have no doubt they are still on the nominal roll of that school, though they are now in Birtle school. Isabelle Violet and Cathrine Bone have not attended any school, but belonged to Roman Catholic families who have sent their other children to Sandy Bay school.\n\nI understand that these children were baptized as Presbyterians by the Rev. F.B. Willson of Elphinstone, this month. The Rev. Father Lambert, Principal of Sandy Bay School, advised me by telephone previously that this action might be taken.\n\nAt present the Indians of Riding Mountain Reserve have a grievance against Sandy Bay School. Last January, Marie Bone, a daughter of Angus Bone, who was a pupil at Sandy Bay school, was admitted to hospital in Portage La Prairie. In March she was transferred to Dynevor Hospital, and until I advised them of the transfer they did not know that she was ill. I knew nothing about it until I was advised by Dr Campbell that she was in Dynevor. It is quite possible that the change of faith is due to the above grievance. I have not signed these applications, as I do not know if you will approve of the transfer.\n\nA.G. Smith, Indian Agent\nOttawa, 1 October 1946.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent,\nBIRTLE, Manitoba.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the Bone children. Our records show that five of these children were regularly admitted to the Sandy Bay Residential School and attended that school until June 30, 1946. We have no record of Isabelle Violet Bone being enrolled at Sandy Bay. Cathrine Bone is shown on the June quarter return of the Sandy Bay School as pupil No. 6269.\n\nThe Principal of the Birtle Residential School had no right to accept the five children who had been attending the Sandy Bay School. If there was a bona fide change of religion on the part of the parents, this matter should have been brought to our attention and our decision given before accepting them at Birtle.\n\nYou should inform the Principal that these children should be returned to the Sandy Bay School from which they have not been discharged. They were simply allowed home for the summer holidays on the distinct understanding that they would return to the school upon the expiry of their leave.\n\nI feel certain that the Principal of the Birtle Residential School will promptly carry out the instructions contained in this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBirdtail Sioux Reservation\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to advise you that I am requesting you to give Birdtail children's Christmas holiday for two weeks, same as white childrens and please answer this letter back to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThomas Hart Benn\n\nButte Red School.\nOttawa, 3 October 1946.\n\nMr. A.G.

These children, their names and numbers being, Tobie Bone, 242; Donald Bone, 246; Murillia Bone 0240; Catharina Bone 0269; Jeanne Bone, 0270; and Isabel Bone, child of Thomas Bone; are all baptized Catholics and should return to Sandy Bay school.\n\nThe reason put forward by the parents for not returning their children to school, was the death of Mary Bone, which occurred at the Dynevor Indian Hospital, and caused by Tuberculosis. The parents were emotionally upset by this sad fact and in that state of emotion were also influenced by the zeal of the resident minister. You will readily understand that the reason put forth is not sufficient to justify such procedure and which is furthermore not according to the provisions of the Indian Act.\n\nI think I am justified in refusing my approval to the transfer and in asking that these children be returned to Sandy Bay Indian School.\n\nYours truly\n\nSgd.

He states that the parents have definitely changed their religion and that he has sent to the Missionary for declarations to that effect.\n\nEven if that is the case he should not have brought them to Birtle knowing that they were enrolled as pupils at Sandy Bay, in my opinion. I understand that Mr Rusaw has written to you about this matter.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which Father Jean Lambert wrote to Mr Waite about the matter.\n\nA.G.

Rusaw\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed by the Indian Agent in Birtle that there is some dissatisfaction regarding the admittance of five Bone children from the Keeseeckocowenin Reserve.\n\nDealing with the case of Catherine Bone, daughter of Angus Bone; when I went to the Reserve to pick up the children Angus Bone asked if he might send this girl to school. I enquired as to his religion and he informed me he was a Presbyterian and it was vouched for by several of the Indians I knew. They stated that the child had never started to any school previously. Also the Indian Agent had no knowledge of her being in another school. In your letter you state that she is enrolled at Sandy Bay.\n\nThe other four children, two of Jonathan Bone's and two of Thomas Bone's I knew had been enrolled at Sandy Bay. Both Thomas and Jonathan were brought up Protestants as their father was always and is still a faithful attendant at the Presbyterian Church. Thomas was educated at the Birtle School and Jonathan never attended any school.\n\nThese children were not canvassed for by myself nor any member of our Church. The parents brought the children to the home of Rev. Wilson in Elphinstone expressing their desire to have them become members of the Presbyterian Church. The Rev. Wilson baptized them in this faith and they declared themselves members of this Church.\n\nYou state that a change of religion must be done in a bonafide manner. Please inform us as to what you require in this matter and it shall be looked into immediately.\n\nSince receiving the word from the Agent I have contacted the Rev. Wilson who is sending me the declarations of the parents.\n\nIf there is any freedom of Religion for the Indian then I beg of you to reconsider this case.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nN. M.

Smith\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 5, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent,\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n\nWe have for answer your letter 33A of 28 November, 1946. As you are doubtless aware, the Department must be fully convinced of a bona fide change of religion before permitting children to transfer from one school to another.\n\nTherefore, the Department wishes to obtain the following facts concerning the children about whom this controversy has arisen:\n\n(a) In what Church was the father baptized?\n(b) What school, if any, did the father attend?\n(c) In what religion was the mother baptized?\n(d) What school, if any, did the mother attend?\n(e) By what religious denomination, if any, were they married?\n(f) In what religion were the children baptized?\n\n(Give dates - be sure to state if these children were baptized in two religions).\n\nWe have on file a letter which you forwarded from Father Lambert on 9 October, in which he states that Tobie Bone, Donald Bone, Marcellia Bone, Catherine Bone, Jean Bone, and Isabel Bone are all baptized Catholics.\n\n...... Our records\nOur records show that Ronald Bone was admitted to Sandy Bay on 21/9/43; that Frank and Murrillis Bone were admitted to Sandy Bay on 20/1/43; and that Jean and Catherine Bone were admitted on 15/9/45. As pointed out in your letter of September 23, these children apparently are from Roman Catholic families. However, the Presbyterian Church claims now that the parents are and have been Presbyterians. Can you please inform the Department of the circumstances concerning their original application forms for admission to Sandy Bay, in which these parents claimed they were Roman Catholics? Can you also obtain information as to why, at the time of the admission of these children to Sandy Bay in 1943 and 1945, we have no record of any complaint lodged by the Presbyterian Church at that time concerning their admission to this school?\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Wilson has forwarded certificates to the Department in which he states (a) that Jonathan Bone, parents and grandparents are life-long members of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, (b) that Thomas Bone is a life-long member of the Presbyterian Church in Canada and (c) that Angus Bone's parents were life-long members of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nWhen we are in possession of further facts in this case, it will receive additional consideration.\n\nBernard F.

Is that to be definitely interpreted that the day a pupil becomes sixteen years old regardless of season he or she may leave school?\n\nI have had two cases where boys became sixteen in December and their parents wanted them immediately. In both cases they petitioned the Indian Agent who gave them his consent and both went out immediately. Both gave reasons for wanting them for help. In neither case were the parents disabled or not able to work.\n\nThis leaving in the middle of the term does upset the routine of the school to a certain degree and creates uncertainty in the different school activities.\n\nI was under the impression that when a pupil reached the age of sixteen during the term that he or she completed the term and was discharged at the end of June.\n\nAlso is a matter of mid-term discharge to be determined by the Indian Agent or put it out of the hands of the principal of the school?\n\nHoping that you will favour me with an early reply,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

George Ironside, the father of the children is a Protestant, he stated that his children, Violet and Andrew Ironside were placed in the Duck Lake Indian Residential School by the Grandfather in December 1940 without him, Ironside, being consulted and against his wishes.\n\nAn Application for Admission to the Duck Lake School in connection with John Ironside was received at the Office on January 13th, at the request of Ironside this Application is being held up for the present.\n\nGeorge Ironside is an extremely timid individual, but has a deep paternal regard and love for his children. On the other hand the Grandfather is the domineering, over-bearing type and has definitely over-ruled Ironside's wishes in every way regarding his children. For instance, Ironside requested that his children remain with him during the last summer holidays, instead, Omani took possession of the children and disappeared. Since the death of the grandmother, the children's aunt, a single woman with two illegitimate children of her own, has assisted in caring for the children.\n\nIronside has been living with a common-law wife until quite recently and since the fall of 1943 has been in a position to provide and care for his family. The woman Ironside has been living with left him and is, I believe, living with an\nLiving with an American Indian (Address unknown). However, Ironside remains firm in his demand that his children be sent to the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has been pointed out to Ironside that the children have been Baptised by a Roman Catholic Priest, but he insists that this was against his wishes and wants his children educated in a Protestant Institution.\n\nIt is my wish that the Department make a ruling in this case.\n\nE.

In 1946 and 1947 a grant of $180.00 was made. However, with rising costs this year we are hoping that this grant may be increased.\n\nIt seems very difficult to secure much assistance from the parents of the children towards these expenses, and the result is that our Society had had to bear an added burden.\n\nWe appreciate very much your kind co-operation in past years and would be grateful if the same consideration could be given this year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nNational Executive Secretary.\nJune 3, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nYour letter of the first instant addressed to Mr. Hoey has been referred to me.\n\nWe will allow an amount not exceeding $200 towards the cost of transportation of children to and from the Birtle Residential School for holidays this summer.\n\nThe principal should prepare the account in the usual manner and submit it to the Superintendent who will forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Each letter has quoted a passage from your Department saying that I am to return these children to the Pine Creek School.\n\nThe children referred to are:\n- Constance and Ivan Cook\n- Lawrence Clowd\n\nPlease note that neither of the Cook children have been at this school at any time and where they are I do not know. I have never met nor seen either the children nor the parents. I have had telephone enquiries from the father requesting me to admit his children but he was informed that he could not as long as they were enrolled in another school without the permission of the Department.\n\nThe child, Lawrence Clowd was brought to the school here later in the fall by his parents. I knew nothing of their intentions of sending him here but he arrived when I was away for three days to Calgary. Had I been here I would not have taken him in but when I came home I could not open the door and send him out to shift for himself as he is only a small boy. I assure you that I find sufficient to do without trying to run down his parents for I do not know where they live. As for returning him to Pine Creek School I do not intend to do that either. I expect his parents may be in next week as the most of the children from that Reserve will be going home for the Christmas vacation and he can go out with them. I will then have the opportunity to contact them personally and inform them that they are not to return him to this school after the Christmas vacation. From there on is up to Pine Creek or someone else.\n\nYour informant regarding these three children, must be of the opinion that I practice their tactics of going about each Reserve recruiting children from any home for I only go to a central meeting place at the beginning of the term and the parents meet us there.\n\nI hope this clears up this misunderstanding.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Transportation furnished for the Indian children amounted to $142.45 of which $108.15 was collected. The $8.45 collected for Mr. Rusaw's ticket was a regular tariff fare hence was kept separate from the Indian children's transaction on account of a special rate governing the movement of the party of Indian children. Incidentally, the Agent was again in error in the issuance of Mr. Rusaw's ticket as he should have collected $11.00 instead of $8.45. I am, therefore, making up new statement showing in detail the construction of the entire cost; also showing the total amount paid by Mr. Rusaw and the under collection now amounting to $36.85. This is made up of $34.30 on the Children's tickets and $2.55 on Mr. Rusaw's ticket.\n\nI very much regret the trouble and inconvenience caused in this connection and would inform you that the parties at fault have been duly reprimanded and disciplined with a view to obviating a recurrence.\n\nThanking you for your consideration, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SDG.) F. N. McKenzie,\nGeneral Passenger Agent.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nDecember 10th, 1949\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPertaining to your letter dated December 9th, 1949, file No. 27-8-575, regarding payment to the CNR Railways for fares for children from Lazarre to Prince Albert, Sask., this is a long story which I have written on paper so many times now that I hope this is the last. The Railway first tried Mr. Smith, on this same thing they tried me and after they got my reply, I received a courteous letter of apology. Then they tried Mr. Davis' office in Winnipeg, who wrote me about the same thing and I explained it to him. The next move I would be is to let the person at fault make up for the error and scrap the thing.\n\nLast June when I set out from here by truck for Lazarre arrangements had been made with the district passenger agent for accommodation on the train in the way of a separate coach. We arrived at Lazarre some time before the train time. The station was opened a few minutes before the arrival of the train by a person who was not authorized to sell tickets. This person stated that notification had been received from Winnipeg about the movement of children that night but that the agent was at a political meeting and would not be there for the train. We boarded the train on our reserved coach. The conductor endeavored to help us out. He wired to Melville (20 min. stop there) got full particulars as to numbers and ages to the ticket agent to prepare them and they would be paid for and picked up.\n\nWhen we arrived at Melville I went to the ticket agent with the conductor. This agent was most disagreeable, had not done a thing about the tickets and for a minute refused to sell them. Had it not been for the conductor changing the divisional point, I do not believe he would have issued them. After a great deal of complaining he issued them at rates from Melville to Prince Albert instead of from Lazarre rates to the same place. He was definitely instructed by myself and the conductor. So you see the error was with them. After I had submitted the account to your office, they wrote about this error on their part.\n\nYou asked about the difference in amounts stated by the railway and my account. I did issue a cheque for $116.60 at Melville for the Children's fare and my own. Apparently the rate he set for mine must have been correct because they do not mention it.\nThe children travelled on Indian fares and I asked for regular fare one way. He must have charged me $8.45 which in comparison with their statement is certainly in order. I have paid cheque returned to the school from the bank.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN. M. Rusaw.\nPrincipal.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 30 | To Balance of Expense incurred in transporting pupils of the Birtle Indian Residential School who returned home to the Mistawasis Reserve for the summer vacation as per detailed account and letters of explanation attached. | $36.85 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Ostrander Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Pupils attending Birtle Residential School that attended Brandon last year.\n\nWe have nine boys at Birtle Residential School this year that attended Brandon Residential School last year. Mr. Strapp sent the school bus for the children from Cote Reserve on Saturday August 25, without advising me beforehand. I went around with the driver and made every effort to gather up all the children that had attended Brandon last year and we were able to muster only six girls and one boy. In all cases the parents refused to have their small boys return to this school but were quite satisfied to have the girls go back.\n\nThe parents stated that the boys were not supervised when not in the class room and that the little boys were much abused and knocked about by the older boys and if they complained to their teacher, it only resulted in more abuse from the older boys.\n\nI discussed the matter over the telephone with Mr. Strapp the Principal of Brandon School and he advised that he did not want the boys back and he would be quite satisfied to have them transfer to another school. He promised two weeks ago to write me to this effect but has not done so.\n\nWe now have 17 pupils from Cote Reserve at Birtle school and eight of these attended Brandon school last year. I have been down to Birtle school three times in the last three weeks and the children appear to be quite happy and contented there.\n\nI am attaching herewith the nine applications for admission to school for the children transferred from Brandon to Birtle and trust that under the circumstances the transfers will be approved by the Department.\n\nSix of the seven girls that attended Brandon school last year are back there this year. Mary Severight had passed her 16th birthday and was discharged on the 31st August 1950.\n\nJ. L.

(RG 10, Volume 6254, File 575-10, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nI, today, am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. Rayson, Supt., of the Indian Agency at Portage La Prairie, Man., stating that authority had been received for the admission of Clara & Ruth Oudie on Dec.1/50 to this school. He also advised that the Department disapproved our taking children and increasing the enrolment here.\n\nI thought I explained the reason for taking these two girls in as we really did not wish to have them. Clara was about to be discharged from the Brandon San. from a three year illness and treatment. Bone from this girl's leg was transplanted in the base of her spine. Dr. Tyre, the Supt., at the San., did not wish to see this girl return to her home on the Reserve as he feared her condition might return and if so it would be fatal. He wanted her where she could get plenty of rest and good food. I felt it was the Christian thing to do and took her in. When she came the parents sent the younger one who had cried to come with Clara to School and sent the girls here with another person. They were here and I could not just send them away.\n\nI have been doing all within my power to have the Indians put in the applications earlier for admissions and have been discouraging the practice of bringing children in after Sept., unless there is a logical reason. I have turned away six different children who have been brought in since Oct.1st. and have equally as many phone calls seeking admission. So please do not think that I am canvassing for these children or using influential measures to increase the enrolment. This school is spacious and will accommodate 150 to 160 easier than several schools I know who have a much higher quota than this school has.\n\nI have been partially successful in getting the parents to co-operate and bring the children to school at the beginning of the fall term.

I visited the Birtle Residential School during October and Mr. Rusau (the principal) informed me that he was very pleased with the attitude and application to studies shown by William Thomas.\n\nBoth Mr. Rusau and myself feel that William Thomas should be permitted to continue his studies in order to fit himself for employment suitable for his physical limitations.\n\nD.A.H.

Rayson, Superintendent of the Indian Agency at Portage La Prairie, Man., has referred your enquiry to me re Nelson Tanner, a student at this school. The reference letter is dated Nov. 5th, 51 and file no is 575-10(E6).\n\nYour enquiry pertaining to this lad or any student taking High School work here was a great surprise to me. This lad is twenty years of age but as a younger pupil did not start school until ten years of age. He also spent a year in his childhood in the Sanatorium. At the present he is completing his grade twelve. It is true he has failed once in two subjects but it is his own will and wish to complete his High School. He works faithfully and is most anxious to be a success. His family background is just about the worst and the Indians from his Reserve are doing all they can to discourage any of their band to be desirous of education. In spite of this, Nelson has plodded ahead and I feel sure he will make use of his training. He is developing into a very fine young man and people who have met him from the Department are quite pleased with his manner and action. When Major McKay was here he met this lad personally and the majority of these older students. If you would approach him on this matter I am sure he will be able to explain it much better than I.\n\nMay I mention here that the Birtle School is not overcrowded to the extent of crowding. Large spaces formerly used for storage and workshop etc., have been changed to sleeping rooms etc., for students. An outside workshop and store house has been moved from the old agency property and much space has been made available for housing etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. M.

There is only five miserable milk cows here and two good cows will give me more milk than the five. It is easy to pick up cheap miserable stuff like what is now here. But it is not much of a training to boys to handle such stuff. I know from actual experience at Alberni that as soon as good cows came on the place the interest of the boys increased 100%. At Alberni I built up the very best herd of dual purpose Pure Bred Shorthorns in the Province. Just look up Report No. 18 of Pure Bred Dairy Cattle of the Dom. Government. There you will see in the 4 year old Shorthorn Section my cow \"Augusta Glad Eyes\" led all Canada in her class, and Roan Marie in the Mature Class occupied 4th place in Canada. In leaving Alberni, nothing grieved me so much as leaving them behind. I left over 30 head at Alberni that any one might envy, and that number is more than the present Principal needs, or can handle to advantage.\n\n\"I must have cows here after the summer vacation, my resources will only permit me to secure \"just cows\". I believe I can buy four cows or heifers from Alberni School for $600.00 and pay the transportation. Will you allow me a grant of $600.00 for this purpose?\"\nOttawa, June 2, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo which is relative to a supply of suitable milk cows for the Birtle Indian Residential School. The Department doubts the advisability of going as far as Alberta for the source of supply. Would it not be satisfactory if I authorized Mr. Commissioner Graham of Regina to purchase four dual purpose Shorthorns. It is possible that you would prefer grade Holstein or Ayrshire.

Currie\nBirtle, Man., 7 June 1927\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Can.\n\nHon Sirs,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd Inst.\n\nNo 106-1-5; in reply I think dual purpose Shorthorns would best meet our need\u2014as a straight dairy cow the Holstein or ayrshire may be all right\u2014but our school will require meat as well as milk and the dual purpose Shorthorn fills the bill well\u2014this I know from experience.\n\nMy idea of going so far afield for foundation stock was, I know anything I buy from the Alberni School is good. I developed the herd\u2014and nothing grieved me more in leaving Alberni than leaving the stock behind\u2014I believe the stock can be had there as cheap as elsewhere, and the only difference is the transportation, now Pure Red stock only takes half freight rates, in other words it costs twice as much to ship a grade cow as it does a Pure Red Cow, so I do not anticipate the freight charges excessive.\n\nIt might be better to pay a fairly stiff freight rate\u2014and get cows of assured good production\u2014than get cows near at hand\u2014simply because the freight was cheap\u2014and the cows possibly not prove up to the expectation in production.\n\nHowever whatever you give me I will try to put\nRegina, Sask., June 29th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Birtle Residential school, which was inspected by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nHere, as at many other schools, there is complaint about not having sufficient cows of a good type. It is more important that good milk should be supplied in large quantities to the children. For some reason or other, it seems almost impossible to get the school authorities to realize the importance of milk. The cows here are of an inferior type and the chances are that four good cows will give as much milk as ten inferior ones. However, when I speak to the school authorities about matters of this kind, the complaint is that they have not sufficient funds. I am pleased to state that at File Hills and Lebret Schools, where they have good herds, the children get an ample supply of good wholesome milk.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 7, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 201-11 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Birtle Indian Residential school.\n\nThe Department is already in correspondence with the Rev. Principal concerning milch cows and, at a later date, there will be a further communication for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThis is a good looking cow and he is willing to sell for $100.00. She is milking some now an freshens in the Spring.\n\nComing in at intervals of a couple of months apart, they would give us a steady supply and be a good foundation from which to build up a dual Shorthorn herd.\n\nThe total cost for the five cows would be $650.00 - 3 at $150.00 and two at $100.00 each.\n\nWould the Dept. be willing to assume the cost of the five? Of course I have purchased three at $400.00 and will finance for them, if it is necessary.\n\nBut I can use the money just the same, to very great advantage. Mr. Davidson judged the dual purpose stock at the New Westminster Fair in 1926 and it is his opinion the cows we have selected are good and the prices most reasonable.\n\nI trust you will be able to give me a favorable reply at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\nmilk flows\u2014and I intend to finish them off and beef them, as they are not worth keeping as dairy cows.\n\nMy need of milk being again before me, I availed myself of an opportunity to visit over a dozen herds the other day\u2014Mr. Jas B. Davidson, Western Representative of the Shorthorn Association, was here and offered to drive me to herds where he was sure I could secure what I required.\n\nAt Tom Mitchell's, Rossburn, we found three good cows:\n- C.E. Irwin - Newdale: one cow\n- J.R. Doubleday - Kelloe: 3 cows\n- Geo Underhill - Moline: 2 cows\n- Mr. Hacking - Salisbury: 1 cow\n- P.C. Moffat - Strathclair: 3 cows\n\nOut of the above I purchased two fresh cows from Geo Underhill - Moline for $300.00. I selected these two because they were fresh and met an immediate need\u2014I also purchased one choice looking cow that freshened in Nov., from Mr. A.C. Moffat, Strathclair, for $100.00.\n\nPerhaps the two best cows we found were, one owned by J.R. Doubleday - Kelloe, that he wants $500.00 for. She is giving some milk but freshens in March, and one owned by Tom Mitchell - Rossburn.\nBirtle, Man., 4 Oct. 1927\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nHon. Sirs,\n\nWhen I arrived at Birtle School in May last, there was a great deal of illness in the school. In looking about for reasons, I concluded one cause was lack of proper nourishment. There was a serious shortage of milk. At that time I asked the Dept. to assist me by purchasing four or five good cows. And in reply the Dept. intimated that they were ready to cooperate, as I preferred dual purpose Shorthorns. I intimated that I thought I had left behind at Alberni a surplus of good Pure Bred Shorthorns just such as I wished to be provided for Birtle. On the 13 June 1927 #106-1-5 letter, the Dept. wished me to get in touch with the Principal of the Alberni School, to ascertain the cost of carrying out my recommendation.\n\nThis I did but the Alberni Principal intimated he did not wish to sell to the Birtle School. As I had to secure cows at once, I went out and got four miserable grade cows at a cost of $194.00 but already they have paid for themselves in the improved condition of the pupils. These cows are now badly falling off in their...\nOctober 12, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nWhen Rev. Mr. Currie, the new principal at the Birtle Indian Residential School, took over the management, one of his first reports showed that the children were not getting enough milk and that there were not sufficient milch cows in the herd. He was asked to look around and see where he could secure 4 or 5 dual purpose Shorthorns. Mr. Currie preferred this breed of cow. He now reports that he can secure 5 animals at a cost of $650. In his selection he has been assisted by the Western representative of the Shorthorn Association. Mr. Currie, himself, is well qualified to select milch cows, and, in view of the urgent need, I wish to recommend that authority be given for the purchase. I find that the Department has had no expenditure at the Birtle School for stock in the last 15 years, and probably never.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 12, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department of the need of supplying the Birtle Indian Residential School with four or five milch cows, in order that the pupils can obtain an adequate quantity of good milk.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will provide an amount not exceeding the sum of $650 towards payment of the purchase of five cows, viz.: 3 at $150 each and 2 at $100 each, as mentioned in your letter.

My colleagues are popular and in request. I have never yet had a single offer to make me an offer of publication on any subject to the press.\n\n\"I am not of a jealous nature. Sometimes and I am not sure when, I read Birkenshaw's work. I read what has been solicited and rewarded by what seems to be a remuneration of full value. I cannot help feeling that if I were my friend and patient with me, I might produce what might be worth, if not a penny a line at least a few words.\"\n\n\"I could write quite an interesting history of the fall of the Coalition and, as other people have given their views about me, I might have some view about others.\n\n\"I cannot tell whether they have any money value. I am but a simple...\"\nColored Bed Spread Better Than White\n\nWhen you are brightening up your house for spring, don't forget the bedroom. A bed spread made of figured materials such as English linen, percale, or cotton and silk fabrics makes a room more cheerful and attractive.\n\nTwo widths of most materials stitched together are enough for a spread. The wide valance which hangs within four or five inches of the floor may be neatly gathered on the two sides and across the bottom of the spread. Bands of harmonizing color may be used for trimming.\n\nA straight piece of figured material or plain material that harmonizes with the spread and with other colors, will serve as a pillow cover. Colored spreads may be used to add to the color scheme of the room and to break up the monotony often caused by a large expanse of white bed spread.\n\nAnother advantage of colored spreads is that they do not soil easily and may be used longer without laundering. No droppings with a white spread can give an inviting appearance unless the spread is spotless.\n\nbeen solicited and rewarded by what seems to be a remuneration of full value, I cannot help feeling that if I tried, and my friends were patient with me, I might produce something worth, if not a penny a line at least a penny a note.\n\n\"I could write quite an interesting history of the fall of the Coalition and, as other people have given their views to me, I might have some views about others.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell whether they have any money value. I am but a simple man, and I should not think much of this because, after all, when I retire and take to some other form of work, I should like to find that at any rate there is one kind-hearted man who, out of pity or whatever motive there might have been, did once make me one offer to see my name with my own stuff over it, and I lay stress on that.\" (Laughter.)\n\nLord Birkenhead, speaking later, said: \"Those who have undergone a long apprenticeship to journalism as Lord Burnham has done, who have laughed\u2014do not laugh, and propose by every legitimate means in our power to resist the inclusion of sexagenarian amateurs.\"\n\nMr. Baldwin, in Parliament last week, when questioned about the journalistic activities of Lord Birkenhead and Mr. Churchill, said that Lord Birkenhead had been guilty of an \"error of judgment\" in writing while he was a Minister a recent article on \"Women in Politics\" for \"Good Housekeeping.\"\n\nSubject: Have I the right expression you require?

English has been switched on to the main currents of the great moving world outside and made to vibrate with every economic or cultural change there. An isolated life is no longer possible even for our remote villages.\n\n\"It is, therefore,\" continued Prof. Sarkar, \"of peculiar advantage to us that in this age of world-forces our official language is English, and that it has diffused itself all over India as the medium of trading and political and cultural correspondence. No other European language has the worldwide influence of English, or is used by such a large proportion of the human race. And English literature is the richest in the world on account of its own original works as well as the translations from all other languages in almost every branch of thought.\"\n\nThe greatest gift of the English besides universal peace and the modernization of India is the Renaissance, the direct result of these two forces\u2014a renaissance which marked our nineteenth century. Modern India owes everything to it; literature, education, thought, art, but in the last generation it became a moral force and reformed our society and religion; still later, in the third generation from its commencement, it has led to the beginning of the economic modernization of India,\" concluded the Vice-Chancellor.\nIndian Residential School\n\nH.

Sirs,\n\nWhen Mr. Russell Ferrier was here a couple of weeks ago he approved of the Dept. supplying the school with a farm wagon at an estimated cost of $160.00. Just after Mr. Ferrier's visit our old wagon went out of use and I had to secure one at once. When I looked over the different wagons, I decided on a fine tire. This wagon runs into a little more money - it also has steel skin, many wagons are only cast skin. This wagon less discount costs $191.45. But I would rather pay the difference than take the other wagon.\n\nIf the Dept. does not care to exceed the estimate of $160.00, then make out a cheque for this amount in favor of Massey-Harris Agent, Birtle, and mail to me, and I will send my own cheque along with it for $31.45.\n\nI might say I have had to secure a six horse Cultivator at a cost of $140.00 and a Massey-Harris Mower at $103.00.\n\nI am doing all I can to secure the equipment necessary to properly operate the farm.

Miss Todd has the junior room with 48 enrolled, 40 in Grade 1 and 8 in Grade 2. The senior room is in charge of Mr. Ingelson with 63 enrolled and the grades arranged as follows -\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 3     | 27     |\n| 4     | 23     |\n| 5     | 8      |\n| 6     | 4      |\n| 8     | 1      |\n\nBoth teachers are qualified and appear to be doing good work. Unfortunately, both are resigning June 30th.\n\nThe children are fairly well dressed. They are neat in appearance and clean. They all appeared interested in their studies and discipline was good. The work books were neat and the handwriting good. I believe the children, in both classrooms, are making progress.\n\nAll dormitories were clean and well aired. The beds were neatly made and the bedding appeared ample and clean. A few beds were in poor condition, but I understand these are being replaced. A number are without castors, which fact I pointed out to Mr. Lockhart, the principal. Beds without castors gradually dig into the cement floors and will, in time, cause considerable damage. I consider repairs of this nature should be attended to by the principal.\n\nThe playroom and washroom on the girls' side was clean and all plumbing in good condition. The playroom walls are plastered with grey cement. I suggested these walls be whitewashed with lime or some suitable preparation. This would tend to destroy any germs and would greatly brighten the rooms. On the boys' side these rooms were also clean but the playroom walls needed some repair. These walls should also be cleaned, either by lime or by some similar preparation.\n\nThe dining room was clean and the tables neatly arranged. Some tables are in need of repair and bracing. I pointed this out to Mr. Lockhart and there is no reason why this work can not be done by a staff member, assisted by the boys.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe kitchen is in the charge of Mrs. Cruikshanks, who also supervises the bakery and dairy. I consider these departments well operated. One girl was busy making apple pies, and she appeared quite accustomed to the work. Bread is baked for the entire school. The children appeared in excellent health and apparently receive plenty of good food.\n\nThe boiler room is in charge of Mr. Dunn, who has been engineer here for some years. The equipment appears in good condition. Some repair is needed on the outlet provided for taking the ashes from the furnace room. The cordwood has been thrown in at this opening, which is in front of the furnace, instead of dropping it into the fuel room proper. To repair this outlet will require six or eight bags of cement and considerable labour. The repair work should be done this summer and in the future, this outlet should only be used for taking out the ashes. The hoist for lifting the ashes is located in this opening, and sooner or later it will be destroyed if they continue to throw the cordwood in against it. The wood should be put in through the fuel room.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are in good repair but badly in need of painting. Mr. Lockhart stated he had a considerable amount of money to the credit of his school in Toronto. If such is the case, I think some should be used to paint the two main barns. Mr. Lockhart has had no big crops so apparently this accumulation is from the school grants. Other principals do repair work and I see no reason why Mr. Lockhart can not do some too.\n\nHe has thirty-five head of cows and young stock. At present there are eleven milking, with about eight to freshen. There are sixteen stalls for milking cows and the principal aims to keep these full. He has disposed of all surplus bulls. The cattle are in excellent condition.\n\nThe following is a list of horses owned and kept at the school, as submitted by Mr. Lockhart. No outside horses are kept on school property.\n\n1.

Mr. Lockhart is quite prepared to sell the grade horses as quickly as he can. He would, however, like to keep the Percherons and, as money is scarce, I do not think he should be asked to sacrifice this stock. He could sell eleven 'grades' and the pure bred stallions, of which there are five at present. This would leave nineteen head, and as the younger purebreds become of serviceable age, the other four grades could be sold. I do not approve of keeping stallions around a school institution and it will not be necessary because there is no need to breed more than four mares a year and this would not justify keeping a horse.\n\nAs stated above, Mr. Lockhart made it quite clear he would co-operate and will, if satisfactory to all, dispose of the grade horses. It may be necessary for the Department to express their views concerning the stallions.\n\nThe other stock consists of five brood sows, a few old hens, and four hundred baby chicks.\n\nThe crop is as follows -\n\n- Wheat: 60 acres\n- Oats: 125 \"\n- Barley: 30 \"\n- Potatoes & corn: 15 \"\n\nand the balance of approximately 220 acres is for summerfallow.\n\nI was pleased with the improved condition of this school.

E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nAt the Birtle Residential school the whole crop is being mowed for feed. It is the poorest crop in the district due to poor cultural methods. Their summerfallow this year has also been very badly handled. Plowed when the weeds were quite high and not cultivated since then.\n\nA. G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMr. Lockhart of the Birtle School has written that he needs a new tractor. He has a chance of buying a second hand one for $720.00 which he says is worth $950.00. It cost $1500.00 two and a half years ago. It is a McCormack Deering W30.\n\nWe have had so many repairs to pay for on the old tractor that we would be glad of your advice as to buying a second hand one, or whether you consider it wiser to buy a new machine. If this enquiry should have gone to Mr. Phelan, would it be too much trouble to ask you to pass it on to him?\n\nI am sorry to have to report that Miss Helen Patterson of Aurora, who went to Birtle last September as Boys' Matron, has had to return home and is now in the Brantford Sanitarium with very little chance for recovery. The doctor at Brantford thinks that the history of the case shows that the infection was contracted about Christmas time and I have been wondering if it could possibly have come in through the Indians visiting the School at Christmas. There is a good deal of objection to these Indians sleeping in the basement of the School, but of course we have not taken any stand on this matter. Mr. Pitts of Cecilia Jeffrey thinks it is a good idea to have a building for the Indians to sleep in and I do not know whether this would be possible at Birtle or not.\n\nI wish to thank you for the picture of the Indian girls from British Columbia. They certainly were a healthy looking group.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your judgment on the matter of the tractor,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant I suggest that Mr. Lockhart consult the Indian Agent regarding the tractor which you are considering purchasing. Mr. Smith has had considerable experience in connection with purchasing tractors recently and he will be able to give Mr. Lockhart proper advice regarding the value of the tractor. As a rule we do not favour purchasing second-hand machinery. I might also add that unless very large areas are being cultivated the Department considers that horse power is preferable to mechanical power.\n\nI am extremely sorry to learn of the condition of Miss Patterson. At all our Indian residential schools we endeavour to discourage Indians visiting the school at frequent intervals. If they insist on doing so some outside building should be provided in which they can sleep. I believe it is a very great mistake to allow them to sleep in the school.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Smith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOur Board has had a request from the Birtle Indian School for a new cultivator at a cost of $150.00 and also a request for $350.00 for seed.\n\nDuring the last year we bought a new tractor at a cost of $750.00 and a new cream separator at a cost of $150.00, which is not yet paid for as the motor has not been delivered. The heavy expense for machinery is causing us some concern. I believe Mr. Lockhart borrowed a cultivator but this is not a very satisfactory arrangement as the borrowers come back with requests. Would you be good enough to clear for us the matter of buying farm implements? Is this really to be one of the expenses to be taken out of the Government grant?\n\nIn view of the fact that we have employed a new farm instructor at a much higher salary, we are hoping that there will be better returns from the farm but we do feel that this drain for machinery is very heavy and we would like your advice as to the purchase of such necessities.\n\nAwaiting a reply, I am Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa,\nApril 17, 1942.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to a request that you have received from the Principal of the Birtle Residential School for a new cultivator.\n\nWhile an amount of $400.00 is included in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43 for repairs and improvements at this school, it has not been our practice for many years to purchase farm machinery at residential schools and, under these circumstances, I regret that we cannot purchase the cultivator mentioned in your letter. It may be difficult for you to secure a cultivator this year and it has occurred to me that there may be Government farm machinery in the Birtle Agency which could be lent to the school from time to time. If this is possible, it would obviate the necessity of purchasing new machinery. I suggest that the Acting Principal confer at once with the Indian Agent and I am certain that he will co-operate in any manner possible.

The one that is there at present has to be disposed of and, in consultation with the Indian Agent, the decision has been made by the Principal that the best offered for sale is one from the Neralcam Herd at a price of $300.00 f.o.b. Buckingham, Quebec.\n\nI do not know whether they have consulted Inspector Hamilton about this matter but they seem to want to make a decision right away as animals seem to be scarce. Would it be convenient for you to send word to the Indian Agent as we do not feel qualified to give an opinion in this matter?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to purchase of a bull at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nWhile we have purchased foundation stock at some residential schools in the past, it is not our practice to continue supplying cattle.

I am of opinion however that this fact need not be greatly regretted, since there is much doubt as to the wisdom of placing an institution in a situation, probably for many years to come, likely to be distant from all centres of civilization.\n\nThe detrimental nature of the policy of massing and herding Indians on reserves, more than is absolutely necessary, and so separating them from the most potent civilizing influences, has been recognized. The very same principle applies with regard to these institutions. They must, if they are to effect the greatest attainable good, be so placed, that as the pupils grow older, they can be placed out temporarily among settlers, or\nlater on, find permanent employment among\nthe Whites; and so, by allowing them to mingle\nwith the intelligence and industry of\nthe country, assimilate them with the\nwhite population, and save them from\nrelapsing into ignorance and barbarism.\n\nI would suggest therefore that an\ninstitution for the benefit of the Indians\nof the district be stationed in the neigh-\nbourhood of (say) Selkirk.\n\nShould the Department however\ndecide that it should be in the im-\nmediate neighbourhood of the Reserve\nconcerned, the best place would be\nabout the mouth of the Saskatchewan,\nwhere the land prospects are least un-\nfavourable.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\n\u2014Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\nH.

The Indian Commissioner states that the number of children of school age under the\n\nTo the Honble.\n\nE. Dendy\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs\nthe Methodist body in that region would appear to warrant the establishment of such an institution; but that from enquiries made he does not consider that a suitable location could be secured in Lake Winnipeg owing to the want of adaptability of the soil for agriculture, and the consequent impossibility of establishing a farm of any considerable size in connection with the institution; but that he would recommend that the School be located in the neighborhood of Selkirk, with a view to obtaining employment for the pupils in industrial pursuits from the settlers, and that thus by their mingling with white people they would be more likely to assimilate themselves with the ways of the white population and be prevented from developing into\ninto ignorance and barbarism. In the event however of the Department not concurring in his views on the above point, the Indian Commissioner recommends that the best place, if the school is to be established in the neighborhood of the Reserve, would be about the mouth of the Saskatchewan, where the land is least unfavorable for agriculture.\n\nThe undersigned beg to state that he is of the same opinion as the Indian Commissioner, and has been for some time past, as to the advisability of locating such institutions in the vicinity of centres of white population and of encouraging the pupils educated therein to follow the trades or other industries, in which\nwhich they have obtained instructions among white people instead of returning to their Reserves, and thus lessen the risk of their relapsing into Indian habits of life. He considers that Selkirk would be a very favorable locality where to establish the Industrial Institution, if the application of the Methodist Church for the same is favorably entertained.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nGeneral\nIndian Affairs\nThe Rev.

Believing the serious disadvantage of having such an Institution in or near an Indian Reserve, we asked that their site might be located in Southern Manitoba.\n\nIf the buildings for an Industrial Institute have been provided on a scale commensurate to the needs of these tribes, as has been done in all other cases, in the North-West, we will be prepared to take the control of the\nSame conditions, as have been imposed upon other commissioners.\n\nI leave the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As far as the site for the school is concerned I think that we could probably find a suitable one in this tract, but for farming purposes it would not be possible to appropriate sufficient land thereon. We should have in that case to endeavor to effect some such arrangement as was made for the Church of England Industrial School, viz., to exchange with some party public lands for a desirable site, if sufficient of the former of a suitable character cannot be obtained near Selkirk.\n\nIn this connection I should have stated that Dr. Sutherland had suggested that the School be established at Fisher River Reserve. So far as land is concerned I think we could probably obtain a fair proportion of cultivable land in that locality, but the other advantages mentioned in Mr. Reed's letter, which would accrue to the pupils through intercourse with White people and obtaining employment at their trades, could not be\nsecured to them at Fisher River, which is purely an Indian settlement; and, so far as I can see at present, the latter consideration should have the preponderance in deciding the question of the location of the School.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(sgd) L.

The delegation dealing with the matter appears to be Hon. E. Denison, Solicitor General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\nhave been the selection of a site. The Indian Commissioner for Mani-\ntoba and N.W.T. was in favor of it being placed at Selkirk, and\nthe undersigned reported to the minister\non the 23rd of Jan 1887, concur-\nring in Mr. Reed's recommendation.\nThe minister approved thereof and\nasked if land was available. In\nreply to that, a letter was addressed\nto the Superintendent by the under-\nsigned, on the 30th of Jan 1889,\na copy of which is placed herewith,\nbut no decision has been arrived\nat, as to whether the land therein\nstated to be available for the site\nfor the buildings should be so used, or\nas to land to be used in connection\nwith the Institution for farming pur-\nposes. It will be observed that the\nundersigned in his letter above men-\ntioned, suggested that we should for\nthe latter purpose endeavor to effect\nsome such arrangement as was made\nfor the Church of England Industrial\nschool at St Paul, viz., exchange with\nSome party, public lands for a farm, if sufficient public land of a suitable character could not be obtained near Selkirk. The undersigned considers it very questionable whether a building similar to that at St. Paul's can be erected for the amount included in the Estimates. The latter building cost \u00a325,000, and if the construction of the building at Selkirk is let by contract, the undersigned is not aware of any reason why the cost of the same should not be at least as much as that of the building at St. Paul's. Then provision will have to be made for the equipment of the Institution. For this purpose \u00a34000 was estimated as the cost of equipment of St. Paul's Institution, and if it is intended that 80 pupils (which is the number allowed at St. Paul's and other Institutions) shall be accommodated at this Institution, and that the per capita rate to be paid by the Department to the Methodist Society for the education,\nmaintenance and clothing of these children shall be \u00a3100 per annum. This will entail a necessity for obtaining an additional vote of \u00a38000, for the next fiscal year. The additional amounts therefore to be included in the supplementary estimates for the institution will be for the cost of the building \u00a325000 less \u00a3600 (already included in the regular Estimates) or \u00a324400.\n\nCost of equipment \u00a34000\n\" \" maintenance \u00a38000\n\nTotal \u00a331000\n\nThe undersigned is however of opinion that if the department employed a practical mechanic, and allowed him to hire labour by the day, and to purchase materials at the expense of the department for the construction of the buildings, all to be done under the supervision of an architect, they could be erected at a very much less cost than \u00a325000 which was the contract price for the school building erected at St Pauls.\n\nH. Macdonald\nDeputy Secretary of the Office\nMay 29th.\n\nMy Dear Reed,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I today wired you in effect that I saw no objection to expending up to $6,000., the sum voted for a Methodist School, Manitoba, on the Morley Institution; but before making any payments you should ascertain from personal knowledge what additions were required, and forward plan and specifications, with an estimate of the cost, to the Department. The money, as you are aware, will lapse on the 30th June. Of course the books are kept open until towards the end of September, in order to allow vouchers for expenditure to reach the Department, but no expenditure dated later than the 30th of June can be charged.\ncharged against the appropriation for that year. In order to overcome the difficulty that presents itself in this case, (there not being time to complete the work before the 30th of June), it is suggested that if the church will agree, and give a guarantee to build the addition itself, according to the plan and specifications approved by the Department, the amount intended to be given it might be paid over to a Board appointed for the purpose, as indicated by the vote, which reads,\u2014\n\n\"For a Grant of $6,000 toward a Methodist Industrial School in Manitoba\". An Order-in-Council would have to be obtained before the transfer of the money could be carried out. If this arrangement can be effected it will matter little whether the work be completed before the 30th of June or not; however, it will be considered when the particulars are received from you.\n\nIn regard to the St. Boniface School, as you know, we\nwe have only $6,000 to spend, and it is in exactly the same position as the money voted for the Methodist School. I telegraphed you today to know where the plans and specifications were. On receipt of these, with an estimate, we may undertake to make the same arrangement in regard to paying the Grant on that suggested for the Wesley improvements, but it must be distinctly understood that no more than the sum voted can be expended. The Department has no power to spend more than is authorized by Parliament to expend, and I shall take no responsibility in the way of authorising the erection of buildings that are to cost more than we have money to pay for, such as was done in the case of the St. Paul's School. In regard to the land for a site for the proposed school, I understand that the Church people will agree to exchange the 34 acres at St. Boniface for equal value in lands elsewhere in the Province.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nI wired you yesterday the position of the land chosen for the Red Deer River School. If the Saskatchewan Homestead Company will not do anything to facilitate securing the site agreed upon, I suppose it could be well again to consult with the Methodist authorities, or choose another location. I don't think any of the current year's appropriation of $27,000 can be utilized, as it is very unlikely that work can now be commenced before the 1st of July; besides, I don't feel much inclin to spend more than the $25,000 voted for next year for a school at that point; and in this connection I might remark that I think you asked only for $10,000 of this for construction. Do you remember why this was?\n\nI forget to mention, in connection with the S. Boniface and Harley grants, that possibly you can suggest the nature of the guarantee that the department should have from the contractor that the work will b\nbe done, and that without any unnecessary delay, before paying them the assistance proposed to be given.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) E.

The first place visited was in the neighborhood of Selkirk, and other points on the Red River as far as Lower Fort Garry, but there were serious obstacles in the way, growing out of the fact that much of the property was owned by private persons, would involve delay, as well as expense to the Missionary Society or the Department.\n\nThe Honorable Mr. Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nAttorney.\nFurthermore, as there is already an Institute on the Red River, controlled by the Church of England, it was thought to be undesirable that another should be planted in the same locality.

Its remoteness from the highway of travel.\n\nAt this juncture communications were received from the municipalities of Carberry and Brandon, in each case offering a site of half a section of land. The sites were carefully inspected by the Executive Commissioner, and subsequently by myself.

I did not mean to say that Beaver River was the only place where a school should be established, nor did I wish to insinuate that one building as large as the one I hear you propose erecting at Brandon, would be suitable, but that this agency was large enough to fill two or three ordinary schools such as the one I saw at the middle church in St Pauls. More - But, you tell me in your letter that\nWith regard to the institute being located at B. River, you may as well say at once this is out of the question. I would rather by that remark that the government has no voice in the matter and could not help us even if they wanted to. Same thing for that, but as I told you before, give us industrial schools in our midst and we will give you our children to educate, otherwise I say as well say as you do, it will be out of the question. I could say much more in support of my views on this point, but as you have decided without consulting our wishes or views on this matter I will not say more at present but hoping that you will be wise enough before it is too late that an industrial school without pupils will neither profit your society nor benefit our people.\n\nI am +++\n\n(Signed) Jacob Heroux\nChief\nBerens River Reserve.\n12th Aug.

From all the circumstances of the case, I am under the impression that the letter has not been written entirely on your own responsibility, but rather at the suggestion of others who in the past have not been very friendly to our work among your people. In regard to the Institute being located at Berens River, I may as well say at once that this is not a good question\u2014there is no land for cultivation.\n\nVery Poor Copy\nfor the opportunities of teaching the various trades which are essential to the success of an institution. Besides this, our experience in such work has convinced us that success depends upon keeping the children removed from the reserves during their school years. Otherwise all the benefits of the instruction which they receive seems to be lost.\n\nYou cannot but know that for many years past our Society has done much for your people. We have spent a great deal of money in keeping a church and school among them, and providing a missionary and teacher. This should be sufficient to show you that we desire only the good of your people and I shall be exceedingly sorry if our efforts now to establish and maintain an industrial school at Brandon should be injured by unwise opposition from the Indians themselves.\nHoping that you may be\nled to see that the arrangement we propose is the\nwisest and the best,\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the nomination is\nconfirmed, as I have no\ndoubt it will be, the\nCommissioner will doubtless\ncommunicate with you\nshortly. It will be well\nfor you to keep an consultation\nwith him as much as\npossible during the progress\nof the...\"\nof the buildings.\n\nIt is now ten months since this action was taken. During that time the impression has gone abroad that I should be wanted for this special work during the coming summer. This has prevented such of the churches as might have called me from taking such action; because it is not regarded as desirable to invite one who in a few months may be designated to other duties.\n\nMy time at Wesley Church, Winnipeg, expires, and my salary does, with the fifteenth of this month, and I now find myself without a home and without financial prospect. You can understand that the difficulty of hiring and furnishing a house with no reasonable prospect of an adequate salary is a serious situation for one who is without capital, etc.\n\nNow it seems only reasonable to suppose that the School will\nwill be completed before snow flies again; and in that event it is a natural supposition that work will be forthwith commenced.\n\nYou were good enough to place an amount in the Estimates of $52-3 to cover cost of maintenance. Whoever is to take charge of such an Institution as that proposed should have sufficient notice to enable him to formulate a plan of procedure based upon careful observation of the methods which have been most successful elsewhere. For these and other reasons I hope you will excuse the liberty I take of asking for such information as you may be pleased to give with reference to the work likely to be done during the coming summer. The near approach of my Conference makes it necessary that I should have some knowledge of what is ahead of me.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood that a contract has been let for the Red Deer school, can you inform the Minister of the amount of the contract and the name of the contractor, also whether a contract has been let for the Brandon school, and if so the name of the contractor and the amount; if not, when may the contract be let?

They claim that similar Institutions have been supported by the Government until such time as they have become established. You will quite appreciate the fact that upon a per capita basis for the first two or three years would not at all cover the expenses incurred but would involve them heavily in debt. In view of these circumstances they strongly urge that you will place them on as favorable terms as you have similar Institutions up to this date. A little later when the Institute has become fully established they will be quite prepared to join in any new system that you may adopt for the control of all of the Institutes under Government control and I beg to suggest under these circumstances that provision be made to cover the expenses of employing a farmer at both Brandon and Red Deer for the present season. The man will require in addition to his salary farming implements.\nstock &c. The Society are prepared to recommend two thoroughly reliable parties to take either place, men whom they have a thorough knowledge of and whom they feel that they can work in harmony with. Are they correct in presuming that the Institute at Red Deer will be completed by the first of November and what is the date when contract is to be completed at Brandon or is not the tender open and the contract closed for the latter place? Regarding the Institute at Muncey the architect has prepared plans for the remodeling and the enlargement of this property. The building however is so old, the interior work so dilapidated and the bricks of the walls were soft and of poor grade that the Society are of the opinion that the Government will save money by tearing down and rebuilding a modern building. This Institution has been so long in operation and its work has been so successful that they think the Government would be justified in giving increased accommodation in a modern model building using the material of the old building for the inside work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The two gentlemen went reported that while some of the Indians considered the location to be far away from the Reserve, yet when the advantages of that site were explained they expressed themselves as quite satisfied & promised to send their children when the Institute should be ready. While not desiring to reflect upon anyone, I have reason to think that the opposition expressed by some of the Indians is not entirely spontaneous. It has come to my knowledge that some of the agents in the Winnipeg Superintendent have expressed a good deal of annoyance because the proposed new Institute was not located somewhere within their...\ntheir jurisdiction & if the Indians are aware of this it will sufficiently account for the representations contained in the letter.

This change having been introduced has been found to work so satisfactorily as to induce the conclusion that it would be well to bring the proposed school at Brandon under it from the start, for the Department feels convinced that economy in management will be much more easily and effectually learned from the beginning, and the difficulty and unsatisfactoriness of afterwards cutting down what cannot properly be allowed to continue avoided.\n\nThe following are the conditions upon which it is proposed that the Church shall assume the maintenance of the school:\n\n- The school to be built and once completed equipped by the Government.\n- Subsequent purchases of outfit to be defrayed by the management.\n\nIn case, however, of the number of pupils authorized being increased beds will be provided.\n\nRev.

He claimed that he had asked for this year's age and that his special plea was that it be situate at or near Norway House. This request he says was ignored and he will not favor an Institution anywhere else. He proposed to see who would be willing to plant such a school on his reserve and would be willing to accept it from any source whatsoever.

With regard to the bringing in of children from Oxford House, I beg to say that as these Indians have not taken Treaty, and are so remote from civilization, it would be doubtful if children taken from that District, and educated at an Industrial School, would not, on their discharge and return to their homes, revert to the uncivilized customs of the rest of the Tribe.

John Semmens on His Way to Being Pupils to Brandon Institute.\n\nRev. John Semmens, principal of the New Indian Schools recently at Brandon, arrived in the city yesterday on his way to Norway house and likely will pass on Lake Winnipeg to bring down the supplies now coming from the several missions to the north. He is expected to leave on Thursday morning for West Selkirk, where he will take passage by the Northwest Navigation Company's steamer, Red River. He will probably arrive in Norway House about the 1st of July.\n\nRev. Semmens is very pleased with the farm and buildings provided for the institution. The school farm, he says, embraces half a section of land, immediately west of the Experimental Farm grounds northwest of Brandon. A large part of the land is under cultivation. The property is beautifully situated on the south side of the Souris River. A fine view is afforded from the Institution to the City of Brandon also of Chuter, the City of Selkirk, Norway House, ten miles west, and the country between.\n\nThe building is of brick on stone foundation, two stories high, 50 feet above the basement. It is in the form of an \"H,\" the main portion 30 feet in height and 30 feet in width. The front to the end of the wing is also 30 feet in height and 30 feet in proportion. The Smead-David system of heating and ventilating the entire building is used. Furnaces placed in the basement supply heat for the baths and kitchen, and also supply heated air for the whole building. Entering the building, the visitor finds the office to the left, and the reception room to the right. Proceeding, the class rooms are reached, one on each side of the hall, which is lighted by eight windows. In the rear are the dining-room and kitchens. Ascending one flight of stairs, another room is reached; it is furnished with machines for sewing, knitting, weaving, tailoring. In the same manner are arranged the rooms for members of the staff. Advancing toward the rear, the house comes to the dormitories, to the right those for the girls, to the left those for the boys, and to the left those for the girls. On either side are wash rooms and bath rooms for the convenience of the pupils. Passing to the third story, here are the rooms which are supplied from a well on the premises by means of a force pump, which is operated by steam. There are several rooms for members of the staff, also rooms for use in case of winter and rainy days. To the rear are the storeroom, nurses' room and sick room for boys and girls. The rooms for members of the staff are all comfortably furnished. The dormitories are supplied with beds, blankets, pillows, robes.\n\nThe following appointments to the staff of the institute have been made: Rev. John Semmens, principal; Mr. Spence, of Brandon, teacher; Mr. H. Todd, farm instructor; Mr. Jarvis, assistant; Misses Smith and Misses Peters; Henry Quackenbush, carpenter. Several other instructors are yet to be appointed; their names have not yet been submitted.\nIndustrial School. 130211\nBrandon, July 12th 1895.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI submit herewith a brief account of the journey recently undertaken under the direction of the Department for the purpose of bringing Indian children to the Brandon School.\n\nLeft Brandon, June 12th took the boat at West Selkirk on the evening of the 13th. Made a good run first night, reaching Bull's Head shortly after breakfast of the second day. Stayed until evening wooding up, proceeded northward during the night and anchored off Berens River early in the morning of the third day arriving at the latter place about dusk, after lying at anchor all day.\n\nJune 16th-17th, Discharging cargo, and spending the Sabbath day in rest at Berens River.\n\nJune 18th, Steamed out of Berens River harbor at night fall, anchored at Swampy Island 12 miles from point of starting at 10 P.M.\n\nJune 19th, Left Swampy Island after breakfast, Made Georgey's Island about 50 miles, anchored early in the afternoon. Left Georgey's late at night arriving at Warren's.\nWarren's Landing at 4 O'clock on the 20th.\n\n21st. All day hard aground.\n\n22nd. Started a boat to Norway House for assistance. Put off some cargo, moved a little way and grounded again.\n\n23rd. Put off some more cargo and go on the way reaching Norway House about noon.\n\n24th--25th. Discharging cargo at Norway House\n\n26th. Got the children on board steamer and proceeded a few miles south, and anchored for the night.\n\n27th. Started early broke the wheel in the first hour, cast anchor 22 miles from Norway House and sent for assistance.\n\n28th. Loaded stones on the steamer all the day to lift the wheel out of the water. Piled cordwood in the bow, Boys helped well. Wheel put on late at night.\n\n29th. Started early, ran four miles and went hard on a rock Compelled to send back to Norway House for assistance.\n\n30th. Worked hard all day trying to free the steamer from the rock.\n\n1st July (Monday morning) Steamer left the rocks at 9 A.M. proceeded up stream about four miles and anchored through stress of weather.\n\n3rd July. Weather still stormy, Did not move until 9 P.M. when we got free and moved southward to Georgey's Island.\n\n4th July. Ran against heavy winds all day, reached Swampy Island by dark. Continued to Bull's Head during the night.\n\nReached\nReached Selkirk early in the morning of the 5th, were taken across to East Selkirk, and reached Brandon sometime after midnight.\n\n6th July. Moved the children from the cars into the Industrial School.\n\nIt might be observed that we should have reached the end of our journey on the 30th, had we made good time from Norway House. Detention will naturally increase the expense of the trip unless the Company should charge for what might have been a straight course between Norway House and Selkirk.\n\nI found a very determined compact against Brandon among the Treaty Indians, who seemed resolved not to send their children to this place. Owing to the distance from Lake Winnipeg, and the impossibility of the parents ever seeing their children during their stay at the school, this was the one general reason for their opposition to this site. At Norway House, in addition to the foregoing there was also manifested a very great unwillingness to have the children used for any purpose other than in the school. They had entertained the thought that it was the purpose of the Department to make money out of their children and to this they had determined not to submit.\n\nIt was a pleasant feature of our journey that with the exception of a slight cold no child has had any sickness since the day of our leaving Norway House.\n\nOn our arrival here, I called Doctor Spencer, and asked him to examine the children individually, and to report...\nreport to you.\n\nI am not aware if this report has as yet been forwarded.\n\nI am, etc.\n\nsgd, John Semmens.\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian, Industrial School,\nBrandon.\nJuly 18th, '96.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI send herewith the amount of the N.W.N.Co.S. bill for the transport of our children from Norway House to Selkirk. These are regular rates, but this bill is larger owing to delays on account of our being on the rocks and otherwise hindered.\n\nI have written the Manager who maintains that his charges are right, yet offers to accept $600.00 in immediate settlement as the money is needed. He will expect full amount in case of delay, or difficulty, involving expense.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(signed) John Sommerns.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nH.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev. John Simmons, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, enclosing the account of the North West Navigation Company for the transport of pupils together with a copy of his diary for the trip. And in reply I beg to say that although the Department has paid the account at $900 it is not satisfied as it still considers this an excessive charge. It is remarked that the fare charged for the pupils is the same as asked for the Principal, and that the Principal's diary shows that the trip took six days longer than the required running time, the Department should not be held responsible for the delays and charges for the board of the pupils from that time. The charge for meals is considered too high by at least 10 cents per meal, 75 cents a day for the board of an Indian child is more than enough to compensate the Company. It is presumed that these children had no better accommodation than is given to deck passengers while they were apparently charged full cabin rates. Children are invariably charged only half-rates and school children.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina,\n\nH.W.T.\nchildren if over the recognized age are entitled to the same reduction while going to or returning from school.\n\nMr. Siemens, the Department considers, should have before leaving Winnipeg made satisfactory arrangements instead of leaving the Company at liberty to make any charge it thought proper, and in connection with this I enclose a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Inspector McColl on 22nd of May last from which it will be seen that the Department considered the amount then asked excessive.\n\nThe Department expects its officials to exercise as much economy and care in carrying out its instructions as they would do in managing their own private business, and it must be conceded that no one would be expected to or pay such high rates as those charged by the Company for the services rendered if the money had to come out of their own pockets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt.-Genl.\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina,\nN.W.T.\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE OPENING OF THE BRANDON INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nRev. John Semmens, chairman of the Lake Winnipeg District, was absent from the session of Conference at Regina, having been instructed by the Bishop of Rupert's Land to go to Brandon and take charge, at Norway House and other points on Lake Winnipeg, of the Indian children who are to attend the Boarding School in that place. He expects to return about July 1 with about forty pupils, possibly more. He left for the north on the day following the close of the autumnal session of the Conference, Thursday, June 13, by the Southwest Navigation Company's steamer, Root River.\n\nMr. Semmens is very much pleased with the farm which has been provided for the purpose of the Institute. The farm, he says, embraces half a section of land immediately west of the Experimental Farm grounds, on the Assiniboine, west of Brandon. A large part of the land is under cultivation. The property is beautifully situated on the north side of the Assiniboine River. A fine view is afforded from the institute grounds overlooking the river, Chats, ten miles east, and of Kemnay, ten miles west, and the country between.\n\nThe building is of brick on stone foundation, three stories in height, above the basement. It is in the form of a T. The front is 82 feet in length and 30 feet in width. The wing from front to end of the wing is also 92 feet; and the width of this portion 30 feet. The open Doric system of heating ventilation and closets is used. Furnaces placed in the basement heat the water for the baths, kitchens, etc., and supply heated air for the whole building. On the first floor are the office, reception room, two class rooms, library, dining-room, schoolroom, kitchens; on the second, the seamstresses' room, private rooms for members of the staff and dormitories for the pupils; fifth floor, private rooms and bath-rooms supplied with every convenience. The third story contains six tanks which are supplied from the spring, the kitchen, recreation rooms, store room, nurse's room and sick rooms.\n\nAs the training of Indians in industrial institutions is opened the question arises, how can these young people, on the completion of their training, be enabled to earn their living in the \"white race\"? They will not be able to return to their former homes and pursue the industries, blacksmithing, carpentry, tailoring, shoemaking, etc., of which they will have acquired. If they scatter through the white settlements and try to earn their living there, they will starve. Their existence for the benefit of other Indians will, to a great extent, depend upon their ability to earn what the great majority of the people, those who cannot be trained in industrial institutes, to make them self-supporting. The Indians are now living in sections of the country unsuitable for agriculture. Their present means of subsistence hunting, fishing, gathering berries, etc., are year to year more precarious. To remove the whole population to agricultural districts and supply them with draft animals, stock, implements, etc., the training requisite to make them farmers, would be beyond the resources of the government if practicable. An experiment begun a few years ago in Alaska and now stated to be resulting successfully concerns the raising of reindeer here. Sixteen reindeer were imported at an expense of a couple of thousand dollars, and some Laplanders were sent out to teach the Indians how to raise, train and use them. The Laplanders, it is said, will return to their own country when the Indians have learned the business, but by that time the Alaskans will understand the reindeer business and will be able to live independently. When in Winnipeg the other day, Rev. John Semmens was asked how he thought such a plan would work in the Indians south of Lake Winnipeg. The plan was not new to him; Sir John Schultz, the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba, had visited the reindeer station upon the subject, warmly advocating the enterprise. Mr. Semmens pointed out that nature has already provided the facilities for the development of such an industry; as there are thousands of reindeer running wild in the north country, proving its adaptation to the feeding of these animals.\nAugust 9th, 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly tell me what is the custom where the Principal and his family live in an Institution like this. Is he provided for by the labors of the staff, or does he have his own help to do his own work, in cooking, washing, ironing, and waiting.\n\nYour answer will be used to guide in our affairs here. Two or three members of the Staff object to the extra work occasioned by the family. I want to follow precedent and rule in this and all matters.\n\nThe happiest would be the erection of a Principal's house separate from the main building if the cash would warrant us in proceeding in that direction.\n\nIt seems a pity that there is not a set of rules for the guidance of each officer in the class of Schools. If there is\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nis printed such a set, I shall be glad to receive it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(sd.) John Semmens.\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Industrial School.\nBrandon, Man.\nAugust 9th, 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA private letter from Fisher River says that a number of children some Treaty, and some non-Treaty desire a place in this School.\n\nThe writer offers to bring them in about the last of August if the Department will bear the expense. What answer shall I make to him? His name and address is as follows:\n\nRev. R. Steinhauer, Fisher Bay, Manitoba.\n\nAwaiting your early reply.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(sgd.) John Semmens.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina,\nN.W.T.\nDear Sir:-\n\nYour letter of the 12th instant received and in reply I beg to say that there must be some misapprehension in regard to the first paragraph of your letter in which you say that I gave as the cost of meals an Estimated sum of 15 cts. each. I certainly did not understand you or you did not understand me, because the lowest charge we ever made as far as I recollect was 35 cts. and I do not now see any reason why we should give meals to the Government for less money than we charge private individuals or a Company like the Hudsons Bay Coy who give us a large amount of freight, while we receive no freight business to speak of from the Government.\n\nIn the second paragraph of your letter you say what is correct, that the steamer was delayed six days and this was no fault of yours. I might remind you of a remark\n\nRev John Semmens,\nPrincipal of Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon.\nremark you made when you landed at Selkirk to the effect that the delay was no fault of the men in charge of the Steamer, that they were on the proper channel but the water was low, and this being correct there is no practical reason why we should board people for nothing. We were not to blame for the delay of the Steamer.\n\nIn reference to clause 3, I may say it is customary to charge the same fare no matter whether people are in the hold, or in the cabin. You are aware there are only 2 cabins in the Steamer in question, and these belong to the Officers, and are only given up to passengers as a matter of courtesy. The trip to Noway House is most hazardous, and it is more than likely that the same Steamer if kept on this trade will be wrecked some day. In consequence we charge double and sometimes treble to this point, than we do to other points on Lake Winnipeg. I think the charge to the Government under the circumstances a fair one. However at your request we would offer as a settlement that the Government pay us $600.00. This is the sum we tendered for this service charged you in the account. You will recollect all steamboat\nsteamboat and tug owners were asked to tender, and you did not get an offer below $600.00, as far as I have learned. We are not showing any desire to overcharge you when we place the service at the same figure as we did when we knew a half dozen other boat owners were offered the work.\n\nI make this offer without prejudice, and unless the matter is settled without trouble or expense to our Company, we of course will expect payment in full as per our first account rendered.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Wm. Robinson.\nIndian Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.,\nAugust 13th, 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the Department's letter of the 2nd instant, re N. W. N. Company's Bill for the transport of the children now at the School; I beg to say that before leaving Selkirk I had an interview with the Managing Director of the said Company as to the charges. He promised no special reductions, but said that regular rates would be charged. This I understood to mean a regular reduction however in the case of small children. Meals were referred to, and I certainly understood that meals were to be given for not more than 25 cts.\n\nWhen the bill was presented it was so out of proportion with my estimate of what it would be that I wrote immediately to Capt Robinson of Winnipeg taking exception to it on three counts.\n\n1. The cost of the meals.\n2. The delay of six days.\n3. The high rate of passage for small children under deck.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina,\n\nN. W. T.\nI append his reply which I did not send before for various reasons.\n\nIt must not be supposed that I received any special attention or accommodation over that which the children received. I slept in the hold with them, and ate very much what they were eating. There was no difference in the provisions made for sleeping. None of us were provided with beds. All slept on the hard oak floor of the hold.\n\nThe Department should understand that when no special arrangement could be made, regular rates had to be followed, and will kindly observe what Capt Robinson says to this.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(signed) John Semmens.\nIndian Industrial School,\nBrandon Man.,\nAugust 2nd 1895.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn presenting my monthly report of provisions used I find this difficulty. We have a limited number of officers, but my own family must be considered. My wife should be classed with the officers who are to draw rations, and my children with the children of the schools. Reckoned in this way we are now 52 in all as per note under the head of remarks in report. Any other method would be likely to provoke the jealousy of the staff, and give rise to trouble.\n\nAt any rate we are rather than over the amounts allowed in most cases so that for this month no difficulty presents itself, but for the sake of a general understanding I think it best that a basis of calculation should be agreed upon between this office, and the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(signed) John Sammons.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev.

J. Semmens,\nBrandon:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 13th Instant received; and in reply would say I cannot see any reason why the Department should feel dissatisfied regarding the charge made for conveyance, &c., of Indian children from Norway House, because when the Indian Agent, Mr. McGoll, asked for tenders for this service, our tender was the lowest, viz: $600.00. I was told at the Indian Office that this tender was too high and that it would not cost that much at the regular fare. The steamer got aground out at Norway House and in this way the cost came to $727.20. If you take off .10\u00a2 per meal you will find this will not amount to as much as I reduced the account to when I offered to accept $600.00 in settlement. Ten cents per meal would only amount to $93.60, and I took of $127.20. However to settle this matter so there may not be any unpleasantness in the future; I would offer to carry all the children the Department may require brought in for $7.00 per head and twenty five cents per meal. We intend to send some kind of a steamer or tug to Norway House, leaving Selkirk on the 14th September on the morning of that day, and if you expect any considerable number of children it would be necessary for us to send the \"Red River\" as a tug might be able to carry all the freight going out but would not have sufficient room to bring in many children. Let me know therefore and we will prepare accordingly. It might be an advantage for you to remember that the Fall of the year is our slack time and if you wish to stop a day anywhere we will not be so particular as we were in the Spring, as from your knowledge of the Lake trade you will remember that every person requires this work done in June or July and for this reason we cannot afford\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\ncontention of the Department that the former charges were excessive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence relative to the position occupied by the wife and family of the Rev: Mr Semmens, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School I beg to say that it is understood that that gentleman has seven children who with his wife are living in the Institution. This must naturally militate against the interests of the school and such a condition of affairs should not be continued, but as there is as yet no residence for the Principal on the school premises, arrangements may be made for renting a house for his family in Brandon, at as cheap a rate as can possibly be had.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.,\nwith me.\n\nSo you may ask as a favor of him to send one or two boys, and if convenient some girls too. If they would rather go to School on the Reserve than to go to the Industrial School, they will never be able to talk English good, or they will go back to heathenism.\n\nI have seen a lot of Sioux Indians around here, but they are not as clean or as of good appearance as those Indians who live in the Moose Woods Reserve.\n\nI will be very glad to hear from you soon.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(signed) Chas.

When I reached there, Mr Semmens told me that Major wanted to see me, so he drove me back to the Town again, and I saw Major, who was in the Hotel. We had a good private conversation there, and when Mr Semmens came back to the hotel, we started to go home and I was much pleased to see all the boys and girls at supper time.\n\nThey cannot talk English good yet, and I think, perhaps they will not be able to write letters to their friends to where they all came from. As I was asking Major, if he would get an address from the pupils of the Brandon Industrial School, he say, he did not get any address from them, because they could not talk English good yet.\n\nI hope you will send some of my friends to this School, as you told me to take some boys to Brandon School last June, but I could not get them, because Mr Tucker has not allowed them to come\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, Assin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On this account he felt the position keenly. I succeeded however in removing this impression and he went back quite in accord with the Department's proposal.\n\nIn discussing details Mr. Semmens requested that the rations now drawn for his wife and for the 4 children between 4 and 12 years of age, might be continued after their removal from the school.\n\nHayter Reed Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nBut in view of the Department's letter No 64411 of October 29th, stating that no rations can be drawn, and of another letter No 64411-5 of October 16th expressing a preference to pay a higher salary than to make any allowances, except fuel, I would recommend that his present salary be increased by $300.00 per year.\n\nI have not yet heard from Mr. Semmens as to whether a suitable house can be had in Brandon, though I do not anticipate any difficulty in that respect.\n\nI presume some expenditure will be necessary in furnishing the house to be rented.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\nIndian Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nNov. 6th 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your direction re the rent of a house in Brandon for the use of my family during the winter, I have made as diligent a search as possible, and find that the only house which I can think of renting is one owned by John Hanbury near the Central School for which he asks the monthly rental of eighteen dollars.\n\nThis house is brick, has seven rooms, bath, closet, cellar, and stable. There is a furnace in the basement and both soft and hard water. Have looked at many houses, and think this the only suitable one. Should you order the renting of this house, I will proceed to the removal of what furniture we have, and then send list for your approval of articles wanted giving prices for the same.\n\nI cannot but think that this contemplated move will be both expensive and inconvenient.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(signed) John Semmens.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nOTTAWA 14th November 1895\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant recommending that an increase of $200 be given to Mr. Simmons, Principal of Brandon Industrial School in lieu of fuel, light and rations for his family; and in reply I beg to say that the proposed increase will be allowed him while his family is living in the town.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n[Signature]\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Principal of the Brandon Industrial School relative to the renting of a house for his family in Brandon and stating that he has been offered one by Mr John Hambury, which will suit his purposes for $18 a month; and in reply I beg to say that authority may be given for renting this house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nNovember 18th 1896.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th, I beg to say that you may rent the house owned by Mr John Hanbury at a rent of $18.00 a month.\n\nThe Department will also allow you an increase of $300.00 in your salary in lieu of fuel light and rations for your family while you are living in Town.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(signed) A.

Am also informed therein that the Department will increase my salary $200.00 in lieu of fuel, light and rations for my family while living in town.\n\nIn reply permit me to quote from my agreement with the Department as represented in a letter from Sup. Gen. to Dr Sutherland under date Dec. 29th-94.\n\n\"In a communication received from the Indian Department some time ago, it was intimated that the salary of the Principal of the Brandon Institute would begin with eight hundred Dollars with the possibility of increasing to $1000.00 when the number of pupils in attendance would warrant it. I then wrote whether in addition to the salary there would be any provision for the board of the Principal and his family. In reply I am informed by the Deputy Superintendent General that board and lodging will be provided.\"\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nprovided for the wife of the Principal, and for their children under twelve years of age. The Rule of the Department is that children of employees of the Department over that age living with their parents at such Institutions or on Reserves has to be paid for.\n\nNow from this it appeared that I might claim 2 full rations and 5 child's rations as my rightful share. It will be seen I think that the two Hundred Dollars advance promised in your letter will not equal the privileges at first conceded.\n\nI am then at a loss to understand how the amount specified applies. Am I to purchase everything for my own House and family and self in the way of Fuel, Board and Light for the next seven months on the allowance mentioned? I shall expect to take two girls to the house in town, and give them some special advantages. Are these also included in the foregoing?\n\nUnderstood thus I should regard the matter as a hardship and I have no idea that the Department desires to make suffer an injustice. If I am allowed to have my share of coal from the supply here as in the case of Mr Todd and Mr Jarvis, if permitted to get my vegetables and milk in the same way and rations as in the original agreement, I shall understand how to proceed. It is impossible for me to do other than this as I now see it.\n\nThe girls who go with me also claim their rations there as here. This reduces the case to this\nNovember 22nd 1895.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, respecting the increase of $200.00 per annum in your salary, and in reply to say it is thought that if the Department allowed you fuel and light in addition to the increased amount, you would be compensated for the rations you would otherwise receive for your family and servants if living in the Institution.

They are not allowed to use bad language, but they frequently use bad words and call each other by nasty names.\n\nSometimes they persuade me to do something that is not good or right, so I don't want to associate with these ignorant and self-willed Indian children.\n\nI struck one boy last night because he was teasing me down in the closets and tried to lock me in. When I got out I hit him and he always calls me names. I told Mr Simmons about it, but he did not make him stop and I am afraid they will make me wild and quarrelsome soon.\n\nI would like to stay here only till next June, because I don't want to quarrel with these boys all the time. I would rather go back to the reserve to work on the farm than teach school, because my friends want me to work with them, especially in hay making time, but I want to do whatever you tell me to do, because you know better than I know.\n\nIf Mr. Simmons can't make these boys stop quarrellings, you may be able to do something to them.\n\nThat boy whom I hit wants to stab me with a Jack Knife at the prayer time, but I am not afraid of him.\n\nThe teachers and carpenter are not very kind to me or help me in my studies, and when I ask them anything, they said: all right; will see, and they did not do it.\nI would be pleased, if you would answer this letter and I would be greatly obliged.\n\nI am Sir.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nChas.

He is regarded as a bothersome boy. He is much in advance of the others and he expects to associate with the members of the Staff rather than with the pupils.\n\nWhen the heads of Departments are busy of course this may not be, and Charlie is sensitive\nsensitive and feels the snub. I often take him into my office and ask his help, or if time permits talk English to him for the sake of his practice in the language. I think he has less to complain of than any other but being alone in standing and unable to talk Cree, he may at times be lonely.\n\nArrangements are now made for his entering the common school, he begins on Monday next, and I think that his quarrelling will scarcely be in order hereafter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd.

Mr Reed then assured us that information might be obtained before that time.\n\nThere is a chance of communicating with the north about the date above given but the space for the necessary correspondence is already very limited and after the time in question no possibility remains of communicating with Kawatin until June 15th or after.\n\nShould I be directed to obtain say 50 or more I could inform our missionaries at the several Mission stations occupied by our Church to have the number desired in readiness so that without extra travel, delay or expense, the whole case might be reached.\n\nThen\nThen I should like to know whether it would be expected by the Department that I should accompany those who may be discharged to their homes and bring back new pupils or whether the Agents of the Government would be asked to render this service.\n\nShould it happen that the writer be asked to undertake the work of gathering up the pupils then arises the question of transit. I know that it was thought last summer that the charges were very high and I anticipate the question how can this be lessened for the future.\n\nIn reply I answer that if an open boat were provided and authority given to purchase necessary provisions for the journey and tents for proper shelter and utensils for preparing food the present Principal would do his utmost to reduce the cost of transit by the utilization of the pupils themselves leaving out of account the question of hire and of fare on steamers.\n\nThis however would consume time as we could only travel as wind and weather would permit and only in daytime unless conditions were especially good.\n\nHowever this whole question might receive due attention and my instructions be issued in time to make all needed arrangements or the question of expense may again perplex us.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd John Semmens.\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter of the 15th instant from the Rev Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, which explains itself.\n\nThe Estimates for 1896-7 as prepared here, contained an item for 65 pupils, and I would recommend that the maximum be allowed.\n\nThe proposition to bring down children in an open boat does not commend itself to my judgment. Though the fare on the steamer might be higher, the comparative freedom from liability to casualties should, it is thought, outweigh the financial consideration.\n\nShould it be decided to bring more children down, an opportunity would be thus afforded of carrying out your suggestion to have some of the parents visit the school, and I would therefore beg to recommend that 6\u2014say\u2014of the leading men be allowed to accompany the children.\n\nThe Rev Principal's mention of \"those who may be discharged\" is understood to be a reference to the pupils who\n\nThe Deputy of,\nthe Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwho are troubled with epileptic fits, among them being No 15, Robert Chubb whose return to the Reserve is recommended in Department letter No G4411-10 of October 9th 1895 (on our 1911)\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nOTTAWA 28th February 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant enclosing a copy of a communication from the Principal of the Brandon Industrial School asking that the number of pupils provided for at that Institution be increased, and that he be authorized to make arrangements for bringing in new pupils up to the increased number.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that in the Estimates for 1896-7, provision is made for 60 pupils, but as it is uncertain whether the Estimates will be passed at the present Session of Parliament, I would not feel justified in authorizing this number to be brought in before the Estimates are passed. However, it would be well for Mr. Simmons to write as he suggests to arrange for obtaining the additional number of pupils when required, and after provision has been made for increasing the grant, it will be time enough to arrange for bringing them down.\n\nThe pupil troubled with epileptic fits referred to in your letter should be returned to his home on the first opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nReg ins., N.W.T.\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs\nIndian Industrial School Brandon.\nApril 14th 1896.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret to state the following circumstance and yet am constrained to inform you and ask for direction in case of repetition of the offence.\n\nEarly in last winter one of the young men No 15, collared Mr Quackenbush who was then in charge and threatened to do him harm. This was reported to me next morning and an apology was made by the boy and accepted by Mr Quackenbush and all went well again.\n\nA couple of nights after Mr Todd came into the office a couple of the boys were fighting inside the building. He commanded them to stop and when he was not obeyed he interfered whereupon one of the number, a young man No 23 challenged him out to fight. Next morning this was as in the first case straightened out, with explanations, and apologies and accepted in the office.\n\nLast night another occurrence of the same kind took place and I have just compelled the young man, No 17, to make an humble apology to Mr Todd and as between persons that is arranged.\n\nThe\nThe point of trouble however lies in the disobedience and insubordination involved.

What in your judgement should we do.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd John Semmens.\nRegina, April 17th 1896.\n\nRev Sir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., relative to a case of insubordination on the part of three boys of the school under your charge, and asking for directions in the event of a similar case.\n\nIn reply I would observe that the measure you have adopted\u2014so impressing the offenders with a sense of their wrong doing as to lead them to apologize\u2014seems to be quite in the direction of what discretion would warrant, and wisdom would dictate, and it is hoped that any new offenders will be dealt with in an equally successful and satisfactory way.\n\nIf you think it advisable you may take a favourable opportunity to express to the pupils the deep regret such unruly behaviour on the part of any of them is calculated to cause not only to those placed in authority over them but also to all those who take an interest in their progress and general welfare. Each one should be made to understand that the whole institute may be brought into disrepute by the repetition of individual acts of this kind.\n\nRev principal.\n\nIndustrial School.\n\nPaddon.\nShould you be met however with the repetition of the offence by the same boy, you would I think be justified in using less leniency, such as depriving the boy of a holiday, or some other privilege, or by a simple diet for a day or two, or as a last resort, unless the boy had great provocation, by corporal punishment.\n\nIf the last it should not be more severe than a strapping on the hand, which should be administered in the presence of the whole school, and after such a full explanation of the case as will leave no doubt in the mind of any one as to the justice and necessity of the course pursued.\n\nConcerning your conjecture that the boys may combine in their opposition to constituted authority, I would say that while there is nothing in your letter to indicate that you will ever be called upon to meet a crisis of this nature, yet should such an occasion arise there would apparently be no practical course open to you other than to call in a policeman.\n\nI am etc.\n\nSgd A.E.

Forget.\n\nRev John Semmens.\n\nBrandon.\nRegina.\n\n13th April 1896.\n\nMy Dear Wadsworth,\n\nI am very sorry you were not able to leave Winnipeg yesterday, as the difficulty which has arisen at Brandon is from all appearances of alarming nature.\n\nThree of the pupils are under arrest charged with committing an assault upon one of the employees. The worst feature of the case, however, is that it would appear to be the result of a pre-arranged plan through a spirit of insubordination which has prevailed among some of the older pupils. I am afraid the boys are not altogether to blame in the matter. You better therefore stay at the school some few days and make a full enquiry into all the circumstances which may have lead to this deplorable state of affairs, as also into certain difficulties existing between certain of the employees themselves, reporting the result here. Regarding the case against the three delinquents, I hope the circumstances are such as they may be let off on suspended sentence. It may be however, that their expulsion from the school might be found advisable. On this you will also kindly report.\n\nI hope this work at Brandon will not detain you more than\n\nT.P. Wadsworth, Esq.\nthan a few days, although I should prefer it to be done at the same time as thoroughly as possible.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nsgd A.E. Forget.\nIndian Industrial School.\nBrandon.\nApril 20th 1896.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs stated in my telegram of the 17th inst., three boys were arrested on the evening of that day and sent to the police court. On Saturday they were tried before a Police Magistrate, and in view of apparent carelessness (indifference?) were sent to the Gaol for a week. After the sentence came the telegram from your office directing me to delay the proceedings until matters should have been talked over with Inspector Wadsworth. I have been to the Depot two nights in succession but have failed to identify him. Your letter of this morning explains the reason of the delay.\n\nNow as to the circumstances of the case, I was in town at the time and a few minutes before the occurrence telephoned Mr Todd and satisfied myself that all was well. It appears that Mr T found one of the boys misbehaving a little later and told him to desist. This he flatly refused to do, the Officer persisted, there was continued refusal.\nrefusal whereupon Mr Todd laid his hand upon him and compelled obedience. As soon as this was observed the other boys near came to the pupils aid and all three joined in the assault only one person actually striking blows but others holding Mr Todd. It is verily believed that but for the timely arrival of Mr Quackenbush Mr Todd would have been roughly handled.\n\nMr Todd immediately drove into town swore out a warrant and asked for police interference.\n\nMy own consent was given on the following grounds:\n\n1) This had occurred three times before and the officers were annoyed at my laxity in only demanding apologies. It was of course time to protect ourselves (2) The boys had been repeatedly warned that this arrest might follow a repetition of this offence. (3) The offence was as far as I could gather without sufficient cause. (4) It was time that some deterrent influence were brought to bear upon others who threatened vengeance upon Mr Todd and who were quite inclined to be ugly and defiant.\n\nNext morning the Magistrate determined to dispose of the case but the boys were laughing and apparently enjoying the farce, I had asked that they be incarcerated but for the night but they were so defiant still that the Magistrate thought it better to leave them to their thoughts for a week. I shall await the coming of Inspector Wadsworth and if he thinks best we can jointly request their release.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd John Semmens.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a copy of all the correspondence relative to some cases of insubordination on the part of the pupils at the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nMr Chief Inspector Wadsworth is now at the Institution, and his report on the matter, when received, will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy.\n\nof the Supt General.\n\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 29th, 1896.\n\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith for your information copy of correspondence relative to insubordination among the pupils of the Brandon Industrial School and the measures taken by the Reverend Principal for the repression of the same, which speaks for itself.\n\nI may add that Mr. Inspector Wadsworth has been sent to the school to investigate and report on the very regrettable occurrences referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) HAYTER REED\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev.

It is matter for regret that under any circumstances police interference should have been invoked, but it is possible that this was a case where the choice lay between police interference and complete insubordination in the school. Where grown up young men are admitted into such an Institution, the difficulties in the way of general control are greatly increased, and it may be that sometimes a severe lesson is needed to prevent complete lawlessness. It would appear that in this instance milder methods were tried repeatedly, but without good effect.\n\nI have the Honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Deputy Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have the honour to refer to my letter of even number of the 22nd Ulto, relative to the insubordination of 3 pupils at the Brandon Industrial School, and to say that the report, therein promised, of Mr Chief Inspector Wadsworth, was forwarded to the Department yesterday, with marginal notes.\n\nThe results of the Chief Inspector's investigation and of my own observations when visiting the school, have convinced me that some radical changes are called for, which I hope to be able to submit personally for your consideration, at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Supt General,\nof Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

That they be allowed to increase the number of pupils\nas soon as practicable to one hundred.\n\n2. That the buildings already authorized by the Depart-\nment be completed.\n3. That some additional requisites in the way of live stock and implements be provided.\n\n4. That the Department make provision in the near future for a dairying industry in connection with the Institution.\n\nAs to proposed rate.\n\nCost of maintenance during year 1896-97.\n\nManagement and Maintenance $10758.40\n\nFurniture 1520.00\n\nBuildings 1258.38\n\nAggregate $13536.78\n\nPer Capita Cost for management and maintenance was on average attendance of pupils $224.42\n\non number enrolled 199.13\n\nAggregate per capita cost including furniture buildings &c. $250.49\n\nThis included travelling expenses of pupils and official obtaining them.\n\nPer capita grant to other schools varies in accordance with distance from Railway communication and other circumstances affecting cost of maintenance and is as follows:\n\nBattlesford $145.00\n\nSt. Boniface (Hochelaga) 130.00\n\nLafayette 115.00\n\nRed Deer 130.00\n\nRegina 120.00\n\nSt. Boniface 110.00\n\nThe rate allowed St. Boniface last year was $105.00 but it proved insufficient and the Department had to pay a deficit of $3561.40.

That they be allowed to increase the number of pupils as soon as practicable to one hundred.\n\n2. That the buildings already authorized by the Department be completed.\n3. That some additional requisites in the way of live stock and implements be provided.\n\n4. That the Department make provision in the near future for a dairying industry in connection with the Institution.\n\nAs to proposed rate.\n\nCost of maintenance during year 1895-96.\n\nManagement and Maintenance $10753.40\nFurniture 1520.00\nBuildings 1258.00\n\nAggregate $13526.00\n\nPer Capita Cost for management and maintenance was on average attendance of pupils $224.92\non number enrolled 199.13\n\nAggregate per capita cost including furniture buildings &c. $250.49\n\nThis included travelling expenses of pupils and official obtaining them.\n\nPer capita grant to other schools varies in accordance with distance from Railway communication and other circumstances affecting cost of maintenance and is as follows:\n\nBattleford $145.00\nSt. Joseph's (High River) 150.00\nGatineau 115.00\nRed Deer 130.00\nRegina 120.00\nSt. Boniface 110.00\n\nThe rate allowed St. Boniface last year was $105.00 but it proved insufficient and the Department had to pay a deficit of $2561.40. This year rate has been increased to $110.\n\nThese rates do not include medical attendance, medicine school material, material for repairs to building\u2014nor are they included in the proposed rate of $110, for Brandon.\nLast year at Brandon\n\nMedical attendance cost $290.50\nSpecial hospital treatment of a pupil $62.25\nMedicines $118.82\nSchool material $78.53\n\nSince beginning of current fiscal year the services of Dr. Fraser have been engaged to give medical attendance as required at fixed rate of $20.00 per month.\n\nFrom the foregoing it would seem that the proposed rate of $110.00 is very reasonable and that if it be granted the per capita cost including medical attendance, medicines and school material would be about $115.00 per capita for 80 pupils.\n\nAs to the conditions -\n\n1.

(RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter of the 4th March last in which it was stated that the question of taking over the Brandy Industrial school by your Society would be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Board of Missions when a definite answer would be given to the Department. I should be glad to know what action has been taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nRev. A Sutherland D.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental letter of February 17th, No. 64411, and my answer thereto of March 4th, stating that the letter would be laid before the Executive Committee of the Board of Missions, and a definite reply sent thereon, I beg now to say that the memorandum of the terms upon which the Brandon Industrial school is to be assumed by the Missionary Society on a per capita basis, seems to be fair and reasonable, and they are agreed to accordingly, with the understanding that any unforeseen circumstance or emergency not covered by these terms, would be considered by the Department on its merits, and such action taken as the case would fairly call for.\n\nI observe that nothing is said in the memorandum as to the expense of bringing new pupils to the Institute, or sending them home when their term expires, or when their removal may be ordered by the Indian Commissioner. This is a kind of expenditure which I think should be provided for by the Department outside of the per capita grant.\n\nIn order that the carrying on of the Institute on a per capita basis may be assumed by us under satisfactory conditions, it is important that steps be taken at once to increase the number of pupils to at least 80; the remaining 20 authorized by the Department to be dealt with subsequently from time to time as opportunity may afford. I would respectfully suggest therefore that the Principal of the Institute be authorized by the Department to proceed by the earliest steamer up Lake Winnipeg with a view to securing additional pupils for the Institute.\n\nIn this connection I would refer also to a suggestion made some\ntime ago by the Principal, namely that two or three of the older boys be taken to visit the Reserves from which they came as the most effective way of removing any unfavorable impression from the minds of the Indians caused by misleading reports that have been circulated among them.\n\nThere is another point to which I would call attention that we deem of great importance, and that is, that all employees in the Institute who have been appointed by the Department should at once be notified that their engagement will terminate with the 30th day of June. This does not mean that there will be an entire change of staff, nor indeed that any change will be made without good and sufficient reasons, but simply that the employees may understand that from the time that the Institute is assumed by the Missionary Society on the per capita basis, all appointments or dismissals rest with the Principal and the authorities of the Missionary Society. Without this, as we view it, it will be impossible to maintain either discipline or efficiency on the part of the employees. At the same time no employee will be retained who, in the judgment of the Department, is inefficient or unsuited to the position.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn reference to the letter herewith from the Rev Dr. Sutherland on the subject of the transfer of the Brandon Industrial school to the Methodist Missionary Society on the per capita system, the undersigned begs to state that the Executive Committee of the Board of Missions say they are satisfied with the Memorandum of the terms upon which the school is to be assumed by them; but Dr Sutherland calls the attention of the Department to the omission in the Memorandum of any mention as to the expense of bringing in new pupils to the Institute, or sending them home when their time expires, and he states that he is of opinion that such expenditure should be provided for by the Department outside the per capita grant.\n\nThere is no appropriation specially made for the purpose of bringing in new pupils or returning those whose time has expired, although the Department has, from time to time, paid the expenses of pupils to Industrial schools in the first instance, and notably in the case of Brandon school when it paid $600 for this service. It was then thought that pupils might be had nearer the school at less expense. The Methodist Missionary Society are however, apparently anxious to bring pupils in from the upper end of Lake Winnipeg where they have a number of mission stations.\n\nThe return for March quarter from the Brandon school shows that there were 69 pupils enrolled, leaving II vacancies to be filled to bring the school up to its quota of 80 pupils, and if the Department sanctions the trip up Lake Winnipeg to obtain these pupils it should only be on the understanding that it was not to be called upon to go to any more expense in this direction.\nas the school once being filled up it is more in the interest of the Society than of the Department to keep up the attendance.\n\nThe suggestion to take two or three of the older boys for the purpose of reconciling the Indians to parting with their children and removing any unfavourable impression from their minds caused from misleading reports being circulated among them, is a good one and would it is thought have the desired effect, and was previously agreed to if another trip of the above nature was authorized.\n\nA good deal of friction is said to exist between the Principal and his staff and the attention of the Department has on several occasions been called to the lack of harmony existing among the employees, but owing to the contemplated handing over of the school to the Church authorities in the near future, it was decided not to make any changes and the Church authorities were informed that when this school was placed in their hands they would be at liberty to re-organize the staff to suit themselves.\n\nIt has always been recognized by the Department that when a school is placed on the per capita basis those assuming its control are responsible for its management and maintenance.\nAm informed that Todd's notice of dismissal at once.

Subsequently a written copy of the telegram was sent to him, when he at once discovered his mistake. I write this explanation so that the Superintendent General may know how Mr. Semmens' mistake occurred, and that there was no intention on his part or ours to interfere with what properly belongs to the authorities of the Indian Department.\n\nI also informed Mr. Semmens that he was authorized by the Department to go North for additional pupils, but I think he is waiting for official notification from Ottawa or Regina.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

Of course it would be practically impossible for the Principal to obtain the consent of the Indian Commissioner.\nbefore bringing the children thus obtained to the Institute. I assume the clause to mean that a pupil is not really \"admitted\" to the Institute until the name and other particulars have been reported to the Commissioner, and his consent obtained.\n\nTrusting that the future work of the Institute will be satisfactory alike to the Superintendent General, and to the Missionary Society,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't.

These children are represented as belonging to the Church of England, or their parents do, and it is thought that they should be educated at a Church of England School. I do not know anything as to the facts but I presume the Inspector's report ought to show all the facts in this connection. Mr. Wilson, of Elkhorn, I understand has raised an objection to their being educated at Brandon although he has not sent in any protest to the Department as far as I am aware. I presume that if the Missionary in charge of the Sioux Indians is dissatisfied he would send a protest to the Department and then the matter could be taken up. I hardly think that otherwise it is the duty of the Department to interfere.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOTTAWA, 30th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nThe Brandon school returns show that there are sixteen Sioux Indian children on the roll\u2014ten boys and six girls. Six entered in '97, four in '98 and six in '99. The religion of their parents is given on the return of admissions as Episcopalian.\n\nI do not see that the Department can interfere under the regulations with their being educated at a Methodist school instead of at one conducted by the Church of England. If the Church of England missionary to the Oak River Sioux had exerted himself in the matter they might have been sent to any of the Episcopal schools, but about the time of their admission to the Brandon school there was no accommodation at Elkhorn, as the new building was only occupied last fall.\n\nIt does not seem to me that the Department would be justified in interfering with these pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You advised me to fill out my quarterly reports with all I had in the roll, and it would probably be dealt with in a favorable manner.

D. McLean,\nSecretary\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal\nIndustrial school\nBrandon, Man.\nTHE BRANDON INDIAN INSTITUTE\n\nImpressions Gathered From Visitors of the General Board of Missions.\n\nOne of the leading topics of conversation among members of the Methodist general board of missions during the meeting at Brandon, outside of the immediate business of the board, was the Industrial Institute of the Canadian Industrial Institute. With splendid roads and fine weather, the drive is a most enjoyable one. The scenery, obtained from different points of view along the hills, is very pleasing in the fall when the leaves appear in varied tints; as well as in summer when the rich foliage covers the avenue in places with a green canopy. The institute has been visited by others through the experience of going there. The bird's-eye view of that institution, both from the air and from the ground, how to supplement with facts and experiences, is something which cannot be done under Mr. Bedford's superintendence.\n\nVisitors to the Industrial Institute are favorably impressed with the sight of the school buildings, which are located and admirably kept. After seeing how much energy, time, money, and skill are employed, together with the talents and enthusiasm of the instructors, who are doing the best interests of the pupils, some wonder why the Indians would not be better off such training. It may be said that the Indian boys and girls in such a school would be better off than white children. They are given the things which the white children need, but which is not provided for them. It is said that double the amount of work is done by Canadians as to the success of the industrial institute, and the solution of the Indian problem. It is possible that the industrial institute gives a measure of education. An Indian boy is not helped forward by being taught how to make a gun instead of an expert use of a gun; or by being taught how to make a writer rather than to make moccasins. If the forests of the remote north are to be opened up, the knowledge how to catch fish is more valuable than the knowledge how to make a shoe in a country where there never have been any shoes made before. To learn farming will be largely a lost of time if one is to live in a country where there are no cultivators.\n\nThe Reverend Ferrier is turning his attention to the problem of finding for his boys a good trade. He is using the knowledge and skill which they acquire. At the time of the visit, several of the boys who were away earning handsome wages in the harvest fields, gave good satisfaction to their employers. His girls, too, have no difficulty in finding good situations as domestics.\n\nOne incomprehensible feature of the Industrial Institute is the fact that one which nobody undertook to do, is the rigid exclusion of all white children from the advantages of the industrial training. That there are hundreds of white children who ought to be dealt with in the same manner is a fact. There are girls in Winnipeg who could earn a living, and there are boys here and elsewhere, of every nationality, who could grow up to be useful men if they had been given the opportunity. Indian children would be most efficiently taught English if they were brought up and played with English-speaking children. The teachers are opposed to the idea of exceptions of enforcing the speaking of English by children who are to be forbidden, almost with harshness, to speak their own language. The teachers feel greatly relieved, when they can get children from India, so that they may be obliged to use English, and not be obliged to be unable to understand each other's languages. They are convinced of the absurdity of the arrangement, if it were not for the fact that the children are of Dookhobor children, or those of any other nationality. No one can imagine anything more unreasonable for any class of foreigners an educational institution. The children are away from their homes, where the children are educated in their own language with English-speaking children, and yet they are forced to speak only English. A teacher of English in a Dookhobor schoolhouse said he did not find it difficult to get the children to speak English, whereas a teacher of English among English-speaking children answered: \"Yes, I find it difficult to get the children to do two-thirds of my work.\"\n\nPrincipal Ferrier's work is the fact that he makes the best use of the resources of the school. By means of a government grant, by means of the heating system, he has cut the expenses of the school down to $1,000. He uses pupil labor, under proper supervision, to keep the premises in proper repair. Just now the rooms are being painted, and added beauty to the brightness of the rooms. All the practical work, cooking, washing, mending, making of garments is done by the pupils, who receive the best kind of teaching. The school has a constant supply of all kinds of goods on hand, even in times of great and unfavorable times. The pupils are taught order and system in their work, and apparently with something like military exactness.\n\nMuch is said of the need of agricultural schools for Indians, but the establishment of an agricultural college is not likely to be carried out in the near future; but it will, according to present appearance, be accomplished. The country has so complete an equipment for teaching agriculture that it is practicable to go young people, as it has for the training of young Indians.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, informing me that the Department has decided that it cannot see its way clear to acquire the land applied for by Rev. Dr. Sutherland on behalf of the Brandon Industrial School, and also asking for my report on the application of the Principal of said School that the number of pupils be raised from 100 to 125.\n\nI visited the Brandon School last week to introduce the new Inspector for that district, Mr. Marlatt, and see the present state of the institution myself. I was much pleased with the condition of the school buildings; the ventilation is admirable, and the dormitories sufficiently large to accommodate 25 more pupils. If the full number of 125 were in the school there might perhaps be a little overcrowding in the dining room; but the class-rooms seem large enough for the desired increase. Altogether I approve of the number of pupils being increased from 100 to 125. The Principal, however, may not find it easy to recruit up to that number for a year or two.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.\nDeputy Supt.

Through an oversight I did not include this increase with the others in presenting the detail of increases to the Minister, so that it did not receive his approval, although it has gone into the estimates. I cannot say however that it was available until it has received the sanction of the Superintendent General.\n\nThere is no increase in the pupilage of any other Industrial School.

Ferrier\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nIt has been represented that Principal Ferrier of the Brandon School secures pupils for it by paying the parents so much to allow their children to go to this School, and that, while they may receive a fairly good education in the way of farming, etc., this is not adapted for their after life, and when they return to the reserves they are very little if at all improved from their previous condition.\n\nKindly let me have a report as to this.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\n\nOttawa, 30th March, 1906.\nOttawa, March 30, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn reply to the enquiries made in your memorandum of today with reference to the Brandon Industrial School I beg to say that there is nothing on file to show that the Principal of this school secures pupils by paying a bonus to the parents for allowing them to be placed there. He may, however, make some present by way of clothing or otherwise to induce them to part with their children, as it is said to be pretty generally the practice in the West to fill up the schools by this means. The denominational schools have clothing sent them, and I have learned from outside sources that they use it for this purpose, as the Indians will not give up their children voluntarily.\n\nThe Brandon Industrial School is one of the best managed institutions of this class in the Dominion, and the pupils have an excellent opportunity of acquiring a practical knowledge of general farming, but, as nearly all the pupils in this school are recruited from the country surrounding the northern end of Lake Winnipeg, which is not adapted for farming, they are not in a position to utilize the instruction they have received in agriculture when they return to their reserves. I have pointed this out in several previous memorandums on this school, and if the colony system for ex-pupils is to be followed, there are no ex-pupils so much in\nneed of segregation in an agricultural district as those from the Brandon school.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer to my memorandum of December, 1902, in which I referred to a clipping from the Winnipeg Free Press of October 3, of that year, which contained the impressions gathered by visitors of the Methodist General Board of Missions during their meeting at Brandon on the Brandon Industrial School, the gist of which was that the industrial education given the Indian children has sometimes been mis-directed. The article says\u2014\"An Indian boy is not helped forward by acquiring a knowledge of printing instead of an expert use of the gun; or a girl by being taught to use a typewriter rather than to make moccasins, if the forests of the remote north are to be their permanent home. To know how to catch fish is more valuable knowledge than how to make a horse-shoe in a country where there never have been, and probably never will be, horses. To learn farming will be largely a loss of time if one is to live where there is no land that can be cultivated\".\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was under the impression that the Department was guided by the policy of requiring the farms of such schools when once set in operation to provide their own implements and horses, and allow surplus of products of the farm not thus expended to go towards the support of the schools. Under this impression I struck out of the Regina School estimates for the next fiscal year, $90.00 for a gang plow and $400. for a farm team. The Principal of Brandon School sent in no estimate last autumn for implements and horses, and yet he is now made a liberal allowance therefor. I am glad that the Department can afford to be generous to our schools which are doing good work, and as Regina Industrial School under its management since Rev. Mr. Sinclair's decease has made an excellent showing, especially in regard to the returns from its farm, I hope the Department will see its way clear to grant now $400. for a team and $125. for a farm wagon to said School. I sent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\nto this school a small gang plow from Rupert's Land School that was not needed there.\n\nI assume from the tenor of your letter that Principal Ferrier has already been notified of the grant you mention; if not, let me know and I will advise him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nTo the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the vote made for this Institution for the year 1906-7 $100.00 is voted for plumbing the girls' and boys' washrooms. I have had Mr. Storey, the man who does the plumbing for this institution, give me an estimate of the actual cost and it will be $500.00.\n\nThere is also a vote of $100.00 to cement the stable floor; my request was $300.00. It simply can't be done for $100.00, and it is no use in making an attempt. The cost will be at the very least $300.00.\n\nI also notice the small sum of $80.00 for material for repairs, painting, renovation, etc. I am keeping a first class mechanic in the carpenter shop the year round and making this shop a schoolroom for from six to eight boys. In order to keep them busy and keep up the respectable tone and add to the general appearance of the entire property this vote ought to be at least $600.00.\n\nWhen in Ottawa in April last I pointed out to Mr. Scott the insufficiency of the vote for the above three purposes he requested me, when the time came, to write the Department for further instructions, hence this communication.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Mr. Perrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, with reference to the grant for improvements and repairs for the current year, I beg to say that it is the wish of the Department that the plumbing, for which an additional allowance of $400 has been authorized, should be given to Mr. Storey, plumber, of Brandon.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMontreal Sept. 15th, 1906\n\nSecretariat\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the month of April I called on your Dept. and had an interview with Mr. Pedley, and Mr Scott, regarding the taking of Indian children from reservations in Ontario for the Brandon Institute, after a considerable conversation, in the above question I was given to understand that each and every case should be considered upon its merits.\n\nSince coming here to the General Conference in Montreal I have had a conversation with the Rev. Mr. George Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute at Munsie. Regarding the same subject he informs me that he always has quite a number of applications for admission, but that he is unable to deal with, because of the school being full. What I wish to know from your Department is this.\u2014 If the Department will admit the Indian boys and girls of the reservations from which Munsie Institution draw their recruits to the Brandon Institution and paying the usual grant of $120.00 for each and every one admitted, provided in all cases the Principal of the Munsie Institution, the Indian Agent of the reservation concerned, the parents or guardian of the children, is agreed and sending them to Brandon. The management of the Brandon Institute paying all necessary costs to transport to and from school.\n\nA reply at your earliest convenience, sending it in care of the General Methodist Conference, St James Church, Montreal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nWill greatly oblige.\n\nI beg to remain your obedient servant,\n\nT. Finnie\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, asks for permission to recruit from Ontario. He explains the situation very clearly in his letter of the 13th inst., and I see no reason why he should be restricted in recruiting pupils to Manitoba.\n\nThe pupils he has obtained come from the upper end of Lake Manitoba, and while at the school are thoroughly instructed in farming, but they have no opportunity to follow farming when they return to their reserves.\n\nMr. Ferrier asks permission to recruit from Western Ontario. The Methodists have a school under their control at Muncey, and have always an overflow of applicants, and I can see no objection to Mr. Ferrier being allowed to take the surplus, on the distinct understanding that the Department shall not be called upon to pay for their transport. The estimates for this school provide for 115 pupils at a per capita grant of $120, and the last return showed that they had only 93 enrolled, with an average attendance of 90, which would leave vacancies for 25.\n\nThe Brandon school affords one of the best agricultural trainings obtainable in the West, and I am fully convinced that it would be to the advantage of the Indian children of Western Ontario to receive a course of instruction at this school. There would be no inducements for them to desert, and when they left the school they would be in a position to make good settlers. The Brandon school is\non a par with the Experimental farm, which adjoins it,\nand I know of no institution where better work is done.\nMr. Ferrier has managed to carry on his school successfully\nwith the per capita grant allowed him, and I think the\nDepartment would be quite justified in allowing him to\nrecruit from Ontario to the extent of the vacancies at\npresent in the school, on the condition that no extra\nexpense is entailed to the Department.\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, November 9, 1906.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn reply to your verbal enquiry for information as to the conditions upon which Indian children may be admitted to industrial and boarding schools I beg to say that the rule of the Department as embodied in the regulations respecting the education of Indian children is as follows:\n\n\"Nevertheless anything in these regulations contained no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic school or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. And no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a Protestant school or in a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nThis regulation is absolutely just and places Roman Catholics and Protestants precisely upon the same footing. If, however, the parents of children so placed in either a Protestant or a Roman Catholic school have changed their religion, which it is quite competent for them to do, then upon evidence of such fact being brought to the Department an order will be made for the discharge of their children, that they may be transferred to a school conducted by the denomination to which the parents belong, should the parents so desire and if there are vacancies.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOr, if parents while remaining Protestants are desirous that their children should be taken into and educated in a Roman Catholic school, upon a written statement to that effect signed by the parents, there is no objection to their admission; and visa versa. But this statement must be given in the presence of the Agent under whose charge is the band to which the Indian parents belong and must be certified by such Agent as having been understood by the parents and as embodying their wishes.\n\nThis is the ruling now in force in the Department in connection with the admission of Indian children to such schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 6, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIn September, last, the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon school, asked for permission to recruit from the Province of Ontario. His reasons for this application are stated in a letter of the 13th of that month, turned out herewith.\n\nOn a memorandum prepared by me on this subject Mr. McLean, who was then acting during your absence, raised the question as to whether it would be right to allow money voted for the education of Indians in the Northwest to be expended upon Ontario Indian children. No decision has been arrived at, and Mr. Ferrier has not been advised as to whether he would be allowed to recruit from Ontario or not.\n\nA memorandum on this subject is turned out herewith.\n\nMr. Ferrier, when here a short time ago, asked that a decision might be arrived at.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ferrier, who is still principal of the school and who occupies the official residence, is being charged in full against the revenue of the institution. The Assistant Principal is paid a salary of $300.00 a year, and owing to Mr. Ferrier's long absence upon work in connection with his position as Superintendent of the Indian Mission work of your Church, he is frequently left with the sole responsibility for the management of the School.\n\nIt is reported that the general usefulness of the institution suffers from this arrangement and under these circumstances I have to request that you will state how the payment of Mr. Ferrier's salary from the finances of the Brandon School and his occupation of the Principal's house can be justified. It would seem that such an important school should have the continuous services of a Principal who would receive a proper salary and be always in charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

As constant changes in the staff always tend to produce friction, I have to draw your attention to the fact that since April of 1907 you have had at least four Assistant Principals and that the present incumbent of the office is about to sever his connection with the school. It is not possible that you could delegate your authority as Principal to an Assistant Principal unless he be a very exceptional man and from the rate of pay which you have been allowing your Assistants it may be judged that they are not highly qualified. Such changes in the staff would also seem to indicate that the Assistant Principals themselves did not find their position congenial, although there is no direct evidence that such is the case.\n\nThese remarks are of course made without prejudice but owing to the fact that the Inspectors and other officers constantly drew attention to the situation at Brandon, it was thought advisable to bring the matter to the attention of the Rev.

Ferrier and his relation to the Brandon School and to the position of Superintendent of Indian Schools has been under our careful consideration.\n\nI have received a statement from Mr. Ferrier in reply to the various points raised by your letter of May 12, which we hope you will receive as a satisfactory reply.\n\nI would draw your attention to two points in Mr. Ferrier's statement. One is that in effect Mr. Ferrier's entire salary is paid by the Methodist Church, although it is felt by our Mission Board that his services both as Superintendent of Indian Education and as Principal of the Brandon School, have been entirely to the benefit of the work under the care of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe other point is that the Assistant Principal of Brandon School is a probationer for the ministry of the Methodist Church. Ordinarily a married probationer of the Methodist Church in the regular work of the ministry receives a salary less than $500 (Five Hundred Dollars). The Assistant Principal of Brandon School is receiving not only the salary of $500 (Five Hundred Dollars), but additional perquisites in the way of supplies, fuel, etc., from the school. From this standpoint he does not seem to have been unjustly treated.\n\nMr. Ferrier enjoys the confidence of our Mission Board as a man of exceptional tact and sympathy, and of unusual executive ability in the supervision of the Indian work.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. E. Egerton Shore,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6255, File 576-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nA reply to the communication from the Department of Indian Affairs, addressed to Dr. Sutherland bearing date of May 12, 1910.\n\nThis letter suggests six propositions that need careful consideration.\n\n1. Upon whom rests the responsibility for the policy which has been adopted for the management of the Brandon Institute during the past four years.\n\n2. The Department assumes that they are paying the salary of Mr. Ferrier as Principal of the Institute, and also for his services as Superintendent of Indian Schools and Hospitals from the funds supplied by the Government for the maintenance of the Brandon School, and that the Church is hardly justified in accepting of the same.\n\n3. That the salary paid to the Assistant Principal is insufficient, and not even fair when compared with the salary of the Principal.\n\n4. That the Assistant is left with the sole responsibility of the Institute during the absence of the Principal.\n\n5. The appointment of a Principal who can give all his time to the work of the Institute.\n\n6. \"That the general usefulness of the Institute suffers from the present arrangement.\"\n\nWe will deal with each of these propositions, and in the order in which they are named.\n\nFIRST PROPOSITION.\n\nUpon whom is the responsibility for the policy adopted for the management of the Brandon Institute during the past four years?\nWhen this appointment of Superintendent of Indian Schools and Hospitals was made Dr. Sutherland notified the Principal of the Brandon School and asked him to come East and go with him to Ottawa. This appointment was discussed with the Secretary of the Department from a two-fold point of view. (1) To receive the sanction of the Department and its co-operation with the duties of this new office which was agreeably assented to. (2) To make provision for the future management of the Brandon School and the policy that has been pursued for the past four years was suggested by the Secretary of the Department. In support of this suggestion it was urged,\n\n(a) That the Brandon School had become their Bamer Institute and that they were not willing that the Principal who had brought it to such a satisfactory condition should give up his control of it.\n\n(b) That the experience of seven years would be of such a value, that it would not be necessary for the Principal to spend all his time in Brandon providing he could secure a good assistant.\n\n(c) That there would be a vast amount of information gathered by visiting and inspecting other Institutes which could be incorporated into the management of the Brandon Institute, and thus make a model Institution for the education of the Indian boy and girl.\n\nAll of which was agreed to by Dr. Sutherland.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the Department is a partner to the policy adopted for the management of the Brandon Institute for the past four years.\n\nSECOND PROPOSITION.\n\nThe assumption that the Department pays the salary of Mr. Ferrier as Principal of the Brandon Institute, and also for his services as Superintendent of Indian Schools and Hospitals, and that this salary is taken from the funds of the Brandon Institute, a mode of procedure that cannot be justified.\nIf this were a fact and not a mere assumption, it would not be hard to justify such a course of action.\n\nThe Indians are wards of the Government, and all the work of educating them should be paid for by the Government. The work of the Principal of the Brandon School and also that of the Superintendent of Indian Schools and Hospitals is all in the interests of the education and welfare of the Indians. The Methodist Church agrees to run these Institutes and Hospitals for a certain per capita grant. Has she not the right to use the money thus earned to pay the salary of the agents she employs to carry out the terms of the contract? From this point of view the practice and policy of the Methodist Church need no justification.\n\nDealing with this particular proposition, what are the facts in the case?\n\nThe cost of the Brandon Institute for the past four years, for maintenance, not including the products of the farm and garden, nor any grant from the Government for the buildings and plant, is as follows:\n\n| Year ending June 30 | Net Cost | Gov't. Grant. | Paid by Church |\n|---------------------|----------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1907                | 12,500   | 1C,839        | 1161           |\n| 1908                | 12,000   | 1C,256        | 1744           |\n| 1909                | 13,500   | 1C,323        | 3117           |\n| 1910                | 13,500   | 11,000        | 2500           |\n| TOTAL               | 51,000   | 42,478        | 8522           |\n\nThe total received by the Principal for salary during the four years was $5,625. It will be seen from this that the Church has paid the salary in full and also contributed $2,897 toward the maintenance of the Institute during the four years, an average of $724 per year.\n\nIn the presence of these facts it is very clear that instead of the Government paying the salary of Mr. Ferrier, they have his services as the Principal of the Brandon Institute free.\nIn this connection it might be well to state that the Board has voted $12,000 per year for the Brandon Institute.\n\nDuring the last two years the Executive has supplemented this by a vote of $1,500. The full amount of Mr. Ferrier's salary, and this should be so reported in our Annual Report and not charged up to the maintenance of the Brandon Institute. Had this mode of procedure been adopted, the Inspector's report would not have been misleading to the Department, and thus it would have saved the Department from the humiliating position of assuming that they were paying the salary in full, and charging the Methodist Church with adopting a policy that she could not justify.\n\nTHIRD PROPOSITION.\n\nThat the salary paid to the Vice Principal is insufficient, and not even fair when compared with that of the Principal.\n\nThe Conference of 1907 gave the Institute a young man who had been ordained one year. He was married. The Institute provided him with a furnished house, fuel, provisions from the farm and garden, the keep of his horse, and $600 in cash.\n\nThe total received was equal to about $850 and a furnished house.\n\nThe Conference of 1906 stationed the Rev. H.B. Allison, the Secretary of the Conference. This appointment was made in view of Mr. Allison becoming the Principal if circumstances warranted it, and if such would be in the interests of the Institute. The salary he received was $800, a furnished house, with fuel, light, milk, vegetables, fruits and horse-keep. This was more than the Principal received the first year he was in charge of the School. If Mr. Allison stayed for another year the understanding was that he should receive $1000.\nThe Conference of 1909 gave a young married man who had travelled one year under a Chairman but had not been received as a probationer. His wife was to have taught one of the classes; both were to live in the main building (which means board, washing and necessary medical attendance), and receive $600. His wife was unable to teach for more than a month, and he received at the rate of $500 per annum for his services.\n\nThere were special reasons why each of these men did not stay longer than one year, and if necessary these reasons can be given. In the meantime it may be sufficient to say that in neither case was the question of salary among the reasons. Nor was there any lack of harmony between the Principal and these men.\n\nFrom these facts the Executive will be able to decide whether these men were dealt fairly with as far as salary is concerned.\n\nFOURTH PROPOSITION.\n\nThat the Assistant Principal is left with the sole responsibility of the Institute during the absence of the Principal.\n\nThere are certain duties that have always been performed by the Principal, such as, the laying out of the farm and garden for crop and improvements, the securing of recruits, which requires a trip over the Southern part of the Lake Winnipeg District each year, the keeping of all books and accounts, and the general oversight that gives unity and keeps harmony within the Institution.\n\nIf the engineer leaves his engine room for a short time, it is hardly correct to say that the engine has the sole responsibility of running the machinery.\nThe Principal has spent eleven of the best years of his life in this class of work, and it does not now require all his time to run one institute.\n\nWhen at home his duties as Superintendent of Schools and Hospitals have usually been attended to by giving an hour from 6 to 7 a.m., and from one to three hours after 8 p.m. in office work; and the rest of the day is largely devoted to the work of the Institute. He has never made any complaint about the amount of work he has been given to do on the one hand, nor has he on the other turned over the sole responsibility of the Brandon Institute upon his assistant.\n\nFIFTH PROPOSITION.\n\nThe appointment of a Principal who can give all his time to the work of the Institute.\n\nThe Present Principal never sought this position nor any other that the Methodist Church has seen fit to honor him with. And for the first two or three years he gave all his time, and worked long days in order to master all the details of every department of this Institute. But during the last eight years and more, particularly during the last four years, he has been doing a vast amount of work over and above the management of this one school. As an illustration of this during the year 1909 he visited all our Institutes, Boarding Schools, Hospitals (except Hazelton) most of our Day Schools, and a large number of our Indian Reserves. This was done to glean information and to get a grip of our Indian Work. To do this it was necessary to travel 36,000 miles, and to spend about one-half of his time away from home. But such extensive visiting and travelling is not a necessity every year, and consequently even more time can be\ngiven to the work of this particular Institute. However what he has done for the last four years he can continue to do so long as he enjoys the same good health and strength. He is not of the opinion that this Institute is degenerating in its usefulness and efficiency, and he would like action postponed until all the facts are before the Executive and the Department.\n\nSIXTH PROPOSITION.\n\n\"That the general usefulness of the Institution suffers from this arrangement.\"\n\nThis ought to have some particular proof. A few questions might be asked, and in order to answer them some proof may be arrived at, or sufficient information to prove that there is no foundation for the statement.\n\nAre the buildings degenerating in usefulness, and in their general appearance? Is the main building not kept well-heated, ventilated, clean, and thoroughly sanitary?\n\nAre the live stock depreciating in value? Are they not in good condition? Is the farm and garden not well worked and made profitable as a training school for boys, and also as an asset in running the Institution?\n\nAre any members of the staff over-worked, or under-paid? Are any of them complaining because of the treatment they receive?\n\nIs the business of the School not well conducted? Are there any debts to pay? Are any of the merchants finding fault for not being promptly, and regularly paid? Is the Bank account over-drawn? Or, has the Department been called upon to pay any deficits for\nmaintenance, or to pay the salary of the Principal, or have they any similar school that is run as economically, and have they one they would like to hold up as an object lesson for the management of the Brandon Institute to copy after?\n\nAre the children not well fed with good wholesome food, and clothed with good warm comfortable clothing? Are they not properly treated by the Principal and all other members of the staff? Are any of their parents or guardians complaining of the care, welfare, education and oversight given to the pupils? Is the order and discipline of the school or the moral and religious tone degenerating?\n\nThe Principal would like the most thorough investigation into all matters suggested by the above questions, and into any other matters that will reveal the facts regarding the general usefulness and efficiency of the Institute. He requests that a commission be appointed by the Executive to make this investigation.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed) T.

You will see from the Quarterly Report that the three children spoken of as seriously afflicted with tuberculosis have died.\n\nAbout a year ago a boy was brought into the school with some affliction of skin trouble. It was not on his hands or face and very little on his body, and not much was thought of it. In fact, I knew nothing whatever about it and when first discovered the Doctor thought it was simply a rash that would pass away. However, we have discovered that since the spring of the year it has infected quite a number of pupils. This appears not on the hands or the face or any parts of the body exposed to the air, but is very troublesome now in the warm weather. I have had a careful examination of all the children and we have been giving them special treatment by the nurse under the Doctor's orders. These children who have been afflicted have greatly improved during the past month. It is very essential that we continue the services of the nurse for at least a couple of months longer, in order that all these cases may be carefully\ntreated, and the whole thing stamped out. I trust the Department will sanction the retaining of the nurse for at least two or three months longer.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 2, 1912.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th of June, which was inadvertently overlooked, in reference to the use of Educational Exhibits at the Brandon Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no action has been taken by the Department in reference to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCharles G.

S. G. I. A.\nTo THE SECRETARY,\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with the extension of our farming operations, in order to handle the extra section of land, it has been necessary to purchase:\n\n- Four horses at a cost of ........................................... $1300.00\n- Harness to the extent of ........................................... 250.00\n- Wagons ................................................................. 300.00\n- Seed drill ............................................................... 125.00\n- Reaper ................................................................. 170.00\n- Double disc ............................................................ 170.00\n- Harrows, mower ..................................................... 100.00\n- In grass seed, seeding about a couple of hundred acres, about .................................................. 500.00\n- Cattle ................................................................. 200.00\n- Hogs ................................................................. 500.00\n\nThis makes a total of over $3,600. We will be needing more machinery next year, and more horse power, and we ought to put at least $1,000 in first class cattle, which will run this total up to over $6,000 for the two years.\n\nNow, I have not sent any vouchers down to the Department but the one for the gasoline engine and plough. If the Department will pay for the engine and plough as I have requested we will be able to finance all the other needs. If not, I will be under necessity of sending vouchers down to the Department to the extent of four or five thousand dollars, in order to keep the credit of this Institution as it has been for the last thirteen years.\nThe Department must certainly see that in order to handle an additional 640 acres, it cannot be done without considerable outlay for two or three years. It would never do to allow the land to be over-run with weeds and thus present a scene of neglect rather than thrift and prosperity.\n\nPersonally I would rather that the Department pay for the engine and plough, and allow the management to handle the balance, but if the Department prefer, I can send vouchers for the machinery, cattle and horses that were absolutely necessary, to the extent of about $4,000.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
